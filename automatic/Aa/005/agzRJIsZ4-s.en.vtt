00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello today I want to teach you to 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.340
 how to make these cute box cardboard if 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.370
 you want to know how they are made is for 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.530
 see the rest of the video the materials 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.000
 what are we going to need for this tutorial 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.150
 will be 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.270
 but so corrugated 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.650
 pen or pencil rule scissors gun 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.880
 silicone 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.240
 silicone bar 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.200
 something ready 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.230
 white and black cardboard and some other 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.270
 decorations now let's see how it is done 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.280
 The first thing we will do is take 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.379
 our corrugated cardboard and we 're going to 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.840
 flip for assets that there is the part 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.059
 flat learn us taking care that the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.390
 cardboard lines are left in a 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.150
 horizontal since this will allow the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.100
 final the figures that we will mark 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.589
 can bend well what we are going to do 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.290
 it will be that with the help of our rule and 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.500
 our pen we are going to cut a strip of 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:09.299
 three centimeters by 70 centimeters two 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.180
 strips of 2.5 x 30 centimeters two 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.030
 rectangles of 4 centimeters by 4.5 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.970
 centimeters another two rectangles of 1 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.280
 centimeter by 3 centimeters and by 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.119
 last a small square of 2 x 2 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.850
 centimeters 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.590
 this is remembering that the lines have 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.750
 that the cardboard line is not 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.170
 without leaving the sense in the sense 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.170
 horizontal 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.159
 once marked everything we're going to 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.159
 do will cut it 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.100
 once it's trimmed we're going to take 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.829
 the strip longer than the 17 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.140
 centimeters and let's take one end and 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.869
 we're going to fold it in 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.030
 we are going to give it the form to be 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.030
 easier to fold it 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.700
 once we have this now yes with 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.619
 help of the silicone gun 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.560
 we will place a point a little on the tip 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.760
 and let's go turning this in 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.590
 With the small edges of cardboard 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.790
 that are left out I recommend 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.910
 to put a little at the beginning and let's go 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.489
 placing in strategic points either 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.910
 every five centimeters or like you 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.910
 prefer 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.130
 How are you 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.280
 at the end the same we will place silicon for 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.590
 close it and we and we already have the body of 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.440
 our google now we will do this same 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.920
 with two strips of 2.5 centimeters 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.920
 30 centimeters 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.170
 these will be our eyes 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.890
 we will take the two squares the two 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.440
 rectangles of 4 by 4.5 centimeters and 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.440
 let's draw some wings 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.290
 once drawn let's cut 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.850
 the two small rectangles will be the 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.620
 eyebrows of our owl this in the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.220
 small square what I 'm doing 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.990
 is to remove the part of the mountains 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.020
 of the cardboard and let's make a small 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:31.330
 nice since this will be 5 of our 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.330
 bus we will close it with a little silicone 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.630
 ready we have all the pieces now 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.580
 we will proceed to assemble it fixing ourselves 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.910
 looking at the sides of the we have 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.700
 the units we will place silicone 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.580
 in what will be our eyes and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.970
 let's stick together as seen in 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.970
 the video 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.060
 and once we have them like that we can 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.129
 give it a little shape and now 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.500
 we will place some silicon in the 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.360
 bottom part of both eyes to 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.360
 stick it to the body 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.880
 we already have this and now I will place the 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.280
 two rectangles that will be our eyebrows 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.079
 in the upper part of the eyes the 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.910
 can place with the ready side of the 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.370
 cardboard or with the side that has these 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.590
 mountaineers can place them straight or 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.320
 a little leaning once we do 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.320
 this now well to place the peak 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.110
 since we put the peak now only 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.110
 subtract the wings 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.350
 and well we have the total structure 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.090
 of our egg now with the help of the 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.970
 black cardboard from white cardboard 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.310
 let's make some circles that will be 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.890
 the pupils of the eyes 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.160
 we will turn our owl and 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.530
 with a ribbon to hear it we are going to stick it in 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.740
 the back to hang it on 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.420
 somewhere we can issue this step and 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.970
 ready once we have this way now 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.570
 only you need to add some 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.570
 other decorations 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.510
 in this case I made three to this eyebrow 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:22.830
 Place it straight and with blue construction paper 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:26.040
 I made a tie I made a tie 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.610
 on the back has the bar 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.460
 our everything normal and then I made a 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.010
 blue tie and I stuck it I made another 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.770
 with the with a bow where the tie 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.009
 the garlic are a little bigger and the 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.699
 eyebrows have them tilted 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:47.659
 and finally that this little owl woman 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:49.999
 to which he put a pink bow and I put 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:52.460
 some thinner eyebrows and well 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:55.399
 I hope you liked this idea a lot 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.520
 leave me all your comments like 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:06:00.680
 share the video and I assure you that if 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.619
 they do this but with corrugated cardboard 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.199
 of colors that will surely look very 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:09.219
 nice, I see them in the next 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.219
 goodbye video
