00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.869
 we are trying the very first to get a better impression of the last minute saved by 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.029
 Lost the hit to clear the homes 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.119
 i'm not there i'm a bit demonstrating that norwegian minutes in it 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.579
 water 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.739
 women have a little weird but the patent with more in stock 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:27.619
 7 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.190
 the best that they add which have passed on to the red card and could 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.310
 I had the subject of a house walk in 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.670
 Chris Noth and present it with a number of devices 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.630
 Ontopic had him come for a balance in the team of nothing experienced 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.020
 other than you can do some industry yes that and maybe in the first of one 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.570
 series is that work 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.730
 viva la lettre 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.730
 Two years was there but it always took quite a while 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.120
 to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.440
 2 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.830
 That 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.310
 the 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.710
 enne 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.680
 and a few other sectors 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.329
 Well the reason I have ever had to miss 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.090
 I tell them to pay everything back after it was previously students who had a car 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.750
 to have 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.690
 so as long as I have countries where every month a year is possible, it is certainly too 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.340
 set 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 he did not recognize that each 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.390
 3 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.400
 of course try college in lead 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
 wait even longer 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.569
 no 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.430
 he laid the corporation 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.270
 but if I have more students than sometimes it is time for them to be on the dam 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.379
 count for the topper what I have 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.379
 the best players in the field in melle 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.979
 because that is what I have said 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:22.709
 to the debate the baker timmer the quiet period and what else with this 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.259
 can call metropolis 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:26.029
 wouldn't do it 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:29.029
 the but in that case 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.749
 come on jette 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.619
 l the camera 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.690
 photo in the water the world the earth 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.479
 that the articles 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:47.479
 therefore there will be no I think it is not then 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.299
 and all that now that park 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.929
 2 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:57.029
 wonderful, I got on with it right away when working 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.359
