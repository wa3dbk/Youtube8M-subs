Chicago<00:00:17.449> last<00:00:17.690> year<00:00:17.840> was<00:00:18.109> a<00:00:18.140> very<00:00:18.230> tough

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
Chicago last year was a very tough

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.439 
Chicago last year was a very tough
opponent<00:00:19.520> for<00:00:19.550> us<00:00:19.760> especially<00:00:19.880> at<00:00:20.300> their

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
opponent for us especially at their

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.210 
opponent for us especially at their
place<00:00:20.630> their<00:00:21.230> fields<00:00:21.619> like<00:00:21.830> a<00:00:21.859> little

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
place their fields like a little

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.409 
place their fields like a little
difficult<00:00:22.849> to<00:00:22.880> play<00:00:23.060> it

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
difficult to play it

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.300 
difficult to play it
you<00:00:23.869> never<00:00:24.259> know<00:00:24.439> the<00:00:24.589> weather<00:00:24.769> conditions

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
you never know the weather conditions

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.300 
you never know the weather conditions
and<00:00:25.839> they're<00:00:26.839> pretty<00:00:27.050> physical<00:00:27.679> direct<00:00:28.070> team

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
and they're pretty physical direct team

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.009 
and they're pretty physical direct team
so<00:00:28.759> I<00:00:28.789> think<00:00:28.970> I<00:00:29.240> think<00:00:29.390> we<00:00:29.570> know<00:00:29.689> them<00:00:29.839> pretty

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
so I think I think we know them pretty

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.920 
so I think I think we know them pretty
well<00:00:30.169> and<00:00:31.159> it's<00:00:31.550> just<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.939> matter<00:00:32.390> of<00:00:32.509> who's

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
well and it's just a matter of who's

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.450 
well and it's just a matter of who's
going<00:00:33.200> to<00:00:33.290> implement<00:00:33.560> their<00:00:33.890> style<00:00:34.160> more<00:00:34.340> on

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
going to implement their style more on

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:45.310 
going to implement their style more on
the<00:00:34.550> game<00:00:43.269> this<00:00:44.269> seems<00:00:44.539> great<00:00:44.870> I<00:00:45.050> mean<00:00:45.230> the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
the game this seems great I mean the

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.319 
the game this seems great I mean the
integration<00:00:45.800> process<00:00:46.190> has<00:00:46.340> been<00:00:46.519> super<00:00:47.149> easy

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
integration process has been super easy

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:50.290 
integration process has been super easy
the<00:00:47.660> chemistry's<00:00:48.199> great<00:00:48.230> I<00:00:48.920> mean<00:00:49.370> I<00:00:50.000> think<00:00:50.059> we

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
the chemistry's great I mean I think we

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.270 
the chemistry's great I mean I think we
have<00:00:50.329> like-minded<00:00:50.629> players<00:00:51.230> which<00:00:51.949> helps

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
have like-minded players which helps

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.720 
have like-minded players which helps
with<00:00:52.460> style<00:00:53.179> play<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:53.629> Paul's<00:00:53.960> trying<00:00:54.289> to

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
with style play the Paul's trying to

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.910 
with style play the Paul's trying to
incorporate<00:00:55.730> with<00:00:55.940> all<00:00:56.090> of<00:00:56.210> us<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:56.629> I<00:00:57.289> mean

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
incorporate with all of us and I mean

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.450 
incorporate with all of us and I mean
the<00:00:58.010> first<00:00:58.190> two<00:00:59.179> games<00:00:59.420> I<00:00:59.960> think<00:01:00.289> we<00:01:00.649> we<00:01:01.280> did

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
the first two games I think we we did

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.030 
the first two games I think we we did
exactly<00:01:01.789> what<00:01:01.910> we<00:01:02.030> wanted<00:01:02.120> to<00:01:02.390> do<00:01:02.710> as<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:03.890> go

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
exactly what we wanted to do as you go

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.770 
exactly what we wanted to do as you go
through<00:01:04.280> here<00:01:04.309> you'll<00:01:05.030> be<00:01:05.120> playing<00:01:05.390> against

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
through here you'll be playing against

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:16.540 
through here you'll be playing against
national<00:01:06.590> team<00:01:06.770> teammates

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.000 

this<00:01:17.210> happens<00:01:17.510> all<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.660> time<00:01:17.750> for<00:01:18.080> us<00:01:18.230> we<00:01:18.920> were

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
this happens all the time for us we were

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.590 
this happens all the time for us we were
always<00:01:19.160> playing<00:01:19.460> either<00:01:19.820> with<00:01:20.090> each<00:01:20.240> other<00:01:20.420> or

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
against each other we know each other

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.230 
against each other we know each other
very<00:01:22.160> well<00:01:22.400> we<00:01:22.580> know<00:01:22.790> each<00:01:22.910> other's

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
very well we know each other's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.350 
very well we know each other's
tendencies<00:01:24.610> obviously<00:01:25.610> great<00:01:25.940> friends<00:01:26.240> off

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
tendencies obviously great friends off

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.360 
tendencies obviously great friends off
the<00:01:26.390> field<00:01:26.720> though<00:01:26.930> on<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.200> field<00:01:27.410> everybody

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
the field though on the field everybody

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.860 
the field though on the field everybody
wants<00:01:28.730> to<00:01:28.790> win<00:01:28.940> so<00:01:29.000> it's<00:01:29.540> always<00:01:29.660> super

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
wants to win so it's always super

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.970 
wants to win so it's always super
competitive<00:01:30.260> I<00:01:34.390> have<00:01:35.390> not<00:01:35.690> seen<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.140> game<00:01:36.350> I

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
competitive I have not seen the game I

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.310 
competitive I have not seen the game I
can<00:01:37.520> kind<00:01:37.730> of<00:01:37.790> see<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.150> my<00:01:38.240> mind<00:01:38.510> I<00:01:38.840> think

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
can kind of see it in my mind I think

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.950 
can kind of see it in my mind I think
Seattle<00:01:39.860> they<00:01:40.610> try<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:40.970> play<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:41.450> similar

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
Seattle they try and play a similar

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.990 
Seattle they try and play a similar
style<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.350> us<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:43.370> think<00:01:43.490> maybe<00:01:43.760> we<00:01:43.820> can

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
style to us so I think maybe we can

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.150 
style to us so I think maybe we can
learn<00:01:44.210> from<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:44.960> few<00:01:45.140> of<00:01:45.230> their<00:01:45.350> things<00:01:45.620> from

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
learn from a few of their things from

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.240 
learn from a few of their things from
what<00:01:46.280> I've<00:01:46.400> heard<00:01:46.430> they<00:01:46.730> had<00:01:47.860> maybe<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:49.010> score

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
what I've heard they had maybe the score

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.140 
what I've heard they had maybe the score
wasn't<00:01:49.580> exactly<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.150> game<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:50.930> I'm<00:01:51.170> not<00:01:51.320> sure

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
wasn't exactly the game but I'm not sure

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.810 
wasn't exactly the game but I'm not sure
obviously<00:01:53.150> Chicago<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:53.840> extremely<00:01:54.290> dangerous

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
obviously Chicago is extremely dangerous

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.220 
obviously Chicago is extremely dangerous
christen<00:01:55.820> press<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.300> can<00:01:56.450> score<00:01:56.960> when<00:01:57.110> she

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 
christen press you can score when she

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.400 
christen press you can score when she
wants<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:57.710> I<00:01:58.400> say<00:01:59.300> we<00:01:59.450> have<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.600> make<00:02:00.230> sure

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
wants so I say we have to make sure

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.860 
wants so I say we have to make sure
we've<00:02:00.650> got<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:01.130> hold<00:02:01.370> on<00:02:01.490> her<00:02:01.730> but<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.600> think<00:02:02.630> we

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
we've got a hold on her but I think we

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.420 
we've got a hold on her but I think we
just<00:02:02.930> have<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.230> focus<00:02:03.380> on<00:02:03.620> us<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:03.980> continue<00:02:04.370> to

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
just have to focus on us and continue to

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.320 
just have to focus on us and continue to
do<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.670> things<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.060> have<00:02:05.150> made<00:02:05.270> us

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
do the things that have made us

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.960 
do the things that have made us
successful
