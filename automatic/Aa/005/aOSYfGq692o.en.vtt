00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:07.060 
did the review just to remind you that
if<00:02:05.210> you're<00:02:05.329> buying<00:02:05.570> this<00:02:05.780> at<00:02:05.960> a<00:02:06.289> gunsight<00:02:06.859> a

if you're buying this at a gunsight a

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.460 
if you're buying this at a gunsight a
gun<00:02:07.369> store<00:02:07.579> make<00:02:08.149> sure<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.690> you<00:02:08.840> check<00:02:09.170> all

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
gun store make sure that you check all

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.729 
gun store make sure that you check all
of<00:02:09.500> these<00:02:09.740> and<00:02:10.009> make<00:02:10.099> sure<00:02:10.250> they're<00:02:10.399> properly

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
of these and make sure they're properly

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.290 
of these and make sure they're properly
assembled<00:02:12.739> what<00:02:12.950> should<00:02:13.310> happen<00:02:13.580> with<00:02:14.060> this

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
assembled what should happen with this

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.370 
assembled what should happen with this
type<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.810> clip<00:02:15.050> right

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
type of clip right

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.400 
type of clip right
here<00:02:15.560> is<00:02:15.740> as<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:16.520> pull<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.180> down<00:02:17.510> it'll<00:02:18.230> lock

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
here is as you pull it down it'll lock

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.540 
here is as you pull it down it'll lock
it<00:02:18.710> won't<00:02:18.860> slide<00:02:19.160> back<00:02:19.400> so<00:02:19.700> once<00:02:19.910> it's<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:21.550> this

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
it won't slide back so once it's in this

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.670 
it won't slide back so once it's in this
clip<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:23.240> should<00:02:23.690> be<00:02:23.780> able<00:02:23.840> to<00:02:23.990> pull<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.380> and<00:02:24.560> it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
clip I should be able to pull it and it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.980 
clip I should be able to pull it and it
should<00:02:24.800> hold<00:02:25.100> on<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:26.090> side<00:02:26.330> it's<00:02:26.540> reversed

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
should hold on this side it's reversed

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.900 
should hold on this side it's reversed
so<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.560> doesn't<00:02:27.920> have<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.460> little<00:02:28.610> bit<00:02:28.820> of

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
so it doesn't have the little bit of

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.480 
so it doesn't have the little bit of
tension<00:02:29.240> against<00:02:30.230> here<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.710> that<00:02:31.310> is

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
tension against here and that is

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.330 
tension against here and that is
problematic<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.840> other<00:02:33.140> than<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:33.440> pretty

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
problematic so other than that pretty

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.190 
problematic so other than that pretty
sweet<00:02:35.980> so<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.100> case<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.550> comes<00:02:37.960> with<00:02:38.960> two

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
sweet so the case it comes with two

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.080 
sweet so the case it comes with two
pockets<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.640> divider<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:42.490> so<00:02:43.490> I<00:02:43.520> came<00:02:43.970> back

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
pockets and a divider and so I came back

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.930 
pockets and a divider and so I came back
from<00:02:44.270> shooting<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.400> what's<00:02:46.400> nice<00:02:46.580> is<00:02:46.820> when

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
from shooting and what's nice is when

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.260 
from shooting and what's nice is when
you<00:02:47.090> pack<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.480> gun<00:02:47.660> up<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:49.220> will<00:02:49.460> put<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.000> in

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
you pack the gun up you will put it in

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.770 
you pack the gun up you will put it in
these<00:02:50.480> velcro<00:02:51.370> velcroed<00:02:52.400> areas<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.390> hold<00:02:53.630> the

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
these velcro velcroed areas to hold the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.460 
these velcro velcroed areas to hold the
gun<00:02:53.990> down

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
gun down

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.660 
gun down
now<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.710> doesn't<00:02:54.890> mean<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.160> gun<00:02:55.310> won't<00:02:55.520> move

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
now that doesn't mean the gun won't move

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.030 
now that doesn't mean the gun won't move
but<00:02:55.940> it's<00:02:56.090> not<00:02:56.270> going<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.480> move<00:02:56.830> side<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.860> side

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
but it's not going to move side to side

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.460 
but it's not going to move side to side
against<00:02:58.460> the<00:02:58.520> other<00:02:58.760> one<00:02:58.940> you've<00:02:59.390> got<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.570> piece

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
against the other one you've got a piece

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.710 
against the other one you've got a piece
of<00:03:00.650> foam<00:03:00.890> in<00:03:01.070> here<00:03:01.100> fairly<00:03:01.910> heavy<00:03:02.270> it

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
of foam in here fairly heavy it

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.870 
of foam in here fairly heavy it
separates<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.380> two<00:03:03.560> guns<00:03:03.830> again<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.700> guns

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
separates the two guns again the guns

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.880 
separates the two guns again the guns
slide<00:03:05.270> under<00:03:05.780> these<00:03:07.300> velcro<00:03:08.300> strips<00:03:08.900> you<00:03:09.830> can

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
slide under these velcro strips you can

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.650 
slide under these velcro strips you can
either<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.430> know<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:10.610> could<00:03:10.850> wrap<00:03:11.090> them<00:03:11.360> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
either you know you could wrap them the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.990 
either you know you could wrap them the
velcro<00:03:11.870> strip<00:03:12.350> if<00:03:12.530> you<00:03:12.650> want<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.880> know

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
velcro strip if you want it to you know

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.640 
velcro strip if you want it to you know
something<00:03:14.390> like<00:03:14.570> this<00:03:14.810> if<00:03:15.020> you're<00:03:15.170> really<00:03:15.410> OCD

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
something like this if you're really OCD

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.640 
something like this if you're really OCD
about<00:03:16.250> keeping<00:03:16.580> it<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:17.060> know<00:03:17.090> down<00:03:17.650> basically

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
about keeping it you know down basically

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.320 
about keeping it you know down basically
you<00:03:18.860> can<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.460> know<00:03:19.580> get<00:03:19.730> it<00:03:19.850> into<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.120> position

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
you can you know get it into a position

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.810 
you can you know get it into a position
where<00:03:20.690> it's<00:03:20.810> going<00:03:20.960> to<00:03:21.050> hold<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.710> gun<00:03:21.950> fairly

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
where it's going to hold the gun fairly

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.420 
where it's going to hold the gun fairly
securely<00:03:23.300> so<00:03:23.900> that's<00:03:24.140> quite<00:03:24.800> a<00:03:24.860> nice<00:03:25.070> setup

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
securely so that's quite a nice setup

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.220 
securely so that's quite a nice setup
from<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.970> standpoint<00:03:26.390> because<00:03:26.690> you're<00:03:27.020> able

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
from that standpoint because you're able

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.950 
from that standpoint because you're able
to<00:03:27.290> carry<00:03:27.500> two<00:03:27.710> carbines<00:03:28.190> 36<00:03:28.790> inch<00:03:28.970> lengths<00:03:29.450> if

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
to carry two carbines 36 inch lengths if

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.280 
to carry two carbines 36 inch lengths if
you've<00:03:30.560> got<00:03:30.770> a<00:03:30.800> 20<00:03:31.310> inch<00:03:31.600> AR<00:03:32.600> let's<00:03:32.900> say<00:03:33.140> and

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
you've got a 20 inch AR let's say and

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.140 
you've got a 20 inch AR let's say and
you've<00:03:33.410> got<00:03:33.590> a<00:03:33.620> conventional<00:03:34.370> buttstock<00:03:34.910> on

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
you've got a conventional buttstock on

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
you've got a conventional buttstock on
it<00:03:35.530> obviously<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:37.430> barrel<00:03:37.820> is<00:03:37.970> going<00:03:38.300> to<00:03:38.510> not

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
it obviously the barrel is going to not

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.710 
it obviously the barrel is going to not
fit<00:03:39.410> in<00:03:39.530> here<00:03:39.830> now<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.280> not<00:03:41.030> had<00:03:41.270> an<00:03:41.390> issue<00:03:41.510> with

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
fit in here now I not had an issue with

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.750 
fit in here now I not had an issue with
that<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.990> simply<00:03:42.620> if<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:43.640> full<00:03:43.940> size<00:03:45.760> AR

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
that I simply if this is a full size AR

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.970 
that I simply if this is a full size AR
and<00:03:47.630> let's<00:03:47.840> say<00:03:48.020> I<00:03:48.050> had<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.380> barrel<00:03:48.740> sticking

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
and let's say I had the barrel sticking

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.770 
and let's say I had the barrel sticking
out<00:03:49.840> right<00:03:50.840> I'd<00:03:51.080> close<00:03:51.410> it<00:03:51.620> up<00:03:51.770> I<00:03:52.450> dip<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:53.600> up

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
out right I'd close it up I dip it up

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.780 
out right I'd close it up I dip it up
and<00:03:54.410> all<00:03:54.740> you'd<00:03:54.920> see<00:03:55.190> is<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.459> barrel

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
and all you'd see is the barrel

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.020 
and all you'd see is the barrel
protruding<00:03:56.270> at<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.480> end<00:03:56.630> again<00:03:56.780> it's<00:03:57.110> not<00:03:57.260> a

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
protruding at the end again it's not a

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.610 
protruding at the end again it's not a
deal-breaker<00:03:59.030> for<00:03:59.450> me<00:03:59.720> at<00:03:59.840> all<00:03:59.990> but<00:04:00.170> if<00:04:00.410> you've

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
deal-breaker for me at all but if you've

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.230 
deal-breaker for me at all but if you've
got<00:04:00.650> full-sized<00:04:01.250> guns<00:04:01.520> that's<00:04:01.820> obviously

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
got full-sized guns that's obviously

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.430 
got full-sized guns that's obviously
something<00:04:02.330> to<00:04:02.720> think<00:04:02.930> about<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.350> especially

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
something to think about it especially

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.160 
something to think about it especially
if<00:04:03.830> you<00:04:03.890> don't<00:04:04.160> have<00:04:04.310> a<00:04:04.940> collapsible<00:04:05.780> stock

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
if you don't have a collapsible stock

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.900 
if you don't have a collapsible stock
that<00:04:06.470> will<00:04:06.560> allow<00:04:06.800> you<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:07.070> compress<00:04:07.700> the

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
that will allow you to compress the

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.110 
that will allow you to compress the
length<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.480> gun<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.690> little<00:04:08.930> bit<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.970> other

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
length of the gun a little bit the other

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.400 
length of the gun a little bit the other
nice<00:04:11.360> thing<00:04:11.690> about<00:04:11.920> the<00:04:12.920> case
