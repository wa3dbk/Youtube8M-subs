they look like but this is what it is I
just<00:00:15.839> put<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.350> negative<00:00:16.619> cable<00:00:17.840> positives

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
just put on a negative cable positives

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.740 
just put on a negative cable positives
here<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.199> these<00:00:19.289> here<00:00:20.090> that<00:00:21.090> way<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.539> you

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
here and these here that way that you

know if something would happen the hood

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.439 
know if something would happen the hood
touched<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.519> or<00:00:23.609> something<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.180> wouldn't

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
touched it or something that wouldn't

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.740 
touched it or something that wouldn't
sort<00:00:24.630> out<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.080> work<00:00:25.199> very<00:00:25.500> out<00:00:26.060> and<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.359> see<00:00:27.570> it

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
sort out so work very out and you see it

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.150 
sort out so work very out and you see it
just<00:00:27.869> connects<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.470> your<00:00:28.560> negative<00:00:28.980> battery

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
just connects to your negative battery

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.900 
just connects to your negative battery

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
negative post excuse me then it's got a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.430 
negative post excuse me then it's got a
place<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.690> connect<00:00:37.170> your<00:00:37.260> other

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
place for you to connect your other

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.910 
place for you to connect your other
cable<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.100> from<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> car<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.710> joined<00:00:40.710> by<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
cable here from the car is joined by a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.799 
cable here from the car is joined by a
piece<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.160> plastic<00:00:41.730> here<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.090> know<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
piece of plastic here you know this is

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.049 
piece of plastic here you know this is
not<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> most<00:00:43.879> heavy-duty

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
not the most heavy-duty

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.330 
not the most heavy-duty
thing<00:00:45.960> I've<00:00:46.110> ever<00:00:46.140> seen<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.219> like

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
thing I've ever seen you know it's like

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
thing I've ever seen you know it's like
everything<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.850> buy<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.300> days<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.870> just

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
everything you buy these days just just

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.170 
everything you buy these days just just
enough<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.890> last<00:00:50.129> for<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.460> while<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.610> guess<00:00:51.000> but

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
enough to last for a while I guess but

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.560 
enough to last for a while I guess but
the<00:00:51.780> theory<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.199> good<00:00:52.879> you<00:00:53.879> know<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.270> just

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
the theory is good you know you just

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.819 
the theory is good you know you just
when<00:00:54.870> you're<00:00:54.989> ready<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.199> run<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> car<00:00:55.680> you

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
when you're ready to run the car you

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.200 
when you're ready to run the car you
just<00:00:55.860> come<00:00:56.160> out<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:57.649> connect<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.770> over<00:00:59.210> and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
just come out and connect it over and

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
just come out and connect it over and
then<00:01:00.359> when<00:01:00.539> you're<00:01:00.750> gonna<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.320> away<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
then when you're gonna be away from the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.880 
then when you're gonna be away from the
car<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:03.290> unconnected<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> disconnected

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
car you just unconnected so disconnected

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.410 
car you just unconnected so disconnected
and<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.460> know<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.820> kind<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.210> said

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
and you know it's kind of like I said

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
and you know it's kind of like I said
it's<00:01:09.540> kind<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.810> little<00:01:09.930> bit<00:01:10.049> yeah<00:01:11.010> flimsy

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
it's kind of a little bit yeah flimsy

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760 
it's kind of a little bit yeah flimsy
but<00:01:12.060> once<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:12.869> once<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.320> in

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
but once it's you know once it's in

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
but once it's you know once it's in
place<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.340> connected<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.880> helps<00:01:15.270> its

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
place and connected that helps its

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.149 
place and connected that helps its
rigidity<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.990> lot<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.830> shouldn't<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
rigidity a lot so it shouldn't be a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.370 
rigidity a lot so it shouldn't be a
problem<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:18.240> even<00:01:18.330> if<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.720> did<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.200> it's

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
problem and even if it did you know it's

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350 
problem and even if it did you know it's
like<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.619> says<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> negative<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.549> it's<00:01:21.180> not

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
like it says the negative so it's not

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.679 
like it says the negative so it's not
gonna<00:01:21.770> it's<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.950> going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> cause<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.689> shortage

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
gonna it's not going to cause a shortage

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.899 
gonna it's not going to cause a shortage
or<00:01:24.869> something<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> yeah<00:01:28.350> there's<00:01:28.950> there's

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
or something so yeah there's there's

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.170 
or something so yeah there's there's
that<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.659> does<00:01:30.810> clear<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.229> hood<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:32.180> check

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that but it does clear the hood I check

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.120 
that but it does clear the hood I check
that<00:01:33.390> it's<00:01:34.110> about<00:01:34.259> twenty<00:01:34.619> dollars<00:01:34.740> at<00:01:35.040> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that it's about twenty dollars at the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.350 
that it's about twenty dollars at the
parts<00:01:35.369> store<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.850> makes<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> know

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
parts store and it makes it you know

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.840 
parts store and it makes it you know
this<00:01:36.630> way<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> don't<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.290> keep<00:01:37.850> fooling

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
this way I don't have to keep fooling

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.460 
this way I don't have to keep fooling
with<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> battery<00:01:39.329> cable<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.780> stressing

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
with the battery cable and stressing

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.240 
with the battery cable and stressing
this<00:01:40.590> post<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> everything<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.729> that's<00:01:43.250> just

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
this post and everything so that's just

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.520 
this post and everything so that's just
blowing<00:01:44.399> cleaner<00:01:44.820> insulation<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.320> little

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
blowing cleaner insulation and a little

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.550 
blowing cleaner insulation and a little
bit<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.740> security<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.729> way<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.380> you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
bit of security that way I can just you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.969 
bit of security that way I can just you
know<00:01:49.619> leave<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.950> car<00:01:51.170> with<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> power<00:01:52.439> cut<00:01:52.799> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
know leave the car with a power cut to
