seat belts in the back are not
functioning<00:00:21.619> either

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.380 

his<00:00:45.470> sounds<00:00:45.890> like<00:00:46.010> it's<00:00:46.130> got<00:00:46.250> a<00:00:46.280> motor<00:00:46.730> in<00:00:47.030> fact

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
his sounds like it's got a motor in fact

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.540 
his sounds like it's got a motor in fact
tific<00:00:47.870> like<00:00:48.350> a<00:00:48.380> not<00:00:48.560> an<00:00:48.680> electric<00:00:49.100> motor<00:00:49.190> like

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
tific like a not an electric motor like

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.070 
tific like a not an electric motor like
a<00:00:49.840> yes<00:00:50.840> an<00:00:51.380> engine<00:00:51.800> I<00:00:51.890> mean<00:00:52.010> just<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.430> sound<00:00:52.730> is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
a yes an engine I mean just the sound is

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:03.650 
a yes an engine I mean just the sound is
incredible

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.470 

so<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.800> center<00:01:05.489> console<00:01:05.850> display<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
so is the center console display is that

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.540 
so is the center console display is that
all<00:01:06.600> fully<00:01:07.020> functioning<00:01:07.590> that's<00:01:08.340> Matt's

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
all fully functioning that's Matt's

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:16.030 
all fully functioning that's Matt's
actually<00:01:08.700> working

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.300 

full<00:01:16.640> screen<00:01:16.970> map<00:01:17.450> which<00:01:18.350> satellite<00:01:18.860> view

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310

so you can read the New York Times while

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:38.860 
so you can read the New York Times while
you're<00:01:26.259> driving<00:01:26.770> or<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.820> passengers

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.080 

so<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.380> are<00:01:39.740> test<00:01:40.040> driver<00:01:40.280> for<00:01:40.520> Tesla<00:01:41.200> I'm

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
so you are test driver for Tesla I'm

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.160 
so you are test driver for Tesla I'm
engineering<00:01:44.090> manager<00:01:44.480> for<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.720> prototype

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
engineering manager for the prototype

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.840 
engineering manager for the prototype
vehicles<00:01:45.790> okay

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.960

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
responsible for all the prototype

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.420 
responsible for all the prototype
systems<00:01:55.299> level<00:01:55.479> prototype<00:01:56.049> work<00:01:56.979> that<00:01:57.250> goes

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
systems level prototype work that goes

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.190 
systems level prototype work that goes
on<00:01:57.610> for<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.940> company<00:01:58.270> including<00:01:58.750> vehicles

on for the company including vehicles

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.940 
on for the company including vehicles
and<00:02:00.060> prototype<00:02:01.060> assemblies<00:02:01.570> for<00:02:01.950> powertrain

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
and prototype assemblies for powertrain

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.820 
and prototype assemblies for powertrain
components<00:02:03.270> right<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:05.170> all<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:05.350> these<00:02:05.560> cars

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
components right so all of these cars

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.809 
components right so all of these cars
fall<00:02:06.130> under<00:02:06.340> under

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819
