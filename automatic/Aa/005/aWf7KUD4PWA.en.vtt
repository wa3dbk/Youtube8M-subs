david<00:00:32.880> vonderhaar<00:00:33.680> basically<00:00:34.680> everybody<00:00:35.430> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
david vonderhaar basically everybody is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.350 
david vonderhaar basically everybody is
in<00:00:36.480> charge<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:37.940> releasing<00:00:38.940> revolution<00:00:39.660> and

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
in charge of releasing revolution and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.729 
in charge of releasing revolution and
apparently<00:00:42.360> where<00:00:42.750> evolution<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.350> released

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
apparently where evolution was released

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.400 
apparently where evolution was released
about<00:00:44.100> 3<00:00:44.370> or<00:00:44.550> 4<00:00:44.760> hours<00:00:45.059> ago<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.140> must<00:00:46.350> have

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
about 3 or 4 hours ago so it must have

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.860 
about 3 or 4 hours ago so it must have
been<00:00:46.530> released<00:00:46.950> about<00:00:47.520> right<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.030> midnight<00:00:48.239> or

for them to release it now I've heard
from<00:00:59.699> several<00:00:59.940> people<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> UK<00:01:01.140> people

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
from several people that the UK people

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.910 
from several people that the UK people
the<00:01:02.879> people<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.270> lives<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> UK<00:01:04.229> does<00:01:04.680> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the people that lives in the UK does it

everybody has this map pack now besides

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.080 
everybody has this map pack now besides
UK<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.880> there's<00:01:15.390> probably<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.990> couple<00:01:16.259> more

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
doesn't have this map pack but yeah I'm

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.039 
doesn't have this map pack but yeah I'm
currently<00:01:23.580> downloading<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.840> give

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049

you<00:01:25.200> guys<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.710> update<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:27.509> see<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:27.930> at

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you guys this update you can see it's at

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.910 
you guys this update you can see it's at
27%<00:01:28.729> 66<00:01:29.729> minutes<00:01:30.090> left<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:31.409> think<00:01:31.710> that's

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
27% 66 minutes left I don't think that's

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
27% 66 minutes left I don't think that's
why<00:01:32.100> because<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.210> first<00:01:33.450> tried<00:01:33.750> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
why because one of my first tried this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
why because one of my first tried this
downloaded<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.530> say<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.890> thousand

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
downloaded it say about a thousand

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.420 
downloaded it say about a thousand
minutes<00:01:35.820> left<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.900> was<00:01:37.079> about<00:01:37.229> 20<00:01:38.130> minutes

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
minutes left and it was about 20 minutes

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.870 
minutes left and it was about 20 minutes
ago

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
ago

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.719 
ago
so<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:39.930> moving<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.290> fast<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.549> can

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
so it's moving pretty fast as you can

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.240 
so it's moving pretty fast as you can
see<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.990> biggest<00:01:43.439> map<00:01:43.619> pack<00:01:43.890> they've<00:01:44.100> ever

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
see is the biggest map pack they've ever

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.719 
see is the biggest map pack they've ever
had<00:01:45.979> 1852<00:01:46.979> megabytes<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.170> pretty<00:01:49.770> high

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
had 1852 megabytes that is pretty high

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.740 
had 1852 megabytes that is pretty high
when<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> comes<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.380> map<00:01:53.100> pack<00:01:56.090> but<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.479> you

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
when it comes to a map pack but as you

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.569 
when it comes to a map pack but as you
can<00:01:57.899> see<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:58.380> downloading<00:01:58.950> revolution
