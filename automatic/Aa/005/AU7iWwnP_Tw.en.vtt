00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.450
 and very, very good to everyone who 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.150
 I hope everyone is the best here 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.070
 as always your friend carlos geo and be 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.320
 welcome to a new video of what more 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.150
 well he will continue his world watch men and 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.710
 I hope you like it as much as me and 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.809
 that this time I leave them in the background 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.489
 a game of all against all in the 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:31.099
 gondola map that I was pretty 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:33.140
 special because it was after almost three 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.969
 or even four days without touching for 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.950
 guide their guard meant nothing walked 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.960
 pretty stuck that in borderlands 2 that 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.969
 in black ops or more and so on and so good 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.860
 I forgot the poor girsu war and said 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.080
 first of how cold it is going to be me 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.880
 see from the kick and I really liked it 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.130
 how I played in this game and I started 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.510
 remember in fact for when he plays 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.090
 in gears of war or not and in gears of war 2 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.890
 that was totally disgusting, well, I did not 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.540
 I can complain since I'm going every 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.250
 time I'm getting better, follow your 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.750
 guard that gives me great pleasure and 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.130
 especially because I remembered that 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.230
 several people lately have told me 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.269
 that you hear Carlos first will be great 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.490
 if they brought more mini tips or if I 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.259
 you will help to play better and so on and not 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.060
 It makes me weird because I say there are people 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.070
 who play a thousand times better than me but 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.380
 Well, this time, that's why 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.970
 I bring this video a couple of tips two 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.610
 what three did he give me 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.560
 and two of them are mental and can 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.790
 tell carlos what nonsense how 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.930
 argue could help us improve 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.330
 in gears of war blood 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.340
 Well, you'll see, the first of them is 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.930
 something more than many people could not 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.880
 consider something dirty but well 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.950
 now that it was updated guiding his guard 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.050
 they see where the boxes of ammunition no longer 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.120
 be more pomegranates and you only have the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.740
 that you appear or those that the few that 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.780
 can pick up during the map then good 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.880
 lately I'm grabbing that from that 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.340
 I know when I die I grab my 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.020
 granada and I stick it like that is to paste pomegranates 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.700
 you know we lost the skill 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.860
 of people on the walls of the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.860
 surfaces follow your guard 3 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.759
 good since his guardian came out 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.720
 we lost that possibility and it was quite 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.340
 necessary in times of play as 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.410
 they were guards since that sometimes you 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.030
 can save the skin and well what 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.349
 they removed but fortunately we 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.390
 they removed the ability to paste 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.550
 grenades to our enemies then 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.290
 well I use it being clear not 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.690
 abusing it but there are times in the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.640
 that is good and from here we see something 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.269
 with the guy who brought the power with 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.519
 a boomer or with a do not know with a bow and 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.769
 Well, it's already here that you do not save 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.840
 So it's good to get him his pomegranate and 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.280
 maybe he can kill you but at least you 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.100
 you go with the notes empty-handed 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.500
 you go with the 175 points that you 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.630
 you killed your enemy today there is even 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.489
 some other times where the guy goes 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.410
 of kamikaze and throws himself against 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.170
 other people and you end up taking you 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.239
 from a double to a 4 play and 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.370
 really then - a few points that one does not 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.140
 I expected and they look pretty good as 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.150
 I say while not abuse this to 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.920
 beating grenades is perfect 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.599
 I say I only use it when I do not 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.640
 there is more and another with which I live good and 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.620
 they are going to sit me for 1 point plus their 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.480
 granada and see what happens clear old and 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.230
 times you water them but when Latinas 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.750
 can be 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.220
 of gold and two other tips and see is that 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.590
 I tell them that I liked them a lot 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.599
 they have served me the first thing that nothing is in 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.370
 our exaggerating which bouncing I have 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.959
 seen many people who put with the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.459
 differences and connections there 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.409
 connection people who have very good 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.360
 connection another not so much so good that 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:25.760
 the items are very irregular 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.080
 Sometimes you kill people very easy other 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.150
 that you have to give the whole cartridge 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.430
 shot to kill everything not 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.349
 with everything is the environment the connections and 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.360
 other good there are people who think that 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.950
 is doing his super walt boxing and that 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.099
 they believe how god is doing 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.629
 but it's something that I see a lot and like them 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.459
 they think it's tell them they are 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.769
 moving like gods and you only what 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.870
 you're watching making a fool of yourself because you 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.910
 they move slower than they think and so 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.560
 well I only sometimes do not even say 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.959
 I'm as well as standing still waiting to see 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.670
 what time does your theater end when 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.859
 he thinks he's going to kill me with his super 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.599
 movement equal boxing have their 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.120
 shot his and he did not even know where 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.859
 came as I tell you there are times that there is no 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.049
 to use the war wounds and because of course 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.359
 it is a basic element to be able to handle 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.849
 lay your guard if you do not use it you're going to 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.930
 have a hard time and so good is something to 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.640
 dodge to make feints to be able to 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.530
 to turn it around and as I say 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.269
 mainly the feint so that not 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.459
 It sounds so ugly to send it in the back 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.949
 so that's why I'm telling you that you do not have to 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.410
 use clear guard bouncing is essential 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.699
 but abuse him of doing the 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.800
 ridiculous at the moment t all over the map 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.360
 according to your moment I like you as god and another 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.100
 person who has a better connection than 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.889
 you could not only expect that 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.259
 here is your theater to kill you and last 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.720
 last that I love to say that I 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.850
 It has served well is to be calm 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.190
 you know that the multiplayer is like 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.110
 that take the rage out of life as I 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.030
 like a phrase that goes on facebook like this 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.949
 Here, what do you say, I thought it was 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.840
 good in video games until I tried 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.729
 the multi body good in multicorte 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.160
 You know all the people who scream at you 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.900
 insults you that of other countries that plays 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.820
 dirty that comes out 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.889
 a lot of things and it's almost impossible 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.930
 not get angry but if one stays 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.280
 quiet or really I know that a 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.660
 Sometimes I'm not the best person 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.150
 to express why sometimes the 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.789
 ballasts where that spike marrano and that 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.050
 I do not know what you make me look clearer but 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.580
 I have done it when one is more 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.349
 quiet that is when he grabs as well as 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.880
 that you see that people that you do not like 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.840
 how are you playing feet that are playing 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.970
 dirty 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.070
 you grab your air quoted I let it out and 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.590
 really if you stop if you do not let you 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.570
 affects you better you can even 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.729
 say over time when you already have 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.410
 some time when gears of war that 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.810
 type of players that according to your crisis to 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.120
 I do not know how a bully that like rays and 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.790
 that seconds are with their dirty you use 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.590
 quite predictable wash especially 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.300
 when you already know when you already know a 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.400
 little bit the map and what it can do 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.290
 do there are times that they will not deny me 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.150
 that you are moving and that is the 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.160
 enemy in front and you know what's going to be 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.840
 you know he's going to hide at home is that 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.150
 you will be waiting for the return to 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.500
 put the shotgun and not so good if 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.510
 I already know that he will be waiting for me there 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.220
 better I wait for it and the vant or is it 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.530
 wait is going to come and you're going to 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.900
 kill there are so many movements that are so 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.460
 predictable feel software that are so 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.410
 good that there is no other way to move 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.900
 that you know that if you think about a 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.639
 little bit if you calm down and you know that 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.669
 it was good what is going to be you are going to 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.680
 depart the host sincerely there are times 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.300
 that I say in this same game about 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.280
 guys are telling me how to fuck 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.600
 you did that who knows what good is 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.220
 because I was calm because I 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.800
 reassure because there were some clubs there 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.379
 that looked like boxers and I calmed down 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.940
 and how did you know that I'm going to put there 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.919
 more because it's not that they are movements that 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.780
 one knowing map and knowing the 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.030
 movement of gears of war is very 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.800
 simple to know where you are going to be or 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.750
 what is he doing then 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.150
 I tell them, the main thing is not to be 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.319
 making unnecessary plays really 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.150
 they are not doing unnecessary walsh 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:47.370
 like wal loot all over the map or be 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.409
 I'm leaping somersaults or not quiet 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.569
 making the movement calm for 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.400
 that because one is until you walk 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.139
 By doing cartwheels you do not know where 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.250
 it came out and they blew your head off because 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:58.740
 even when he is not doing 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.419
