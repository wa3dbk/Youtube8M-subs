00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.789
 and here we are going to download sounds 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.030
 and here are all the applications 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.939
 that I downloaded from installing to a 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.229
 side I have a second generation ipod 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.560
 which I'm going to pass some of my 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.360
 applications so they can see how they 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.180
 does not we can in edit 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.840
 we select one of those that 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.840
 let's have here 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.730
 for example red face 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.130
 we select it and the bottom part 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.490
 we see that the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.540
 the bluetooth the symbol sign or how 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.280
 know the bluetooth we select it 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.590
 who asks us if we want 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.680
 activate it and it will search and blah blah 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.420
 bla we can ok and there says search 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.420
 us ipad iphone or ipod touch 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.159
 we wait for you to look for it in the 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.890
 meeting 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.299
 we select and wait for the other 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.299
 ipod ask us for the verification 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.330
 As you can see, it is already being transferred 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.170
 it depends on how many megs ps or whatever 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.300
 It's going to take a bit because, like you, 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.760
 they know the blood 16 so many to transfer 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.710
 things but to connect some command 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.710
 wireless or something else 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.799

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.930
