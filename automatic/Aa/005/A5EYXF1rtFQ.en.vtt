00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
number one because we've been wondering

number one because we've been wondering
what<00:01:25.259> could<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.650> done<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.159> type<00:01:26.369> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
what could be done with this type of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.200 
what could be done with this type of
technology<00:01:26.640> it's<00:01:27.450> uh<00:01:28.020> uh<00:01:28.880> striking<00:01:29.880> number

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
technology it's uh uh striking number

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.179 
technology it's uh uh striking number
two<00:01:30.479> because<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.470> know<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:32.009> actually

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
two because we now know it's actually

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.039 
two because we now know it's actually
going<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.729> far<00:01:33.000> more<00:01:33.030> difficult<00:01:33.240> than<00:01:33.780> what

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
going to be far more difficult than what

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.870 
going to be far more difficult than what
many<00:01:34.200> people<00:01:34.380> imagine<00:01:35.070> because<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.579> didn't

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
many people imagine because it didn't

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.969 
many people imagine because it didn't
work<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.390> many<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> attempts<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.799> they

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
work with many of the attempts that they

work with many of the attempts that they
made<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.369> did<00:01:38.520> work<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.880> some<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.390> number

of<00:01:43.079> ethical<00:01:43.530> concerns<00:01:44.009> because<00:01:44.369> it's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of ethical concerns because it's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.109

it uh it's it's going to happen and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.100 
it uh it's it's going to happen and
there's<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.659> lot<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.869> opposition

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
there's going to be a lot of opposition

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.889 
there's going to be a lot of opposition
and<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> class<00:02:09.509> thing

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and it's going to be a class thing

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.390 
and it's going to be a class thing
eventually<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:11.220> uh<00:02:11.569> but<00:02:12.569> that

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
eventually I think uh but that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.130 
eventually I think uh but that
the<00:02:13.519> future<00:02:13.849> and<00:02:14.060> other<00:02:14.450> than<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> greater

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
the future and other than the greater

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.420 
the future and other than the greater
part<00:02:15.470> there's<00:02:15.739> two<00:02:15.829> different<00:02:16.010> debates

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
around it one is the our embryos people

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.110 
around it one is the our embryos people
debate<00:02:19.189> which<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.549> there's<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.819> group<00:02:20.030> of

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
people who believe that embryos are our

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.479 
people who believe that embryos are our

who believe that because of that there

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.530 
who believe that because of that there
should<00:02:31.159> be<00:02:31.220> no<00:02:31.400> research<00:02:31.760> at<00:02:31.909> all<00:02:32.030> do<00:02:32.180> done<00:02:32.420> on

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
should be no research at all do done on

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.539 
should be no research at all do done on
human<00:02:32.780> embryos<00:02:33.140> that's<00:02:33.829> more<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
human embryos that's more of the

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.509 
human embryos that's more of the

the<00:02:38.000> other<00:02:38.209> side<00:02:38.629> of<00:02:38.659> it<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.140> just<00:02:39.680> around<00:02:39.859> the

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
the other side of it is just around the

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.059 
the other side of it is just around the
ethics<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.879> morals<00:02:41.299> of<00:02:41.599> this<00:02:41.920> potential<00:02:42.920> to

the<00:02:57.709> highest<00:02:58.069> priorities<00:02:58.609> i<00:02:58.760> would<00:02:58.909> imagine

would be eradicated predispositions to

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.819 
would be eradicated predispositions to
certain<00:03:02.480> diseases<00:03:02.599> that<00:03:03.260> would<00:03:03.470> be<00:03:03.590> for<00:03:03.799> me

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
certain diseases that would be for me

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.470 
certain diseases that would be for me
that<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:04.760> most<00:03:04.939> interesting

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
that the the the most interesting

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.869 
that the the the most interesting
element<00:03:05.870> of<00:03:05.989> this<00:03:06.200> uh<00:03:06.439> but<00:03:07.340> but<00:03:07.370> there's<00:03:07.760> no

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
element of this uh but but there's no

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.729 
element of this uh but but there's no
question<00:03:08.299> that<00:03:08.329> this<00:03:08.510> kind<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:08.780> custom<00:03:09.439> baby

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
question that this kind of custom baby

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.699 
question that this kind of custom baby
build<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.430> baby<00:03:10.700> thing<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.810> also<00:03:12.109> going<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.620> be

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
build the baby thing is also going to be

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.399 
build the baby thing is also going to be
a<00:03:12.799> very<00:03:12.859> uh<00:03:13.659> compelling<00:03:14.659> thing<00:03:14.959> if<00:03:15.290> the

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
a very uh compelling thing if the

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.670 
a very uh compelling thing if the
technology<00:03:15.620> allows<00:03:16.220> for<00:03:16.579> it<00:03:16.780> yeah<00:03:17.780> i<00:03:18.049> think

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
technology allows for it yeah i think

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.670 
technology allows for it yeah i think
the<00:03:19.579> like<00:03:20.389> you<00:03:20.510> said<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.810> first<00:03:20.989> step<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.470> is

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
the like you said the first step is is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.159 
the like you said the first step is is
health<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:23.150> going<00:03:23.449> to<00:03:23.540> be<00:03:23.690> that's

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
health and that is going to be that's

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.809 
health and that is going to be that's
without<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:24.859> going<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.250> first<00:03:25.459> step<00:03:25.639> but

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
without that going the first step but

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.119 
without that going the first step but
the<00:03:26.329> big<00:03:26.510> money<00:03:26.750> is<00:03:26.840> going<00:03:27.109> to<00:03:27.290> be<00:03:27.410> in<00:03:27.709> having

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
the big money is going to be in having

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.580 
the big money is going to be in having
completely<00:03:28.669> customizable<00:03:29.480> babe<00:03:29.659> huge<00:03:29.930> can
