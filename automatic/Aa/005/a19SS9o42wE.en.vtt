use about them and how they use them
I've<00:02:02.369> got<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> lot<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.729> free<00:02:03.060> apps<00:02:03.240> out<00:02:03.540> here

I've got a lot of free apps out here
we've<00:02:04.439> got<00:02:04.469> in-depth<00:02:05.219> looks<00:02:05.579> at<00:02:05.790> applications

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
we've got in-depth looks at applications

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.930 
we've got in-depth looks at applications
created<00:02:06.719> specifically<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:07.759> education<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
the thinking behind them

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.670 
the thinking behind them
we<00:02:11.650> have<00:02:11.860> several<00:02:12.400> chapters<00:02:13.270> about<00:02:13.750> studies

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
we have several chapters about studies

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.470 
we have several chapters about studies
that<00:02:14.830> were<00:02:14.980> conducted<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.670> really<00:02:16.090> helped

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
that were conducted that really helped

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.270 
that were conducted that really helped
to<00:02:16.570> prove<00:02:16.900> out<00:02:17.110> how<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.350> iPad<00:02:17.860> can<00:02:18.070> bring

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
to prove out how the iPad can bring

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.980 
to prove out how the iPad can bring
measurable<00:02:18.760> benefits<00:02:19.210> in<00:02:19.360> terms<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.720> student

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
measurable benefits in terms of student

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.840 
measurable benefits in terms of student
engagement<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.770> in<00:02:21.250> terms<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.700> learning

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
engagement and in terms of learning

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.940 
engagement and in terms of learning
outcomes<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.810> then<00:02:23.200> lastly<00:02:23.530> we<00:02:23.710> have<00:02:23.740> the
