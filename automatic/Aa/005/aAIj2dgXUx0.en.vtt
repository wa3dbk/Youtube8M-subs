sense<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.840> had<00:01:15.840> several<00:01:16.110> people<00:01:16.320> ask<00:01:16.590> me<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
sense I had several people ask me if you

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.249 
sense I had several people ask me if you
could<00:01:17.850> use<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.450> standard<00:01:18.509> blade<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
could use just a standard blade to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.929 
could use just a standard blade to
create<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> coves<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.780> in<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:23.460> raised

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
create the coves in the in the raised

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.060 
create the coves in the in the raised
panels<00:01:24.390> rather<00:01:25.020> than<00:01:25.229> using<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.590> stack<00:01:25.830> dado

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
panels rather than using a stack dado

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.819 
panels rather than using a stack dado
and<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:27.229> there's<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.320> difference<00:01:28.680> that

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and you can there's a difference that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.380 
and you can there's a difference that
you<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.189> make<00:01:29.340> several<00:01:29.549> consecutive

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
you have to make several consecutive

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.120 
you have to make several consecutive
passes<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.900> create<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.259> same<00:01:31.409> effect<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
passes to create the same effect and you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.700 
passes to create the same effect and you
typically<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.180> cut<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.900> quite<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.380> clean

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
typically the cut is not quite as clean

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950 
typically the cut is not quite as clean
as<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> stack<00:01:35.670> dado<00:01:35.970> stack<00:01:36.329> dado<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
as it is with a stack dado stack dado is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
as it is with a stack dado stack dado is
very<00:01:37.229> rigid<00:01:37.500> blade<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.400> stacked

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
very rigid blade when it's all stacked

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.370 
very rigid blade when it's all stacked
together<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> don't<00:01:39.360> have<00:01:39.659> any<00:01:39.869> flexing

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
together so you don't have any flexing

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.289 
together so you don't have any flexing
at<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.590> when<00:01:41.310> you're<00:01:41.460> running<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.790> blade<00:01:42.000> when

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
at all when you're running a blade when

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.219 
at all when you're running a blade when
you're<00:01:42.420> running<00:01:42.540> something<00:01:42.899> through<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
you're running something through it a

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.800 
you're running something through it a
blade<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.619> an<00:01:43.740> angle<00:01:44.100> if<00:01:44.520> your<00:01:44.759> blades<00:01:45.630> have

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
blade at an angle if your blades have

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.490 
blade at an angle if your blades have
flexing<00:01:46.259> up

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
flexing up

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.819 
flexing up
so<00:01:46.710> when<00:01:46.860> Intel<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.310> said<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:48.619> introduced<00:01:49.619> a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
so when Intel you said you introduced a

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.380 
so when Intel you said you introduced a
piece<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.159> wood<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:50.490> an<00:01:50.610> angle<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> blade

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
piece of wood at an angle to a blade

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.700 
piece of wood at an angle to a blade
it's<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.049> small<00:01:52.380> amount<00:01:52.649> of

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
it's going to have a small amount of

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.609 
it's going to have a small amount of
flex<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.270> slow<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.689> or<00:01:54.960> speed<00:01:55.079> up<00:01:55.409> in

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
flex and if you slow down or speed up in

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.230 
flex and if you slow down or speed up in
what<00:01:56.070> when<00:01:56.549> you're<00:01:56.670> pushing<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.090> through

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
what when you're pushing it through

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.639 
what when you're pushing it through
that's<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.200> create<00:01:58.259> different

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that's going to create different

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.899 
that's going to create different
pressures<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.159> blade<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.520> blades<00:01:59.700> going

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
pressures on the blade the blades going

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.920 
pressures on the blade the blades going
to<00:01:59.969> bounce<00:02:00.270> around

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to bounce around

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.230 
to bounce around
even<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.100> nice<00:02:02.280> smooth<00:02:02.640> all<00:02:03.120> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
even if it's just a nice smooth all the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.430 
even if it's just a nice smooth all the
way<00:02:03.300> clean<00:02:03.540> through<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.900> end<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.260> with<00:02:04.410> a

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
way clean through you end up with a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.130 
way clean through you end up with a
little<00:02:04.710> bit<00:02:04.980> more<00:02:05.520> sanding<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> end<00:02:06.540> in

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
little bit more sanding in the end in

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.130 
little bit more sanding in the end in
the<00:02:07.290> end<00:02:07.440> but<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> way<00:02:08.430> you<00:02:08.490> would<00:02:08.700> do<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:09.140> is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the end but the way you would do that is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.640 
the end but the way you would do that is
by<00:02:10.680> introducing<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.550> piece<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> blades

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
by introducing the piece to the blades

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.440 
by introducing the piece to the blades
in<00:02:13.650> several<00:02:14.160> second<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.610> consecutive<00:02:15.210> passes

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
in several second of consecutive passes

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.040 
in several second of consecutive passes
here<00:02:15.900> I'm<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:16.770> going<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.010> throw<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:18.050> any

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
here I'm just going to throw this any

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.560 
here I'm just going to throw this any
aim<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.740> point<00:02:19.980> at<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.130> point<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:24.480> you

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
aim of the point at this point and you

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.850 
aim of the point at this point and you
can<00:02:24.690> do<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.870> two<00:02:25.020> ways<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.680> rays

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
can do it two ways you can do the rays

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.680 
can do it two ways you can do the rays
of<00:02:25.890> light<00:02:26.070> up<00:02:26.370> into<00:02:26.670> an<00:02:26.760> incrementally<00:02:27.330> or<00:02:27.570> you

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
of light up into an incrementally or you

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.000 
of light up into an incrementally or you
can<00:02:27.840> move<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.110> fence<00:02:28.320> into<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.770> incrementally

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
can move the fence into it incrementally

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.980 
can move the fence into it incrementally
because<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.760> don't<00:02:30.060> want<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.300> stop<00:02:30.510> my<00:02:30.720> blade

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
because I don't want to stop my blade

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.920 
because I don't want to stop my blade
measure<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.980> height<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.480> for<00:02:33.840> that

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
measure the height to that for that

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.230 
measure the height to that for that
final<00:02:34.200> pass<00:02:34.500> I'm<00:02:35.400> not<00:02:35.610> going<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:35.850> mess<00:02:35.970> with<00:02:36.090> it

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
final pass I'm not going to mess with it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.120 
final pass I'm not going to mess with it
I'm<00:02:36.360> just<00:02:36.480> going<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.750> move<00:02:37.020> my<00:02:37.080> blade<00:02:37.500> my<00:02:37.800> fence

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
I'm just going to move my blade my fence

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.699 
I'm just going to move my blade my fence
into<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.760> each<00:02:38.940> time<00:02:39.240> so<00:02:39.930> I've<00:02:40.380> got<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> little

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
into it each time so I've got a little

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.199 
into it each time so I've got a little
scrap<00:02:40.980> piece<00:02:41.190> here<00:02:43.459> I'm<00:02:44.459> going<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.790> set<00:02:45.000> that

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
scrap piece here I'm going to set that

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.410 
scrap piece here I'm going to set that
so<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:46.980> hits<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.940> end<00:02:48.090> there<00:02:48.330> I'm

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
so it just hits the end there I'm

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.780 
so it just hits the end there I'm
basically<00:02:48.840> taking<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.410> 1/8<00:02:49.800> inch<00:02:49.830> pass<00:02:50.430> each

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
basically taking a 1/8 inch pass each

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.940 
basically taking a 1/8 inch pass each
time<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.870> enough<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.320> those<00:02:52.470> teeth<00:02:52.740> to

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
time just enough for those teeth to

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.280 
time just enough for those teeth to
cover<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.760> don't<00:02:54.420> want<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.720> go<00:02:54.920> over<00:02:55.920> that

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
cover that I don't want to go over that

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.750 
cover that I don't want to go over that
you<00:02:58.290> don't<00:02:58.530> want<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:58.830> try<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.040> start<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.610> from

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
you don't want to try and start it from

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.640 
you don't want to try and start it from
the<00:02:59.850> center<00:03:00.270> of<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.510> plywood<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.230> do<00:03:01.410> that

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
the center of the plywood if you do that

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.650 
the center of the plywood if you do that
what's<00:03:01.860> going<00:03:01.980> to<00:03:02.070> happen<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:03.209> blade<00:03:03.510> is

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
what's going to happen is that blade is

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.300 
what's going to happen is that blade is
going<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.900> meet<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.230> center<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.070> then<00:03:05.190> when

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
going to meet the center and then when

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.800 
going to meet the center and then when
it<00:03:05.400> hits<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.610> when<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:05.940> hits<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.269> blade<00:03:06.570> or

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
it hits that when it hits that blade or

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.330 
it hits that when it hits that blade or
enough<00:03:07.019> meat<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.320> that<00:03:07.620> blade<00:03:07.860> it's<00:03:08.130> going<00:03:08.280> to

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
enough meat on that blade it's going to

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.220 
enough meat on that blade it's going to
want<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.670> track<00:03:08.970> straight<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.750> blades<00:03:10.050> will

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
want to track straight that blades will

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.080

want<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.500> keep<00:03:10.890> going<00:03:11.340> straight<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:11.820> it's

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
want to keep going straight so it's

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.220 
want to keep going straight so it's
going<00:03:12.239> to<00:03:12.300> end<00:03:12.390> up<00:03:12.420> pulling<00:03:12.630> your<00:03:12.840> piece<00:03:13.019> out

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
going to end up pulling your piece out

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.740 
going to end up pulling your piece out
from<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.560> table<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.209> know<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.420> then<00:03:15.540> some

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
from the table you know and then some

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.150 
from the table you know and then some
bad<00:03:15.930> things<00:03:16.200> could<00:03:16.380> happen<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.769> definitely

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
bad things could happen you definitely

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.560 
bad things could happen you definitely
don't<00:03:17.280> want<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.519> do<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.850> if<00:03:18.060> you're<00:03:18.239> using<00:03:18.300> a

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
don't want to do that if you're using a

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.000 
don't want to do that if you're using a
standard<00:03:18.630> blade<00:03:19.140> with<00:03:19.350> something<00:03:19.680> like<00:03:19.830> this

take<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.030> time<00:03:21.269> to<00:03:21.450> set<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.750> upright<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.410> do

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
take the time to set it upright and do

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.380 
take the time to set it upright and do
you<00:03:23.070> know<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.280> several<00:03:23.610> consecutive<00:03:23.940> passes

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
you know the several consecutive passes

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.570 
you know the several consecutive passes
it<00:03:25.200> might<00:03:25.470> seem<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.130> lot<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.340> work

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
it might seem like it's a lot of work

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.580 
it might seem like it's a lot of work
but<00:03:26.820> if<00:03:27.390> you're<00:03:27.600> only<00:03:27.720> doing<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:28.200> few<00:03:28.410> raised

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
panels from time to time it's a lot

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.960 
panels from time to time it's a lot

there's<00:03:42.420> some<00:03:42.570> cheaper<00:03:42.870> ones<00:03:43.019> out<00:03:43.230> there<00:03:44.060> they

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
there's some cheaper ones out there they

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.820 
there's some cheaper ones out there they
never<00:03:45.269> cut<00:03:45.540> right<00:03:45.750> I<00:03:45.959> just<00:03:46.140> like<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.560> few

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
never cut right I just like a few

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.229 
never cut right I just like a few
abusive<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.400> was<00:03:47.640> thing<00:03:47.820> to<00:03:47.910> have<00:03:48.060> more

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
abusive and that was thing to have more

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.289 
abusive and that was thing to have more
trouble<00:03:48.600> than<00:03:48.690> they're<00:03:48.750> worth<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:50.640> if<00:03:51.120> you're

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
trouble than they're worth so if you're

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.729 
trouble than they're worth so if you're
going<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.480> go<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.690> router<00:03:51.870> way<00:03:52.049> get<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.470> right

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
going to go the router way get the right

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.640 
going to go the router way get the right
ones<00:03:53.870> I'm<00:03:54.870> just<00:03:55.019> going<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.200> go<00:03:55.290> ahead<00:03:55.350> and<00:03:55.530> run

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
ones I'm just going to go ahead and run

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:18.979 
ones I'm just going to go ahead and run
this<00:03:55.769> through<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:58.110> show<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.530> how<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.739> do<00:03:58.890> it

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.420 

so<00:04:19.989> as<00:04:20.139> you<00:04:20.319> can<00:04:20.439> see<00:04:20.499> just<00:04:21.009> using<00:04:21.159> a<00:04:21.370> standard

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
so as you can see just using a standard

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.489 
so as you can see just using a standard
blade<00:04:21.939> works<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.749> can<00:04:22.900> take<00:04:23.080> those<00:04:23.259> several

00:04:23.489 --> 00:04:23.499 
blade works you can take those several

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:25.800 
blade works you can take those several
passes<00:04:24.099> and<00:04:24.310> you<00:04:24.669> can<00:04:24.849> create<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.300> nice<00:04:25.509> cold

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
passes and you can create that nice cold

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.839 
passes and you can create that nice cold
by<00:04:26.319> raising<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:26.830> blade<00:04:27.039> or<00:04:27.219> lowering<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.699> or

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
by raising the blade or lowering it or

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.570 
by raising the blade or lowering it or
changing<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.389> angle<00:04:28.629> of<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.319> fences<00:04:29.830> in<00:04:29.860> its

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
changing the angle of the fences in its

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.700 
changing the angle of the fences in its
orientation<00:04:30.999> to<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.389> blade<00:04:31.599> you<00:04:32.229> can<00:04:32.409> create

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
orientation to the blade you can create

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.700 
orientation to the blade you can create
different<00:04:33.599> size<00:04:34.599> coves<00:04:34.990> different<00:04:35.379> depths<00:04:35.620> of

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
different size coves different depths of

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.249 
different size coves different depths of
coves<00:04:35.949> so<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.580> mean<00:04:36.909> it's<00:04:37.150> obviously<00:04:37.689> more

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
coves so I mean it's obviously more

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.600 
coves so I mean it's obviously more
versatile<00:04:38.770> than<00:04:38.830> just<00:04:39.129> buying<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.430> single

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
versatile than just buying a single

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.769 
versatile than just buying a single
router<00:04:39.909> bit<00:04:40.150> that<00:04:40.180> creates<00:04:40.659> one<00:04:40.930> sides<00:04:41.289> Cove

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:42.779 
router bit that creates one sides Cove

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:45.899 
router bit that creates one sides Cove
again<00:04:43.779> using<00:04:44.229> a<00:04:44.319> stacked<00:04:44.620> dado<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:45.159> much<00:04:45.699> more

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
again using a stacked dado a much more

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.149 
again using a stacked dado a much more
preferable<00:04:46.300> method<00:04:46.479> it's<00:04:46.900> one<00:04:47.199> pass<00:04:47.469> and<00:04:47.830> it's

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
preferable method it's one pass and it's

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.890 
preferable method it's one pass and it's
done<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.669> here's<00:04:48.969> a<00:04:49.029> little<00:04:49.150> video<00:04:49.539> of<00:04:49.599> that

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
done and here's a little video of that

00:04:49.900 --> 00:05:00.990 
done and here's a little video of that
again

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.180 

okay<00:05:02.000> with<00:05:02.240> that<00:05:02.419> done<00:05:02.660> talk<00:05:03.560> about<00:05:03.889> is<00:05:04.070> how

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
okay with that done talk about is how

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.310 
okay with that done talk about is how
you<00:05:04.250> can<00:05:04.370> accessorize<00:05:04.820> this<00:05:05.540> fence<00:05:06.020> system

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
you can accessorize this fence system

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.700 
you can accessorize this fence system
and<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:08.000> had<00:05:08.389> a<00:05:08.419> couple<00:05:08.690> things<00:05:08.930> I<00:05:09.110> wanted<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.500> do

and<00:05:17.120> I'm<00:05:17.419> going<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.630> show<00:05:17.750> you<00:05:17.780> what<00:05:17.990> we<00:05:18.080> can<00:05:18.229> do

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
and I'm going to show you what we can do

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.170 
and I'm going to show you what we can do
with<00:05:18.530> some<00:05:18.560> accessories<00:05:19.660> okay<00:05:20.660> so<00:05:20.720> this<00:05:20.990> is<00:05:21.199> my

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
with some accessories okay so this is my

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.360 
with some accessories okay so this is my
pending<00:05:23.180> jig<00:05:23.449> I<00:05:23.720> have<00:05:24.199> a<00:05:24.229> 45<00:05:24.590> degree<00:05:24.889> angle<00:05:25.100> cut

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
pending jig I have a 45 degree angle cut

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.129 
pending jig I have a 45 degree angle cut
on<00:05:25.639> the<00:05:25.729> top<00:05:25.940> of<00:05:26.090> this<00:05:26.240> fence<00:05:26.449> right<00:05:26.690> here<00:05:26.750> and

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
on the top of this fence right here and

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.060 
on the top of this fence right here and
on<00:05:27.680> here<00:05:27.979> if<00:05:28.100> it's<00:05:28.250> another<00:05:28.690> corresponding<00:05:30.070> 45

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
on here if it's another corresponding 45

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.290 
on here if it's another corresponding 45
degree<00:05:31.340> angle<00:05:31.639> that's<00:05:31.729> up<00:05:32.060> top<00:05:32.240> of<00:05:32.419> there

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
degree angle that's up top of there

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.939 
degree angle that's up top of there
which<00:05:35.300> makes<00:05:35.510> changing<00:05:36.289> out<00:05:36.410> really<00:05:37.010> quick

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
which makes changing out really quick

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.189 
which makes changing out really quick
there<00:05:39.949> we<00:05:40.070> go<00:05:40.419> so<00:05:41.419> I<00:05:41.479> can<00:05:41.510> just<00:05:41.750> slap<00:05:41.930> it<00:05:41.960> on

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
there we go so I can just slap it on

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.840 
there we go so I can just slap it on
there<00:05:42.410> when<00:05:42.590> I'm<00:05:42.740> holding<00:05:43.250> this<00:05:43.520> thing<00:05:43.580> in

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
there when I'm holding this thing in

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.219 
there when I'm holding this thing in
position<00:05:44.240> I'll<00:05:44.360> hold<00:05:44.539> it<00:05:44.630> down<00:05:44.780> here<00:05:44.990> with<00:05:45.110> my

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
position I'll hold it down here with my

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.200 
position I'll hold it down here with my
hands<00:05:45.530> in<00:05:45.650> my<00:05:45.680> hands<00:05:45.979> nowhere<00:05:46.490> near<00:05:46.789> this<00:05:46.970> I

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
hands in my hands nowhere near this I

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.670 
hands in my hands nowhere near this I
have<00:05:47.630> a<00:05:47.660> good<00:05:47.870> amount<00:05:48.080> of<00:05:48.199> control<00:05:48.560> because

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
have a good amount of control because

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.050 
have a good amount of control because
I'm<00:05:48.979> basically<00:05:49.310> putting<00:05:49.580> pressure<00:05:49.880> down

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
I'm basically putting pressure down

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.360 
I'm basically putting pressure down
against<00:05:50.720> the<00:05:50.840> fence<00:05:51.080> I'm<00:05:51.260> pushing<00:05:51.560> down<00:05:51.590> so

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
against the fence I'm pushing down so

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.589 
against the fence I'm pushing down so
that's<00:05:52.460> creating<00:05:52.639> down<00:05:52.910> pressure<00:05:53.180> pushing<00:05:53.539> it

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
that's creating down pressure pushing it

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:54.879 
that's creating down pressure pushing it
up<00:05:53.690> against<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.080> fence<00:05:54.349> and<00:05:54.530> that<00:05:54.620> holds

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
up against the fence and that holds

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.490 
up against the fence and that holds
everything<00:05:55.130> in<00:05:55.370> position<00:05:56.080> now<00:05:57.080> if<00:05:57.229> I<00:05:57.289> want<00:05:57.470> to

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
everything in position now if I want to

simply<00:06:46.699> just<00:06:46.729> move<00:06:47.659> the<00:06:47.780> fence<00:06:48.020> just<00:06:48.139> a<00:06:48.409> little

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
simply just move the fence just a little

00:06:48.650 --> 00:07:10.140 
simply just move the fence just a little
bit<00:06:48.770> at<00:06:48.919> the<00:06:49.099> at<00:06:49.370> the<00:06:49.580> end<00:06:49.699> of<00:06:49.789> the<00:06:49.849> process

later unless you for this kind of a

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:28.779 
later unless you for this kind of a

not<00:07:29.389> really<00:07:29.629> that<00:07:29.750> important<00:07:30.319> but<00:07:30.819> so<00:07:31.819> this<00:07:32.240> is

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:32.389 
not really that important but so this is

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:33.969 
not really that important but so this is
real<00:07:32.539> simple<00:07:32.719> accessory<00:07:33.319> what<00:07:33.590> I<00:07:33.620> like<00:07:33.830> about

00:07:33.969 --> 00:07:33.979 
real simple accessory what I like about

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:36.369 
real simple accessory what I like about
this<00:07:34.280> is<00:07:34.460> its<00:07:34.610> quick<00:07:34.789> they're<00:07:35.030> quick<00:07:36.020> to<00:07:36.050> put

00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:36.379

00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:37.939 
on they're quick to take off and I think

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:41.619 
on they're quick to take off and I think
you<00:07:38.000> set<00:07:38.210> it<00:07:38.330> aside<00:07:38.419> so<00:07:39.939> this<00:07:40.939> fence<00:07:41.240> will<00:07:41.449> stay

00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:41.629 
you set it aside so this fence will stay

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:43.809 
you set it aside so this fence will stay
