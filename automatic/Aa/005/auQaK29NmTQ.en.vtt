 and I'm going to introduce you, I 'm going to make a 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.890
 short presentation and then if you want 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.840
 know much more he has a blog spot is 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.390
 federico de robertis who wrote the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.790
 Mayan calendar 2013 with predictions 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.360
 for each stamp that everything here is in 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.130
 this federico book specialized in 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.320
 Mayan calendar and play habia is us 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.660
 also therapeutic companion is 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.400
 transpersonal connections therapist is 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.580
 channeler and creator of his own 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.210
 energy healing system that 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.190
 flame spiral energy good really 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.170
 It was very nice to be back in 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.390
 next to federico so what do you think 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.600
 If I was already traveling in Buenos Aires 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.920
 with him so here we go 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.280
 Federico is a pleasure to be again 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.280
 with you is a fantastic guy good and 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.650
 I have the 2013 Mayan calendar here 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.839
 come out of the oven and says practical guide 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.549
 to know your mission energy and 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.880
 projection in the future and changes 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.149
 planetary 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.539
 and the big question you're not ready 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:16.659
 for the new resonance that is going to 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:21.220
 happen after the 22 good first 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.470
 there will be 2013 because the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.960
 people thought that 2012 was ending or 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.039
 be that we have a very good news not 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.200
 be after appliances as well 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.240
 marketers and others we are before 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 a fantastic event that will happen a 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.970
 lots of things we're going to go 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.280
 developing in the program but that in 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.979
 reality nothing more will happen 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.470
 that is already happening or that the 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.060
 book that deals with the resonance more 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.729
 that nothing is that we have to change the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.080
 internal resonance and in that radical is 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.119
 the most important thing that they have to be 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.229
 human beings at this time and the reason 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.500
 is that it has to do with the vibration 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.270
 with the vibration of either the food of 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.399
 the breath of connection that each 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.429
 one has with his affections with work 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.220
 with no family then from 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.799
 there is to resonate as you reason internally 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.769
 you and how are we going to resolve internally 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.940
 with the other because in addition always 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.870
 we are connected and we are beings 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.159
 social 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.049
 we always have to be connected with 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.269
 the other then the idea is 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.400
 rethink how this year to 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.250
 In 2013 we will be connecting with 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.590
 the other and the most important thing would be the 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.540
 resonances of love but that love that 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.329
 that they did not really teach us is not a 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.060
 most unconditional love is a lot love 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.459
 more this loving one is a thing like more 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.349
 compassionate has nothing to do with love 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.849
 that we understand in many years that 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.190
 had to see more than anything with the couple 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.900
 or how we provide affection 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.720
 In short, it has to do with 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.129
 with something more internal like something else up 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.379
 even as spiritual that does not have 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.760
 to do with religion not because the 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.530
 people confuse this thing of the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.120
 spirituality with religion among 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.510
 regions are fine are well seen no 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.819
 there is no problem but the integration 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.319
 absolute of all those religions the 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.819
 coexistence and the internal religion that 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.500
 you can get to develop has 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.239
 what to do with the resonance of how we 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.489
 we move this is friend because it is important 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.980
 that we ask ourselves internally 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.590
 I'm with the right person I'm in 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.020
 the indicated work and I'm happy doing 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.430
 what I do 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.200
 and I think that everyone is 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.730
 asking that at this time and the 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.340
 people sometimes ask you but before 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.890
 I wondered also do not think that 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.210
 was so sincere the human being I think that 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.130
 at this time the universe and the 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.130
 energies are taking you to certain 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.720
 places where you no longer get a 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.820
 drop to the glass that has to do with the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.640
 brain not then it's like that one 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.710
 You have to advance through other paths and you 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.080
 they are leading by other roads then 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.480
 It seems to me that this is a moment of 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.180
 Reflection of reflection and observation 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.890
 internal but very important for the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.560
 who knows and who does not know no no no 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.850
 There is no need to know about the Mayans. 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.380
 know about the Egyptians 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.360
 you have to know a lot that you see a lot 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.580
 better not because you can not escape from the 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.340
 consciousness that has already developed the 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.280
 subject is in 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.450
 that the one who does not know has time 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.910
 this is important that the people that we 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.489
 is seeing also know until the last 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.010
 moment one has time to wake up 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.500
 that's why one can not underestimate the other 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.660
 because maybe I study a lot of 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.220
 years I did a lot of things a lot 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.620
 of postgraduate a lot of masters and 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.580
 others and by putting it into practice 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.110
 I have enough courage or certainty and 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.590
 authenticity to be able to take it to 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.780
 the practice in this resonance change 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.270
 obviously it is happening is not the 22 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.729
 it's not 21 it's been feeling 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.620
 throughout the year he has been feeling 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.139
 throughout the year because you think 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.850
 that we are changing an era of 26 thousand 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.919
 years that is from the long count of the 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.720
 Maya and so on from other accounts that 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.229
 obviously they handle in other places this 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.410
 of the world 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.690
 everything comes together in the same are 26,000 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.510
 years of history I do not know what a cycle is 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.550
 but giant and obviously does not end in 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.620
 a moment but it ends a day 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.380
 for the other in a year approximately 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.840
 between 86 and 87 which sediba 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.370
 argüelles called 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.470
 josé argüello is a great scholar the 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.660
 Mayan calendar the harmonic convergence 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.330
 from that moment on it was called 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.639
 because they were the last 26 years before 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.410
 of 2012 and notice that there begins the 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.540
 gulf war other types of wars 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.669
 after all debacle and no earthquake 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.500
 public at the social economic level this 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.540
 political that is what we are now 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.760
 paying also then we are 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.350
 preparing not only 26,000 years ago 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.900
 but we talk about fractals 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.900
 also like of 26 years in this case
