00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
floor on the ground I'm sure there was

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.039 
floor on the ground I'm sure there was
some<00:01:53.159> dirt<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.909> too<00:01:54.090> also<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.689> three

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
some dirt in it too also that three

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.719 
some dirt in it too also that three
imaginary<00:01:55.649> fingers<00:01:56.100> picked<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.490> from<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
imaginary fingers picked up from the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.370 
imaginary fingers picked up from the
ground<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.240> there<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.570> some<00:01:57.780> dirt<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.200> stuff

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
ground so there was some dirt and stuff

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.319 
ground so there was some dirt and stuff
on<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.560> too<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.009> think<00:01:59.640> maybe<00:01:59.820> there's<00:02:00.090> also

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329

what<00:02:00.659> those<00:02:00.869> microscopic<00:02:01.439> real<00:02:01.950> name<00:02:02.310> niblets

this and annoying you can slice printing
paper<00:04:06.450> like<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:06.840> that's<00:04:07.769> pretty<00:04:08.070> good<00:04:08.280> let's

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
paper like this that's pretty good let's

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.380 
paper like this that's pretty good let's
see

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390

oh<00:04:16.120> yeah<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.329> battery<00:04:17.720> had<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:18.049> die<00:04:18.230> right<00:04:18.500> now

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
oh yeah the battery had to die right now

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:36.719 
oh yeah the battery had to die right now
that's<00:04:21.200> fun<00:04:21.880> luckily<00:04:22.880> I<00:04:23.000> have

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.700 

this<00:04:37.729> larger<00:04:38.240> place<00:04:38.449> our<00:04:38.660> little<00:04:38.960> scarier<00:04:39.500> to

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
this larger place our little scarier to

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.439 
this larger place our little scarier to
do<00:04:39.830> on<00:04:39.949> that<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.340> if<00:04:40.520> you<00:04:40.669> ever<00:04:40.789> do<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.090> be

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
do on that so if you ever do that be

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:51.309 
do on that so if you ever do that be
careful<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:47.720> is<00:04:49.750> considerably<00:04:50.750> sharper

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
careful that is considerably sharper

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:59.529 
careful that is considerably sharper
than<00:04:51.590> it<00:04:51.740> was<00:04:51.889> before<00:04:55.330> can<00:04:56.330> push<00:04:56.690> cut<00:04:56.990> yet<00:04:58.539> but

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
than it was before can push cut yet but

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.580 
than it was before can push cut yet but
I<00:04:59.630> can<00:04:59.810> feel<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.319> it<00:05:00.470> is<00:05:00.590> sharper<00:05:01.250> I<00:05:02.590> think

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
I can feel that it is sharper I think

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.809 
I can feel that it is sharper I think
you<00:05:03.650> can<00:05:03.800> actually<00:05:03.949> even<00:05:04.340> hear<00:05:04.699> the

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
you can actually even hear the

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:11.770 
you can actually even hear the
difference<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:10.550> shaves<00:05:10.880> again<00:05:11.300> evenly<00:05:11.750> I

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
difference it shaves again evenly I

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.350 
difference it shaves again evenly I
didn't<00:05:12.199> shave<00:05:12.409> even<00:05:12.770> it<00:05:13.250> was<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.729> shaving

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
didn't shave even it was the shaving

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.730 
didn't shave even it was the shaving
hair<00:05:14.659> it<00:05:14.810> was<00:05:14.930> funny<00:05:15.229> because<00:05:15.409> it<00:05:15.650> was

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
hair it was funny because it was

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.830 
hair it was funny because it was
interesting<00:05:16.190> because<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.940> was<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.509> hair

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
interesting because it was the hair

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.040 
interesting because it was the hair
shaving<00:05:18.940> capabilities<00:05:19.940> the<00:05:20.389> first<00:05:20.720> time<00:05:20.900> I'm

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
shaving capabilities the first time I'm

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.499 
shaving capabilities the first time I'm
shopping<00:05:21.289> with<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:22.009> was<00:05:22.220> still<00:05:22.520> sharp<00:05:23.270> enough

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
shopping with it was still sharp enough

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.620 
shopping with it was still sharp enough
to<00:05:23.720> easily<00:05:23.930> slide<00:05:24.470> slice<00:05:25.220> through<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:26.509> the

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
to easily slide slice through the to the

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.149 
to easily slide slice through the to the
phone<00:05:26.840> book<00:05:27.020> paper<00:05:27.259> so<00:05:27.500> that<00:05:27.530> was<00:05:27.800> there<00:05:28.039> was

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
phone book paper so that was there was

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:30.399 
phone book paper so that was there was
interesting<00:05:28.669> actually<00:05:28.849> and<00:05:29.780> you<00:05:29.900> see<00:05:30.139> you

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
interesting actually and you see you

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.850 
interesting actually and you see you
know<00:05:30.530> n<00:05:30.740> 690<00:05:31.520> stainless<00:05:31.940> steel<00:05:32.590> pretty<00:05:33.590> large

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
know n 690 stainless steel pretty large

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.070 
know n 690 stainless steel pretty large
blade<00:05:34.220> not<00:05:34.490> very<00:05:34.759> heavy<00:05:35.030> but<00:05:35.599> pretty<00:05:35.870> large

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
blade not very heavy but pretty large

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.560 
blade not very heavy but pretty large
blade<00:05:36.470> and<00:05:36.650> from<00:05:36.800> the<00:05:36.919> nature<00:05:37.099> of<00:05:37.310> it<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:38.360> edge

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
blade and from the nature of it the edge

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.749 
blade and from the nature of it the edge
is<00:05:38.840> being<00:05:39.229> abused<00:05:39.650> quite<00:05:40.039> a<00:05:40.070> lot<00:05:40.340> because<00:05:40.520> you

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
is being abused quite a lot because you

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.140 
is being abused quite a lot because you
have<00:05:40.849> low<00:05:41.389> profile<00:05:41.990> and<00:05:42.759> this<00:05:43.759> handle<00:05:44.090> is

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150 
have low profile and this handle is

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.570 
have low profile and this handle is
kinda<00:05:44.570> narrow<00:05:44.780> for<00:05:45.199> me<00:05:45.380> and<00:05:45.560> I'm<00:05:46.099> not<00:05:46.159> used<00:05:46.490> to

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
kinda narrow for me and I'm not used to

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.129 
kinda narrow for me and I'm not used to
chopping<00:05:47.060> it<00:05:47.180> still<00:05:47.479> beginning<00:05:47.900> of<00:05:48.020> the

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 
chopping it still beginning of the

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.010 
chopping it still beginning of the
season<00:05:48.349> for<00:05:48.710> me<00:05:48.830> like<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.099> summer<00:05:49.310> and<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:50.509> a

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
season for me like the summer and it a

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.709 
season for me like the summer and it a
god<00:05:51.229> does<00:05:51.530> have<00:05:51.889> a<00:05:51.919> lot<00:05:52.340> of<00:05:52.370> you<00:05:52.909> know<00:05:53.030> lateral

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:53.719 
god does have a lot of you know lateral

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:55.930 
god does have a lot of you know lateral
forces<00:05:54.110> on<00:05:54.289> the<00:05:54.320> edge<00:05:54.530> especially<00:05:55.340> with<00:05:55.849> the

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
forces on the edge especially with the

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.760 
forces on the edge especially with the
type<00:05:56.120> of<00:05:56.150> work<00:05:56.389> i<00:05:56.539> did<00:05:56.719> I<00:05:56.780> chopped<00:05:57.169> the<00:05:57.199> big

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
type of work i did I chopped the big

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.860 
type of work i did I chopped the big
pieces<00:05:58.039> small<00:05:58.580> branches<00:05:59.030> everything<00:05:59.509> into

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
pieces small branches everything into

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.860 
pieces small branches everything into
the<00:05:59.990> nuts<00:06:00.169> so<00:06:00.889> the<00:06:01.280> edge<00:06:01.430> does<00:06:01.789> get<00:06:02.090> a<00:06:02.300> lot<00:06:02.810> of

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
the nuts so the edge does get a lot of

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.589 
the nuts so the edge does get a lot of
lateral<00:06:03.469> forces<00:06:03.830> reducing<00:06:04.460> that<00:06:04.639> are<00:06:05.240> not

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 
lateral forces reducing that are not

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:08.890 
lateral forces reducing that are not
ideal<00:06:06.050> for<00:06:06.409> knife<00:06:06.650> so<00:06:07.610> it's<00:06:07.759> it's<00:06:08.210> very<00:06:08.479> hard

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
ideal for knife so it's it's very hard

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.320 
ideal for knife so it's it's very hard
to<00:06:09.020> use<00:06:09.199> knife<00:06:09.500> so<00:06:09.949> far<00:06:10.250> and<00:06:10.520> it<00:06:10.969> held<00:06:11.210> up

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 
to use knife so far and it held up

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.870 
to use knife so far and it held up
pretty<00:06:11.569> nice<00:06:11.840> so<00:06:12.080> I'm<00:06:12.530> happy<00:06:12.889> super<00:06:13.370> happy<00:06:13.550> I
