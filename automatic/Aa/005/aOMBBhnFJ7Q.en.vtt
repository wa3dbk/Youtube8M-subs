00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:11.110
 Hello Miyashita is 11 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:17.680
 World swimming Shanghai 2011 swimming competition starts from July 24 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:19.370
 I would also like to share the subpool presence from Shanghai as a co-prosper caster 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:26.420
 I will 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:27.670
 Thank you for your support so that as many Japanese players as possible can win medals 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.240
 And 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:38.160
 My first teaching dvd 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:42.660
 Beneath out to Miyashita, 10 percent house of the military worth Toru resistance and technique is July 19 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.170
 I would like to see a little bit more about the contents of that dvd 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.170
 Here please 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:04.129
 The say the charm of Well backstroke, unlike Nampa crawl breaststroke butterfly only 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.909
 There is the Tteyuu swim faces on this 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.909
 A characteristic 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:17.990
 After all, I can not see the stroke when I extend it, I can not see the wall, so I feel my sense 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.110
 Even though I have become the great important Tteyuu go sharpened 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:26.000
 When overcoming the difficulty 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:29.980
 I feel my sense rather than practice swimming 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.980
 I have not approached a fish 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:39.080
 That sense is 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:42.380
 Can not grow only swim Tteyuu However in my left and right to 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.000
 One difficulty of justice 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.660
 And I wonder if not a fun 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.660
 I feel 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:57.630
 More fun and more the backpack to everyone in the Hello Miyashita is 10 o'clock of this dvd 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.990
 I would like to introduce the points that can be improved 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.500
 The important thing in swimming is to say straight 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:08.280
 There is fear in the backstroke, especially in front of you. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:13.920
 And because I can not see the rope, how my image 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:17.620
 That feeling in some of such you have become or to cherish their own sense of point 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.760
 I would like to introduce training to support the image 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.760
 Let's get started 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.810
 How was that 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.990
 Speaking of spare 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.870
 Water enters 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:37.610
 And I think that there are many people who are not good at not seeing the front 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:40.440
 I think that such a sense will also fly somewhere if you look at this dvd 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.040
 So please take a look at everyone 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.520
 So let's be a world swimming Shanghai 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.520
 good bye
