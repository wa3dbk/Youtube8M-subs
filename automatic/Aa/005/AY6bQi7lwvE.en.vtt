00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.070
 welcome to interested parties 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.559
 Today I want to let you know 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.509
 which do I share from the 1000 euro 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.519
 gaming pc could recommend this list 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.930
 By the way, the used part is not 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.570
 from me but from a subscriber 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.180
 on my part then lukas from lukas 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.040
 games lp and euro genster youtube channel 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.090
 for the compile has with 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.430
 definitely saved time 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.579
 as cpu the intel core i5 4670 quad core 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.619
 processor 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.540
 this offers a lot of power 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.700
 play and may well for 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.190
 Cattle work can be used around 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.199
 to cool this process as well and that 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.890
 The system also quieter than the stock 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.390
 Much running would be the baroque will 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.300
 really not a bad choice 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:53.019
 as a graphics card the gigabyte geforce gtx 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.940
 470 windows and video card with 2 gb 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.589
 gddr5 video memory 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.289
 With this card you should be able to 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.179
 his game is really high or even 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.600
 to play at maximum settings 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.080
 can 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.930
 mainboard first quality 87 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.940
 cellar board with the decision 87 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.070
 chipset with this mainboard you can 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.810
 quite well overclocked and that will 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.300
 also here in this case really 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.990
 because it allows us a good cooling 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.440
 have list 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.470
 as a memory the emperor xms 3 8 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.350
 gb 1600 megahertz all new store 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.480
 the 8 gigabytes divide to 24 gb 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.220
 modules on this budget can be 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.440
 In any case, there is room for one 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.390
 ssd find and there would be maybe 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.700
 the kingston hyperx ex 3k 120gb ssd 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.700
 not bad as had the classic 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.010
 seagate barracuda 1 ter mate six 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.270
 gigabit per second disk around that 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.080
 to supply the whole system with electricity 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.090
 be the be quiet person model a 650 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.970
 watt power supply really not bad 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.690
 As the name suggests, it is modular and 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.340
 In addition, the pc is also 80 plus bronze 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.540
 certified as a housing this time something 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.880
 more expensive the causa graf than 230 c in 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.690
 orange with a window and that would be it 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.340
 actually already 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.709
