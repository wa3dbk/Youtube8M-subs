00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.379
 9 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.329
 through traffic 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.510
 I only have to play and not the sentiment that I am here too often 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.310
 filed for bankruptcy 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.659
 I always find the podium 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.449
 and you have to check it is today a day after queen's day and yet one hit anyway 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.509
 a few hundred ajax who have come here to party at this hardenberg 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.580
 hardenberg july are the shit 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.310
 what to expect from that moment would come no believe me but I had myself 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.300
 something like no no one but finally Queen's Day 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.360
 And then your interest stick just had a nice time between we have one 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.320
 made a party and today was an exception because I knew something about it 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.560
 you discovered a little later we go with the idea the westerly wind but this you do not 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.700
 I say come and stand on your feet with you also it is that having done 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.180
 nice 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.000
 but of course it is not faith at all last year but that is a pulse 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.140
 according to the nos configure know that man i actually thought they had been music for years and years 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.150
 believe me the deal and brainpower since and the shit of win win win win win 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.720
 you know that a lot of people don't know and maybe don't appreciate that 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.690
 believe me that as a child as a conductor I will definitely draw in the other room 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.450
 euros per year 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 this every penny since long time 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.579
 in short one 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.490
 except for a little bit when I 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.890
 but what was smaller at primary schools like I was a very annoying one 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.490
 the noisy under pressure but that you never left tranzo but then 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.940
 the man a way 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.689
 I didn't stop 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.670
 and then I also have no one with a tight everyone 30 autumn everyone now has 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.290
 everybody 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.820
 there used to be very tough but she got into her so I used to 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.900
 from the measurements in this maniac 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.219
 and after about four years of terror suspects of that name is much tougher 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.999
 for example if you would come home with me this is a maniac then 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:54.670
 your parents would have been found 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.179
 protesters I am never you 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.649
 so i have that all abbreviated subspecies other thing but not so now i am not 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.629
 the man who made it is the difference between a private audience in hardenberg 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:05.710
 or in Amsterdam it is a lot of difference 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.409
 to the Russians a lot of difference that is of course because the girl 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.060
 of course grow up with very different living conditions 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.560
 but one thing they have in common is that and that parents love music and that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.120
 is just one thing was really take Amsterdammers rotterdammers one move 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.359
 hardenberg doesn't care what is in it 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.549
 this year I could again here and there I may also have the tender it was for me 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.789
