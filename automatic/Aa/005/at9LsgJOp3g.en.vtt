00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:11.849
 I would like to explain that the reverse Oh fan monitoring 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:15.629
 What has been explained until then is how the performance has evolved 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:21.630
 It has become party members of large capacity but was there from here 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:25.259
 We will carry out will explain the fact that new car usage using this 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.130
 How to run on the numbers 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:35.160
 After using up the externally supplied power 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.950
 Attendance so that the hybrid image height we have to shape called leading to life 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.740
 On the contrary 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.320
 A real estate for the battery in the customers to have the wind of freedom to use purpose of the two modes of 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.840
 I have set 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:55.960
 At first there is a there you battery component are you save mode 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:59.680
 Because it will be in the form of keeping the full power remaining at that time when you use this cooking 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:05.820
 It changes to hybrid driving from there 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 To start ev traveling at a national power under pier in the form of releasing and again 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:17.280
 When a finger breaking at the plateau zone of destination will form say it is spend to dance outside in his surgery 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.610
 It becomes this section like saying 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.240
 Cedar is there a Perry charge mode char King 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:28.470
 Yale and you can use this switch 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.730
 We do that to generate electricity in a play aggressively 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.210
 I think because it will be charging the battery for driving by this 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.390
 Power was charged yeah 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.119
 Later we will explain external 9 years 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.119
 It will also be possible to use 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:53.080
 The following are There is a concept for an external power supply 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.030
 Masu much less using the flow waiting for the Ryo Kudo 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.370
 We were prepared to leave after the interior light 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.909
 I'm happy from the outlet 1500 w 100 balls 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:11.200
 It becomes possible to do this to the front 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:15.580
 There is a charge of 1,500 out, but the capacity that most related products can be used 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.080
 In addition, it is a state of the battery for driving this battery 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.900
 8 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:24.770
 Average general 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:30.230
 It will be possible to meet the power of about one day used at home 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:36.580
 As I mentioned earlier, it also means that engine power generation is performed in charge mode . 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.580
 It will be possible to supply about 10 days of power 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.010
 The last time to hit sun remote control say 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:49.340
 I will explain about that 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:55.310
 Smartphones and mobile devices equipped with wi-fi function 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:58.630
 There may be game consoles, but charge timer timer setting with these things 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:03.990
 Speaking of remote control of the air conditioner 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:07.569
 We have a over Te absolute, such as can be carried out that state a feeling of vehicle 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.050
 As we do wi-fi communication design technique 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.680
 Telephone charges etc 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.680
 There is something to say
