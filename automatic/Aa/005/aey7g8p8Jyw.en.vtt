00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.610
 in most games we have always 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.410
 been brave soldiers at the service of 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.000
 our commander and we had to use 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.220
 all our ability to defeat 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.740
 our enemy but if things were 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.330
 upside down today in the reyno dot net you 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.130
 We teach how you can become 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.110
 all a military strategist in advanced 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.940
 words for game boy advance and thanks to 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.870
 the nintendo virtual console now 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.870
 also in windows 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.860
 in this title we will take control of 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.420
 commander and we will have our 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.610
 layout a large number of units 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.560
 ready for combat whose objectives 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.390
 main will be to defeat everything 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.530
 the rival army or capture your point 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.690
 central operations 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.640
 in each shift we must choose with 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.170
 astuteness what will be our movement already 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.880
 that we can not afford with our 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.100
 forces dwindle or we will fail in the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.690
 mission the summary of each shift will be 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.250
 counted for days and we will have to 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.990
 complete the mission as soon as possible 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.409
 to get the best ranking at the end 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.409
 of this one 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.620
 the title introduces us to the handling of it 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.300
 with a masked tutorial in the 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.010
 first missions that we will carry out in the 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.930
 training mode to get us with the 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.330
 disregard of units their strengths 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.890
 and the multiple uses that it has in the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.960
 deployment of another pass is motley 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.060
 going from the infantry to tanks 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.950
 medium air vehicles forces 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.840
 naval and even special units 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.770
 dedicated to the support of supplies or 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.770
 loads of soldiers 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.540
 a point to stand out about the units 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.430
 is an impact percentage if it will be a 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.050
 case of offensive although we send to the 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.970
 attack a troop of soldiers just 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.070
 they can harm a group of tanks 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.720
 or superior forces even reaching the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.110
 point that our troops go wrong 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.110
 stops 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.900
 that is why there are units with different 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.880
 variations with which they can meet 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.520
 its function or cover the weaknesses of 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.140
 others for example antiaircraft tanks 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.000
 will be very effective against the forces 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.410
 enemies that are handled by air but 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.120
 they will hardly be useful when we are 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.310
 face to face against ground forces 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.870
 this is where we will have to decide how 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.430
 we will have our units by the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.049
 battlefield and observe the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.400
 movement and offensive of the enemies 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.129
 to reduce the least possible damage 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.840
 when they attack us we can see the 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.760
 distance they will travel and the reach 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.920
 clicking on any unit either 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.750
 friend or enemy 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.730
 another factor that should not escape us 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.410
 is the land which will grant us a 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.180
 better disposition when attacking or 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.880
 defend ourselves by marking the improvement of 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.770
 situation from one to five stars is 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.420
 more the territory is almost an objective 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.709
 vital to get the victory taking 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.390
 to appropriate buildings 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.590
 neutral or rivals so that in each 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.510
 turn our units can 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.690
 recover a little and get some 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.370
 advantage positioned forests mountains 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.140
 or being in our own city are 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.690
 Positive factors of attack and defense 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.550
 while on the other side of the rivers and 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.530
 other adverse factors will make us lose 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.450
 priority although in certain cases as 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.580
 well says the phrase the union does the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.870
 force with this we mean that if 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.640
 several infantry units have 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.230
 result wounds can manage to join 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.730
 each other as a single unit and 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.350
 recover the forms for a new 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.150
 attack even if it were the case that 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.620
 we lose units we can buy 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.090
 more every turn to not stay without 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.709
 army 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.569
 now is the time to talk about the 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.030
 commanders on the side of the forces 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.150
 of good the orange star we have 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.180
 andy and max sami with him and later 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.340
 we can count on other commanders 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.780
 these main characters are not of 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.060
 ornament since they fulfill a function 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.680
 additional special which is to employ a 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.900
 special power that will give us a great 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.489
 temporary advantage between these powers 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.859
 we have improvements in all 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.450
 units a super advance or increments 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.819
 of attack to inflict greater damage 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.230
 but yes, each commander has a 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.329
 skill and a disadvantage that does not 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.859
 we must neglect and above all cover 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.629
 against the effectiveness of our rival 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.579
 since artificial intelligence is 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.319
 something high and will not last a moment in 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.060
 seize any moment by tourist 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.240
 or dismissal to put the game to your 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.670
 favor 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.870
 as curious data advanced words is not 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.050
 the first title of this saga of 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.730
 nintendo since for the year 1998 in japan 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.420
 War conflicts can now be discussed 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.950
 in fame with words released for fam and with 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.230
 this title is not forgotten and has 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.550
 had its own recognition 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.350
 appearing as assistant trophy in 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.940
 super smash bros brawl where 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.770
 deploy the troops of ans bass words 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.310
 and you hear the famous red fame alert 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.310
 with words 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.710
 if you like playing strategy 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.930
 turns like fire emblem but set 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.310
 with a more warlike tone without any doubt 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.020
 You should stop by the academy of 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.820
 testament and become a general 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.410
 more to test yourself as a leader 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.410
 military in advanced words
