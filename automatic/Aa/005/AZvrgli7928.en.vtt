00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 ah 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.690
 very good because here is the binh that 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.880
 you asked me about the vallero in the 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.670
 direct and it is not so juvenile the truth 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.190
 is that it is already very big very big 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.750
 big the thing that is what I was saying 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.640
 yesterday is that I have not developed bar 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.849
 billion because it's still small for 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.400
 that I know if it's a co or is a street 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.230
 or that it is already ruled out that it is a 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.240
 sub a king or can be a song 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.150
 normal a letter his kite that the one of the 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.610
 long letters or can be a co and in the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.580
 case that I develop the var billions 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.340
 the little mustache notice that when I 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.960
 suit was afraid that this fish that 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.310
 is here that is the little one and the other 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.140
 I was there 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.600
 these are these two that are there now 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.820
 he was afraid that they could be 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.370
 eat the alevín because it was super small 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.960
 look since it is almost as big 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.630
 that those two fish 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.400
 so there you have the little one 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.060
 fry update on the day I do not 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.130
 agreement what but I put it here arribita 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.189
 and swim what I tell you has not 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.140
 developed no color I do not know how to do the 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.600
 reflection of the camera 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.870
 I do not know I love that weight 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.330
 the snails out there 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.510
 I do not know I do not know I do not know if it will be orange if 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.000
 it will be yellow if it will be if it will be sarasa 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.290
 these are red with white spots 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.880
 I hope that one day I have good 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.800
 developed some color because I do not think 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.510
 that stays like that because right now it's 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.420
 that does not have any color is not golden 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.570
 it's nothing it does not do one thing a little 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.470
 miss the pp look 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.700
 I was afraid that these fish would 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.910
 could eat 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.020
 the fry and they are practically the 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.600
 Same size 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.230
 so with this image of the alevín 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.410
 I leave you 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.940
 to see if you soon notice that they have 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.770
 practically the same size 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.100
 before he could fit in his mouth to see if 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.660
 soon that develops something a snail 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.080
 floating around 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.630
 the poor man with the horns and I was 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.280
 these are the planes bis the snails 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.140
 'red devils' this town would be 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.540
 delighted with a site and has let go 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.670
 Well, well, what I said, I leave you the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.370
 image of the fry that is not so 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.380
 alevín and a very small fish and see 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.420
 if one day develops colors or 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.610
 develop billions although I do not have 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.370
 no problem with it not being a co and 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.709
 simply that I would like to know what 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.500
 color is my fish so I guess 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.569
 will develop some color and will not stay 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.319
