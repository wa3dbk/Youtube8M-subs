00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.480
 our half-series and that is what I do 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.580
 this series with web youtube channels in 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.059
 the infobox is sinking and today i have 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.040
 Just a make-up and a show 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.890
 hairstyle I wear that but now 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.480
 not because they testify in the video 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.289
 I opened it and I have to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 in all, therefore, for me that without 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.789
 Hairstyle looks yes my make-up and that is 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.010
 a bit more so much 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.689
 not really tragic but me 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.719
 I thought I would do a little more 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.329
 and yes I have the feeling you 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.670
 a bit out and I'm not like that 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.140
 I 'm not happy because I can not 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.570
 make up so well, that's why I do too 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.950
 not so often make up to tomizawa 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.680

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.630
 otherwise there are more 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.630

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.890
 mainhattan taken that I also

 color on my whole mobile steve 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.620
 distributed 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.340
 then you take the second color and 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.030
 spread this on the outer half 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.030

 color taken and have on the outer 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.690
 half of mine is a stalemate what 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.940
 most of you are already determined 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.570
 is known and have the rest of the color 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.460
 I then blinded in the dearest then 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.740
 take a clean brush 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.210
 to blind everything again because I 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.940
 The feeling was that it was at least 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.170
 is strong and exactly the same I do 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.170
 then on the other side too 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.110

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.540
 patrice and I have a very 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.340
 pulled a thin line and that was one 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.920
 bit difficult for me to fill 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.790
 but I still have it like that 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.860
 Somehow I get mine 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.580

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.580

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:55.250
 then I have my rival 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.469

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.209
 Finally I have my mother from 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.310

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.049
 I do not spread everything to mine 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.170

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.030
 small swabs and the fairplay me then 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.820

 rosberg we come to the hairstyle and 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.610
 really nothing special 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.560
 but if I think such a caps then 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.170
