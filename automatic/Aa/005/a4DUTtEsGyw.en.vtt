00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 or the red girl if gm 2 loquillo and today 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.059
 I bring you the Samsung 840 evo is a disk 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.920
 solid state hard of half terabytes 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.019
 and good here what you see is what is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.730
 in the box with instructions that 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.800
 for a little more information the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.189
 black ssd I have it plugged in 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.949
 currently now from usb of the computer 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.529
 ok and well I'm going to apply something that stops 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.480
 many of you will be very simple but 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.150
 for many of you you do not have 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.980
 idea that this exists with which the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.260
 SSD comes with a program called 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.059
 samsung data migration what good 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.860
 first that we will have to do will be 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.200
 update it since it is very important 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.210
 update all this kind of programs 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.410
 to be able to do the operations 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.090
 relevant without any problem 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.730
 after updating it as you can see 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.410
 we get two images of SSD and HD 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.260
 that we have installed in our 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.750
 computer and we accept it so that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.489
 see us the capacity that we have used in 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.309
 the hard disk that we will have installed 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.760
 currently and the capacity that the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.130
 ssd as you can check the disk 1 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.020
 what is the top part would be the disk 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.320
 hard that I am currently using 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.500
 and the capacity that I have occupied and down 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.600
 we will have ls sd the space that I have 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.370
 ok so what are we going to do is going to be 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.670
 very simple with this program we are going to 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.610
 completely copy the hard drive that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.770
 I have the ssd installed to replace 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.590
 already directly by the s without need 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.180
 to format before starting the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.550
 cloning as you can see it does not jump a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.710
 warning message and recommends us 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.110
 that we close all the programs for 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.100
 that can be cloned to the ss of any 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.170
 type of problem is worth so good 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.930
 we closed the skype we closed all these 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.510
 programs that we have open before 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.040
 start and we'll give you that if you 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.040
 we would give the go-ahead 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.350
 and now, well, now we would not touch 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:07.830
 the computer and little by little we would 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.869
 copying our ssd I will put it like this 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.790
 a little bit to fast camera and such for 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.060
 that you see a little how it is copied and with 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.989
 power for good takes a little bit is the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.870
 true copying the scd but good more or 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.730
 the process lasts less than an hour and 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.190
 media to all that depends on the data 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.110
 we have not because it's not the same 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.410
 copy three gigs of data to copy 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.350
 for example 200 gb of data in this case 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.760
 I think that it would fit almost 300 gigabytes 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:41.550
 something like that but let's take an hour and a half 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.620
 40 minutes like this or so but that 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.530
 you see that it is very very very very very simple 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.720
 make the copy 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.370
 and already good with this people do not even 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.380
 they buy it for having to format or 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.050
 nothing that already but directly the cope already 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.940
 directly happens to him the 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.130
 hard disk they had so after 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.130
 you work any kind of problem here 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.800
 you can see the results that this 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.970
 ssd because they still will not give theirs and 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.180
 good as you can see reading 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.030
 sequential of 542 megabytes per second of 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.680
 sequential writing are 526 megs per 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.390
 second 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:19.010
 operations per second in reading 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:23.930
 random are 94 thousand 913 and writing 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.209
 random are 85 thousand 871 are also 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.670
 operations per second on request me 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.110
 peixe so we see the guys this has 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.670
 been everything I hope you liked to give 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.670
 Favorite wife and see you soon
