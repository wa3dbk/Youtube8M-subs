how<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.899> kids<00:00:37.200> excited<00:00:37.350> about<00:00:37.739> Math

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
how do you get kids excited about Math

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.700 
how do you get kids excited about Math
our<00:00:39.030> program<00:00:39.450> works<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.110> words<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
our program works with the words and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.770 
our program works with the words and
terminology<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.399> kids<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.270> math<00:00:42.480> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
terminology that kids here in math and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.319 
terminology that kids here in math and
there<00:00:43.680> are<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.040> many<00:00:44.160> words<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.760> math<00:00:45.120> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
there are so many words in math that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.270 
there are so many words in math that
kids<00:00:45.600> come<00:00:45.780> across<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:46.860> actually

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
kids come across that they actually

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.190 
kids come across that they actually
struggle<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.149> where<00:00:48.420> parents<00:00:48.840> could<00:00:49.020> help

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
struggle with where parents could help

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
struggle with where parents could help
them<00:00:49.410> at<00:00:49.739> home<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.340> we're<00:00:51.149> going<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> go

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
them at home so we're going to go

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.510 
them at home so we're going to go
through<00:00:51.449> some<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.809> those<00:00:51.989> today<00:00:52.399> we're<00:00:53.399> going

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
through some of those today we're going

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.090 
through some of those today we're going
to<00:00:53.640> start<00:00:53.820> talking<00:00:54.120> about<00:00:54.270> shapes<00:00:54.570> and

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
to start talking about shapes and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.709 
to start talking about shapes and
sometimes<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.489> word<00:00:56.670> congruent<00:00:57.360> will<00:00:57.539> come

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
sometimes the word congruent will come

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.189 
sometimes the word congruent will come
up<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.859> are<00:00:58.949> many<00:00:59.010> activities<00:00:59.879> that

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
up and there are many activities that

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.209 
up and there are many activities that
parents<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.530> with<00:01:01.649> their<00:01:01.770> kids<00:01:01.949> at<00:01:02.070> home

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
parents can do with their kids at home

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.700 
parents can do with their kids at home
to<00:01:02.640> talk<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.120> them<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.510> plug<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:03.899> word<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to talk with them and plug that word in

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.590 
to talk with them and plug that word in
so<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.640> become<00:01:06.000> more<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.479> more

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
so they can become more and more

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.990 
so they can become more and more
comfortable<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> terms<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.340> home<00:01:08.610> so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
comfortable with the terms at home so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760 
comfortable with the terms at home so
when<00:01:09.150> they<00:01:09.270> come<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.600> school<00:01:09.720> math<00:01:10.260> becomes<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
when they come to school math becomes a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.700 
when they come to school math becomes a
breeze<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.720> congruent<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.900> just<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.530> same

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
breeze so congruent is just the same

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.010 
breeze so congruent is just the same
shape<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.369> same<00:01:14.580> size<00:01:14.850> all<00:01:15.479> right<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
shape the same size all right the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.480 
shape the same size all right the
parents<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> parents<00:01:16.890> don't<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> be

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
parents so the parents don't have to be

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.460 
parents so the parents don't have to be
methyl<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.880> themselves<00:01:18.600> absolutely<00:01:18.720> not<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
methyl is themselves absolutely not and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.840 
methyl is themselves absolutely not and
if<00:01:19.590> they<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.920> our<00:01:20.009> website<00:01:20.310> which<00:01:20.820> is

involved<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.460> we're<00:01:38.729> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.030> say<00:01:39.470> congruent

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
involved so we're going to say congruent

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.749 
involved so we're going to say congruent
means<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.130> then<00:01:41.280> you're<00:01:41.400> going<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.610> make<00:01:41.700> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
means and then you're going to make a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.600 
means and then you're going to make a
triangle<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.570> say<00:01:42.780> same<00:01:43.200> shape<00:01:43.530> same<00:01:43.560> size<00:01:44.220> are

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
triangle we say same shape same size are

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.030 
triangle we say same shape same size are
you<00:01:44.729> ready<00:01:44.909> okay<00:01:45.360> could<00:01:45.810> agree<00:01:46.049> with<00:01:46.439> me<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.340 
you ready okay could agree with me and
same<00:01:47.340> shape<00:01:47.700> change<00:01:48.119> side<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.229> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
same shape change side and then at the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.410 
same shape change side and then at the
end<00:01:49.380> you're<00:01:49.619> gonna<00:01:49.680> say<00:01:49.950> rotations<00:01:50.640> okay<00:01:51.180> you

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
end you're gonna say rotations okay you

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.960 
end you're gonna say rotations okay you
guys<00:01:51.630> ready

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970

tations okay you guys all right but moms
at<00:01:55.850> home<00:01:56.000> put<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.300> laundry<00:01:56.480> down<00:01:56.780> just<00:01:57.050> a

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
at home put the laundry down just a

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.120 
at home put the laundry down just a
quick<00:01:57.320> second<00:01:57.680> we're<00:01:57.770> going<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.950> try<00:01:58.070> it

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
quick second we're going to try it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.000 
quick second we're going to try it
together<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.700> goes<00:01:58.910> like<00:01:59.090> this<00:01:59.710> congruent<00:02:00.710> the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
together it goes like this congruent the

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.190 
together it goes like this congruent the
same<00:02:01.430> shapes<00:02:01.880> and<00:02:02.330> sizes<00:02:03.700> okay<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.760> guys<00:02:05.360> so

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
same shapes and sizes okay you guys so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.999 
same shapes and sizes okay you guys so
basic<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:07.690> basically<00:02:08.690> on<00:02:08.990> a<00:02:09.020> test<00:02:09.380> kids<00:02:09.770> could

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
basic you basically on a test kids could

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.520 
basic you basically on a test kids could
see<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.880> like<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.270> rhombus<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:11.930> rhombus<00:02:12.290> and

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
see to like a rhombus and a rhombus and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.860 
see to like a rhombus and a rhombus and
then<00:02:12.860> one<00:02:13.130> could<00:02:13.340> be<00:02:13.490> turned<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.540> tricks

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
then one could be turned and that tricks

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.750 
then one could be turned and that tricks
kids<00:02:15.200> they'll<00:02:15.530> say<00:02:15.710> is<00:02:15.770> is<00:02:15.980> congruent<00:02:16.400> and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
kids they'll say is is congruent and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.090 
kids they'll say is is congruent and
kids<00:02:16.970> will<00:02:17.090> say<00:02:17.240> no<00:02:17.480> when<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:17.990> actuality<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.860> is

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
kids will say no when in actuality it is

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.430 
kids will say no when in actuality it is
congruent<00:02:19.630> parents<00:02:20.630> are<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:20.930> many<00:02:21.140> things<00:02:21.350> you

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
congruent parents are so many things you

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.050 
congruent parents are so many things you
can<00:02:21.590> do<00:02:21.710> at<00:02:21.830> home<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.280> can<00:02:22.310> when<00:02:22.910> you're

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
can do at home you can when you're

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.360 
can do at home you can when you're
getting<00:02:23.420> plates<00:02:24.350> out<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.710> dishwasher<00:02:24.860> you

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
getting plates out of the dishwasher you

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.160 
getting plates out of the dishwasher you
can<00:02:25.550> say<00:02:25.730> all<00:02:26.150> right<00:02:26.330> witchblade<00:02:27.020> is

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
can say all right witchblade is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.080 
can say all right witchblade is
congruent<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.770> this<00:02:27.860> one<00:02:28.190> and<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.520> plug<00:02:28.880> the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
congruent to this one and just plug the

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.760 
congruent to this one and just plug the
word<00:02:29.270> congruent<00:02:29.930> in<00:02:30.050> for<00:02:30.290> same<00:02:30.500> shape<00:02:30.740> same

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
word congruent in for same shape same

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.530 
word congruent in for same shape same
size<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.520> then<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.730> kids<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.090> point<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
size and then the kids can point to the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.480 
size and then the kids can point to the
other<00:02:32.630> plate<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.709> it's<00:02:33.860> almost<00:02:34.100> like<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.459> have

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
other plate so it's almost like you have

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.240 
other plate so it's almost like you have
to<00:02:34.790> try<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.390> turn<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:36.110> everyday<00:02:36.620> things<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
to try and turn the everyday things the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.310 
to try and turn the everyday things the
chores<00:02:37.550> that<00:02:37.700> parents<00:02:38.240> have<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.480> do<00:02:38.630> into

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
chores that parents have to do into

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.290 
chores that parents have to do into
almost<00:02:39.680> not<00:02:40.220> only<00:02:40.490> are<00:02:40.640> we<00:02:40.670> doing<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.120> dishes

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
almost not only are we doing the dishes

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.880 
almost not only are we doing the dishes
but<00:02:41.600> we're<00:02:42.050> keeping<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.440> kids<00:02:42.620> kind<00:02:42.830> of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
but we're keeping the kids kind of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.199 
but we're keeping the kids kind of
focused<00:02:43.220> in<00:02:43.340> their<00:02:43.430> brains<00:02:43.700> activate

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
focused in their brains activate

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.900 
focused in their brains activate
absolutely<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.380> dump<00:02:45.680> out<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:45.860> Legos<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.640> say

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
absolutely so dump out the Legos and say

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.600 
absolutely so dump out the Legos and say
can<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:47.540> find<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.959> congruent<00:02:48.650> lego<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:49.280> this

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
can you find a congruent lego to this

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.980 
can you find a congruent lego to this
one<00:02:49.820> you<00:02:49.970> know<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.270> match<00:02:50.450> them<00:02:50.600> up<00:02:50.750> now<00:02:50.930> the
