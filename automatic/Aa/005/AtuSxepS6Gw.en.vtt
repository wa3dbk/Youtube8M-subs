00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.470 
their hair so what she wants you to do
basically<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.920> just<00:02:11.280> write<00:02:11.819> down<00:02:12.120> things

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
basically is just write down things

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.360 
basically is just write down things
about<00:02:12.870> your<00:02:13.110> hair<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.709> say<00:02:13.890> like<00:02:14.099> how<00:02:14.250> it

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
feels like what you're you know how it

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.740 
feels like what you're you know how it
feels<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:17.819> part<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.150> your<00:02:18.239> hair<00:02:18.480> in<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
feels in this part of your hair in the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.610 
feels in this part of your hair in the
back<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.349> front<00:02:19.380> take<00:02:20.250> photos<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.750> all

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
back the front take photos of it and all

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.470 
back the front take photos of it and all
that<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.069> think<00:02:23.099> that<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.940> really

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that and I think that that is really

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.690 
that and I think that that is really
important<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.560> definitely<00:02:26.130> think<00:02:26.520> that

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
important and I definitely think that

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.240 
important and I definitely think that
people<00:02:27.239> should<00:02:27.270> do<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.750> then<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.920> step

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
people should do that then and step

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.309 
people should do that then and step
three<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:30.000> says<00:02:30.180> understanding<00:02:30.959> product

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
three it says understanding product

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.900 
three it says understanding product
ingredients<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.860> formulation<00:02:32.459> so<00:02:32.640> what<00:02:32.790> she

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
ingredients in formulation so what she

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.000 
ingredients in formulation so what she
does<00:02:32.940> if<00:02:33.360> she<00:02:33.420> goes<00:02:33.870> over<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.530> different

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
does if she goes over the different

foaming and cleansing and shampoo versus
conditioning<00:02:45.470> ingredients<00:02:46.470> in

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
I've been saying m and it doesn't you

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.350 
I've been saying m and it doesn't you
know<00:02:57.930> actually<00:02:58.860> penetrate<00:02:59.700> your<00:02:59.850> hair<00:03:00.120> they

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
know actually penetrate your hair they

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.350 
know actually penetrate your hair they
kind<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.780> form<00:03:01.019> like<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> film<00:03:01.760> while<00:03:02.760> shampoo

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
kind of form like a film while shampoo

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.270 
kind of form like a film while shampoo
is<00:03:03.660> taking<00:03:04.170> away<00:03:04.410> something<00:03:04.680> that's<00:03:04.830> another

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
is taking away something that's another

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.280 
is taking away something that's another
reason<00:03:05.489> why<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.910> don't<00:03:06.330> understand<00:03:06.959> how<00:03:07.230> you

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
reason why I don't understand how you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.780 
reason why I don't understand how you
can<00:03:07.470> have<00:03:07.739> something<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.310> supposed<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.730> be

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
can have something that supposed to be

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.300 
can have something that supposed to be
cleansing<00:03:09.330> and<00:03:09.569> it<00:03:10.019> contains<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.739> silicone

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
cleansing and it contains a silicone

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.810 
cleansing and it contains a silicone
because<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.760> silicone<00:03:13.220> stays<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.459> your<00:03:14.489> hair

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
because the silicone stays on your hair

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.120 
because the silicone stays on your hair
so<00:03:15.090> you're<00:03:15.390> not<00:03:15.540> fully<00:03:16.109> cleansing<00:03:16.769> your<00:03:16.890> hair

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
so you're not fully cleansing your hair

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.620 
so you're not fully cleansing your hair
if<00:03:17.280> you're<00:03:17.459> using<00:03:17.670> something<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.180> silicones

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
if you're using something the silicones

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.110 
if you're using something the silicones
it's<00:03:18.810> something<00:03:19.109> I<00:03:19.140> don't<00:03:19.290> really<00:03:19.380> get<00:03:19.590> um<00:03:20.120> so

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
it's something I don't really get um so

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.759 
it's something I don't really get um so
yeah<00:03:21.239> she<00:03:21.480> really<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:21.870> goes<00:03:22.079> over<00:03:22.350> all<00:03:22.620> of

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
yeah she really just goes over all of

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.110 
yeah she really just goes over all of
these<00:03:22.890> thickeners<00:03:25.670> preservatives<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.910> think

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
these thickeners preservatives I think

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.699 
these thickeners preservatives I think
that<00:03:27.329> that's<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:28.079> good<00:03:28.260> one<00:03:28.470> because

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
that that's a good one because

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.800 
that that's a good one because
preservatives<00:03:29.549> on<00:03:29.730> some<00:03:30.000> of<00:03:30.060> those<00:03:30.120> longings

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
preservatives on some of those longings

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.990 
preservatives on some of those longings
that<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.590> don't<00:03:31.709> know<00:03:31.890> how<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.070> pronounce<00:03:32.220> and

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
that we don't know how to pronounce and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.490 
that we don't know how to pronounce and
sometimes<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.720> just<00:03:33.930> don't<00:03:34.049> feel<00:03:34.440> like

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
sometimes you just don't feel like

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.650 
sometimes you just don't feel like
googling<00:03:35.130> it<00:03:35.370> all<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.640> time<00:03:35.700> like<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.600> feel

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.770 
Google all the time so I think that's
really<00:03:49.980> good<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.910> if<00:03:51.060> she<00:03:51.209> really<00:03:51.359> just<00:03:51.569> goes

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
really good so if she really just goes

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.090 
really good so if she really just goes
over<00:03:51.989> all<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.350> different<00:03:52.709> kinds<00:03:52.859> of

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
over all the different kinds of

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.059 
over all the different kinds of
ingredients<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:54.120> then<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.930> end<00:03:55.170> basically

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
ingredients and then the end basically

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.520 
ingredients and then the end basically
you<00:03:56.670> apply<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.299> then<00:03:57.569> maybe<00:03:57.780> that's<00:03:58.230> where<00:03:58.440> we

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
you apply and then maybe that's where we

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.320 
you apply and then maybe that's where we
have<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.799> cheat

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
have the cheat

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.270 
have the cheat
look<00:03:59.930> at<00:03:59.990> it<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.290> always<00:04:00.530> get<00:04:00.800> questions

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
look at it and I always get questions

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.550 
look at it and I always get questions
like<00:04:01.370> L<00:04:01.700> how<00:04:02.390> do<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.600> know<00:04:02.660> that<00:04:02.810> this<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.440> the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
silicone like usually it says Conan in

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.710 
silicone like usually it says Conan in
but<00:04:06.470> there<00:04:06.620> are<00:04:06.680> some<00:04:06.830> tricky<00:04:07.370> ones<00:04:07.550> so<00:04:07.880> it<00:04:08.480> has

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
but there are some tricky ones so it has

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.100 
but there are some tricky ones so it has
you<00:04:09.140> know<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.800> if<00:04:10.100> you<00:04:10.180> see<00:04:11.180> like<00:04:11.720> kind<00:04:11.990> of

issues<00:04:16.760> all<00:04:17.299> in<00:04:17.810> here<00:04:18.109> so<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.410> can<00:04:18.620> just<00:04:18.650> look

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
issues all in here so you can just look

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.220 
issues all in here so you can just look
this<00:04:19.160> up<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:20.120> kind<00:04:20.390> of<00:04:20.450> gives<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.810> some

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.050 
keywords to look for when you're looking
at<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.320> ingredients<00:04:24.530> list<00:04:24.920> of<00:04:25.400> your<00:04:25.550> products

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
at the ingredients list of your products

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.500 
at the ingredients list of your products
I<00:04:26.300> think<00:04:27.260> that's<00:04:27.380> really<00:04:27.620> great<00:04:27.920> um<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.880> won't

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
I think that's really great um I won't

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.790 
I think that's really great um I won't
say<00:04:29.840> that<00:04:29.870> this<00:04:30.350> is<00:04:30.410> not<00:04:30.700> an<00:04:31.700> easy<00:04:32.390> and<00:04:32.900> or<00:04:33.320> fun

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
say that this is not an easy and or fun

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.970 
say that this is not an easy and or fun
read<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.400> think<00:04:35.000> that<00:04:35.030> ingredients<00:04:35.980> basically

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
read I think that ingredients basically

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.580 
read I think that ingredients basically
are<00:04:37.100> boring<00:04:37.640> um<00:04:37.910> but<00:04:38.720> I<00:04:38.780> do<00:04:38.930> think<00:04:39.290> it's<00:04:39.470> a

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
are boring um but I do think it's a

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.400 
are boring um but I do think it's a
necessity<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.700> know<00:04:41.540> what's<00:04:41.990> going<00:04:42.080> in<00:04:42.380> your

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
necessity to know what's going in your

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.340 
necessity to know what's going in your
hair<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.040> if<00:04:43.430> you<00:04:43.940> just<00:04:44.180> want<00:04:44.330> like<00:04:44.390> a<00:04:44.450> fun<00:04:44.870> like

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
hair so if you just want like a fun like

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.950 
hair so if you just want like a fun like
light-hearted<00:04:45.860> like<00:04:46.580> an<00:04:46.790> entire<00:04:47.330> book<00:04:47.660> this

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
light-hearted like an entire book this

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.860 
light-hearted like an entire book this
probably<00:04:48.410> isn't<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.830> but<00:04:49.430> it<00:04:49.760> definitely<00:04:50.270> is

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
probably isn't it but it definitely is

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.120 
probably isn't it but it definitely is
helpful<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:51.440> I'm<00:04:51.500> definitely<00:04:51.710> gonna<00:04:51.920> keep

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
helpful and I'm definitely gonna keep

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.460 
helpful and I'm definitely gonna keep
this<00:04:52.280> as<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.550> resource<00:04:52.880> on<00:04:53.120> my<00:04:53.180> shelf<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.020> only

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
this as a resource on my shelf the only

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.170 
this as a resource on my shelf the only
thing<00:04:54.710> I've<00:04:54.860> not<00:04:55.190> like<00:04:55.370> about<00:04:55.610> this<00:04:55.730> book<00:04:55.940> was

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
thing I've not like about this book was

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.070 
thing I've not like about this book was
her<00:04:56.480> view<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:57.220> sodium<00:04:58.220> hydroxide<00:04:58.970> because<00:04:59.900> she

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
her view of sodium hydroxide because she

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.210 
her view of sodium hydroxide because she
said<00:05:00.320> that<00:05:00.640> basically<00:05:01.640> in<00:05:02.330> order<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:03.230> have<00:05:04.010> to

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
said that basically in order to have to

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.000 
said that basically in order to have to
list<00:05:04.520> something<00:05:05.300> in<00:05:05.690> a<00:05:05.780> product<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.710> have<00:05:06.890> to

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
list something in a product and have to

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.920 
list something in a product and have to
have<00:05:07.100> at<00:05:07.250> least<00:05:07.280> one<00:05:07.490> percent<00:05:08.000> of<00:05:08.060> it<00:05:08.180> so<00:05:08.870> she

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
have at least one percent of it so she

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.380 
have at least one percent of it so she
said<00:05:09.500> if<00:05:09.770> they'll<00:05:09.950> is<00:05:10.160> sodium<00:05:10.520> hydroxide<00:05:11.180> and

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
said if they'll is sodium hydroxide and

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.900 
said if they'll is sodium hydroxide and
that<00:05:11.510> means<00:05:12.050> it's<00:05:12.350> at<00:05:12.500> least<00:05:12.740> one<00:05:13.100> percent<00:05:13.640> of

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
that means it's at least one percent of

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.900 
that means it's at least one percent of
the<00:05:14.690> formulation<00:05:15.470> which<00:05:15.740> is<00:05:15.890> true<00:05:16.190> but<00:05:16.220> then

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
the formulation which is true but then

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.200 
the formulation which is true but then
she's<00:05:17.150> like<00:05:17.300> well<00:05:17.990> you<00:05:18.950> know<00:05:19.100> that<00:05:19.130> does<00:05:19.940> have

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
she's like well you know that does have

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.420 
she's like well you know that does have
the<00:05:20.330> potential<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.840> relax<00:05:21.290> your<00:05:21.470> hair<00:05:21.740> when<00:05:22.280> in

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
the potential to relax your hair when in

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.020 
the potential to relax your hair when in
fact<00:05:22.640> sodium<00:05:23.570> hydroxide<00:05:24.140> alone<00:05:24.650> is<00:05:25.160> it<00:05:25.700> really

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
fact sodium hydroxide alone is it really

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.909 
fact sodium hydroxide alone is it really
what<00:05:26.480> relaxes<00:05:27.110> your<00:05:27.260> hair<00:05:27.530> it's<00:05:27.740> the

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
what relaxes your hair it's the

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.130 
what relaxes your hair it's the
formulation<00:05:28.610> of<00:05:28.700> the<00:05:28.760> relaxer<00:05:29.510> is<00:05:29.540> the

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
formulation of the relaxer is the

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.830 
formulation of the relaxer is the
smoothing<00:05:30.590> technique<00:05:31.130> that<00:05:31.790> you're<00:05:32.330> doing

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
smoothing technique that you're doing

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.530 
smoothing technique that you're doing
what<00:05:33.080> you're<00:05:33.169> doing<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.500> relax<00:05:33.770> are<00:05:33.919> a<00:05:33.950> high

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.540 
what you're doing the relax are a high

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.650 
what you're doing the relax are a high
alkaline<00:05:35.560> alone<00:05:36.560> is<00:05:37.100> not<00:05:37.310> going<00:05:37.370> to<00:05:37.790> relax

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
alkaline alone is not going to relax

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.930 
alkaline alone is not going to relax
your<00:05:38.900> hair<00:05:39.140> I<00:05:39.169> think<00:05:39.470> a<00:05:39.530> lot<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:39.740> people

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
your hair I think a lot of people

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.400 
your hair I think a lot of people
misinterpret<00:05:40.940> that<00:05:41.510> like<00:05:41.750> if<00:05:41.870> I<00:05:41.990> put<00:05:42.169> straight

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
misinterpret that like if I put straight

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.790 
misinterpret that like if I put straight
sodium<00:05:42.890> hydroxide<00:05:43.430> on<00:05:43.580> my<00:05:43.729> hair<00:05:43.940> I<00:05:44.120> definitely

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
sodium hydroxide on my hair I definitely

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.200 
sodium hydroxide on my hair I definitely
my<00:05:45.800> hair<00:05:45.950> probably<00:05:46.190> just<00:05:46.400> melt<00:05:46.640> like<00:05:46.880> it<00:05:47.030> would
