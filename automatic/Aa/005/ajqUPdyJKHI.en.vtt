00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.780
 this segment are all very similar is 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.000
 it's more about personal service and 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.070
 individual and there one can excel 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.200

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.090
 better than the internet and he was absolutely right 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.220
