00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.759
 hello how are you welcome to info clean 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.560
 water we arrived at the long-awaited end of 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.240
 week that will be characterized by 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.970
 present field conditions 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.460
 unstable hot from the environment like 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.529
 so also something humid in the republic 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.810
 Argentina why do I say this because 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.880
 we have a weak cold frontal system 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.250
 entering through the south of the region 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.080
 pampeana that towards Sunday is going 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.329
 to enter much of the area 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.610
 central of our country producing its 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.399
 step increased again rusty as well 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.710
 also areas of instability against 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.719
 temperatures still remain with 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.550
 few changes but attention that in the 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.559
 northwest of our country we will have a 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.570
 important activity in terms of rainfall 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.730
 because some strong ones are expected 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.070
 storms especially for the day 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.690
 Sunday is now and let's see how the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.850
 time in different regions of the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.430
 Argentine Republic starting as 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.860
 always on the north coast and the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.860
 that will keep partially cloudy 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.750
 and more that are going to haunt the 18 19 and 20 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.910
 degrees and maxims that way the afternoon 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.350
 would reach 31 32 and 33 degrees towards 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.200
 the south of the littoral and in the province of 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.390
 CÃ³rdoba continues the stable time with 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.190
 increase in cloudiness or as I said 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.500
 especially in cordoba for the day 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.300
 Sunday where some are not ruled out 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.310
 rains and showers with minimum 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.479
 between 10 and 7 degrees and maximum 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.100
 will reach 28 and 29 during the afternoons 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.950
 meanwhile in Buenos Aires and what 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.810
 variable cloudiness and increase in 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.880
 same as they were saying 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.500
 product of the displacement of a 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.440
 weak cold frontal system that is going to 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.520
 leave some areas of instability 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.220
 temperatures with few changes that 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.430
 they will maintain between 23 and 16 degrees and 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.030
 maximum that will reach 22 25 and 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.590
 up to 28 degrees in the region of which the 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.979
 Weather remains stable with cloudiness 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.520
 minimum variable between 17 and 15 degrees and 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.950
 maximum that will reach 27 28 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.349
 29 degrees for the province from San 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.060
 john and now if we go to the 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.400
 northwest of our country where you have to 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.690
 pay attention because as it comes 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.870
 advancing an important one is expected 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.730
 activity with abundant water fall in 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.959
 few periods of time some 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.170
 storms that may be locally 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.930
 intense especially in jujuy and jumps 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.910
 as well as in the north of santiago 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.610
 of the estuary especially for the day 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.459
 Sunday with minimums to be around 15 and 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.260
 20 degrees and maximums during the afternoon 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.720
 will reach as you can see the 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.280
 28 32 and up to 35 degrees in the south of 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.989
 our country meanwhile the time 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.700
 continues variable and you have to pay 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.650
 attention also because it will be 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.230
 entering a new cold frontal system 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.209
 that is going to be on its way down and the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.099
 meanwhile temperatures from the 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.860
 center towards the north if I partially 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.799
 Cloudy minimum between four days 30 and 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.579
 16 degrees and maximum that will reach 19 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.590
 22 and 28 degrees and finally at the point 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.209
 more showed from our country I do not know 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.450
 there were blackouts during the end of 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:17.380
 week with minimums between 45 and 6 degrees and 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.319
 maximum that will reach 14 16 and 17 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.510
