00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.640
 what can you say about your preparation 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.009
 it is a blessing very hard i suppose 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.939
 preparation was as usual 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.939
 not every fight that seriously 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:16.909
 he is nothing new 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.539
 the training was stable with two 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.150
 half month 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.450
 now all invincible boxer 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.540
 and which duel was difficult as the head 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.960
 do you think that the opponent is more difficult 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.250
 head skc circuit with whom you are already date 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.810
 Japan and whether now Alexander Pak 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.810
 process 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.719
 best exaggeration rf 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.219
 I will say that all the same Enzo Maccarinelli was 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:44.830
 such an experienced rival 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.670
 but at the same time of course 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.490
 do not discount anything else and 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.720
 what Alekseev can do 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.200
 m for Sasha fight will continue amp 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.430
 full full distance I remind 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.270
 distances 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.740
 for the industry will see 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.040
 so 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.630
 no comments for comments 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.930
 nothing 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.820
 I recall that in my own restaurant 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.140
 becoming the best 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.159
 according to estimates of Russia for August, the third search and 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.510
 impotence fifth 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.740
 and remember that Alexei percent 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.610
 said you don't deserve the light so 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.410
 us for this title 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.320
 project very long position 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.010
 touch that field to prove that you are 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.010
 however deserves it 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.380
 but I will not prove anything 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.980
 i just want to win this fight 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.440
 and people will say themselves 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.670
 what it sees fit 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.230
 and if you win Alexey Ivanov tomorrow 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.140
 how do you think when 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.930
 m and can be in fact difficult possible to 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.930
 Sam's duel deep 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.250
 this question I can not answer this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.320
 rather a question of your managers 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.920
 Vladimir Khryunov 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.330
 think that after this field there will be 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.430
 opportunity to 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.560
 with someone else a percentage to point at 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.660
 power and immediately it will be a fight said 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.049
 dog hook 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.819
 but I would like of course 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.729
 maybe right away 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.399
 hold a fight with a hook 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.189
 the sequence is determined through a certain 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.819
 time 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.489
 and then how come 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.829

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.829
 participation in the super six tournament 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:29.619

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:32.829
 you also have an imitation of you all 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.269

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.580

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.399

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.609
 to the side 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.609
