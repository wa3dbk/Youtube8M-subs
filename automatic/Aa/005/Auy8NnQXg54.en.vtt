probably<00:01:16.250> know<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:18.420> idea<00:01:18.659> ok<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:19.680> that's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
probably know the idea ok so that's

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.690 
probably know the idea ok so that's
looking<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.400> right<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.470> simple

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
looking all right for just the simple

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.010 
looking all right for just the simple
basic<00:01:23.700> run<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.450> maybe<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
basic run then you can maybe go to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.510 
basic run then you can maybe go to
gradient<00:01:25.920> overlay<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.210> click

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
gradient overlay and you can just click

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.249 
gradient overlay and you can just click
maybe<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> white<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.020> greater

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
maybe like like a white and a greater

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.780 
maybe like like a white and a greater
grazed<00:01:34.740> give<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> bit<00:01:35.720> contrast<00:01:37.340> then<00:01:38.340> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
grazed give it a bit contrast then you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.050 
grazed give it a bit contrast then you
can<00:01:39.409> might<00:01:40.409> have<00:01:40.560> got<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> basic<00:01:41.400> text<00:01:41.939> you

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
can might have got the basic text you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
can might have got the basic text you
can<00:01:42.240> make<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> new<00:01:42.750> layer<00:01:42.899> by<00:01:43.110> clicking<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.439> new

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
can make a new layer by clicking a new

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.370 
can make a new layer by clicking a new
layer<00:01:43.740> icon<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.880> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> go<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
layer icon then you want to go to the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.929 
layer icon then you want to go to the
shapes<00:01:46.770> thing<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.549> might<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.850> on

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
shapes thing and you might be on

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.700 
shapes thing and you might be on
rectangle<00:01:48.509> n<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.750> them<00:01:48.899> click<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.350> hold<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
rectangle n with them click and hold and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.219 
rectangle n with them click and hold and
go<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.250> line<00:01:50.460> tool<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:51.450> up<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:51.720> change

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
go to the line tool then up here change

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.370 
go to the line tool then up here change
the<00:01:52.409> weight<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:54.270> then<00:01:54.840> when<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.259> got

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the weight to one and then when you got

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.770 
the weight to one and then when you got
that<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.680> want<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.939> draw<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> line<00:01:57.180> hold<00:01:57.479> shift

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that you want to draw a line hold shift

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.350 
that you want to draw a line hold shift
so<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.140> goes<00:01:58.290> straighten<00:01:58.799> doesn't<00:01:59.310> go<00:01:59.460> an

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
so it goes straighten doesn't go an

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.709 
so it goes straighten doesn't go an
angle<00:02:00.899> maybe<00:02:01.649> creature<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.479> ok<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
angle maybe creature like that ok and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.039 
angle maybe creature like that ok and
then<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.960> can<00:02:04.079> double-click<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:05.040> go<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:06.049> layer

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
then you can double-click it go to layer

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.499 
then you can double-click it go to layer
starts<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.770> color<00:02:08.009> overlay<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.670> change<00:02:09.330> it

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
starts go to color overlay and change it

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.170 
starts go to color overlay and change it
to<00:02:09.539> white<00:02:11.239> tell<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.300> one

okay then if i click that maybe just

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.910 
okay then if i click that maybe just
place<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.780> up<00:02:17.079> further<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.769> bit<00:02:17.890> up<00:02:18.129> a<00:02:18.280> bit<00:02:18.459> then

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
place it up further a bit up a bit then

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.940 
place it up further a bit up a bit then
you<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.099> change<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.879> blending<00:02:22.510> mode<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.950> soft

you can change the blending mode to soft
light<00:02:24.159> and<00:02:27.870> maybe<00:02:28.870> just<00:02:28.989> lower<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.500> opacity

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
light and maybe just lower the opacity

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:41.220 
light and maybe just lower the opacity

those lines that you actually see it in

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.159 
those lines that you actually see it in
the<00:03:22.359> picture<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.760> see<00:03:24.940> there<00:03:25.120> those<00:03:25.329> like

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.169 
the picture you see there those like

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.369 
the picture you see there those like
little<00:03:26.349> streaks<00:03:26.769> going<00:03:26.889> across<00:03:27.689> to<00:03:28.689> make<00:03:29.229> them

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
little streaks going across to make them

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.740 
little streaks going across to make them
all<00:03:29.500> uneven<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.189> everything<00:03:30.579> maybe<00:03:31.239> do<00:03:31.510> play

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
all uneven and everything maybe do play

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.649 
all uneven and everything maybe do play
the<00:03:31.930> first<00:03:32.229> one<00:03:32.560> continue<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.639> and<00:03:33.819> go<00:03:33.970> up<00:03:34.239> up

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
the first one continue that and go up up

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.240 
the first one continue that and go up up
up<00:03:36.299> there<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.389> go<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:38.470> maybe<00:03:38.680> make<00:03:38.889> them<00:03:38.949> bit

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
up there you go to maybe make them bit

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.699 
up there you go to maybe make them bit
better<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.329> more<00:03:40.479> obscure<00:03:40.989> go<00:03:41.229> to<00:03:41.290> edit

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
better and more obscure go to edit

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.689 
better and more obscure go to edit
transform<00:03:42.099> scale<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:44.319> just<00:03:45.040> adjust<00:03:45.609> the

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
transform scale and just adjust the

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.509 
transform scale and just adjust the
scale<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.299> they're<00:03:46.449> not<00:03:46.540> all<00:03:46.659> the<00:03:46.689> same<00:03:46.870> but

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
scale so they're not all the same but

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.069 
scale so they're not all the same but
not<00:03:48.519> under<00:03:48.790> them<00:03:49.000> for<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:49.449> because<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.989> will

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
not under them for this because it will

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.819 
not under them for this because it will
be<00:03:50.169> just<00:03:50.349> too<00:03:50.590> time-consuming<00:03:50.859> really<00:03:52.829> okay

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
be just too time-consuming really okay

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.099 
be just too time-consuming really okay
so<00:03:53.889> greatly<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.609> this<00:03:54.849> or<00:03:55.120> basic<00:03:55.569> text<00:03:55.930> there

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
so greatly of this or basic text there

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.289 
so greatly of this or basic text there
and<00:03:56.889> then<00:03:57.009> you<00:03:57.099> wanna<00:03:57.250> go<00:03:57.370> make<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.579> to<00:03:57.909> just

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
and then you wanna go make the to just

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:01.189 
and then you wanna go make the to just
make<00:03:58.449> a<00:03:58.479> new<00:03:58.720> layer<00:03:58.900> and<00:03:59.250> click<00:04:00.250> text<00:04:00.609> and

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
make a new layer and click text and

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:06.469 
make a new layer and click text and
place<00:04:02.199> in<00:04:02.439> a<00:04:02.470> type<00:04:02.769> 2<00:04:04.229> then<00:04:05.229> you<00:04:05.439> can<00:04:05.560> go<00:04:05.680> to

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
place in a type 2 then you can go to

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.259 
place in a type 2 then you can go to
edit<00:04:07.479> and<00:04:07.900> transform<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:08.889> scale<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.699> if<00:04:10.180> you

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
edit and transform and scale and if you

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.059 
edit and transform and scale and if you
notice<00:04:10.419> it<00:04:10.720> goes<00:04:10.900> from<00:04:11.139> the<00:04:11.349> middle<00:04:11.709> of<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.829> r

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
notice it goes from the middle of the r

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.059 
notice it goes from the middle of the r
to<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.810> roughly<00:04:13.810> middle<00:04:14.079> of<00:04:14.169> ER<00:04:14.409> again<00:04:14.530> so

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
to the roughly middle of ER again so

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.899 
to the roughly middle of ER again so
just<00:04:16.049> move<00:04:17.049> that<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.859> beginning<00:04:18.669> of<00:04:18.789> the

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:18.909 
just move that to the beginning of the

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:24.990 
just move that to the beginning of the
are<00:04:19.229> down<00:04:20.229> bit<00:04:20.760> up<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.909> bit<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:23.020> rat<00:04:23.909> to<00:04:24.909> the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
are down bit up a bit to the rat to the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.809 
are down bit up a bit to the rat to the
right

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:30.819 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:33.850 

okay<00:04:31.819> so<00:04:31.879> then<00:04:32.180> you<00:04:32.270> have<00:04:32.360> the<00:04:32.479> two<00:04:32.870> but<00:04:33.349> you

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860

okay so then you have the two but you
want<00:04:33.979> to<00:04:34.009> make<00:04:34.129> it<00:04:34.400> below<00:04:34.789> the<00:04:34.970> modern<00:04:35.180> warfare

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
want to make it below the modern warfare

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.909 
want to make it below the modern warfare
text<00:04:35.780> so<00:04:35.870> you're<00:04:36.020> going<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.169> drag<00:04:36.470> it<00:04:36.500> right<00:04:36.650> to

bigger there we go there we go so that's
a<00:06:00.020> bit<00:06:00.379> better<00:06:00.529> anyway<00:06:00.889> he<00:06:01.159> can<00:06:01.310> obviously

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
a bit better anyway he can obviously

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.519 
a bit better anyway he can obviously
spend<00:06:02.180> more<00:06:02.330> time<00:06:02.479> over<00:06:02.690> and<00:06:03.020> you<00:06:03.110> have<00:06:03.259> that

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:03.529 
spend more time over and you have that

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:07.149 
spend more time over and you have that
and<00:06:04.599> that's<00:06:05.599> pretty<00:06:05.930> much<00:06:06.080> it<00:06:06.229> that's<00:06:06.830> just<00:06:06.979> a

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
and that's pretty much it that's just a

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.740 
and that's pretty much it that's just a
basic<00:06:07.340> to<00:06:07.669> not<00:06:07.789> make<00:06:07.940> a<00:06:07.969> more<00:06:08.240> advanced<00:06:08.479> one

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
basic to not make a more advanced one

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.040
