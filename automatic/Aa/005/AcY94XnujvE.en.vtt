00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
space I mean I love training so you know

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.830 
space I mean I love training so you know
predominantly<00:01:00.610> I<00:01:00.880> did<00:01:01.180> it<00:01:01.270> because<00:01:01.360> I<00:01:01.540> loved

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
predominantly I did it because I loved

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.049 
predominantly I did it because I loved
it<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.739> fact<00:01:02.980> that<00:01:03.040> I'm<00:01:03.309> good<00:01:03.610> at<00:01:03.640> it<00:01:03.880> and

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
it the fact that I'm good at it and

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.209 
it the fact that I'm good at it and
could<00:01:04.719> maybe<00:01:04.930> get<00:01:05.170> something<00:01:05.439> out<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:05.890> it

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219 
could maybe get something out of it

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:09.630 
could maybe get something out of it
really<00:01:06.640> was<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.509> secondary<00:01:08.250> concern<00:01:09.250> because<00:01:09.610> I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
really was a secondary concern because I

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.120 
really was a secondary concern because I
just<00:01:09.700> love<00:01:09.880> training<00:01:10.270> I<00:01:10.570> took<00:01:11.439> me<00:01:11.710> awhile<00:01:11.799> to

just love training I took me awhile to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
realize that maybe I had potential to to

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.510 
realize that maybe I had potential to to
compete<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.310> wet<00:01:15.960> 20-plus<00:01:16.960> years<00:01:17.319> of<00:01:18.249> training
