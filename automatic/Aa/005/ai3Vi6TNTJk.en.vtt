 at a carnival one of the most beautiful al 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.969
 the world of Venice precisely 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.220
 I am very curious to find masks 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.930
 more beautiful around the city so if 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.829

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.940
 but we are not here by chance today mica 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.280
 forever together with sephora has organized 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.960
 an ad hoc event for carnival we will find 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.790
 as many as three mica paties that they will make 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.790

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.530
 ok guys be public the lines honors e 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.140
 What Eleonora is doing then I'm doing 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.149
 creating a body painting inspired by 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.560
 circus so we are not very colorful a 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.050
 theme that fits perfectly into the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.300
 Carnival period begins with the face 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.280
 painting all in shades of white and 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.680
 black because the color will develop later 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.720
 later on the rest of the body 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.510
 but what are you using like 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.460
 product products at this time the 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.040
 black is a burden while for what 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:56.040
 regards white or used 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.020
 the flash color which is a big one I don't know 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.430
 computer haiti bulb paintings like that 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.430

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:07.040

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.040
 also products to make a little shrill 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.950
 the cirque du soleil and then we say is a 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.290
 theme that allows to give space to the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.110
 fantasy and we decided to make 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.060
 this as you would understand for the brand 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.980
 artistic certainly because it is a quarrel anyway 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.590
 started problem of how to brand 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.680

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.410

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.010
 the classic cheeks of about two sisters 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.709

 for sad reality, it makes you eat exactly 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.310
