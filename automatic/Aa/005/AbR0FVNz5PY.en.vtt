machinist here in Phoenix and when I got
the<00:01:11.220> thing<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.610> just<00:01:11.700> absolutely<00:01:12.830> devoid

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
of rigidity everything moved if I pushed

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.910 
of rigidity everything moved if I pushed
on<00:01:16.830> this<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.270> lift<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:19.020> or<00:01:19.229> lift<00:01:19.560> here

and<00:01:23.520> move<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:23.939> spent<00:01:24.270> an<00:01:24.390> entire<00:01:24.540> day

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
and move here I spent an entire day

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
and move here I spent an entire day

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
rigidity what that means as I was

setting the Gibbs the Gibbs are little

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.370 
setting the Gibbs the Gibbs are little
pieces<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.799> metal<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.900> take<00:01:39.900> up<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.290> slop

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
pieces of metal that take up the slop

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.330 
pieces of metal that take up the slop
they<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:43.979> here<00:01:44.780> there's<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:46.340> v-groove

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
they go right in here there's a v-groove

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.270 
they go right in here there's a v-groove
assembly<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.990> adjust<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.680> take<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:50.070> the

assembly and to adjust and take up the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.179 
assembly and to adjust and take up the
play<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.509> would<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:51.960> set<00:01:52.290> screws<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:53.009> and

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
play you would just set screws in and

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.899 
play you would just set screws in and
out<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.759> maximize<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> minimize<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.590> clay<00:01:55.909> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
out to maximize and minimize the clay so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.069 
out to maximize and minimize the clay so
that<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> thing<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.689> rigid<00:01:59.060> when<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.240> metal

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that the thing is rigid when the metal

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.959 
that the thing is rigid when the metal
you're<00:02:01.200> cutting<00:02:01.560> comes<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:01.979> contact<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.759> the

all day
I<00:02:26.470> had<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:28.690> portion<00:02:29.690> completely<00:02:30.380> loose<00:02:30.620> like

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
I had this portion completely loose like

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.870 
I had this portion completely loose like
get<00:02:31.280> at<00:02:31.490> it

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
get at it

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.980 
get at it
I<00:02:35.230> had<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.320> discover<00:02:36.800> how<00:02:37.550> this<00:02:37.790> thing<00:02:38.030> went

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
I had to discover how this thing went

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.670 
I had to discover how this thing went
together<00:02:39.490> by<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.550> way<00:02:40.730> when<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.000> got<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:42.440> had

know<00:05:52.160> how<00:05:52.340> the<00:05:52.400> thing<00:05:52.700> functions<00:05:53.210> as<00:05:53.390> a<00:05:53.419> length

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
know how the thing functions as a length

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.180 
know how the thing functions as a length
may<00:05:55.760> be<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.940> little<00:05:56.210> bit<00:05:56.390> better<00:05:56.660> but<00:05:57.590> as<00:05:57.770> a<00:05:57.800> mill

it<00:05:58.730> is<00:05:58.970> virtually<00:06:00.070> without<00:06:01.070> value<00:06:03.340> see<00:06:04.340> you

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
it is virtually without value see you

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.020 
it is virtually without value see you
later<00:06:04.700> I<00:06:04.850> hope<00:06:05.180> this<00:06:05.390> helps<00:06:05.720> you<00:06:05.780> guys
