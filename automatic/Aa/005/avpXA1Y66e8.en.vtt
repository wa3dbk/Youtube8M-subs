00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.110
 so hello to all of you 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.140
 found before you today for 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.490
 you film a video that was very 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.050
 often asked actually I 'm going to you 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.480
 show how to give volume to 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.219
 fine hair and especially how texture 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.049
 easy a hair so the present addition 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.029
 melanie as you can see she has 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.300
 hair that naturally we will say 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.210
 it's a little crazy so I'm 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.460
 am hitched to discipline a little bit 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 all this while knowing that I am 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.910
 glimpse of forgetfulness and the brush for the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.910
 blow dry so I ended up at you 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.730
 to do a small express blow- dry open ya 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.079
 so not really top but good 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.160
 as you can see if one day you 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.540
 forget your brush and you have 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.840
 fifteen themes you can still 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.309
 succeed in disciplining a little so well 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.980
 obviously it will not look like 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.680
 brushing with the brush but anyway 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.070
 the goal is then to make 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.600
 loops on the hair straightener so it's not 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.730
 the most important bison state but that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.250
 still allows to slide in large 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.559
 part at the essential root level 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.850
 and especially to take off a little bit 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.920
 and therefore to give them volume 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.590
 so this video is really 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.390
 to show that naturally we did not 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.659
 not all actually a texture of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.640
 hair that is simple to tame and that 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.460
 to sometimes make pretty hairstyle 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.150
 must actually go through 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.000
 this step 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.009
 so myself with my curly hair 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.390
 that's what I used to do 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.710
 when I have to film you anyway 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.890
 videos otherwise in the life of all 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.310
 days here I can leave we'll say 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.990
 natural so the goal and it's without 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.110
 count that melanie has hair that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.820
 are extremely thin actually we have not 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.310
 badly but they are very very hungry like 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.170
 you can see in pettis 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.710
 are more and more fine the more we go to 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.030
 the rains tip are fine so that says 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.680
 I still continue to 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.799
 discipline as I can with my 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.180
 comb will welcome her hair and 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.610
 as you can see already in roots 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:01.780
 we have a little more volume that is 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.780
 let's say more defined so you keep going 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 and there I spent a cost of his hair 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.310
 in fact to just finish high loire 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.080
 we'll say that's what I'm used to 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.430
 to do when sometimes I do not want 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.019
 that they take the form of their 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.200
 natural curls especially on my 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:27.840
 hair 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.910
 so I continue to finger is already there we 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640
 managed to texture is is a little bit 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.640
 more so we will attack the loops 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.080
 with our sphere so technical that I 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.480
 have already shown you a couple of times 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.599
 but who is still the same so I 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.980
 take the lock of hair I pass the 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.390
 So do a little more without roots 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.540
 precisely because I have not been able to 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.239
 hair dryer and I go down 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.120
 so then I finish the loop with my 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.410
 finger 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.480
 so I voluntarily decide not to 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.769
 start the loops at the root and a 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.180
 once we are here I will put a 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.760
 little bit of spray to make them 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.260
 hold 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.239
 we proceed in exactly the same way 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.310
 with the hair we just let go 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.019
 above and we loop once in a 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.519
 sense once in the car definitely that 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.680
 does not matter too much about it 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.889
 just for the gentlemen on the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.889
 front of the face so you continue 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.310
 you go a little in roots then you 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.590
 make your book and there we will see 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.530
 precisely that the tip finally is 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.910
 it actually joins because the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.860
 problem of melanie hair bombs 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.260
 who are fine enough and more and more 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.030
 ends at the peaks is that we have 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.690
 an aspect a bit messy in 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.990
 point 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:46.250
 and it's true that the straightener will come on 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.230
 will say gathered all this so well 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.100
 obviously I do not encourage you to do that 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.860
 everyday 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.630
 even once a week in my opinion 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.400
 it's a little too much less 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.770
 take care of your hair and protect it 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.240
 against the heat so before doing this 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.040
 kind of thing do not hesitate to sting a 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.580
 heat protector it's great 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.200
 important 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.510
 and of course to do care have 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.660
 continued to hydrate them to the maximum 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.700
 I continue I make my little curls 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.130
 as much to tell you that the stars this is 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.690
 that I said to my friends by styling it 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.170
 is that they make bun leases and 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.010
 it is unfortunately and very often 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.620
 first goes through this step of 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.390
 disciplinary textures actually on the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.540
 hair to really get a result 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.830
 sharper in fact so that's it 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.090
 really the secret when you tell me 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.580
 that precisely we had not the same 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.860
 texture ben that's really the secret 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.160
 to help you tame your 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.330
 hair so we continue the loops on 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.850
 happens now as you can see 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.860
 on the top of the head 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.960
 and here is the result already the loops 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.879
 we have done so I will continue 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.500
 to do it on the front because she has 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:57.860
 small hair on the front too 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.319
 they are a little hard to tame 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.599
 100-200 the straightener and there I will come 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.189
 with dry shampoo so if you have 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.719
 fine hair that's very very 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.259
 important I like to use the 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.870
 xxl baptist since I tested it's 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.189
 true it's the one I use 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.129
 almost all the time and here we go 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:18.229
 coming from the blow ma it's a little bit for 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.939
 give volume 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.740
 samar usually very very much a 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.180
 once this step is done we go to the 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.340
 small suite therefore to water fluids 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.819
 like my favorite for years 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.180
 now that I do not change and we will 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:34.650
 come apply that on the lengths 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.330
 boss is rooting a watchful for 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.330
 do not give the hair a greasy look 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:47.759
 and here is the result before we 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.319
 puts a little bit ready so that the 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:51.150
 loops hold well all day 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.159
 so you can also find melanie 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.469
 on youtube in the passage which also has a 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.300
 kitchen chain 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:59.460
 so I'll put the link in the bar 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.710
 info for the little gourmands of that 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.409
 we can be here so I hope in 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.939
 any case that this little trick very 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.499
 quick to realize you will have liked 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:09.629
 do not hesitate to tell me if you 

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:12.599
 blame this kind of ideas in any 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.279
 case of steps earlier before doing 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.569
 a nice bun me anyway I you 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.219
 make big kisses and I'll get back to you 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:21.409
 very very quickly for a hairstyle of 

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:21.409
 simple married big kisses
