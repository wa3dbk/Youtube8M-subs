00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.610
 welcome to a new video in which 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:07.490
 we recommend the qualities of distraction 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.959
 in this case the oven and two unknown 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.330
 I remember this moment we are a 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.039
 closed environment lucier then deny us 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.429
 we move the external duty conditions of 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.750
 speed is better even my voice 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.550
 on the test stage because obviously 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.439
 we are recorded with the microphone 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.970
 inside we make a structure meanwhile 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.429
 tells you something about this fight 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.679
 phone is called board two the first idiot 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.960
 phone of this Russian company is never 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.390
 become a mass product 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.820
 which instead wants to do here too 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.739
 italy just this second model the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.899
 main feature is that of 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.489
 have a double screen so you do n't 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.980
 reco principal in this grade one 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.680
 5-inch amoled screen e 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.140
 full hd resolution and a second screen 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.410
 imposed in the later fact and the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.850
 electronic ink technical model 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.590
 the back one has one of lighting 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.670
 share of the present inches in resolution 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.500
 of 960 x 540 pixels 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.190
 the purpose is for any second screen 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.040
 is the one that not only maybe 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.680
 be good to read ebooks like 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.550
 bari the bar after just talking up 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.530
 but above all to the screen 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.020
 replace the main state with 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.600
 various applications are excusing me 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.050
 I ask why it is cold today to replace 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.370
 I said I had applications to avoid 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.430
 use know the main e 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.350
 save battery they tried for 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.560
 several days when we move into 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.970
 our son usually has it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.280
 found for several days ed 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.900
 actually the situations where yes 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.270
 can only use different from the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.150
 classic reading of a website maybe 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.310
 while you are also using al 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.420
 gps navigator those situations in which 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.220
 a screen is not so essential 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.210
 colors the best of the main screen 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.220
 not only with the essentials but serves 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.470
 simply say information 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.420
 summary is based on the application is 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.090
 became for example during the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.979
 gps navigation maybe the voice command 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.709
 is sufficient and give an indication 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.180
 pictograms predict where to go 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.070
 other features very quickly 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.570
 2GB of RAM memory with regards to 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.390
 I know it is not up to date indeed 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.550
 they were n't always with 800 it was 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.180
 slightly on android and the last one 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.700
 version 5.0 but not 4.4 but will arrive 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.080
 the camera update only from 8 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.880
 megapixel and let's say it's a 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.770
 a high-end smartphone 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.690
 certainly with regards to the 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.330
 price but more than features 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.660
 techniques you pay the novelty of the second 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.450
 screen 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.070
 I would say that regarding the test 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.040
 quality of education and the yacht 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.290
 a von due is everything we see in 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.120
 next videos here on youtube but on 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.480
 tom's also with the full review 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.480
 Hello
