customers and what they need for hunting
we<00:00:54.620> started<00:00:54.890> with<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.040> carbon-fiber<00:00:55.520> shank

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
we started with a carbon-fiber shank

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.580 
we started with a carbon-fiber shank
went<00:00:56.450> through<00:00:56.570> about<00:00:56.690> five<00:00:56.900> iterations<00:00:57.140> of

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
went through about five iterations of

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.900 
went through about five iterations of
this<00:00:57.739> boot<00:00:57.980> to<00:00:58.130> where<00:00:58.280> we<00:00:58.400> are<00:00:58.430> now<00:00:58.700> we've

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
this boot to where we are now we've

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.520 
this boot to where we are now we've
ended<00:00:59.120> up<00:00:59.210> with<00:00:59.270> a<00:00:59.420> nylon<00:00:59.630> shank<00:00:59.870> something

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
ended up with a nylon shank something

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.740 
ended up with a nylon shank something
gives<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.800> little<00:01:01.130> bit<00:01:01.250> more<00:01:01.399> flex<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.120> is

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
gives a little bit more flex and is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.729 
gives a little bit more flex and is
going<00:01:02.840> to<00:01:02.930> give<00:01:03.050> you<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:03.200> little<00:01:03.500> bit<00:01:03.620> more

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
without a full shank you have to use the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.620 
without a full shank you have to use the
whole<00:01:33.410> soul<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:34.100> bit<00:01:34.250> for<00:01:34.580> a<00:01:34.850> large<00:01:35.090> portion

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
whole soul the bit for a large portion

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.480 
whole soul the bit for a large portion
of<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.750> front<00:01:36.050> of<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.230> boot<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:37.070> get<00:01:37.220> up<00:01:37.340> that

of the front of the boot to get up that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.340 
of the front of the boot to get up that
mountain<00:01:37.550> without<00:01:37.850> slipping<00:01:38.330> with<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.080> full

in a front point into the side of the
mountain<00:01:46.400> it's<00:01:46.880> actually<00:01:47.180> like<00:01:47.300> having<00:01:47.690> a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
mountain it's actually like having a

hoof of an animal it works incredibly

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.420 
hoof of an animal it works incredibly
well<00:01:50.660> it's<00:01:50.960> very<00:01:51.320> efficient<00:01:51.860> way<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.010> climb<00:01:52.369> a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
well it's very efficient way to climb a

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.990 
well it's very efficient way to climb a
mountain<00:01:52.550> we<00:01:53.360> put<00:01:53.990> on<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.440> outsole<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.490> Teton

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
mountain we put on the outsole the Teton

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.900 
mountain we put on the outsole the Teton
Vibram<00:01:56.540> sole<00:01:56.810> which<00:01:57.410> has<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:58.220> really

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
Vibram sole which has a really

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.340 
Vibram sole which has a really
aggressive<00:01:59.119> lug<00:01:59.570> pattern<00:01:59.600> so<00:02:00.140> you're<00:02:00.259> gonna

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
aggressive lug pattern so you're gonna
