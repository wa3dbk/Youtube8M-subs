doubt<00:03:46.340> right<00:03:46.609> there<00:03:46.879> but<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.389> know<00:03:47.629> I<00:03:47.750> was

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
doubt right there but I know I was

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.869 
doubt right there but I know I was
running<00:03:48.260> him<00:03:48.379> early<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:48.889> it<00:03:49.010> was<00:03:49.129> just<00:03:49.370> he

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
running him early and it was just he

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.089 
running him early and it was just he
just<00:03:50.060> runs<00:03:50.299> hard<00:03:50.599> you<00:03:51.079> know<00:03:51.199> he<00:03:51.349> just<00:03:51.590> he's

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
just runs hard you know he just he's

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.879 
just runs hard you know he just he's
just<00:03:52.370> runs<00:03:53.060> hard<00:03:53.419> he<00:03:53.750> ran<00:03:53.959> hard<00:03:54.260> he's<00:03:54.439> run<00:03:54.620> hard

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:54.889 
just runs hard he ran hard he's run hard

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:56.530 
just runs hard he ran hard he's run hard
every<00:03:55.159> time<00:03:55.189> I've<00:03:55.549> been<00:03:55.699> around<00:03:55.969> them<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:56.419> it

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
every time I've been around them and it

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.020 
every time I've been around them and it
just<00:03:56.750> seems<00:03:57.040> like<00:03:58.040> overkill<00:03:58.400> like<00:03:58.579> if<00:03:58.909> your

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
just seems like overkill like if your

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.520 
just seems like overkill like if your
car<00:03:59.180> is<00:03:59.209> good<00:03:59.479> you'll<00:03:59.659> go<00:03:59.810> forward<00:04:00.229> if<00:04:00.379> your

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
car is good you'll go forward if your

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.409 
car is good you'll go forward if your
car<00:04:00.709> is<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:01.099> you'll<00:04:01.310> go<00:04:01.879> back<00:04:01.909> and<00:04:02.120> that's

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
car is and you'll go back and that's

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.599 
car is and you'll go back and that's
just<00:04:02.599> what<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:03.409> know<00:04:03.500> that's<00:04:04.009> just<00:04:04.159> a<00:04:04.310> lot<00:04:04.489> of

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
just what you know that's just a lot of

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.450 
just what you know that's just a lot of
NASCAR<00:04:04.849> and<00:04:05.150> so<00:04:05.569> you<00:04:06.229> know
