we've<00:01:57.810> put<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.049> there<00:01:58.200> every<00:01:58.470> shot<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.829> shot<00:01:58.860> a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
we've put in there every shot we shot a

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.460 
we've put in there every shot we shot a

it's<00:02:03.659> always<00:02:03.840> going<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.170> quite<00:02:04.649> heavily

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
it's always going to be quite heavily

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.260 
it's always going to be quite heavily

we're<00:02:06.420> trying<00:02:06.720> to<00:02:06.840> retrace<00:02:07.799> something

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
we're trying to retrace something

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.150 
we're trying to retrace something

the<00:02:17.040> funny<00:02:17.220> thing<00:02:17.400> was<00:02:17.550> she's<00:02:17.880> she's<00:02:18.720> quite<00:02:18.930> an

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
the funny thing was she's she's quite an

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.220 
the funny thing was she's she's quite an
inside<00:02:19.349> cat<00:02:19.680> she<00:02:19.890> actually<00:02:20.120> CG<00:02:21.120> he<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.050> they

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
inside cat she actually CG he so they

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.020 
inside cat she actually CG he so they
actually<00:02:22.380> make<00:02:22.890> something<00:02:23.160> look<00:02:23.459> real<00:02:23.790> that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
actually make something look real that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.880 
actually make something look real that
I've<00:02:24.150> seen<00:02:24.330> better<00:02:24.510> than<00:02:24.750> CG<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.260> almost<00:02:25.590> there

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
I've seen better than CG is almost there

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.009 
I've seen better than CG is almost there
it's<00:02:26.850> almost<00:02:27.030> like<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.540> was<00:02:27.630> an<00:02:27.720> extra

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
it's almost like it was an extra

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.350 
it's almost like it was an extra
challenge<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:28.500> itself<00:02:28.769> one<00:02:29.549> of<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.760> things

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
challenge in itself one of the things

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.600 
challenge in itself one of the things
that<00:02:30.540> had<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.720> be<00:02:30.810> sort<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.110> sorted<00:02:32.100> out<00:02:32.220> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
that had to be sort of sorted out the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.059 
that had to be sort of sorted out the
front<00:02:32.880> end<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.180> job<00:02:33.360> was<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:34.410> performance

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
front end of the job was the performance

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.830 
front end of the job was the performance
of<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.220> cat<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.760> if<00:02:36.269> this<00:02:36.390> cat<00:02:36.690> could

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
of the cat and if this cat could

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.990 
of the cat and if this cat could
actually<00:02:36.989> sing<00:02:37.380> what<00:02:38.069> would<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.340> water<00:02:38.700> look

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
actually sing what would it water look

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.240 
actually sing what would it water look
like<00:02:39.030> with<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> cats<00:02:40.110> performance<00:02:40.590> it's

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
like with the cats performance it's

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.220 
like with the cats performance it's
being<00:02:41.640> lost<00:02:41.910> in<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.209> moment<00:02:42.599> was<00:02:42.870> something

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
being lost in the moment was something

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.680 
being lost in the moment was something
as<00:02:43.470> key<00:02:43.709> because<00:02:44.549> like<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:44.849> say<00:02:45.269> we<00:02:45.390> found<00:02:45.569> this

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
as key because like I say we found this

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.380 
as key because like I say we found this
clip<00:02:45.930> on<00:02:46.110> me<00:02:46.260> instead<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.590> these<00:02:46.799> two<00:02:47.010> kids

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
clip on me instead of these two kids

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.490 
clip on me instead of these two kids
lip-synching<00:02:48.390> together<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:49.019> way<00:02:49.140> they<00:02:49.319> just

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
lip-synching together the way they just

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.020 
lip-synching together the way they just
got<00:02:49.680> lost<00:02:49.920> closing<00:02:50.280> their<00:02:50.370> eyes<00:02:50.459> expression

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
was the cap to be able to do I mean we

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.770 
was the cap to be able to do I mean we
wanted<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.980> ultra-cute<00:02:56.880> oh<00:02:57.060> my<00:02:57.420> god<00:02:57.630> I've

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
researched on the way just basically

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.560 
researched on the way just basically
getting<00:03:05.250> lost<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.609> lot<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:05.910> cute<00:03:06.090> cat<00:03:06.239> videos
