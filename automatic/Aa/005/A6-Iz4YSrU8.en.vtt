00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:14.299
 Raw materials and connection to the environment at the same time Robert Schad something not 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:15.139
 to repeat 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.339
 just one of many questions for which scientists are interested 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.179
 importantly used in cosmetics 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.179
 must be able to rely on that Krems are compatible 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:33.360
 Rotate 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.950
 tested on animals cause for the animals and pain meant 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.540
 What could not prevent that, for example, new products on the market 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.630
 The allergies trigger because they now system in animals quite different 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.630
 reacts as in humans 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.600
 firmly on skin models of human skin should replace animal experiments 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.390
 The scientists have an automated evidences to the skin 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 Manufacturing developed and built 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.970
 Cases from a tiny piece of skin are first separated from each other 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.830
 in the boat closet they multiply 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.100
 The machine ensures that the cells get their special diet 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.280
 two field kitchens are finally brought together and grow to 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 two-layered skin model together 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.250
 it just sounds like it's all about the people as well 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.480
 when two people live together 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.210
 then there was gigantic and fretting what the food is all about 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.790
 that's the percentage of cases too 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.479
 Every counter has some claims to the heck being made by media 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.870
 and then you have to optimize for the two, that is, everyone 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.570
 confidently make certain restrictions and must accept what the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.570
 others too 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.970
 the researchers have found the right compromise 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.200
 stuck this line-like skin have the same physiological 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.200
 Properties like the human skin 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.879
 Chemicals drugs and also Kriens can do it better than in animal experiments 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.879
 getting tested 

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:22.189
 Under the microscope you can see that the pink surface of the 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:26.219
 artificially produced skin is attacked by the applied crows 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.219
 the test drive is damaged 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.269
 even the sun can be dangerous for the skin 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.419
 People in the midday heat at the water 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.419
 for Heike Walles a cause for concern 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.329
 Reiner Wellmann worst 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.819
 when you see people roasting in the sun when you know that 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.769
 this energy is transmitted through the sun 3 on the 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.479
 Zeller trigger can quickly give if this is why of 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.949
 especially rarely does Saleh mutate 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:00.919
 then you can happen 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.059
 The development of skin cancer, the scientists already at the 

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.939
 track artificially produced human skin 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.640
 They are experimenting with the dangerous black skin cancer 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.310
 to find out something else 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.380
 what makes him particularly aggressive 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.369
 and how can you defuse it 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.879
 Under the microscope, the black cancer cells are clearly visible 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.859
 to further investigate the main quest development 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.059
 and to be able to try out new therapies the house models has expanded 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.059
 become 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:38.509
 for this purpose, human skin cells are formed in a so-called bioreactor 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.969
 a ship a lady deliberately with blood vessels settled 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.049
 human skin develops 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.079
 In the future, skin grafts could also be made from the patient's own 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.829
 Cells are produced 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.829
 There would be no repulsion reactions 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.090
 we now give these human cells mouthpiece for the beautiful ones 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.809
 Hours in our bioreactors 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:05.369
 in order to stop growing, they want to do very well internationally 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:06.989
 did not occur 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.939
 with half a year 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.729
 then the entire implant consists of the body's own material 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:18.090
 the entire pig days were reduced and that's all downhill was your own 

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:22.049
 In the lurch, therefore, there is no danger at all 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.889
 rejection 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.770
 large-scale burns or other injuries, for example as a result of 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.120
 Skin cancer surgery 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.490
 should then lose their terror 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.330
 from a few healthy skin cells of a patient 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.629
 could easily be made in the specialized artificial skin sales 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.470
 Grief as in every way force 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.419
 how to pour 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.589
 I imagine the self-proclaimed here what they wanted burns 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.500
 because rarely get rid of district can loud fire department 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.830
 bee colonies 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.919
 the skin repair as if by magic 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.019
 is just a milestone for the researchers
