00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
this or anything else so what I'm going

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.200 
this or anything else so what I'm going
to<00:00:47.789> do<00:00:48.059> first<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:49.760> just<00:00:50.760> show<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.969> what

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
to do first of all is just show you what

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.959 
to do first of all is just show you what
the<00:00:51.660> other<00:00:51.840> examples<00:00:52.320> may<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.710> now<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.940> a

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the other examples may be now this is a

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.830 
the other examples may be now this is a
split<00:00:54.329> pin<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.920> split<00:00:55.920> pin<00:00:56.070> knockouts<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.690> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
split pin and split pin knockouts so I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
split pin and split pin knockouts so I
can<00:00:58.050> tell<00:00:58.230> up<00:00:58.379> by<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> way<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.250> see

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
can tell up by the way because you see

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.160 
can tell up by the way because you see
the<00:01:00.030> holes<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.989> each<00:01:01.109> link<00:01:01.850> which<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.170> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the holes in each link which just you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.770 
the holes in each link which just you
can<00:01:04.350> after<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.860> while<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.479> some

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
can after a while you just see that some

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.640 
can after a while you just see that some
of<00:01:06.810> them<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.580> splits<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> pin<00:01:09.439> on<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
of them have splits in the pin on the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.420 
of them have splits in the pin on the
one<00:01:10.799> end<00:01:12.380> which<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.530> completely<00:01:13.920> different<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
one end which is completely different to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.789 
one end which is completely different to
what<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.939> lot<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> other<00:01:15.720> ones<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:16.140> this

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
what a lot of the other ones are this

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.179 
what a lot of the other ones are this
one<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.130> example<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.270> sleeve<00:01:19.049> pin<00:01:19.950> which

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
one for example is a sleeve pin which

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.530 
one for example is a sleeve pin which
you<00:01:20.340> knock<00:01:20.520> out<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.680> here<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.540> an

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
you knock out this one here is an

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.190 
you knock out this one here is an
l-shaped<00:01:26.060> link<00:01:27.060> which<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.990> pull

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
l-shaped link which we you have to pull

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.590 
l-shaped link which we you have to pull
out<00:01:28.380> effectively<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:30.000> there's<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.329> clip

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
out effectively and that there's a clip

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.580 
out effectively and that there's a clip
link<00:01:30.869> which<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.590> hand<00:01:33.470> but<00:01:34.470> this

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
link which you can do by hand but this

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.350 
link which you can do by hand but this
one<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.979> says<00:01:35.189> probably<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.759> most<00:01:35.880> common

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
one that says probably the most common

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.760 
one that says probably the most common
and<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.840> there<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.049> also<00:01:37.140> other<00:01:37.470> ones<00:01:37.619> as

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
and that there are also other ones as

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.120 
and that there are also other ones as
well<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.369> small<00:01:38.729> example<00:01:38.790> and

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
well this is just a small example and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.380 
well this is just a small example and
this<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> most<00:01:41.460> common<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:41.970> which<00:01:42.150> is<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this is the most common one which is the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.130 
this is the most common one which is the
split<00:01:42.659> pin<00:01:42.840> knockout

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
split pin knockout

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.300 
split pin knockout
so<00:01:46.140> should<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.040> show<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.509> this<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> block

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
so should I show you this is the block

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.730 
so should I show you this is the block
you<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.549> select<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.210> correct<00:01:51.630> point<00:01:52.560> on

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
you have to select the correct point on

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.249 
you have to select the correct point on
the<00:01:52.829> block<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.220> put<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.170> bracelet<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the block to put the bracelet in

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.440 
the block to put the bracelet in
securely<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.159> when<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> knock<00:01:56.969> straight

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
securely so you when you knock straight

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.630 
securely so you when you knock straight
down<00:01:57.719> directly<00:01:58.439> down<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.219> doesn't<00:01:59.399> move

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
down directly down on it it doesn't move

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.399 
down directly down on it it doesn't move

you can see the arrows on the inside of
the<00:02:09.899> bracelet

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the bracelet

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.080 
the bracelet
and<00:02:12.230> what<00:02:13.230> I'm<00:02:13.320> going<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.500> do<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:14.130> hit<00:02:14.340> with<00:02:14.940> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and what I'm going to do is hit with the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.390 
and what I'm going to do is hit with the
arrows<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.150> second<00:02:19.190> adjustable<00:02:20.190> link

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
arrows on the second adjustable link

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.700 
arrows on the second adjustable link
down<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:22.620> have<00:02:23.000> one<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.120> these<00:02:24.470> knockout<00:02:25.470> pins

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
down we have one of these knockout pins

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.200 
down we have one of these knockout pins
here<00:02:25.980> now<00:02:26.550> I'm<00:02:26.640> going<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.820> select<00:02:27.000> this<00:02:27.150> one

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
here now I'm going to select this one

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.880 
here now I'm going to select this one
here<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.600> think<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:27.930> about<00:02:28.080> north<00:02:28.410> with<00:02:28.680> eight

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
here I think it's about north with eight

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.940 
here I think it's about north with eight
mil<00:02:29.330> which<00:02:30.330> looks<00:02:30.630> about<00:02:30.870> right<00:02:31.140> for<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
mil which looks about right for the the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.230 
mil which looks about right for the the
holes<00:02:32.720> these<00:02:33.720> ones<00:02:34.530> ranged<00:02:35.220> from<00:02:35.310> 1.2<00:02:35.880> mil

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
holes these ones ranged from 1.2 mil

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
holes these ones ranged from 1.2 mil
down<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.780> North<00:02:36.959> 14:6<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:39.810> looks<00:02:40.020> about

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
down to North 14:6 that looks about

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.340 
down to North 14:6 that looks about
right<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.650> me<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.040> one<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:42.270> run<00:02:43.110> knock

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
right to me for this one and run knock

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.020 
right to me for this one and run knock
down<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.830> so<00:02:46.010> see<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.100> that's<00:02:47.310> quite<00:02:47.580> easy<00:02:47.610> warm

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
down it so see is that's quite easy warm

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.949 
down it so see is that's quite easy warm

that's the one link out and what I'm
going<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.470> do<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.650> type<00:02:58.920> one<00:02:59.160> link<00:02:59.400> out<00:02:59.550> of<00:02:59.580> this

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
going to do is type one link out of this

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.470 
going to do is type one link out of this
one<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.780> I'll<00:03:01.709> repeat<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.130> process<00:03:02.340> book<00:03:02.760> one

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
one so I'll repeat the process book one

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.630 
one so I'll repeat the process book one
week<00:03:03.660> further<00:03:03.900> down

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.870 

like<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.500> does<00:03:14.500> help<00:03:14.770> when<00:03:15.580> you're<00:03:15.670> putting

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
like so does help when you're putting

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.090 
like so does help when you're putting
them<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.120> block<00:03:16.360> and<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:17.650> little<00:03:17.830> holes

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
them on the block and the little holes

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.580 
them on the block and the little holes
on<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.580> other<00:03:18.730> side<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.060> block<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:20.530> you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
on the other side of the block if you

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.500 
on the other side of the block if you
actually<00:03:20.830> knock<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.220> out<00:03:21.340> over<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.730> hole<00:03:21.910> it

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
actually knock it out over the hole it

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.660 
actually knock it out over the hole it
will<00:03:23.040> go<00:03:24.040> down<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.610> table<00:03:26.520> rather<00:03:27.520> than

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
will go down to the table rather than

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.750 
will go down to the table rather than
get<00:03:27.880> stuck<00:03:28.330> in<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.750> actual<00:03:29.440> block<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:32.760> let

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
get stuck in the actual block so let

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.570 
get stuck in the actual block so let
that<00:03:33.790> link<00:03:34.180> out<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.790> put<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.060> back<00:03:37.239> in<00:03:38.580> line

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
that link out and to put it back in line

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.490 
that link out and to put it back in line
up<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.820> links<00:03:40.090> like<00:03:40.270> so<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:42.900> we<00:03:43.900> actually<00:03:44.050> put

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
up the links like so and we actually put

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.699 
up the links like so and we actually put
the<00:03:44.830> split<00:03:45.459> pin<00:03:45.640> back<00:03:45.820> in<00:03:46.709> with<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:49.709> rounded

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
the split pin back in with the rounded

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.640 
the split pin back in with the rounded
end<00:03:51.269> going<00:03:52.269> in<00:03:52.420> against<00:03:53.260> the<00:03:53.800> arrow<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.900> push

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.430 
till it's smooth see now it's smooth
that's<00:04:52.330> okay<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:55.180> bracelet<00:04:55.570> is<00:04:55.600> adjusted

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.330 

now<00:04:59.440> you<00:04:59.500> can<00:04:59.710> see<00:05:00.120> that<00:05:01.120> bracelet<00:05:01.630> now<00:05:01.930> hangs

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
now you can see that bracelet now hangs

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.830 
now you can see that bracelet now hangs
centrally<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:04.270> that's<00:05:04.420> something<00:05:04.600> else

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
centrally and that's something else

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.600 
centrally and that's something else
you're<00:05:04.960> said<00:05:05.230> well<00:05:05.410> I<00:05:05.560> also<00:05:05.890> need<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.280> take

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
you're said well I also need to take

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
you're said well I also need to take
into<00:05:06.670> account<00:05:06.970> and<00:05:07.180> doing<00:05:07.360> your<00:05:07.510> bracelet

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
into account and doing your bracelet

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.630 
into account and doing your bracelet
because<00:05:10.630> if<00:05:10.930> I<00:05:11.200> was<00:05:11.410> to<00:05:11.440> take<00:05:11.680> say<00:05:12.010> three<00:05:12.340> links

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
because if I was to take say three links

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.150 
because if I was to take say three links
out<00:05:12.820> of<00:05:13.030> one<00:05:13.270> side<00:05:13.480> only<00:05:13.960> it<00:05:14.770> would<00:05:14.920> end<00:05:15.070> up

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
out of one side only it would end up

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.300 
out of one side only it would end up
with<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:16.300> hanging<00:05:16.780> being<00:05:17.080> sort<00:05:17.440> of<00:05:17.470> went<00:05:18.190> over

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
with the hanging being sort of went over

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.220 
with the hanging being sort of went over
to<00:05:18.490> one<00:05:18.640> side<00:05:18.670> so<00:05:19.540> that's<00:05:19.630> something<00:05:20.050> we<00:05:20.200> have

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
to one side so that's something we have

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.440 
to one side so that's something we have
to<00:05:20.350> take<00:05:20.500> into<00:05:20.650> account<00:05:20.710> when<00:05:21.100> we<00:05:21.450> we're

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
to take into account when we we're

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.970 
to take into account when we we're
looking<00:05:22.720> at<00:05:22.840> it<00:05:22.960> something<00:05:23.200> on<00:05:23.320> that<00:05:23.650> wall<00:05:23.860> in

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
looking at it something on that wall in

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.410 
looking at it something on that wall in
particular<00:05:24.220> because<00:05:24.670> I<00:05:24.730> may<00:05:24.850> take<00:05:25.030> on<00:05:25.210> one

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
particular because I may take on one

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.930 
particular because I may take on one
link<00:05:25.660> out<00:05:25.840> you<00:05:26.740> have<00:05:26.890> an<00:05:27.370> uneven<00:05:27.700> number<00:05:29.940> of

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
link out you have an uneven number of

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.260 
link out you have an uneven number of
links<00:05:31.270> on<00:05:31.420> us<00:05:31.570> either<00:05:31.780> side<00:05:32.200> and<00:05:33.040> therefore

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
links on us either side and therefore

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.430 
links on us either side and therefore
it's<00:05:34.270> always<00:05:34.360> going<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.600> be<00:05:34.690> very<00:05:34.930> slightly

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
it's always going to be very slightly

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.020 
it's always going to be very slightly
out<00:05:35.970> but<00:05:36.970> that's<00:05:37.210> fine<00:05:37.540> for<00:05:38.020> that<00:05:38.050> one<00:05:38.320> so<00:05:39.070> that

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
out but that's fine for that one so that

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.110 
out but that's fine for that one so that
