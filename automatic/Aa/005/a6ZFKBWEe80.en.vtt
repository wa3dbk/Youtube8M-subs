00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.900 

so<00:00:07.410> today<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.890> thought<00:00:08.130> we'd<00:00:08.309> have<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.490> look<00:00:08.670> at

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
so today I thought we'd have a look at

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.299 
so today I thought we'd have a look at
some<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.630> new<00:00:09.870> UI<00:00:10.290> changes<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.219> are

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
some of the new UI changes that are

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.549 
some of the new UI changes that are
coming<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:11.880> Battlefield<00:00:12.630> 4<00:00:12.870> now<00:00:13.080> these<00:00:13.320> are

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
coming in to Battlefield 4 now these are

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.499 
coming in to Battlefield 4 now these are
in<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.889> CTE<00:00:14.400> community<00:00:15.150> test<00:00:15.360> environment

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
in the CTE community test environment

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.810 
in the CTE community test environment
and<00:00:16.080> alignment<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:17.279> they<00:00:17.400> will<00:00:17.640> be

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
and alignment but they will be

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.730 
and alignment but they will be
transferred<00:00:18.359> through<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> main<00:00:19.230> game<00:00:19.529> at

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
transferred through to the main game at

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.410 
transferred through to the main game at
some<00:00:19.980> point<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.820> course<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.270> to

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
some point and of course we have to

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.900 
some point and of course we have to
remember<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:22.020> most<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> CTE<00:00:23.250> changes

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
remember that most of the CTE changes

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.089 
remember that most of the CTE changes
will<00:00:24.300> go<00:00:24.510> through<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.080> battlefield<00:00:25.560> hardline

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
will go through to battlefield hardline

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.070 
will go through to battlefield hardline
too<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.180> all<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.449> changes<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:27.930> we're<00:00:28.050> seeing

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
too so all the changes that we're seeing

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.589 
too so all the changes that we're seeing
here<00:00:28.320> now<00:00:28.529> could<00:00:28.980> eventually<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:30.060> an<00:00:30.210> impact

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
here now could eventually have an impact

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.510 
here now could eventually have an impact
on<00:00:30.900> how<00:00:31.199> about<00:00:31.260> four<00:00:31.650> four<00:00:31.800> plays<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> next

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
on how about four four plays in the next

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220 
on how about four four plays in the next
couple<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.820> months<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.329> most<00:00:33.780> likely<00:00:33.989> how

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
couple of months and most likely how

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.540 
couple of months and most likely how
hardline<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> play<00:00:35.190> out<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
hardline is going to play out for the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.299 
hardline is going to play out for the
next<00:00:35.670> year<00:00:36.000> or<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.590> going<00:00:37.770> into<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
next year or so so going into the

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.610 
next year or so so going into the
options<00:00:38.579> menu<00:00:39.110> there<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.230> new<00:00:40.379> section

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
options menu there is a new section

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.319 
options menu there is a new section
under<00:00:41.070> gameplay<00:00:41.670> which<00:00:42.030> has<00:00:42.180> been

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
under gameplay which has been

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.930 
under gameplay which has been
highlighted<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.989> advanced<00:00:43.710> options<00:00:44.250> now

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
highlighted as advanced options now

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.760 
highlighted as advanced options now
these<00:00:45.149> UI<00:00:45.420> elements<00:00:46.050> will<00:00:46.230> probably<00:00:46.559> come

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
these UI elements will probably come

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.490 
these UI elements will probably come
with<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.370> massive<00:00:47.640> cheer<00:00:48.030> from<00:00:48.239> most<00:00:48.570> people<00:00:49.050> in

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
with a massive cheer from most people in

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.619 
with a massive cheer from most people in
the<00:00:49.649> battlefield<00:00:50.039> community<00:00:50.160> who<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.300> had

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
the battlefield community who have had

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
the battlefield community who have had
seriously<00:00:52.469> bad<00:00:52.620> experiences<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.340> HUD

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
seriously bad experiences with HUD

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
seriously bad experiences with HUD
clutter<00:00:54.140> this<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.320> where<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.739> heads-up

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
clutter this is where the heads-up

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.310 
clutter this is where the heads-up
display<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> game<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.719> sort<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.079> getting

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
display of the game is sort of getting

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.470 
display of the game is sort of getting
in<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.590> way<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.219> shooting<00:00:59.489> people<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
in the way of you shooting people so the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240 
in the way of you shooting people so the
obliteration<00:01:00.750> bomb<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:01.590> example<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
obliteration bomb for example is a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.039 
obliteration bomb for example is a
massive<00:01:02.789> icon<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> middle<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> screen

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
massive icon on the middle of the screen

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.740 
massive icon on the middle of the screen
these<00:01:04.979> changes<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:06.000> counteract<00:01:06.659> that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
these changes can now counteract that

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.480 
these changes can now counteract that
and<00:01:07.110> basically<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.010> change<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
and basically you can change the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.179 
and basically you can change the
visibility<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:09.119> those<00:01:09.540> icons<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
visibility of those icons so here you

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.770 
visibility of those icons so here you
can<00:01:11.310> obviously<00:01:11.549> change<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.090> HUD<00:01:12.270> visibility

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
can obviously change the HUD visibility

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
can obviously change the HUD visibility
as<00:01:12.960> you've<00:01:13.140> always<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.040> always<00:01:14.250> could<00:01:14.520> do

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
as you've always as you always could do

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.020 
as you've always as you always could do
but<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> further<00:01:16.170> down<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.790> more

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
but now the further down you go the more

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.700 
but now the further down you go the more
things<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.689> change<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.439> you've<00:01:19.590> now

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
things that you can change so you've now

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.249 
things that you can change so you've now
got<00:01:19.920> common<00:01:20.340> HUD<00:01:20.700> world<00:01:21.090> icons<00:01:21.659> visibility

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
got common HUD world icons visibility

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.830 
got common HUD world icons visibility
this<00:01:22.920> gives<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> ability<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.210> basically

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
this gives you the ability to basically

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.929 
this gives you the ability to basically
change<00:01:25.200> all<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.009> icons<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.640> aren't

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
change all of the icons that aren't

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.850 
change all of the icons that aren't
actually<00:01:27.090> owned<00:01:27.420> by<00:01:27.630> one<00:01:27.930> specific<00:01:28.409> faction

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
actually owned by one specific faction

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.940 
actually owned by one specific faction
so<00:01:29.400> sort<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.030> icons<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.780> flags<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.470> icons

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
so sort of icons for flags and icons

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.700 
so sort of icons for flags and icons
that<00:01:32.070> pick<00:01:32.490> things<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.939> off<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.240> ground<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that pick things up off the ground or to

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
that pick things up off the ground or to
activate<00:01:35.280> LEvolution<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.970> things<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.360> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
activate LEvolution and things like that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.499 
activate LEvolution and things like that
so<00:01:36.979> common<00:01:37.979> basically<00:01:38.549> means<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.970> when

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
so common basically means that when

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.240 
so common basically means that when
you're<00:01:39.720> sort<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.110> zoomed<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.650> that's<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
you're sort of zoomed out that's the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.469 
you're sort of zoomed out that's the
visibility<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.850> you're<00:01:42.090> going<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> be

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
visibility that you're going to be

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.179 
visibility that you're going to be
seeing<00:01:42.750> these<00:01:42.930> icons<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> screen<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.100> I've

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
seeing these icons on the screen so I've

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.999 
seeing these icons on the screen so I've
set<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.610> 60%<00:01:44.970> now<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.990> icons<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.740> battle

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
set that as 60% now the icons in battle

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.859

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
better that's going to be for me now

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.670 
better that's going to be for me now
when<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.700> zoom<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.869> visibility<00:01:58.229> drops

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
when you zoom in that visibility drops

when you zoom in that visibility drops
down<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.950> half<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.610> which<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.909> 30%<00:02:00.570> which

down to half of that which is 30% which

down to half of that which is 30% which
means<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.290> when<00:02:01.439> I'm<00:02:01.530> zoomed<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.250> haven't

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
means that when I'm zoomed in I haven't

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.789 
means that when I'm zoomed in I haven't
got<00:02:03.119> these<00:02:03.479> colors<00:02:03.930> all<00:02:04.079> over<00:02:04.110> my<00:02:04.439> screen<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
got these colors all over my screen that

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.859 
got these colors all over my screen that
are<00:02:05.040> obscuring<00:02:05.579> my<00:02:05.610> vision<00:02:05.729> when<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.600> trying

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
are obscuring my vision when I'm trying

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.930 
are obscuring my vision when I'm trying
to<00:02:06.990> kill<00:02:07.170> somebody<00:02:07.439> which<00:02:08.280> makes<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.640> easier

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
to kill somebody which makes it easier

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.910 
to kill somebody which makes it easier
for<00:02:09.000> me<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.239> see<00:02:09.450> enemies<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> background

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
for me to see enemies in the background

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.770 
for me to see enemies in the background
so<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.640> come<00:02:11.760> further<00:02:11.940> down<00:02:12.240> you<00:02:12.420> actually

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
so as you come further down you actually

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.690 
so as you come further down you actually
have<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.020> option<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.470> change<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> enemy<00:02:14.370> HUD

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
have the option to change the enemy HUD

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.300 
have the option to change the enemy HUD
icon<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.900> little<00:02:16.110> Doritos<00:02:16.680> or<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
icon so the little Doritos or the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.460

conquest icons the rush em comm icons

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.410 
conquest icons the rush em comm icons
the<00:02:19.709> obliteration<00:02:20.160> icon<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.060> change<00:02:21.209> all

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
the obliteration icon you can change all

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.390 
the obliteration icon you can change all
of<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.569> if<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.840> want<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.920> kind<00:02:23.340> of

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
of that if you want to but I kind of

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.190 
of that if you want to but I kind of
find<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.790> having<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> screen<00:02:25.080> a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
find that having that on the screen a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.229 
find that having that on the screen a
hundred<00:02:25.709> percent<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.220> better<00:02:26.459> because<00:02:27.120> it

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
hundred percent is better because it

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.460 
hundred percent is better because it
means<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.569> can<00:02:27.780> see<00:02:27.959> through<00:02:28.200> all<00:02:28.350> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
means that I can see through all the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.680 
means that I can see through all the
other<00:02:28.620> icons<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.190> i<00:02:29.280> zoom<00:02:29.459> in<00:02:29.700> but<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.239> can<00:02:30.360> still

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
other icons as i zoom in but I can still

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.540 
other icons as i zoom in but I can still
see<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.989> enemy<00:02:31.319> icons<00:02:31.709> that<00:02:31.890> I'm<00:02:32.010> aiming<00:02:32.190> at

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
see the enemy icons that I'm aiming at

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.570 
see the enemy icons that I'm aiming at
and<00:02:32.819> I've<00:02:33.540> done<00:02:33.750> virtually<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.500> same<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:35.340> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
and I've done virtually the same for the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.460 
and I've done virtually the same for the
friends<00:02:36.000> HUD<00:02:36.180> icon<00:02:36.569> as<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:37.019> for<00:02:37.319> the

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
friends HUD icon as I have for the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.650 
friends HUD icon as I have for the
common<00:02:37.830> icon<00:02:38.250> which<00:02:38.790> is<00:02:38.910> where<00:02:39.060> I've<00:02:39.150> got<00:02:39.239> 60

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
common icon which is where I've got 60

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.870 
common icon which is where I've got 60
and<00:02:39.780> 30<00:02:39.930> percent<00:02:40.440> visibility<00:02:41.010> which<00:02:41.640> means

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
and 30 percent visibility which means

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.180 
and 30 percent visibility which means
that<00:02:42.150> 60<00:02:42.630> percent<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.560> visibility<00:02:43.860> is

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
that 60 percent of the visibility is

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.710 
that 60 percent of the visibility is
there<00:02:44.370> when<00:02:44.550> I'm<00:02:44.640> zoomed<00:02:44.850> out<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.420> when<00:02:45.600> I'm

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
there when I'm zoomed out but when I'm

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.570 
there when I'm zoomed out but when I'm
aiming<00:02:45.989> down<00:02:46.110> sight<00:02:46.410> that<00:02:46.709> drops<00:02:47.010> down<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.220> 30

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
aiming down sight that drops down to 30

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.759 
aiming down sight that drops down to 30
percent<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:49.019> all<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.319> these<00:02:49.410> percentages

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
percent so all of these percentages

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.559 
percent so all of these percentages
probably<00:02:50.580> don't<00:02:50.790> make<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> huge<00:02:51.209> amount<00:02:51.510> of

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
probably don't make a huge amount of

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.880 
probably don't make a huge amount of
sense<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.319> probably<00:02:52.650> better<00:02:52.799> to

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
sense to you it's probably better to

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.650 
sense to you it's probably better to
show<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.250> some<00:02:53.519> gameplay<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:54.060> really<00:02:54.510> give

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
show you some gameplay to really give

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.840 
show you some gameplay to really give
you<00:02:54.780> an<00:02:54.870> idea<00:02:55.019> of<00:02:55.799> what<00:02:56.010> I'm<00:02:56.100> actually<00:02:56.250> talking

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
you an idea of what I'm actually talking

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.180

about<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.390> we'll<00:02:57.660> cut<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.959> some<00:02:58.080> gameplay<00:02:58.530> and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
about so we'll cut to some gameplay and

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.070 
about so we'll cut to some gameplay and
we'll<00:02:59.400> put<00:02:59.640> those<00:02:59.819> percentages<00:03:00.480> into<00:03:00.690> action

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
we'll put those percentages into action

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.410 
we'll put those percentages into action
just<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.380> can<00:03:01.530> see<00:03:01.650> what's<00:03:01.799> going<00:03:01.860> on<00:03:02.420> so

the moment where they're changing the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.090 
the moment where they're changing the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.069 
why I like it the M comm locations
actually<00:03:17.040> make<00:03:17.220> sense<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:18.090> maps<00:03:18.390> flow<00:03:18.750> and

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
actually make sense the maps flow and

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.500 
actually make sense the maps flow and
everything<00:03:19.590> works<00:03:19.859> properly<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.670> have<00:03:21.060> just

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
everything works properly I have just

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.110 
everything works properly I have just
frozen<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.140> gameplay<00:03:22.590> here<00:03:22.980> because<00:03:23.609> this<00:03:23.880> is

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
frozen the gameplay here because this is

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.819 
frozen the gameplay here because this is
a<00:03:24.150> great<00:03:24.450> chance<00:03:24.780> for<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.320> see<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
a great chance for you to see the

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.190 
a great chance for you to see the
difference<00:03:26.280> between<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.820> visibilities<00:03:27.450> now

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
difference between the visibilities now

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.310 
difference between the visibilities now
the<00:03:28.260> first<00:03:28.709> screenshot<00:03:29.100> shows<00:03:29.880> 60%<00:03:30.390> opacity

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
the first screenshot shows 60% opacity

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.430 
the first screenshot shows 60% opacity
on<00:03:31.530> all<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.130> HUD<00:03:32.340> icons<00:03:32.820> for<00:03:33.510> friendly<00:03:34.200> and

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
on all of the HUD icons for friendly and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.069 
on all of the HUD icons for friendly and
enemies<00:03:35.130> and<00:03:35.370> then<00:03:36.090> you'll<00:03:36.269> see<00:03:36.510> on<00:03:36.750> the

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
enemies and then you'll see on the

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.550 
enemies and then you'll see on the
second<00:03:37.650> one<00:03:37.829> there<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.340> 30%<00:03:38.850> opacity<00:03:39.299> for<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
second one there is 30% opacity for the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.190 
second one there is 30% opacity for the
friendly<00:03:41.190> icons<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:41.970> it's<00:03:42.420> still<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.900> hundred

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
friendly icons and it's still a hundred

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.190 
friendly icons and it's still a hundred
percent<00:03:43.769> for<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.430> enemy<00:03:44.820> icons<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.989> there

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
percent for the enemy icons so there

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.319 
percent for the enemy icons so there
gives<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> nice<00:03:47.040> comparison<00:03:47.790> between<00:03:47.940> the

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
gives you a nice comparison between the

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.800 
gives you a nice comparison between the
two<00:03:48.769> now<00:03:49.769> you<00:03:49.829> might<00:03:50.130> be<00:03:50.160> thinking<00:03:50.450> Westie<00:03:51.450> why

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
two now you might be thinking Westie why

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.330 
two now you might be thinking Westie why
are<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.079> showing<00:03:52.350> us<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.890> doesn't<00:03:53.190> make

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
are you showing us this it doesn't make

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.970 
are you showing us this it doesn't make
a<00:03:53.370> huge<00:03:53.850> difference<00:03:54.359> well<00:03:55.260> in<00:03:55.590> my<00:03:55.859> experience

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
a huge difference well in my experience

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.059 
a huge difference well in my experience
it<00:03:56.790> makes<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.329> massive<00:03:57.750> difference<00:03:57.989> because<00:03:58.829> if

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
it makes a massive difference because if

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.430 
it makes a massive difference because if
you're<00:03:59.250> in<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.670> tight<00:03:59.970> infantry<00:04:00.600> centric<00:04:01.019> area

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
you're in a tight infantry centric area

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.259 
you're in a tight infantry centric area
especially<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.489> part<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:03.000> Road

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
especially this part of Road

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.699 
especially this part of Road
transmission<00:04:03.930> is<00:04:04.019> a<00:04:04.049> really<00:04:04.350> good<00:04:04.500> place<00:04:04.680> to

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
transmission is a really good place to

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.650 
transmission is a really good place to
show<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.220> because<00:04:05.700> not<00:04:05.910> many<00:04:06.000> vehicles<00:04:06.359> can

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
show it because not many vehicles can

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.270 
show it because not many vehicles can

can get in and around down here

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.420 
can get in and around down here
and<00:04:12.959> when<00:04:13.139> there<00:04:13.260> are<00:04:13.380> lots<00:04:13.590> of<00:04:13.739> icons<00:04:14.160> on<00:04:14.280> the

and when there are lots of icons on the

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
screen it makes a massive difference

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.199

doesn't<00:05:01.379> actually<00:05:01.530> move<00:05:01.949> from<00:05:02.159> the<00:05:02.310> center<00:05:02.580> of

doesn't actually move from the center of
the<00:05:02.729> screen<00:05:02.940> anymore<00:05:03.479> the<00:05:03.810> frame<00:05:04.530> of<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:05.219> site

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
the screen anymore the frame of the site

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.879 
the screen anymore the frame of the site
moves<00:05:05.909> around<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.389> outside<00:05:06.780> of<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:07.050> now<00:05:07.680> in

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
moves around the outside of it now in

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.070 
moves around the outside of it now in
battlefield<00:05:08.370> 4<00:05:08.430> there<00:05:08.940> is<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.330> visual<00:05:09.870> recoil

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
battlefield 4 there is a visual recoil

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.339 
battlefield 4 there is a visual recoil
and<00:05:10.650> true<00:05:11.370> recoil<00:05:11.879> visual<00:05:12.629> recoil<00:05:12.840> is<00:05:13.169> just

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
and true recoil visual recoil is just

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:14.839 
and true recoil visual recoil is just
where<00:05:13.469> the<00:05:13.560> gun<00:05:13.740> bounces<00:05:14.190> around<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.610> true

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
where the gun bounces around and true

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.029 
where the gun bounces around and true
recall<00:05:15.240> is<00:05:15.360> where<00:05:15.509> your<00:05:15.629> bullets<00:05:15.779> go<00:05:16.139> with<00:05:16.830> the

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
recall is where your bullets go with the

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.920 
recall is where your bullets go with the
recoil<00:05:17.460> of<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.639> weapon<00:05:17.729> those<00:05:18.569> don't

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
recoil of the weapon those don't

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.010 
recoil of the weapon those don't
actually<00:05:19.110> add<00:05:19.590> up<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:20.279> the<00:05:20.879> fix<00:05:21.419> for<00:05:21.690> that<00:05:21.719> is

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
actually add up and the fix for that is

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.019 
actually add up and the fix for that is
to<00:05:22.289> keep<00:05:22.439> the<00:05:22.590> reticle<00:05:22.949> where<00:05:23.430> your<00:05:23.669> bullets

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.029 
to keep the reticle where your bullets

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:26.480 
to keep the reticle where your bullets
are<00:05:24.120> actually<00:05:24.539> going<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.139> then<00:05:25.919> move<00:05:26.250> the

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
are actually going and then move the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.459 
are actually going and then move the
sight<00:05:26.699> and<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.939> gun<00:05:27.150> around<00:05:27.449> it<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:28.080> it's<00:05:28.259> kind

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
sight and the gun around it so it's kind

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.559 
sight and the gun around it so it's kind
of<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.710> fix<00:05:28.949> for<00:05:29.279> something<00:05:29.639> that<00:05:29.849> they<00:05:30.240> can't

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
of a fix for something that they can't

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.659 
of a fix for something that they can't
really<00:05:30.870> roll<00:05:31.199> back<00:05:31.440> on<00:05:31.680> now<00:05:32.190> I<00:05:32.219> don't<00:05:32.370> really

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
really roll back on now I don't really

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.550 
really roll back on now I don't really
know<00:05:32.879> why<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.180> decision<00:05:33.779> was<00:05:33.930> made<00:05:34.139> that<00:05:34.199> the

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
know why the decision was made that the

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.010 
know why the decision was made that the
visual<00:05:35.039> recoil<00:05:35.279> should<00:05:35.819> be<00:05:35.940> higher<00:05:36.240> than<00:05:36.960> what

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
visual recoil should be higher than what

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.290 
visual recoil should be higher than what
the<00:05:37.319> actual<00:05:37.529> recoil<00:05:38.159> of<00:05:38.250> the<00:05:38.279> weapon<00:05:38.370> is<00:05:38.789> but

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
the actual recoil of the weapon is but

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.059 
the actual recoil of the weapon is but
it<00:05:39.389> does<00:05:39.629> give<00:05:39.839> me<00:05:39.870> an<00:05:40.080> explanation<00:05:40.409> as<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:40.830> why

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:41.069 
it does give me an explanation as to why

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.100 
it does give me an explanation as to why
sometimes<00:05:41.430> when<00:05:41.940> you're<00:05:42.089> aiming<00:05:42.330> at<00:05:42.599> somebody

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
sometimes when you're aiming at somebody

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.860 
sometimes when you're aiming at somebody
in<00:05:43.409> battlefield<00:05:44.069> 4<00:05:44.129> vanilla<00:05:44.669> your<00:05:45.449> bullets

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
in battlefield 4 vanilla your bullets

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.719 
in battlefield 4 vanilla your bullets
don't<00:05:46.139> hit<00:05:46.440> them<00:05:46.650> because<00:05:47.009> the<00:05:47.159> visual<00:05:47.370> recoil

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
don't hit them because the visual recoil

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.610 
don't hit them because the visual recoil
is<00:05:48.180> higher<00:05:48.449> so<00:05:48.750> you're<00:05:48.900> trying<00:05:49.080> to<00:05:49.199> compensate

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
is higher so you're trying to compensate

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.559 
is higher so you're trying to compensate
for<00:05:50.129> that<00:05:50.190> but<00:05:51.000> your<00:05:51.120> bullets<00:05:51.419> aren't

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569 
for that but your bullets aren't

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.059 
for that but your bullets aren't
actually<00:05:51.839> going<00:05:51.870> anywhere<00:05:52.529> near<00:05:52.800> where

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:53.069 
actually going anywhere near where

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.740 
actually going anywhere near where
you're<00:05:53.250> actually<00:05:53.669> aiming<00:05:53.909> because<00:05:54.539> the

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
you're actually aiming because the

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.360 
you're actually aiming because the
recoil<00:05:54.990> is<00:05:55.379> different<00:05:55.800> from<00:05:55.889> what's<00:05:56.129> being

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
recoil is different from what's being

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.760 
recoil is different from what's being
shown<00:05:56.729> as<00:05:57.000> I<00:05:57.539> say<00:05:57.870> I<00:05:57.900> don't<00:05:58.080> really<00:05:58.379> know<00:05:58.560> why

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
shown as I say I don't really know why

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.529 
shown as I say I don't really know why
that<00:05:58.949> decision<00:05:59.219> was<00:05:59.370> ever<00:05:59.639> made<00:05:59.879> I<00:05:59.909> guess<00:06:00.150> it

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
that decision was ever made I guess it

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.570 
that decision was ever made I guess it
was<00:06:00.659> for<00:06:00.690> realism<00:06:01.379> but<00:06:01.560> I'm<00:06:01.770> really<00:06:02.400> happy

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
was for realism but I'm really happy

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.300 
was for realism but I'm really happy
that<00:06:02.849> they<00:06:02.969> fixed<00:06:03.330> that<00:06:03.389> now<00:06:03.740> so<00:06:04.740> yes<00:06:04.979> some

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
that they fixed that now so yes some

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.850 
that they fixed that now so yes some
real<00:06:05.580> fixes<00:06:06.270> coming<00:06:06.810> into<00:06:06.930> CT<00:06:07.349> not<00:06:07.620> that<00:06:07.770> they

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
real fixes coming into CT not that they

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.980 
real fixes coming into CT not that they
haven't<00:06:08.069> been<00:06:08.310> real<00:06:08.699> ones<00:06:09.000> already<00:06:09.449> but<00:06:09.719> this

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
haven't been real ones already but this

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.159 
haven't been real ones already but this
was<00:06:10.349> one<00:06:10.710> that<00:06:11.099> really<00:06:11.310> caught<00:06:11.940> my<00:06:12.120> attention

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
was one that really caught my attention

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.420 
was one that really caught my attention
especially<00:06:13.169> with<00:06:13.319> the<00:06:13.409> HUD<00:06:13.589> visibility<00:06:14.190> and

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
especially with the HUD visibility and

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.369 
especially with the HUD visibility and
then<00:06:14.879> secondly<00:06:15.360> with<00:06:15.599> that<00:06:15.779> visual<00:06:16.139> recoil

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:16.379 
then secondly with that visual recoil

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:18.260 
then secondly with that visual recoil
just<00:06:17.219> wanted<00:06:17.430> to<00:06:17.490> keep<00:06:17.639> you<00:06:17.819> up<00:06:17.940> to<00:06:17.969> date<00:06:18.089> with

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
just wanted to keep you up to date with

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.490 
just wanted to keep you up to date with
all<00:06:18.539> the<00:06:18.569> things<00:06:18.870> that<00:06:18.960> you're<00:06:19.169> gonna<00:06:19.319> be
