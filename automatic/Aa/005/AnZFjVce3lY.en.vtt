relatively high that mine is as you see
eighty<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.960> have<00:02:25.550> not<00:02:26.550> got<00:02:26.760> too<00:02:27.090> many<00:02:27.270> perks

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
eighty I have not got too many perks

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.660 
eighty I have not got too many perks
into<00:02:28.140> it<00:02:28.260> but<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.430> can<00:02:30.000> still<00:02:30.180> enchant<00:02:31.670> 5%

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
into it but I can still enchant 5%

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.170 
into it but I can still enchant 5%
better<00:02:33.080> then<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.560> default<00:02:35.190> drag<00:02:35.820> of<00:02:35.970> robes

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
better then the default drag of robes

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.570 
better then the default drag of robes
and<00:02:36.650> even<00:02:37.650> then<00:02:37.770> that's<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.040> an<00:02:38.190> improvement

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
and even then that's just an improvement

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.350 
and even then that's just an improvement
that's<00:02:40.010> very<00:02:41.010> minor<00:02:41.370> but<00:02:41.820> also<00:02:41.970> very

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
that's very minor but also very

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.770 
that's very minor but also very
important<00:02:42.960> when<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.530> get<00:02:43.740> into<00:02:44.540> fighting<00:02:45.540> the

difficult battles that every little

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.710 
difficult battles that every little
