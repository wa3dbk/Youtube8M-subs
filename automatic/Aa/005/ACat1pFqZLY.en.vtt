00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
what we need to do is we need to remove

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:51.799 
what we need to do is we need to remove
one<00:00:43.820> to<00:00:46.460> two<00:00:47.460> there<00:00:48.950> three<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.629> number<00:00:51.629> four

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
one to two there three and number four

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.979 
one to two there three and number four
so<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.590> remove<00:00:53.070> those<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.910> then<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.719> top

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
so you remove those and then the top

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.189 
so you remove those and then the top
comes<00:00:55.320> off<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.340> saves<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.850> from<00:00:57.199> having

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
to replace replace these here see what

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.330 
to replace replace these here see what
what<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> did<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.780> lifted<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.740> broke<00:01:08.100> off

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
what I did was I lifted it I broke off

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.090 
what I did was I lifted it I broke off
the<00:01:08.520> end<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> each<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.659> these<00:01:09.750> cost<00:01:10.049> about<00:01:10.290> $50

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
the end and each of these cost about $50

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.890

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
have been solved as simple as a bathroom

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.520 
have been solved as simple as a bathroom
key<00:01:28.320> or<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> paperclip<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:30.259> right<00:01:31.259> at<00:01:31.409> the

right over here at the bottom of the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.690 
right over here at the bottom of the
your<00:01:36.360> ignition<00:01:36.780> there's<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.799> little<00:01:38.100> hole<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
your ignition there's a little hole and

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.850 
your ignition there's a little hole and
in<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.780> hole<00:01:40.049> that's<00:01:40.320> where<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> gas<00:01:40.799> comes

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
in that hole that's where the gas comes

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.179 
in that hole that's where the gas comes
out<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.820> natural<00:01:42.240> gas<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.630> propane<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
out of the natural gas or propane and it

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460 
out of the natural gas or propane and it
lights<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.670> an<00:01:44.820> example<00:01:45.360> right<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.290> will

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
lights it an example right here you will

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.280 
lights it an example right here you will
see<00:01:48.770> see<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:50.270> so<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.479> gas<00:01:51.689> comes<00:01:51.990> out<00:01:52.140> of

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
see see that so the gas comes out of

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.639 
see see that so the gas comes out of
here<00:01:52.649> lights<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.399> rest<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.880> burners<00:01:54.270> so

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
here lights the rest of the burners so

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.050 
here lights the rest of the burners so
what<00:01:55.649> was<00:01:55.829> happening<00:01:56.310> was<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.790> wasn't

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
what was happening was this wasn't

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.999 
what was happening was this wasn't
lighting<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.930> because<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.439> was<00:01:58.680> clogged

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
lighting it's because this was clogged

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.520 
lighting it's because this was clogged
with<00:01:59.280> food<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.969> other<00:02:00.090> products<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.259> all<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
with food and other products so all you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.340 
with food and other products so all you
got<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.189> kind<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.430> clean<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.700> out

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
got to do is just kind of clean it out

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.410 
got to do is just kind of clean it out
take<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.409> paper<00:02:04.770> clip<00:02:05.009> real<00:02:05.520> fine<00:02:05.820> paper<00:02:06.060> clip

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
take a paper clip real fine paper clip

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.160 
take a paper clip real fine paper clip
and<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.840> kind<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.170> getting<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.890> out<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.310> way

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
and just kind of getting it out this way

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.490 
and just kind of getting it out this way
now

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
now

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.400 
now
so<00:02:10.590> now<00:02:11.550> if<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:11.850> step<00:02:12.210> back<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.720> second<00:02:13.200> you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
so now if you step back for a second you

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:20.990 
so now if you step back for a second you
will<00:02:13.590> see<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:14.840> light<00:02:17.210> see<00:02:18.210> that<00:02:19.430> there<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.580> goes

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
will see it light see that there it goes

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.020 
will see it light see that there it goes
so<00:02:22.010> all<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.340> problem<00:02:23.760> could<00:02:23.880> have<00:02:23.940> been

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
so all of this problem could have been

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.930 
so all of this problem could have been
solved<00:02:24.600> just<00:02:24.750> with<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> paper<00:02:25.680> clip<00:02:25.800> or<00:02:26.250> or

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
solved just with a paper clip or or

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.000 
solved just with a paper clip or or
light<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.530> take<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.890> off

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
light and if you have to take it off

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.670 
light and if you have to take it off
make<00:02:29.430> sure<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.790> take<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> burner<00:02:30.530> lift<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
make sure you take the burner lift the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.580 
make sure you take the burner lift the
four<00:02:31.920> screws<00:02:32.400> lift<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.510> hand<00:02:33.720> lift<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.350> top

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
four screws lift the hand lift the top

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.340 
four screws lift the hand lift the top
and<00:02:34.920> there<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.100> go<00:02:35.340> replacing<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.030> that's<00:02:36.959> it

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
and there you go replacing it that's it

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.300 
and there you go replacing it that's it
that's<00:02:37.620> what<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.800> got<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.250> maytag<00:02:38.790> gas<00:02:38.820> range
