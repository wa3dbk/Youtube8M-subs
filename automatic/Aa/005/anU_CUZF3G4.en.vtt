00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
oh wow do you hear that but this is the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.160 
oh wow do you hear that but this is the
demo<00:03:36.750> level<00:03:37.050> that<00:03:38.040> wasn't<00:03:41.540> DeGeneres<00:03:42.540> okay

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
demo level that wasn't DeGeneres okay

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.150 
demo level that wasn't DeGeneres okay
just<00:03:43.920> give<00:03:44.160> me<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.280> sec

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:59.510 

nice

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.120 

so<00:04:00.520> they<00:04:00.700> actually<00:04:00.790> run<00:04:01.330> an<00:04:02.050> ellipse<00:04:02.770> not<00:04:03.100> a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
so they actually run an ellipse not a

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.760 
so they actually run an ellipse not a
selfie<00:04:03.760> circle<00:04:05.880> moving<00:04:06.880> out<00:04:07.030> there<00:04:07.620> so<00:04:08.620> that's

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
selfie circle moving out there so that's

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:17.539 
selfie circle moving out there so that's
very<00:04:09.070> significant<00:04:10.050> give<00:04:11.050> out<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.770> little<00:04:12.960> orbit

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.260 

just<00:04:18.549> like<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:19.200> astronomer<00:04:20.200> from<00:04:20.799> D<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:22.060> act

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
just like the astronomer from D the act

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.220 
just like the astronomer from D the act
stand<00:04:22.810> wait<00:04:23.170> no<00:04:23.620> it's<00:04:23.800> really<00:04:24.070> accurate

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
stand wait no it's really accurate

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:40.200 
stand wait no it's really accurate

physics I love the music Andy did she

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.930 
physics I love the music Andy did she
know<00:04:40.660> it's<00:04:40.990> hot<00:04:41.200> teaches<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:41.980> something
