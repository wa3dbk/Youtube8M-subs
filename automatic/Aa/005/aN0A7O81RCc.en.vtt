00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
inside the airplane zero G's so you have

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.190 
inside the airplane zero G's so you have
to<00:01:21.700> put<00:01:21.850> a<00:01:21.880> rack<00:01:22.150> in<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.509> airplane<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:26.049> would

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
to put a rack in the airplane it would

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.539 
to put a rack in the airplane it would

a pallet and slides into the rails I'm
using<00:01:38.409> plastic<00:01:39.009> here<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:40.390> could<00:01:40.570> use<00:01:42.360> light

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
using plastic here you could use light

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.740 
using plastic here you could use light
ply<00:01:43.720> or<00:01:44.289> aircraft<00:01:45.009> grade<00:01:45.310> ply<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:46.360> make<00:01:46.569> that

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
ply or aircraft grade ply to make that

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:55.440 
ply or aircraft grade ply to make that
happen

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.650 

and<00:01:56.450> then<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.690> pushes<00:01:56.870> them<00:01:57.400> pushes<00:01:58.400> it<00:01:58.520> out

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.680

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
keep closing and shuts off the power and

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.990 
keep closing and shuts off the power and
the<00:02:06.080> loads<00:02:06.260> gone<00:02:07.960> now<00:02:08.960> the<00:02:09.080> problem<00:02:09.500> is

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
the loads gone now the problem is

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.270 
the loads gone now the problem is
getting<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.120> parachute<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.750> open<00:02:11.900> after<00:02:12.710> it's

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
getting the parachute to open after it's

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.000 
getting the parachute to open after it's
left<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.700> airplane<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:15.530> don't<00:02:15.740> want<00:02:15.890> it

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010
