00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello my glamourous core today I 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.870
 I bring a guy there how to make a stand 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.889
 to charge your cell phone 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.990
 so it is very simple and easy to do and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.990
 if you want to learn is to just come with me 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:29.580
 the material we will need is a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:36.149
 shampoo bottle scissors or knife 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.780
 the nail polish nail polish and of course 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:44.280
 our charger 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:47.910
 so let's start then, loves 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.300
 you start by cutting off a 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.300
 people we will not need her 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:04.370
 then you pick up your cell phone and 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.370
 measure up to where I hit you on the shampoo glass 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.680
 then you measure 4 fingers down and make a 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.680
 other marking 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.900
 This is going to be the mark we are going to cut 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.509
 with scissors preferably sped a 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.610
 good scissors because mine is the river 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.610
 It was a little tricky to cut 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.200
 and then after you cut the stick 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.759
 just as he had 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.759
 you make the finish 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.630
 after making the parliament will be more 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.860
 or less so it's not much at all 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.500
 Perfect 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.110
 and then I'll mark the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.030
 charger with the charger itself 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:14.180
 even make a mark zinha and there 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.989
 after making the mark I'll cut 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.269
 This part that's going to be where I go. 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:25.130
 the charger is to leave the 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.930
 sweat stuck in a room a little 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.400
 complicated if you have a stylus 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.010
 helps a lot 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:39.260
 I had not then it was more complicated 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:41.209
 cut and then I'll get him 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.000
 to finish in this 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:49.970
 part and now it's ready it's just missing 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.920
 to paint, I chose the backyard enamel 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.470
 I found it very happy, can you do it? 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.700
 ink with a contact you have 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.100
 in your house 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.390
 so this girls this was the result 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.140
 Last 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.239
 I found this glitter very beautiful and without 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.700

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.690
