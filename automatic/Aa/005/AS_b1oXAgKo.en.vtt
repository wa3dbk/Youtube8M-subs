00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
experiment started ok so I'm going to

00:00:47.170 --> 00:03:00.700 
experiment started ok so I'm going to
grab<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.440> orange<00:00:47.680> juice

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.120 

you

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.380 

so<00:03:04.130> what<00:03:04.370> you're<00:03:04.520> seeing<00:03:04.730> right<00:03:04.850> now<00:03:05.000> is<00:03:05.180> the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
so what you're seeing right now is the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.760 
so what you're seeing right now is the
BCI<00:03:05.750> is<00:03:06.170> currently<00:03:06.710> on<00:03:06.920> and<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:09.140> red<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.590> what

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
BCI is currently on and the red is what

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.350 
BCI is currently on and the red is what
it<00:03:09.890> thinks<00:03:10.040> I'm<00:03:10.190> looking<00:03:10.520> at<00:03:10.640> but<00:03:10.940> because<00:03:11.210> I'm

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
it thinks I'm looking at but because I'm

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.930 
it thinks I'm looking at but because I'm
not<00:03:11.450> concentrating<00:03:12.320> it's<00:03:12.650> just<00:03:14.740> randomly

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
not concentrating it's just randomly

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.370 
not concentrating it's just randomly
selecting<00:03:16.940> things<00:03:17.150> right<00:03:17.480> now<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.990> so<00:03:18.200> we're

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
selecting things right now and so we're

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.540 
selecting things right now and so we're
about<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.770> play<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.370> shell<00:03:19.910> game<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:21.550> they're

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
about to play a shell game so they're

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.000 
about to play a shell game so they're
not<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:22.880> going<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.180> start<00:03:23.510> here<00:03:23.800> so<00:03:24.800> once

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
not just going to start here so once

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.720 
not just going to start here so once
women<00:03:25.220> osh<00:03:25.520> mixes<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.420> cups<00:03:26.630> up<00:03:26.900> he<00:03:27.730> signals

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
women osh mixes the cups up he signals

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.000 
women osh mixes the cups up he signals
to<00:03:29.570> my<00:03:29.720> system<00:03:30.080> on<00:03:30.230> this<00:03:30.350> side<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.800> it's

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
to my system on this side that it's

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.940 
to my system on this side that it's
ready<00:03:31.190> for<00:03:31.400> my<00:03:31.520> control<00:03:32.740> that's<00:03:33.740> how<00:03:33.890> the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
ready for my control that's how the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.250 
ready for my control that's how the
control<00:03:34.520> has<00:03:34.640> turned<00:03:34.850> over<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.120> me<00:03:35.330> and<00:03:35.540> the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
control has turned over to me and the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.700 
control has turned over to me and the
object<00:03:36.620> detection<00:03:36.920> on<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.190> table<00:03:38.620> finds<00:03:39.620> the

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
object detection on the table finds the

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.350 
object detection on the table finds the
cups<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.040> numbers<00:03:40.370> them<00:03:40.490> for<00:03:40.730> me<00:03:40.850> so<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:41.060> can

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
cups and numbers them for me so I can

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.030 
cups and numbers them for me so I can
choose<00:03:41.780> which<00:03:41.960> one<00:03:42.080> to<00:03:42.110> select

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.020 

all<00:03:50.040> right<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.220> think<00:03:50.280> think<00:03:50.670> we<00:03:50.700> got<00:03:50.879> have<00:03:50.970> a

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
all right I think think we got have a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:17.080 
all right I think think we got have a
fear<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:51.300> time

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.439 

ah<00:04:17.350> success<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:21.680> that<00:04:22.010> is<00:04:22.310> our<00:04:22.610> demonstration

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
ah success so that is our demonstration

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.930 
ah success so that is our demonstration
number<00:04:23.600> two
