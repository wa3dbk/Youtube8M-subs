works<00:00:52.600> now<00:00:52.870> it's<00:00:53.170> up<00:00:53.620> for<00:00:53.739> some<00:00:54.010> reason<00:00:54.339> to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:54.549 
works now it's up for some reason to

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:56.250 
works now it's up for some reason to
slider<00:00:54.909> I<00:00:55.089> really<00:00:55.690> don't<00:00:55.809> get<00:00:55.899> why<00:00:56.049> it's<00:00:56.199> a

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
slider I really don't get why it's a

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.349 
slider I really don't get why it's a
slider<00:00:56.589> but<00:00:57.249> it<00:00:57.370> is<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.519> slider<00:00:57.879> and<00:00:58.149> there<00:00:58.269> are

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
slider but it is a slider and there are

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
orientation angle I don't know that is

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.130 
orientation angle I don't know that is
pretty<00:01:04.150> sweet<00:01:04.420> though<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:04.809> that's<00:01:04.870> something

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
are a lot more accurate now if you're

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.880 
are a lot more accurate now if you're
watching<00:01:22.450> my<00:01:22.810> let's<00:01:23.079> play<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.350> went<00:01:23.619> into<00:01:23.710> the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
watching my let's play I went into the

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.069 
watching my let's play I went into the
nether<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.340> gas<00:01:24.850> just<00:01:25.299> they<00:01:25.600> just<00:01:25.630> couldn't

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 
nether and gas just they just couldn't

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:28.770 
nether and gas just they just couldn't
hit<00:01:26.380> me<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:26.859> it<00:01:27.250> was<00:01:27.430> weird<00:01:27.700> but<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.149> think

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
hit me and it was weird but I think

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.730 
hit me and it was weird but I think
they're<00:01:28.990> supposed<00:01:29.229> to<00:01:29.289> be<00:01:29.439> a<00:01:29.469> little<00:01:29.590> more

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
they're supposed to be a little more

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.380 
they're supposed to be a little more
accurate<00:01:30.189> now<00:01:30.310> I'll<00:01:30.670> have<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.880> play<00:01:31.090> with<00:01:31.210> that

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390
