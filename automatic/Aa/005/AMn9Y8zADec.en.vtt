00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.449
 for 1 6 dolls we need 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.089
 four identical pencils 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.219
 I have a pencil and sharpened and with 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.430
 rezinochkami can be used just not 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:07.210

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.170
 we also need cardboard pencil 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.560
 for cutting with a ruler for cutting 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 brush for paints brush for glue 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:26.110

 toothpick paint 4 beads with large 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.179
 hole and hot glue for a start we 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.299
 we cut out 20 rectangles of size 9 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:42.629
 centimeters by four centimeters this 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:45.340
 future shelves will take 5 

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:49.020

 fuke we will later paint on 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.750
 painted cardboard paint falls bad 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.740
 so when gluing the canopy we follow 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.810
 ensuring that both surfaces of the shelf are with us 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.000
 they were not painted like that 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.040
 after all the cardboard we glue it 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.820
