00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:08.200
 hello I'm emilia feint let's cook 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.140
 Baked chicken drumsticks is a recipe 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.540
 very simple that I'm going to teach you the 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.410
 step by step and 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:23.279
 half an hour or less you have done it 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.279
 let's start by peeling some potatoes 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.820
 I imagine that anyone knows 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.570
 doing it is not 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.570
 It is very simple 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.320
 once you have the peeled potatoes 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.579
 cut into slices 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.950
 and put on a tray to put it 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.160
 baked 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.120
 we are going to add a little oil 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.150
 olive and on top very little salt and 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.060
 a little bit of pepper but but very very 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.410
 very little good at ease everyone but 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:10.700
 I think the spiciness should not be 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.350
 healthy after we take the chicken thighs 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.610
 Y 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:20.090
 what we are going to do is remove the skin 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:26.240
 because if the thighs are for purchase 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:29.670
 the skin is not healthy , however, if 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.350
 you have free range chicken 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.890
 and you know what 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.979
 feeding the chicken then the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.509
 skin does not need to be removed in fact 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.509
 crunchy is delicious 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.270
 whatever 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.680
 What I usually do is take away the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.680
 skin 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.840
 then once the skin is removed what 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.840
 let's do is wash them 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.679
 and once washed 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.310
 we are going to place in the tray 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.310
 A) Yes 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.890
 and now what he touches is 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.280
 season what is very simple 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.239
 let's start with salt 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:38.769
 what I always say that you do not have to throw 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:43.099
 a lot of good salt, especially there are people who 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.750
 salt does not get it right but for the 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.840
 people who can talk a 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.989
 bit 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.709
 It would not hurt a tad pepper 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.200
 black but very little as I said 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.650
 before 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.650
 Y 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.719
 and finally sweet paprika 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.310
 this is a very cheap recipe and it is very 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.910
 very easy to do 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.420
 I 've always liked to add a separate 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.989
 of the potatoes a little bit of support 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.380
 It always tasted great and it's 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.920
 antioxidant now that we live in the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:31.209
 era of the antioxidant that 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:34.959
 found everywhere because one thing 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.330
 that our grandparents did not teach us is 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:42.870
 precisely 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:49.890
 the garlic what I'm going to do is 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:52.489
 a carlos knife to take out all his 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.489
 power 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:00.170
 there are people who like to take away the 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.230
 skin to me not because I think that 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.599
 that is going to give very good flavor but 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:12.069
 good if you want to take the 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:16.349
 Well, now we're going to 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.349
 and add some olive oil 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.230
 unhappy love 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.680
 this for what 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:37.220
 that the meat does not dry in the oven 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.220
 there's going to be one thing left and I like to add 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.440
 it is clear 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.440
 a little white wine 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.100
 these are all the ingredients 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:02.810
 and now what we are going to do is in the 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.480
 preheated oven I have already put the 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:10.540
 oven 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:14.850
 I do not know if it looks at 175 degrees and what 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.850
 I usually do is put it in motion 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.789
 so I know that this one could for the two 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.789
 sides 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:31.590
 and now the only thing that needs to be done is 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:34.680
 keep an eye on the oven and every 15 or so 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:37.260
 minutes we are going to turn around the 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:42.070
 thighs to brown for two 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.420
 parts and what I usually do is 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:49.740
 pour over a bit of the juice that 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.740
 is forming in the tray 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.980
 the cooking time I'm not going to 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:01.040
 say because it depends on the meat that 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.100
 you are putting and meats that 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.210
 that are very tender so then with 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.850
 half an hour is enough but if they are a 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:15.440
 little bit more mature then they need 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:18.820
 a little more that yes with pricking it with a 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.820
 stick same 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.520
 you will realize when it is done 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.740
 because when it is already done in the flesh 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.040
 it is very easy to click the however 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.820
 if it 's raw then when you puncture it with 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:35.830
 the stick 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.830
 and it's going to cost you a little bit more 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:44.060
 thank you very much and I hope that my advice 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.060
 have helped you until then
