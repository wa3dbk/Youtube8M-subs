00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
program was filling a niche but we

program was filling a niche but we
wanted<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.190> do<00:00:11.340> something<00:00:11.670> that<00:00:11.759> was<00:00:11.849> really

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
wanted to do something that was really

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.470 
wanted to do something that was really
ahead<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> curve<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.849> was<00:00:14.849> an<00:00:15.000> exemplary

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
project Passivhaus really is a

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.080 
project Passivhaus really is a
cutting-edge<00:00:18.720> energy<00:00:19.710> standard<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.460> if

cutting-edge energy standard and if

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.550 
cutting-edge energy standard and if
people<00:00:21.840> are<00:00:21.930> concerned<00:00:22.199> about<00:00:22.470> global

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560

warming<00:00:23.300> buildings<00:00:24.300> use<00:00:24.539> we've<00:00:25.080> heard<00:00:25.260> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
warming buildings use we've heard the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.410 
warming buildings use we've heard the
numbers<00:00:25.650> before<00:00:25.800> forty<00:00:26.400> percent<00:00:26.849> or<00:00:27.090> whatever

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
numbers before forty percent or whatever

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.509 
numbers before forty percent or whatever
it<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.050> energy<00:00:28.650> use<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> country

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
it is of the energy use in the country

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.490 
it is of the energy use in the country
and<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> wanted<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> try<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> build<00:00:31.349> an

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
and so I wanted to try to build an

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.370 
and so I wanted to try to build an
example<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.489> yellow<00:00:32.820> springs<00:00:33.059> Ohio<00:00:33.600> as

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
example here in yellow springs Ohio as

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.430 
example here in yellow springs Ohio as
to<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.250> show<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.690> possible<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.350> we

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
to to show that this is possible that we

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.780 
to to show that this is possible that we
can<00:00:37.530> actually<00:00:37.649> make<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> dent<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.460> something

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
can actually make a dent in something

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.150 
can actually make a dent in something
like<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:40.320> house<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
like that and this house is going to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.860 
like that and this house is going to
cost<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.520> hundred<00:00:41.610> dollars<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> year<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.540> eating

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
cost a hundred dollars a year to eating

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.660 
cost a hundred dollars a year to eating
cool<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.350> think<00:00:44.190> that's<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.430> pretty<00:00:44.550> powerful

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
cool I think that's a pretty powerful

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
cool I think that's a pretty powerful
statement<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> extent<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> research

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
statement to the extent of the research

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.380 
statement to the extent of the research
we've<00:00:50.129> done<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.610> think<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> very

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
we've done we think this is the very

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.990 
we've done we think this is the very
first<00:00:51.539> passive<00:00:52.410> house<00:00:52.590> built<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.129> Ohio<00:00:53.489> the

first passive house built in Ohio the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.439 
first passive house built in Ohio the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
suspended two layers of a clear film so

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.330 
suspended two layers of a clear film so
it<00:03:57.730> essentially<00:03:58.210> acts<00:03:58.600> as<00:03:58.960> a<00:03:59.530> four<00:04:00.070> pane

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
it essentially acts as a four pane

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.690 
it essentially acts as a four pane
window<00:04:01.150> without<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.960> weight<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.470> four<00:04:03.430> panes

window without the weight of four panes
of<00:04:03.820> glass<00:04:03.930> these<00:04:04.930> are<00:04:05.080> poor<00:04:05.260> cell<00:04:05.470> facing

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
of glass these are poor cell facing

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.800 
of glass these are poor cell facing
windows<00:04:06.250> so<00:04:06.430> they<00:04:06.550> have<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.730> very<00:04:06.940> high<00:04:07.210> solar

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
windows so they have a very high solar

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.840 
windows so they have a very high solar
heat<00:04:08.140> gain<00:04:08.170> coefficient<00:04:08.620> meaning<00:04:09.400> they<00:04:09.520> let<00:04:09.700> a
