00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
treatments and that's very personal as

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.800 
treatments and that's very personal as
to<00:01:47.950> how<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.100> judge<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:49.060> severity<00:01:49.510> of<00:01:49.600> that

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
pain because most of these are not

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.929 
pain because most of these are not
permanent<00:01:53.290> you<00:01:53.890> do<00:01:54.040> have<00:01:54.189> to<00:01:54.250> have<00:01:54.549> repeat

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
permanent you do have to have repeat

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.880 
permanent you do have to have repeat
treatments<00:01:55.420> somewhere<00:01:56.020> between<00:01:56.170> three<00:01:56.740> and

away after a couple of months but that's
annoying<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.769> you<00:02:14.769> can<00:02:15.010> get<00:02:15.189> bruising<00:02:15.670> as<00:02:15.790> a

doctor

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.060 
doctor
because<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.750> filler<00:02:20.960> injections<00:02:21.200> go<00:02:21.830> deep

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
because the filler injections go deep

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.250 
because the filler injections go deep
and<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.850> just<00:02:23.060> can't<00:02:23.330> tell<00:02:23.570> if<00:02:23.810> there<00:02:24.050> are<00:02:24.170> any

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
and you just can't tell if there are any

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.800 
and you just can't tell if there are any
blood<00:02:24.560> vessels<00:02:24.950> there<00:02:25.210> but<00:02:26.210> last<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.720> most

blood vessels there but last and most

blood vessels there but last and most
important<00:02:27.440> there<00:02:27.860> are<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.130> certain

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
important there are just certain

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.850 
important there are just certain
limitations<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.990> what<00:02:30.020> fillers<00:02:30.470> can<00:02:30.710> do

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
limitations to what fillers can do

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.150 
limitations to what fillers can do
because<00:02:31.580> fillers<00:02:32.090> restore<00:02:32.570> lost<00:02:33.110> volume<00:02:33.380> but

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
because fillers restore lost volume but

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.210 
because fillers restore lost volume but
they<00:02:34.250> don't<00:02:34.460> restore<00:02:34.970> lost<00:02:35.510> elasticity<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:37.070> as

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
they don't restore lost elasticity so as

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.310 
they don't restore lost elasticity so as
your<00:02:37.400> skin<00:02:37.670> continues<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.660> sag<00:02:38.900> there's<00:02:39.260> a

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
your skin continues to sag there's a

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.560 
your skin continues to sag there's a
certain<00:02:39.530> point<00:02:39.680> when<00:02:40.400> fillers<00:02:40.670> just<00:02:41.150> don't<00:02:41.420> do

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
certain point when fillers just don't do

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.450 
certain point when fillers just don't do
enough<00:02:41.810> for<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.470> if<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.100> want<00:02:43.280> that

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
enough for you and if you want that

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.070 
enough for you and if you want that
corrected<00:02:44.000> then<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:44.570> do<00:02:44.750> have<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:45.050> have

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
corrected then you do have to have

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.860 
corrected then you do have to have
