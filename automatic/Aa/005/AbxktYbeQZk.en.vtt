00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.839
 hi friends how are you and we are here 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.379
 again with a new project so 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:14.199
 let's start with the materials and the 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:18.070
 materials are therefore some old irises 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:22.420
 I am no longer using a cutter or 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.240
 blade this carpenter tape 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.930
 a little picture out there that you like 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.920
 frame three pieces or hold 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.920
 scissors 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.480
 we are also a round base in this 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.720
 case use and a little bit of paint and 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.460
 good the infallible silicone gun 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.570
 we started now yes what we're going to do 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.710
 first about the cid and we are going to make a 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.890
 scratched from the circular shape of our 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.890
 container not the idea that you get 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.530
 Circulitos you are going to mark us with your pencil 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.040
 on the surface as we are seeing 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.690
 here in the video 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:12.250
 and we are going to proceed to cut them 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.590
 take this this cut well 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.390
 firm but to get it better you 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.700
 I suggest you do it with the part of with 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.260
 that end of the scissors is the most 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.300
 strong because it's a bit difficult 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.940
 cut them but if you do it well 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.850
 background will be much easier than 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.800
 can you cut this one and we're going to 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.190
 cut out all the balls that you 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.460
 want 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.370
 I have not cut something out of the 76 plus or 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.670
 least I got a lot of these to 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.820
 where and I did not know what to do I did not know 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.149
 make letters or make glasses up 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:51.570
 that I decided to make a portrait 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:55.110
 look here you can see I was advancing 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.710
 and here I show you all my progress everything 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.710
 what did I do 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.910
 and now yes 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.670
 let's have the piece of cardboard the 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.950
 which I have already marked and trimmed 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.110
 to move forward may not be very long 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.280
 video what I've done is cut back the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.340
 central part more or less leaving 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.520
 one centimeter on each side so that 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.510
 can hold the photo as you can see 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.390
 that would be more or less the dimension not 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.370
 there are ports to have the photo and to 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.030
 we also need a support 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.940
 internal 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.620
 so that the photo can not be easy to 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.370
 change it because if as we put this 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.870
 picture we can also put others so 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.660
 this support will allow you 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.600
 exchange your photos and you can put 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.380
 the ones you like the most and this does not come 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.110
 alone but with the third piece of cardboard 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.290
 we put here this 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.200
 as a kind of border does not stop 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.160
 cover it 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.620
 and then we're going to paste all those three 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.450
 cartons with masking tape by 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.530
 the edges also by the central part 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.530
 from the sea ​​and quito 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:25.330
 not to see it better finished about everything and 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:25.330
 let's paste it masking the whole piece 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.390
 and then we try the photos to see how 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.190
 We are not staying because we have to 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.980
 see that it is well pegadito but we return 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.830
 to wait we're going to do it but not in 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.270
 this case and this is this box already 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.460
 stay 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.010
 and it would be necessary to put it in the tab of 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.980
 support and this you will achieve with another 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.850
 piece another piece of cardboard and you go to 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.090
 draw two diagonals so as is 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.940
 is watching the videos also for 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.150
 to be able to make this frame good I did the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:06.910
 calculation just because I like that of 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:11.080
 measures I 'm not very very be addicted this 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.640
 I do not do it as it seems to me 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.609
 the dimensions I'm calculating 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.859
 and here I am left with this little eye 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.620
 also the shape with masking tape for 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.300
 give a better finish the one that I am 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.370
 showing how it has to be 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.760
 means you stay in the middle a 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.720
 space to place the 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.250
 photo that can enter the photo and that 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.410
 can leave easily 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.510
 let's apply a layer or two layers of 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.090
 acrylic paint chose the color 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.419
 golden brown because it's for my room 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.419
 babe 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.550
 and we're going to throw this the back 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.710
 around the edges of the center 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.410
 frame and also to the tab that the 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.720
 subject here you can see how it is already dry 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.470
 this dry very fast you have 15 minutes 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.170
 and it was dry and we are going to place our 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.150
 first round I decided in the 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.950
 sides like them as guides not later 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.290
 fill in the rest but I realized that 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:13.370
 there were some edges that were not visible 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:17.050
 well of the same cardboard so 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.050
 I pasted over others more 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.510
 and look 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.810
 this is the result 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.270
 I stay very nice so 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.640
 I decided to share it with you 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.880
 I love the finish I loved it is 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.660
 especially as it is that it gives him so much 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.360
 life to this picture is the picture of my husband 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:45.600
 with my little daughter there we can see if you 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.730
 liked to like to share it with everyone 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.890
 your friends with all your friends look 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.110
 tense there is a little walk so you can see 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.510
 how is this detail in the 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.890
 back part good thank you for watching
