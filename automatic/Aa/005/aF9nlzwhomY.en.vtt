00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 This drop, and a drop - yours, 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.200
 The little brook in it is my love. 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.240
 This drop in the palm of your hand, 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.920
 So take all the strength, my child. 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.120
 This drop, but a drop - water, 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:30.240
 For the people of the pure the world is holy. 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.640
 This drop is like a seed seed. 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.920
 Drink your spirit, take a lively sip. 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.480
 In this droplet all star seas 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.680
 Smile and look at you. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.320
 This drop is a heavenly tear, 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:33.000
 So wash your kids' eyes. 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.760
 You water from the crown to the foot 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.560
 Wash your feet and do not remove from the grass. 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.120
 On the ground you are both wet and barefoot - 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:11.040
 Man is healthy, man is alive. 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:04:03.680
 A droplet ... a droplet .. a droplet.
