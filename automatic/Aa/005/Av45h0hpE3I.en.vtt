00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.330
 good afternoon dear measures with you again 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.200
 simcity sens team and today we do 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.960
 review of the city's addition to the future this 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.510
 video review will be released in three parts in the first 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.580
 parts talk about the Academy of Sciences and new 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.580
 chips add-ons have gone 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.500
 at first briefly about the supplement itself 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.250
 the cities of the future adds two new ones to the game 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.430
 specialization academy of sciences and omega to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.860
 In addition, new mega towers appeared 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.120
 type of transport 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.800
 power plants that produce 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.690
 huge amount of energy 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.480
 various buildings to solve 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.220
 communal problems park and much 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.199
 other 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.449
 Academy of Sciences is an institute of technology 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.909
 that support eco-friendly and 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.310
 modern production in it 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.920
 new building modules are being investigated already 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.110
 existing and future technologies 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.290
 the academy gives additional workers 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.570
 there is no place and control 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.760
 all will require citizens with high 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.100
 income is therefore best built 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.439
 academy in a thriving city with 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.110
 wealthy residents do not have this control 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.729
 special wireless network 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.340
 being created at the academy all new and 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.530
 technological buildings investigated in it 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.020
 require connecting to this network therefore 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.960
 in the absence or weakening of the signal 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.820
 they switch off the more sims 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.310
 works at the academy the faster 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.980
 wider channel studies are performed 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.260
 controller and stronger signal more than that 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.720
 rich sims make it so much more successful 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.570
 than middle income sims 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.610
 or poor three institutions that can 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.730
 be installed at the academy also 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.800
 amplify the signal there is the possibility 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.440
 put a building controller for 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.200
 additional network channel expansion and 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.530
 gain signal to put the institute 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.940
 it is necessary to increase the level of the academy and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.280
 modernize and and these actions 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.260
 only available after the end of one 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.209
 each research project 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.580
 level ie you need to study 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.459
 any second level improvements 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.060
 before upgrading to 3 when 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.130
 research of many projects necessary 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.110
 or academy need to consider that 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.390
 research affects the whole region 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.060
 for example if the mayor of a nearby city 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.760
 studied any building in the academy then 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.340
 it becomes available and you have an academy 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.440
 science does not replace university all 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.690
 university studies are different 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.120
 from research at the academy now 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.519
 tell about the innovations new look 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.950
 transport in addition it could 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.140
 magnetic cushion train for his 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.540
 construction is required to investigate this 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.819
 mode of transport at the maglev academy can 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.030
 move over the streets and low buildings 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.519
 in the city the fact is that the magnetic ways 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.890
 raised to great height due to which 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.500
 trains will not be stuck together 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.720
 with conventional machines, moreover, they are very 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.299
 quick and easy to put together one piece 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.180
 the city on the other could have in no single 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.000
 you and at each station there is a garage for 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.400
 trains building from addition to the menu 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.830
 displayed using peculiar 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.200
 drawing when you put such an object 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.930
 Future will happen in your city 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.959
 nearby buildings and roads soon you 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.480
 can see your future cars 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.630
 new species have appeared in the city 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.180
 power plants wave and thermonuclear 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.010
 to install them in the city is necessary 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.410
 do research at the academy 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.630
 wave power station is located on 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.359
 coast and produces enough 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.220
 amount of energy for a small town 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.959
 when will you miss her 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.540
 install the wave module 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.489
 power stations in the game are two types of modules 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.709
 standard wave generator and 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.209
 superior but for use 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.489
 improved generator need 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.190
 explore it at the academy of sciences 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.579
 higher traffic is also required 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.590
 control no fusion power plant 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.329
 takes not much space though she and 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.389
 requires very large capital investments 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:17.970
 but itâ€™s safe and environmentally friendly 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.039
 mayors who require large amounts 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.079
 energy however for the initial 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.470
 starting up the reactor will take a lot 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.350
 energy from the original and 100 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.120
 how can you add extra 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.490
 standard or enhanced reactors 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.740
 to use superior you need 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.200
 explore it at the academy if you 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.710
 you can afford to install though 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.680
 one such reactor would get 2400 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.850
 megawatt clean energy behind 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.420
 huge amount 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.770
 new water treatment plant 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.910
 recycle wastewater into clean 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.920
 drinking water 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.620
 soil cleaner quickly cleans 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.000
 contaminated and radioactive soil but 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.400
 pollutes the air 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.170
 module for garbage dumps of garbage 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.750
 chopper will help get rid of 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.210
 excess waste quickly and without pollution 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.940
 air module for power plants 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.680
 power wave amplifier 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.530
 increases energy production by half and 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.400
 what a stunning park now decorate 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.710
 Your city 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.770
 but don't forget to work all of these 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.440
 facilities need no control it and 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.320
 much more came into the game with 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.600
 the addition of simcity and the city of the future on 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.060
 this moment we complete the first part 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.400
 our review near future will be released 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.050
 the second part where we tell you about 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.050
 Mega to see you soon
