00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
was so loose there at the end but we're

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.140 
was so loose there at the end but we're
gonna<00:01:52.470> make<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> big<00:01:52.920> change<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.490> had<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.760> car<00:01:54.000> we

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
gonna make a big change we had a car we

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.000 
gonna make a big change we had a car we
had<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> car<00:01:54.540> handling<00:01:54.869> good<00:01:55.080> in<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.860> last

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
had the car handling good in the last

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.490 
had the car handling good in the last
practice<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.299> ran<00:01:57.510> I<00:01:57.780> ran<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.229> thing<00:01:58.380> out

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
practice and I ran I ran the thing out

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.440 
practice and I ran I ran the thing out
of<00:01:58.530> gas<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.070> mean<00:01:59.250> we<00:01:59.790> ran<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.090> all<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> way<00:02:00.390> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
of gas I mean we ran it all the way to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.480 
of gas I mean we ran it all the way to
40<00:02:00.990> laps<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.500> handled<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:01.890> good<00:02:02.159> so

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
40 laps and it handled really good so

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.430 
40 laps and it handled really good so
that<00:02:03.479> was<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> little<00:02:03.930> disappointing<00:02:04.320> right

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
that was a little disappointing right

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.960
