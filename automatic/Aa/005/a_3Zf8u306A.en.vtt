weakened by the way is means tangerine

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.320 
weakened by the way is means tangerine
in<00:00:22.830> Japanese<00:00:23.250> by<00:00:23.429> the<00:00:23.490> way<00:00:23.669> and<00:00:23.939> that's<00:00:24.119> where

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
in Japanese by the way and that's where

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.329 
in Japanese by the way and that's where
I<00:00:24.359> got<00:00:24.599> the<00:00:24.779> inspiration<00:00:25.109> for<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.189> design

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
I got the inspiration for this design

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.560 
I got the inspiration for this design
from

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.510 

okay<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.630> now<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.050> are<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.530> Row<00:00:31.950> two<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.400> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
okay so now you are on Row two of the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580 
okay so now you are on Row two of the
pattern<00:00:32.670> repeat<00:00:33.150> and<00:00:33.420> we're<00:00:33.990> going<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.290> make

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
pattern repeat and we're going to make

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.730 
pattern repeat and we're going to make
yarn<00:00:35.250> over<00:00:35.580> purl<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:36.000> five<00:00:36.300> times<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:37.470> row

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:37.740 
yarn over purl one five times this row

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.540 
yarn over purl one five times this row
is<00:00:38.010> actually<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> row<00:00:39.240> before<00:00:39.450> making<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.170> knot

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
is actually a row before making the knot

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.790 
is actually a row before making the knot
okay<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.700> now<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.240> making<00:00:42.540> yarn<00:00:43.290> over<00:00:43.590> purl

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
okay so now I'm making yarn over purl

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:54.610 
okay so now I'm making yarn over purl
one<00:00:46.250> three<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:48.559> four<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.510> five<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.739> then

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
one three and four and five and then

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.820 
one three and four and five and then
knit<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.160> next<00:00:56.309> five<00:00:56.760> stitches<00:01:00.170> then<00:01:01.170> yarn

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
knit the next five stitches then yarn

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.260 
knit the next five stitches then yarn
over<00:01:01.949> purl<00:01:02.400> one<00:01:02.699> five<00:01:03.660> times<00:01:03.960> again<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.270> we're

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
over purl one five times again and we're

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.730 
over purl one five times again and we're
going<00:01:06.480> to<00:01:06.750> repeat<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:08.150> knit<00:01:09.150> five<00:01:09.420> yarn<00:01:10.380> over

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
going to repeat this knit five yarn over

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:21.710 
going to repeat this knit five yarn over
purl<00:01:10.950> one<00:01:11.220> five<00:01:11.880> times<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:13.290> end

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:31.640

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
so on the next row we are ready to make

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.370 
so on the next row we are ready to make
the<00:01:35.670> knot<00:01:35.850> stitch<00:01:36.740> okay<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:38.550> do<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:39.380> we're
