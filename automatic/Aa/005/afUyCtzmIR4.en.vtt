00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.530
 very good friends we will talk about the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.140
 sequence of numbers and I will explain them 

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.910
 how it works I think that one of the 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.900
 most important number sequences 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.030
 that there is the triangle of pascal or 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.550
 also as yes known as triangle 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.770
 of tartaglia I hope it's helpful 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.440
 this for you and let's start with this 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.830
 video very good friends in the sequence of 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.820
 numbers we have to analyze the numbers 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.930
 or the rows 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.510
 as meticulously as possible very well 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.270
 start we start in the first row only 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.940
 we have one 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:44.829
 in the second row we have a 1 and a 1 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.769
 in the third row we have a 1 1 2 and 1 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.490
 so it would be easy to think that the sum 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.580
 of these two gives us this 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.880
 and we would only download some 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.910
 we go perfectly well now we arrive 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.110
 Now we come to this row as 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.840
 we get these three numbers well if we 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.380
 we realize we can add 1 and 2 and we 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.330
 da 3 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.020
 if we add 1 and 2 and it gives us 3 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.270
 and we would simply download some 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.190
 apparently we have understood the logic of 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:26.100
 this sequence of numbers 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:28.740
 we add 1 and 3 those of 4 3 and 3 gives us 6 3 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.370
 and 1 gives us 4 and we simply lower the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.440
 some 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:38.710
 1 and 4 2 of 5 4 and signs of 10 6 and 4 we 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.000
 gives 10 4 and 1 gives us 5 and as always 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.070
 we go down the ones now comes what 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.890
 It could be a bit complicated because 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:53.570
 we will perform the next row 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:58.880
 1 and 5 gives us the result 6 what we notice 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:02.539
 here 5 and 10 give us result 15 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.200
 10 and 10 give us the result 20 10 and 5 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:09.229
 gives us result 15 5 and 1 gives us the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.750
 result 6 and as always we lower the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.180
 ones on the sides 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.830
 good friends this is a sequence of 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.470
 numbers I hope you have understood 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.950
 you should always analyze the rows for 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.070
 to be able to understand and develop the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.070
 next sequence in these exercises
