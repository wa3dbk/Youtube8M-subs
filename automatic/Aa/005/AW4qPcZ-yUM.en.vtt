00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
memoranda in cover but sometimes if you

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.130 
memoranda in cover but sometimes if you
charge<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.060> far<00:03:13.300> away<00:03:13.360> from<00:03:13.450> home<00:03:13.810> they'll

charge this far away from home they'll

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.610 
charge this far away from home they'll
just<00:03:15.330> take<00:03:16.330> an<00:03:16.480> oar<00:03:16.690> where<00:03:16.960> you<00:03:17.080> place<00:03:17.350> them

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
just take an oar where you place them

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.980 
just take an oar where you place them
then<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.730> got<00:03:18.880> something<00:03:19.180> to<00:03:19.270> tell<00:03:19.450> afford<00:03:19.780> some

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
charge the garden or knots and so it

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.000 
charge the garden or knots and so it
wasn't<00:05:02.910> going<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.180> be<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.360> certain<00:05:04.050> death<00:05:04.410> if<00:05:04.830> I

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
wasn't going to be a certain death if I

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.430 
wasn't going to be a certain death if I
charged<00:05:05.310> them<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:06.870> know<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:06.990> put<00:05:07.199> it<00:05:07.260> to<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
that's why it took me a second to figure

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.670 
that's why it took me a second to figure
out<00:05:12.030> how<00:05:12.210> it's<00:05:12.389> going<00:05:12.539> to<00:05:12.599> charge<00:05:12.840> that<00:05:13.260> s

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
out how it's going to charge that s

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.909 
out how it's going to charge that s

if you're not going to take a couple of

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:15.850 
if you're not going to take a couple of

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.530 

anyway<00:06:16.860> this<00:06:17.010> part<00:06:17.310> I<00:06:17.490> just<00:06:17.790> fast<00:06:18.120> forwarded

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
anyway this part I just fast forwarded

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.110 
anyway this part I just fast forwarded
through<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:18.900> whole<00:06:19.110> auditorium<00:06:19.470> but<00:06:20.400> this<00:06:21.030> is

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
through the whole auditorium but this is

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.220 
through the whole auditorium but this is
an<00:06:21.180> extra<00:06:21.450> hold<00:06:21.750> much<00:06:22.169> strategic<00:06:22.860> value<00:06:23.070> I<00:06:24.230> the

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
an extra hold much strategic value I the

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.080 
an extra hold much strategic value I the
Vanguard<00:06:25.680> doesn't<00:06:26.040> quite<00:06:26.280> the<00:06:26.520> Praetorian

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
Vanguard doesn't quite the Praetorian

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.820 
Vanguard doesn't quite the Praetorian
and<00:06:27.270> different<00:06:27.720> that<00:06:27.960> and<00:06:28.320> the<00:06:28.410> other<00:06:28.470> class

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
and different that and the other class

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.480 
and different that and the other class
does<00:06:29.900> because<00:06:30.900> charge<00:06:31.770> is<00:06:32.070> completely

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
does because charge is completely

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.760 
does because charge is completely
useless<00:06:32.669> against<00:06:33.120> it<00:06:33.300> so<00:06:33.720> I'm<00:06:34.110> usually<00:06:34.290> using

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
useless against it so I'm usually using

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.550 
useless against it so I'm usually using
the<00:06:34.830> same<00:06:35.010> tactics<00:06:35.550> that<00:06:35.840> any<00:06:36.840> other<00:06:37.140> classic

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
the same tactics that any other classic

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.040 
the same tactics that any other classic
moves<00:06:37.800> which<00:06:38.070> is<00:06:38.250> try<00:06:38.730> to<00:06:38.790> stand<00:06:39.270> behind<00:06:39.540> tight

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
moves which is try to stand behind tight

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.590 
moves which is try to stand behind tight
cover<00:06:40.350> and<00:06:40.710> to<00:06:41.370> shoot<00:06:41.640> at<00:06:41.790> it<00:06:41.820> once<00:06:42.060> available

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
and that's really about it and this

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.890 
and that's really about it and this
fight<00:06:46.500> which<00:06:46.710> way<00:06:47.220> to<00:06:47.280> want<00:06:47.729> to<00:06:48.690> bother
