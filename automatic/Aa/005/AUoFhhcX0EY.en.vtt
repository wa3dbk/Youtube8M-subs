00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello everybody it's manu we see 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.440
 I have just settled my little ones 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.090
 carburation problems the verde mount 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.559
 away from a second fair clean 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.870
 the sprinklers it was stuffed had 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.210
 still deposit in pubs so here you go 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.369
 I have well clean touch all 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.880
 to the carburetor completely clean everything 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:29.400
 all breath and that's it but tomorrow we 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.349
 there not yet finished I still have the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.700
 throttle installed in there I 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.410
 know how I do I drilled 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.840
 three holes in there I have no access to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.510
 the other side i'm all going through the hatch 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.829
 there necessarily this not the place I have not 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.570
 how am I gonna do that I 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.270
 would find it's someone who has a 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.399
 trick in passing I take a less 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 put back second hatch on this side but 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.610
 if I can do without it it would not be 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.100
 very bad 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.480
 so that's why you have to start the engine 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.600
 after I've realized I have a 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:06.060
 little trouble when I accelerate with the 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:13.890
 idle throttle here because 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:17.310
 I bring it back not you see the bow 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.140
 lacquered and that I do not know how the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.150
 settle i can not settle it i 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.409
 tried on the cable here that it does nothing 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.380
 in that I have to take a little 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.729
 in the in command I shortcuts 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.350
 it's a little bit in control I know 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.600
 not at all it's a bit painful 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.960
 I took over I had some of the game on 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.770
 their on the synchro rod of the buses 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.750
 bus makes you think about accelerating on carbide 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.220
 was coming back pretty much like that I was bringing back 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.399
 all that in hand pretty much to do it 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.899
 return from one in water towers near 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.119
 correct what's left is really or 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.770
 surrounds so now it's turning pretty 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.420
 near round there is also really less I 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.880
 you start would have finished second 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.420
 little worries before tomorrow 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.350
 I had already mentioned on the forum 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.979
 this is the leaks at the level of 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.509
 bull cap goes back up I put a lake 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.689
 olson yet mass does that when 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.899
 even 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.849
 so it's painful it flows along 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.540
 after its long color of the engine in the 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.310
 bowl do not know if we change in the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.480
 tank 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.819
 it can solve my problem but hey 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.970
 when we mention secondhand do not think 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.800
 it's exactly the same problem, but I 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:32.250
 do not know what to do either 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:46.940
 will see well at 8 years old that you talk about it I 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:51.599
 you showed the installation so here 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.730
 here I have everything to 3 and see all the 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:57.269
 hose takes precedence at the port neuf 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.310
 the decanter 9 also with jar 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.530
 transparent the small plastic ring 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.730
 including water in it 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.590
 he was there originally but I could 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.760
 not put it because of pvc pipe or 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.810
 all the cases because it bothered to see 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.470
 the caps that gave me they are a little 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.489
 too big we could try that I'll go 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.650
 do not know if it really hinders 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.170
 I would later exchange to see if I can 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.530
 to use a little less for the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.389
 season 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.150
 I think you think I'm waiting 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:26.639
 your opinions on it that they end of season 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.530
 so i'm exchanging cheney cecab 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.959
 the right dimension 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.130
 I had my trim beam also finally 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.180
 the good that passes there I have not yet 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.590
 calculated correctly there it was just 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.590
 to try as it works 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.659
 your side to close to crush the 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.659
 cable 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.920
 are we going to start do not need to 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.099
 go out I 'm going to make a good trip there 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.099
 is hot 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.189
 when then 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.920
 it's normal I have the propeller running 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.130
 frankly like that in slow motion at 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.130
 spring 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.160
 what sometimes comes back to him 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.160
 1 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.889
 no 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.289
 flo his first product counters the 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.480
 contract 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:31.200
 good there he falls 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.200
 what it was 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.520
 see you soon friends
