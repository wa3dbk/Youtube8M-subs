enough<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.460> can<00:00:08.760> take<00:00:09.000> any<00:00:09.210> pot<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.809> you

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
enough so you can take any pot that you

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.870 
enough so you can take any pot that you
want<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.170> for<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.620> pull<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.730> can

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
want to for it and pull it and you can

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.629 
want to for it and pull it and you can
forward<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.360> using<00:00:13.110> u-turn<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:14.160> now<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.370> don't

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
forward it using u-turn so now you don't

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.490 
forward it using u-turn so now you don't
have<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.910> go<00:00:15.030> through<00:00:15.210> your<00:00:15.360> rooster<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.170> set

particular<00:00:20.939> ports<00:00:21.510> we<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.750> do<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.930> straight

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260

from<00:00:22.820> utah<00:00:23.820> utorrent<00:00:24.539> will<00:00:25.140> basically<00:00:25.470> open<00:00:25.920> a

port<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.279> go<00:00:29.429> down<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.029> now<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.269> don't<00:00:30.359> have<00:00:30.480> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
port to go down so now we don't have to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.500 
port to go down so now we don't have to
go<00:00:31.019> by<00:00:31.650> any<00:00:31.859> other<00:00:32.099> means<00:00:32.219> now<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.210> way<00:00:33.360> we're

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
go by any other means now the way we're

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.310 
go by any other means now the way we're
going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.079> we're<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.260> to

there<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:48.000> says<00:01:48.299> that

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
there we go you can see it says that

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.719 
there we go you can see it says that
it's<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.810> 560<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.799> computer<00:01:50.220> name<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
it's one on 560 the computer name and

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.969 
it's one on 560 the computer name and
then<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.899> see<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.049> it's<00:01:52.290> listening<00:01:52.710> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
then you can see that it's listening and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.740 
then you can see that it's listening and
now<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.250> means<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.119> open

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
now what that means is that it's open

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.319 
now what that means is that it's open
basically<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:56.369> theoretically<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:57.180> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
basically so now theoretically if you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.999 
basically so now theoretically if you
were<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> take<00:01:57.780> my<00:01:57.990> IP<00:01:58.200> address<00:01:58.320> which<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:58.829> ki

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
were to take my IP address which I'm ki

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.459 
were to take my IP address which I'm ki
not<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.430> give<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.759> my<00:02:00.390> global<00:02:01.170> IP

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
not going to give you my global IP

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.580 
not going to give you my global IP
address<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.990> give<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.320> someone

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
address if I was to give that to someone

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.310 
address if I was to give that to someone
they<00:02:05.399> could<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:05.729> connect<00:02:06.149> my<00:02:06.420> minecraft

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
they could then connect my minecraft

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.100 
they could then connect my minecraft
server<00:02:07.530> or<00:02:07.770> whatever<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.690> pretty<00:02:09.840> cool

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
server or whatever so it's pretty cool

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.229 
server or whatever so it's pretty cool
way<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.349> open<00:02:10.890> ports<00:02:11.310> very<00:02:11.760> very<00:02:12.060> easily

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you have one open port but that's pretty

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.120 
you have one open port but that's pretty
nifty<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.210> good<00:02:18.480> easy<00:02:18.720> way<00:02:18.960> thanks<00:02:19.890> watching
