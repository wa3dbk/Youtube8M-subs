00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
whether it's an obvious one but you can

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.490 
whether it's an obvious one but you can
think<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.880> probably<00:01:27.060> other<00:01:27.570> images<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.409> are

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the actual image it's their changes like

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.069 
the actual image it's their changes like
say<00:01:32.009> maybe<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.340> webcam<00:01:32.850> or<00:01:33.299> something<00:01:33.659> in

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
say maybe a webcam or something in

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
addition you can drag file information

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.740 
addition you can drag file information
here<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.130> will<00:01:38.280> put<00:01:38.640> some<00:01:38.790> text<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.420> on

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
here so this will put some text here on

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.929 
here so this will put some text here on
the<00:01:39.869> desktop<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.220> text<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.790> put

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
and I can set what it is so like I can

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.719 
and I can set what it is so like I can
for<00:01:48.840> instance<00:01:48.899> use<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> log<00:01:49.530> file<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.189> like

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
for instance use a log file here like

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.560 
for instance use a log file here like
let<00:01:50.939> me<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.210> my<00:01:52.340> Apache<00:01:53.340> firewall<00:01:54.000> log<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.450> I'm

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
let me get my Apache firewall log if I'm

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.120 
let me get my Apache firewall log if I'm
really<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:54.930> geeky<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.530> we'll<00:01:55.890> put<00:01:56.100> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
really really geeky and we'll put that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.490 
really really geeky and we'll put that
information<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.600> desktop<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.200> as

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
information there on the desktop and as

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.560 
information there on the desktop and as
that<00:01:58.770> file<00:01:58.950> changes<00:01:59.399> will<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.670> updated<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that file changes will be updated so

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.260 
that file changes will be updated so
this<00:02:00.750> could<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.369> something<00:02:02.369> here<00:02:02.670> where<00:02:02.850> you

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
this could be something here where you

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.880 
this could be something here where you
can<00:02:03.390> have<00:02:03.509> logs<00:02:03.810> or<00:02:04.079> some<00:02:04.229> other<00:02:04.290> information

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890

that<00:02:05.100> appears<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.869> changes<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.409> again<00:02:07.890> if

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
that appears and it changes and again if

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.430 
that appears and it changes and again if
I<00:02:08.099> am<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.479> geektool<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.170> see<00:02:10.289> it's

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
I am not in geektool you can see it's

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.949 
I am not in geektool you can see it's
just<00:02:10.770> static<00:02:11.129> information<00:02:11.520> on<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.629> desktop

probably the most ultra geeky thing that
you<00:02:20.610> could<00:02:20.730> do<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.840> use<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.990> shell<00:02:22.290> script

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
you could do is to use a shell script

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.990 
you could do is to use a shell script
let<00:02:22.830> me<00:02:22.890> put<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> shell<00:02:23.280> script<00:02:23.430> here<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.820> shell

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
let me put a shell script here and shell

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.130 
let me put a shell script here and shell
script<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.390> kind<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.720> like<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:24.990> like<00:02:25.110> a

terminal command and I can do something

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.980 
terminal command and I can do something
like<00:02:28.350> top<00:02:28.770> which<00:02:29.670> will<00:02:30.150> display<00:02:30.420> information

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990

this information here you can see the
results<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.500> top<00:02:50.130> or<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.460> could<00:02:50.910> use<00:02:51.150> something

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
results of top or I could use something

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.810 
results of top or I could use something
like<00:02:51.680> all<00:02:52.680> sorts<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.100> different<00:02:53.160> things<00:02:53.580> to

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
like all sorts of different things to

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.190

display the current date you can see

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.730 
display the current date you can see
splice<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.130> date<00:02:59.310> there<00:02:59.570> as<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:01.050> would<00:03:01.230> return

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
splice the date there as it would return

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.830 
splice the date there as it would return
from<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.100> terminal<00:03:02.370> command<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:03.510> addition

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
from a terminal command but in addition

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.500 
from a terminal command but in addition
I<00:03:04.460> can<00:03:05.460> now<00:03:05.760> customize<00:03:06.060> that<00:03:07.370> by<00:03:08.370> changing<00:03:08.760> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
I can now customize that by changing the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.840 
I can now customize that by changing the
font<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.050> color<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.130> can<00:03:11.310> put<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.490> clock<00:03:11.790> on

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
font and color so I can put a clock on

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:20.120 
font and color so I can put a clock on
my<00:03:12.180> desktop<00:03:13.130> that<00:03:14.130> easily<00:03:18.290> like<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.800> now

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
my desktop that easily like that and now

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.440 
my desktop that easily like that and now
if<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.340> click<00:03:20.400> off<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.910> can<00:03:21.030> see<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.180> just

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
if I click off you can see that just

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.699 
if I click off you can see that just
stays<00:03:21.660> there<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.080> background<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
stays there on the background on the

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.590 
stays there on the background on the
desktop<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.250> remember<00:03:23.910> i<00:03:23.940> said<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.240> update

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
desktop and remember i said it's update

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.150 
desktop and remember i said it's update
every<00:03:24.870> three<00:03:25.170> seconds<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.800> can<00:03:25.920> see<00:03:26.010> it's

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
every three seconds so you can see it's

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.400 
every three seconds so you can see it's
doing<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.610> probably<00:03:26.910> for<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.959> one<00:03:28.200> i

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
doing that it probably for this one i

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.540 
doing that it probably for this one i
want<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:28.950> set<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.760> update<00:03:30.090> every<00:03:30.510> second<00:03:31.550> so

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
want to set it to update every second so

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.390
