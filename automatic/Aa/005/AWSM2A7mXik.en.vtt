00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.970

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.460
 rapid 74 I know the great 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.469
 a standard makes I think mk1 there 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.200
 I just thought fit 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.670
 the same time to initiate 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.859
 I'm spreading the joy yes that is 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.650
 the fatalities of sympathy with mortal 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.269
 kombat 3 there is no possibility one 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.380
 how to make changed demonstration 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.240
 I will show you again like that 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.430
 go and I just thought of one 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.340
 or others do not know that 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:45.239
 and I wanted to show times necessarily 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:48.690
 Just enjoy a cheap beautiful 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:56.309
 thing at mk 1 on the super nintendo 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:01:01.620
 knows that synonymous completely free to switch 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:05.640
 But starting in the city even has nintendo 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:14.700
 realized that mortal kombat something quite 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:21.990
 special is almost all are now the 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.310
 young based on their age thus times 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.570
 I look a bit like that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.579
 the m kat show all you know 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.930
 differences between energy on the n64 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:37.860
 ancelotti on the playstation 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.400
 what the blowers is the camellias one 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.930
 difference 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.930
 that is not so well known 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:56.550
 stories k1 should you know 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:58.470
 I have mortals again 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.030
 kombat if you want to roll this we will 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.690
 probably know but also know 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:09.140
 mortal kombat for me what good job for 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.140
 waste of time 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.640
 I will be my one car collection here 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.830
 then lay down if you see something 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:32.130
 I so everything got to but 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:37.650
 beautiful stories have been around since mk 166 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.720
 and a mockery of his character 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.190
 but he needs probability 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.420
 not so bad here is theme sub 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.989
 zero pick up 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.650
 we have them at the mortal kombat 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:58.530
 reboot you have to smoke and story 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:02.780
 if I changed that way I think 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:07.040
 that ok or you are new to such 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.040
 chronik character did not turn 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:19.420
 yes i was not a fan of the mini 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:22.380
 rob this again completely 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:28.570

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:30.640
 series with once things partner of course 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.900
 kristanna loken and the gang is okay 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.900
 We know about Koller 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.590
 also kind of good but bad 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.590
 somehow too damn strangely 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.320
 that does not have to be 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:15.190
 all stories must be through the standard 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:18.720
 by scorpion though others 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.720
 things come then I say that still 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:28.840
 so to speak, the old memories of 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:37.580
 johnny cage now we come to 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:39.880

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.410

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:50.060
 About needed and the mercys 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:56.290

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.290
 brutal tea party is the same for everyone 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.350
 I do not know why it has built in 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.240
 probably somewhere to say so too 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.240
 it is not that powerful 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.880
 he is missing along with rap then there 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:28.790

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.130
 I believe that too, if we do any of that 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.280
 a mistake yes that was the fidelity 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.710
 demonstration 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.240
 I think he often had one 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:08.850

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.350

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.580
 special usually show you the most 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.170

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.730
