civic SI which is a rocket ship and it's
really<00:01:19.940> fun<00:01:20.300> to<00:01:20.330> drive<00:01:20.600> unfortunately<00:01:21.350> they

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
really fun to drive unfortunately they

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.260 
really fun to drive unfortunately they
only<00:01:21.770> make<00:01:22.040> it<00:01:22.160> in<00:01:22.250> a<00:01:22.340> 6-speed<00:01:22.729> manual<00:01:22.760> which

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
only make it in a 6-speed manual which

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.700 
only make it in a 6-speed manual which
wouldn't<00:01:23.510> be<00:01:23.570> bad<00:01:23.780> for<00:01:24.050> me<00:01:24.080> but<00:01:24.380> for<00:01:24.530> about

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
wouldn't be bad for me but for about

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.350 
wouldn't be bad for me but for about
eighty<00:01:25.340> percent<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.910> country<00:01:26.060> they're

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
eighty percent of the country they're

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.030

not<00:01:26.479> gonna<00:01:26.600> want<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:26.869> buy<00:01:26.960> that<00:01:27.200> this

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
not gonna want to buy that this

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.290 
not gonna want to buy that this
particular<00:01:28.190> has<00:01:28.550> got<00:01:28.640> a<00:01:28.670> five-speed

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
particular has got a five-speed

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.120 
particular has got a five-speed
automatic<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:30.050> wish<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.350> had<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.500> six<00:01:30.830> I<00:01:30.979> think

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
automatic I wish it had a six I think

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.170 
automatic I wish it had a six I think
that<00:01:31.250> would<00:01:31.340> make<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.610> perform<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:32.030> lot<00:01:32.119> better

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
that would make it perform a lot better

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.350 
that would make it perform a lot better
