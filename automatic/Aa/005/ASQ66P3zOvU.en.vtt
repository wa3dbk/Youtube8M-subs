00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.930
 Y 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.110
 hello everyone, good morning evenings or 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.060
 good night friends today in this video 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.610
 I will discuss my views on the 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.590
 movie my little pony costs giles yes 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.300
 They wonder why I upload this video 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.890
 after more than two weeks of 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.690
 premiere of the movie because it's 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.030
 simply because I did not find a 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.859
 decent platform on what to see it for that 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.739
 recently I just found a 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.510
 platform with acceptable quality 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.670
 good friends in this video I will only give one 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.890
 honest opinion and I will not criticize this 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.780
 film in an exaggerated way since it does not 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.429
 I want to behave like the critic who 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.019
 it only points out the errors but 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.420
 Rescue the good of each film 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.940
 simply this opinion will be like that of 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.800
 a simple spectator and nothing else so 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.230
 I recommend you do not expect something so 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.720
 exaggerated with regard to a very critical 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.450
 strict good friends me for my part 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.430
 I recommend you watch this movie for him 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.710
 simply done that it reminded them 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.670
 a lot to the series also in the end it turned out 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.040
 be true what 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.560
 the makers of this movie or 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.270
 that would be identical to the original series 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.430
 also has fragments taken from the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.259
 series like when twilight is presented 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.030
 with flutter yes because to be 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.189
 sincere one of the aspects for the 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.440
 which I really liked is that in certain 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.270
 way one can relive the feeling of 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.490
 see for the first time magaly del pont and the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.409
 magic of friendship since twilight is 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.630
 presents with each of her friends in 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.180
 its human versions in an almost 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.979
 identical as in the first episode that 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.810
 did not lose the essence of the 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.940
 original series and for which he did not lose 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.159
 the charm of my little pony the magic of 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.289
 Friendship also because this movie 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.600
 it's not made with an external story 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.729
 since twilight only goes to the world 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.679
 human to recover his element of the 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.259
 harmony that was stolen by the villain from 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.940
 this movie called sunset singer the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.130
 which I consider a villain not so 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.690
 remarkable since it does not turn out to be a 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.700
 great threat compared to the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.160
 previous villains of magritte the pony 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.080
 but I also give him merit because I 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.569
 really liked the design and the look that 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.760
 they gave him good friends the one that the plot 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.709
 principal is not parallel to the original 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.030
 I think he left many satisfied 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.770
 bronis on the yes 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.470
 the fact that it is not a story 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.510
 different and it's not like many claimed or 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.209
 it would be like that series for girls 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.160
 called monster jam I also clarify 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.110
 that the creators pleased many 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.300
 of the fans adding characters like 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.610
 dj get to see well the end of the 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.860
 credits and many more that will recognize 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.720
 to see this movie also the music of 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.850
 the presentation of the film was 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.920
 very good so much so that it seemed 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.959
 for the same bronis because as many 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.330
 they know the brownies create excellent 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.280
 my music independent themes 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.959
 little pony for example here they 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.350
 I will show a fragment of what 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.350
 I speak 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.629
 good friends with regard to the side 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.129
 negative of the movie so I tell them 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.170
 that the creators could have 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.239
 improve visual quality but 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.430
 unfortunately they just copied and pasted 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.560
 the same visual quality of the series 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.569
 another bad aspect is that they could give 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.400
 a better story or a story 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.189
 more complex because unfortunately 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.049
 has a very simple story an example 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.909
 is that they defeat the villain of the same 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.709
 way that they defeat a name harmony 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.639
 dischord but that's not much 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.859
 importance 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:10.109
 Another bad point that can be highlighted is 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.090
 which is of very short duration since to me 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.340
 seem an hour and a half would have been enough 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.470
 but unfortunately the movie just 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.049
 lasts one hour and ten minutes which 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.789
 considered very little good finally there 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.620
 Obvious mistakes that you notice so 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.660
 pay close attention to each scene 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.789
 including the typical errors of 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.070
 animation but if you do not take all those 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.690
 bad aspects seriously and they only try to 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.970
 enjoy the film because 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.009
 they will simply fascinate you a lot 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.020
 they will feel as if they are seeing 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.479
 first time more little pony the magic of 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.550
 the friendship seriously friends 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.740
 I recommend watching this movie as it is 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.240
 very entertaining I also know that many 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.190
 they will love it 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.289
 many of your favorite ponies in 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.509
 human versions which I consider 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.849
 great me on my part to this movie 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.650
 I give a score of 8 to 10 since 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.780
 fulfills its mission to entertain the 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.060
 public but there's something more than 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.949
 I want to clarify them I'm sure that 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.289
 hasbro made this movie with this 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.509
 look different then simply for 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.490
 attract more female audience since the 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.620
 majority of current viewers of 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.419
 magritte the pony as they are men by 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.639
 that made this movie like the 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:16.800
 typical series for girls but I do not know 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.900
 worry friends that this movie is not 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.030
 only for the female audience and 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.190
 that this movie was meant for everything 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.020
 general public also remember that 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.000
 many people before being brownies 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.620
 they said that my little pony the magic of 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.780
 the friendship was only for the public 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.789
 female and they did not accept the first 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.039
 time but over time it turned out 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.409
 liking for that reason I tell them not to judge 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.389
 to a book for its cover last if 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.909
 you are curious to see this 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.190
 film watch it but simply because 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.620
 they do not like it because they ignore the point and 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.659
 my case, I recommend them because it is 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.699
 very entertaining and sure it will get them 

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.540
 a smile to most people that the 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.790
 see 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.040
 good friends that's all for today many 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.000
 thanks for watching this video and I hope that 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.100
 you liked it 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.100
 I see then take care to
