00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:07.420
 now welcome to academy internet 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.040
 they ask us to find the rational number that 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.420
 is between a quarter and five 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.340
 sixth in such a way that the distance to 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.140
 first be twice the distance the 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.460
 second 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.230
 we have fractions 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.669
 The first thing to do when 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.380
 I have a fraction, it's always 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:30.019
 homogenize the is the first step 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.579
 as its congenital causing the 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.010
 denominators are equal 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.550
 in this case taking out their common minimum 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.629
 multiple 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.629
 it's first 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.949
 I am 12 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.809
 there is a room and then I had five 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.109
 sixth as I do here so it is the 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.339
 denominator 12 very easy multiplied this 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.229
 by 3 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.399
 then I already have 12 and here also had 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.199
 that multiply by 3 so that it does not 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.399
 alter equality here I do something 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.690
 seemed 6 multiplied by 2 and I get 12 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.229
 5 for 2 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.810
 10 then 10 12 to 2 is the same as 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.350
 say 5 sixth now look like they have 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.990
 another way the numbers these 3 12 to 2 and 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.000
 this is 10 12 to 2 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.220
 that making them beautiful before you saw 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.220
 a 45 sixth and I did not even know who 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.320
 I was the oldest now that you have the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.360
 denominators matched only 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.490
 criticisms in numerators 3 and 10 already 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.530
 you know that this for example is greater 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.000
 for they tell you that there is the number 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.680
 rational that lies between those two 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.479
 whose rate the first is double the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.880
 this is the second one is to say only 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.979
 just look at the numerators because 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.979
 have equal dominators suppose that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.619
 have your straight 1 be like this 300 be 10 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.630
 then that there is a distance from 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.230
 first be twice the distance 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.780
 second know, I do not like it here 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.170
 because this distance is double what 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.170
 what is here, something like that is 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.810
 therefore it is not worth 12 and true 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.180
 1 look for equipment for example 2 there 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.310
 team is how important they are going to 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.910
 be in that proportion 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.440
 therefore you say 3 more this and more 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.200
 this has to give me 10 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.200
 2 to the mass is 13 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:27.080
 and in that way I get 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:29.830
 the value from 10 - 37 to is7 thirds 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.890
 if you want to find x 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.710
 that I will have to do or 3 to add 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.030
 twice to 10 subtract the height when 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.820
 you go to the left subtract and when you go to 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.800
 right sums therefore x is going to be 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.700
 very easy to find because you say that x 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.880
 it is 10 minus 7 thirds 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.360
 3 for 10 30 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:59.910
 minus 723 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.910
 23 thirds that's what it's worth x 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.299
 A) Yes 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.200
 but the little problem that you number 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.019
 it was 3 over 12 10 over 12 x over 12 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.569
 good easy divide about 2 to what 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.700
 would be x was 23 thirds 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.590
 this you divide between 2 12 on one 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.530
 to complete the fraction ends and 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.130
 media 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.840
 23 x 123 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.540
 3 x 12 36 solution then first great 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.850
 step homogenized that way we have 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.260
 control over the fraction we already know that 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.390
 is greater than the least if we want 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.160
 we can add there we can subtract is very 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.090
 easy good back is a straight 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.610
 interpreting the conditions of 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.670
 problem 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.380
 let's hope we helped you 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.950
 if this guys leave their doubts 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.730
 we see 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.730
 see you soon
