it's a nice design um it's like a little

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.030 
it's a nice design um it's like a little
wet<00:03:10.260> leads<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:12.420> yeah<00:03:13.420> this<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.470> little<00:03:14.709> try

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
wet leads that yeah this is little try

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.199 
wet leads that yeah this is little try
piece<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.810> can<00:03:16.989> stand<00:03:17.319> up<00:03:17.790> wait<00:03:18.790> that<00:03:19.030> make

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
piece so it can stand up wait that make

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.119 
piece so it can stand up wait that make
it<00:03:19.599> makes<00:03:19.900> it<00:03:20.049> harder<00:03:20.349> for<00:03:20.379> it<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.590> stand<00:03:20.950> up

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
it makes it harder for it to stand up

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.330 
it makes it harder for it to stand up
doesn't<00:03:21.790> stand<00:03:22.060> at<00:03:22.180> warm<00:03:22.390> starts<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:24.040> get<00:03:24.159> the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
doesn't stand at warm starts you get the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.240 
doesn't stand at warm starts you get the
guy<00:03:24.519> with<00:03:24.579> without<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.599> gun<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.290> put

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
guy with without the gun and you put

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:48.150 
guy with without the gun and you put
them<00:03:27.370> on<00:03:27.549> to<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:28.060> hand<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.470> single<00:03:29.470> second

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.020 

so<00:03:49.160> they<00:03:49.370> go<00:03:49.670> he's<00:03:49.940> like<00:03:50.540> hitting<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:52.340> he's

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
so they go he's like hitting and he's

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.990 
so they go he's like hitting and he's
just<00:03:53.720> pursue<00:03:54.850> you<00:03:55.850> can<00:03:56.060> might<00:03:56.300> fly<00:03:57.080> with<00:03:57.320> him

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
just pursue you can might fly with him

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.280 
just pursue you can might fly with him
whistling<00:03:59.000> now<00:03:59.750> on<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.070> hi<00:04:01.190> face

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
whistling now on to the hi face

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.450 
whistling now on to the hi face
there<00:04:03.290> are<00:04:03.440> two<00:04:03.650> ways<00:04:03.830> this<00:04:04.040> thinking

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
there are two ways this thinking

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.610 
there are two ways this thinking
connects<00:04:04.940> can<00:04:05.750> connect<00:04:06.310> like<00:04:07.310> this<00:04:08.620> that

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
connects can connect like this that

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.070 
connects can connect like this that
triangle<00:04:10.220> piece<00:04:10.430> this<00:04:10.850> like<00:04:11.210> triangle<00:04:11.690> pieces

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
triangle piece this like triangle pieces

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.770 
triangle piece this like triangle pieces
mentor<00:04:12.710> is<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.430> part<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:13.910> turret<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:14.510> you

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
mentor is a part of the turret and you

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.070 
mentor is a part of the turret and you
can<00:04:14.930> pick<00:04:15.800> that<00:04:15.980> bit<00:04:16.250> off<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:16.850> can<00:04:17.810> we<00:04:17.930> write

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
can pick that bit off so can we write

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.229 
can pick that bit off so can we write
that<00:04:18.109> and<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.950> can<00:04:19.070> attach<00:04:19.340> with<00:04:19.459> us<00:04:19.609> why<00:04:19.880> thing

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
that and it can attach with us why thing

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.600 
that and it can attach with us why thing
and<00:04:21.080> just<00:04:21.109> take<00:04:21.470> that<00:04:21.500> out<00:04:21.709> there<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.490> a

and just take that out there and a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.900 
and just take that out there and a
separate<00:04:24.100> self<00:04:25.100> of<00:04:25.250> this<00:04:25.400> challenge<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:27.910> it's

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910
