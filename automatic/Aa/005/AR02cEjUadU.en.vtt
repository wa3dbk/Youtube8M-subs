00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
bust out the max strength with dds

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.920 
bust out the max strength with dds
excluding<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> Goliath<00:01:47.700> gloves<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.299> know<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
excluding the Goliath gloves I know I

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.719 
excluding the Goliath gloves I know I
should<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.530> brought<00:01:49.860> some<00:01:49.920> spec<00:01:50.399> restores

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
should have brought some spec restores

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.399 
should have brought some spec restores
that<00:01:51.000> only<00:01:51.119> lasts<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.509> about<00:01:51.659> 10<00:01:51.990> minutes<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
that only lasts for about 10 minutes and

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.460 
that only lasts for about 10 minutes and
then<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.950> recharge<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.520> five<00:01:53.729> hours<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
then the recharge is five hours so I I

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.959 
then the recharge is five hours so I I
was<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:55.860> really<00:01:56.040> excited<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> try<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.759> out

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
was just really excited to try it out

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.120 
was just really excited to try it out
wasn't<00:01:57.689> really<00:01:57.869> thinking<00:01:58.079> about<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.409> as<00:01:58.680> you

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
wasn't really thinking about it as you

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
wasn't really thinking about it as you
guys<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.430> tell<00:01:59.670> when<00:01:59.969> overloaded<00:02:00.750> my<00:02:00.899> stats

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
guys can tell when overloaded my stats

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.499 
guys can tell when overloaded my stats
are<00:02:01.439> now<00:02:01.530> 133<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.430> attack<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.969> strength<00:02:03.299> in

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
are now 133 on attack and strength in

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.480 
are now 133 on attack and strength in
comparison<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> 125<00:02:04.920> which<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.399> would

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
comparison to 125 which you would

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.490 
comparison to 125 which you would
normally<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:06.060> without<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.570> URL<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.290> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
normally be without the URL that is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.710 
normally be without the URL that is
actually<00:02:08.069> quite<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.369> bit<00:02:08.580> +<00:02:08.849> 8<00:02:09.060> levels<00:02:09.390> that's

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
actually quite a bit + 8 levels that's

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 
actually quite a bit + 8 levels that's
almost<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.830> from<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.280> super<00:02:11.550> attack<00:02:11.819> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
almost like going from a super attack to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.340 
almost like going from a super attack to
extreme<00:02:12.599> attack

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
extreme attack

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.660 
extreme attack
this<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.740> brings<00:02:13.860> it<00:02:14.100> one<00:02:14.250> step<00:02:14.460> further

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
this just brings it one step further

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.200 
this just brings it one step further
than<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.480> almost<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:16.370> if<00:02:17.370> there<00:02:18.030> were

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
than that it's almost like if there were

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.030 
than that it's almost like if there were
another<00:02:18.540> potion<00:02:18.810> better<00:02:19.170> than<00:02:19.320> extremes<00:02:19.770> i'd

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
another potion better than extremes i'd

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.300 
another potion better than extremes i'd
name<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.700> nuclear<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.170> nuclear<00:02:22.650> super

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
name it nuclear it's a nuclear super

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.570 
name it nuclear it's a nuclear super

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
if you're training I used to go to its

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.400 
if you're training I used to go to its
Azar's<00:02:44.940> all<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.420> time<00:02:45.660> with<00:02:45.870> Jack<00:02:46.110> it's

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
have to make multiples of it and keep

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.480 
have to make multiples of it and keep
the<00:03:06.900> extra<00:03:06.960> one<00:03:07.290> for<00:03:07.320> yourself<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.160> who's<00:03:08.460> I
