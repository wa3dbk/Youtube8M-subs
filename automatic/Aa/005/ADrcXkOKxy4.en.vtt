 hello my friends from the earth 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.270
 for some time that does not appear to 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.800
 here but now I'm back and I'm 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.200
 bringing some new news 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.510
 important for you to use the pedal 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:29.300
 simple and use a double pedal well we 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.140
 let's learn how to use two three four 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.269
 notes with only one progress and making 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.410
 the division of these notes 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.410
 aquino chimbau 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.579

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.280
 demonstrate for you the exercise well 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.590
 simple and comfortable where you can 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.290
 develop this exercise 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.699
 you have to use only your hands and do 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.610
 and solfejo of the divisions 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:06.200
 so come on 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:13.729

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.340
 And then you feel how you feel. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.740
 with the divisions 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.280
 now we are going to do this exercise in 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.280
 drums 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.619
 It was very beautiful, beautiful, handsome. 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.450
 you must be wondering borja de 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:28.019
 January can and will develop exercise 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.209
 applications and how is it the 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.330
 first step you have to develop 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.130
 the exercise with the subway in which 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.290
 tell if that's what you do 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.870
 You have to use the subway there and there you go. 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.900
 accelerating gradually starts well 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.040
 slow and accelerating and accelerating 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.160
 fine 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.459
 applications will come from the 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.500
 When you're already well habit you 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.000
 already can do a good job and 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.489
 you're already pretty sure 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 Are you sure about this? 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.989
 that things will happen with your 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:07.440
 study sequence, I'm going to make a 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.840
 demonstration a little faster than 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.799
 exercise for you here on earth 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.799
