00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.610
 and the site is not very super-duper 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.649
 to record video for playing in 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.039

 The first torrent file distribution is very 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.190
 big you download 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.260

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.620
 after installation I advise you to download 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.920

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.090
 crack because the game is on 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.700
 English is the only way around here 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.019
 it takes a little right 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:56.730
 you can even look megabytes well this 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:03:01.260

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:20.030
 the site registered there downloaded 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:22.680

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.099
 from these file so that you don't 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.370
