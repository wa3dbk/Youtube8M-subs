00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.020 
good look at the Aqualung legend supreme
regulator<00:00:08.849> so<00:00:09.360> let's<00:00:09.510> take<00:00:09.750> closer<00:00:10.019> look

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
regulator so let's take closer look

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.209 
regulator so let's take closer look
the<00:00:12.030> legend<00:00:12.360> supreme<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.139> cold<00:00:13.650> water<00:00:13.799> rated

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
the legend supreme is a cold water rated

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.730 
the legend supreme is a cold water rated
regulator<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.299> designed<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.049> extreme

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
regulator so it's designed for extreme

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.040

incredible performance in any condition

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.320 
incredible performance in any condition
if<00:00:27.269> we<00:00:27.359> have<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.510> look<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> first<00:00:28.019> stage

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
if we have a look at the first stage

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.209 
if we have a look at the first stage
they<00:00:30.330> say<00:00:30.510> it's<00:00:30.660> quite<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> tall<00:00:31.230> first<00:00:31.949> stage

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
they say it's quite a tall first stage

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.040 
they say it's quite a tall first stage
because<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> has<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.090> environmental<00:00:33.719> cap<00:00:33.899> on

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
because it has this environmental cap on

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.200 
because it has this environmental cap on
top<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.530> protect<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> internal<00:00:35.309> parts<00:00:35.820> from

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
top to protect the internal parts from

well
got<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:39.899> fins<00:00:40.170> around<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.950> center<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.790> is

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
got some fins around the center this is

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
got some fins around the center this is
it<00:00:41.969> acts<00:00:42.239> like<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.510> heat<00:00:42.780> exchanger<00:00:43.379> C<00:00:43.680> will

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
it acts like a heat exchanger C will

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
it acts like a heat exchanger C will
transfer<00:00:44.670> some<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.000> cold<00:00:45.270> away<00:00:45.690> from<00:00:46.020> the

here but also 232 bar a clamp as well a
nice<00:00:57.239> feature<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.989> these<00:00:58.440> first<00:00:58.710> stages<00:00:59.010> just

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
nice feature in these first stages just

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.209 
nice feature in these first stages just
inside<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.210> din<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.680> also<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
inside this din here and also on the a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.130 
inside this din here and also on the a
clamp<00:01:02.550> there's<00:01:02.969> an<00:01:03.149> ACD<00:01:03.480> which<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.930> an<00:01:03.989> auto

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
clamp there's an ACD which is an auto

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.710 
clamp there's an ACD which is an auto
closure<00:01:04.589> device<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.850> when<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> regulators

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
closure device so when the regulators

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.060 
closure device so when the regulators
off<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.200> cylinder<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:07.920> not

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
off the cylinder and it's not
pressurized<00:01:08.460> there's<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.390> little<00:01:09.630> cap<00:01:09.780> inside

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
pressurized there's a little cap inside

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.260 
pressurized there's a little cap inside
which<00:01:10.380> springs<00:01:10.740> sharp<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.700> prevents<00:01:12.180> any

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
which springs sharp and it prevents any

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.390 
which springs sharp and it prevents any
contaminants<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.049> water<00:01:13.290> getting<00:01:13.950> into<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
contaminants of water getting into the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
contaminants of water getting into the
first<00:01:14.640> stage<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.240> obviously<00:01:15.479> causing<00:01:15.930> any

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
first stage and obviously causing any

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.109 
first stage and obviously causing any
problems<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:17.369> available<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.850> din

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
problems so that's available on the din

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
problems so that's available on the din
here<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.540> also<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> clamp<00:01:19.740> as<00:01:19.890> well<00:01:21.830> first

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
here and also the a clamp as well first

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.340 
here and also the a clamp as well first
stage<00:01:23.009> has<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.790> low<00:01:24.000> pressure<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.600> single<00:01:25.259> high

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
stage has to low pressure a single high

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.740 
stage has to low pressure a single high
pressure<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.860> both<00:01:26.070> sides<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.790> total<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.570> low

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
pressure on both sides so total for low

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.170 
pressure on both sides so total for low
pressure<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:29.070> high<00:01:29.310> pressure<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
pressure and to high pressure I was a

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
pressure and to high pressure I was a
great<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.630> cobalt<00:01:30.960> use<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> do<00:01:31.829> have

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
great for cobalt use because you do have

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.749 
great for cobalt use because you do have
dry<00:01:32.610> suit<00:01:32.909> BCD<00:01:33.780> regulators<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:35.040> high<00:01:35.490> pressure

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

so<00:01:38.400> all<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> ports<00:01:38.970> do<00:01:39.150> get<00:01:39.360> used<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.780> very

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
so all the ports do get used up very

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.399 
so all the ports do get used up very
quickly<00:01:41.060> chrome<00:01:42.060> plated<00:01:42.450> for<00:01:42.899> all<00:01:43.229> Z

protection<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.909> bit<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.270> longer<00:01:45.540> life

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
protection is a bit of a longer life

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.899 
protection is a bit of a longer life
helps<00:01:46.380> protect<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.340> brass<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
helps protect that that brass and

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.600 
helps protect that that brass and
underneath<00:01:50.090> hoses<00:01:51.090> are<00:01:51.329> braid<00:01:52.140> style<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.490> do

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
underneath hoses are braid style so do

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.490 
underneath hoses are braid style so do
have<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.820> much<00:01:54.210> higher<00:01:54.420> burst<00:01:54.840> pressure<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.470> as

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
have a much higher burst pressure so as

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.020 
have a much higher burst pressure so as
you've<00:01:55.710> got<00:01:55.829> great<00:01:56.070> protection<00:01:56.369> there<00:01:56.670> but

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
you've got great protection there but

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.959 
you've got great protection there but
also<00:01:57.119> prevent<00:01:57.600> UV<00:01:57.840> damage<00:01:58.200> from<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.250> Sun<00:01:59.460> so

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
also prevent UV damage from the Sun so

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.120 
also prevent UV damage from the Sun so
rubber<00:02:00.689> hoses<00:02:01.079> would<00:02:01.259> perish<00:02:01.649> very<00:02:01.890> quickly

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
rubber hoses would perish very quickly

again<00:02:11.520> cold<00:02:11.849> water<00:02:12.030> rated<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.959> as<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.170> can<00:02:13.260> see

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
again cold water rated so as you can see

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.559 
again cold water rated so as you can see
here<00:02:13.650> as<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:14.250> enters<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.849> second<00:02:15.209> stage<00:02:15.390> we've

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
here as it enters the second stage we've

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.930 
here as it enters the second stage we've
got<00:02:15.660> another<00:02:15.840> heat<00:02:16.349> exchanger<00:02:16.980> again<00:02:17.730> just

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
got another heat exchanger again just

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.059 
got another heat exchanger again just

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
helps warm up the airflow as it enters

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.250 
helps warm up the airflow as it enters
into<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> second<00:02:20.760> stage<00:02:21.080> preventing<00:02:22.080> any

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
designed to be smaller and lighter so

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.559 
designed to be smaller and lighter so
it's<00:02:30.150> very<00:02:30.420> very<00:02:30.630> comfortable<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.319> mouth

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
it's very very comfortable in the mouth

have a look around big perch button on

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.360 
have a look around big perch button on
the<00:02:36.120> front<00:02:36.299> very<00:02:36.660> easy<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.260> access<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
black faceplate gives it a nice stylish

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.280 
black faceplate gives it a nice stylish
look<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:44.040> exhaust<00:02:44.849> deflector<00:02:45.450> spins<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
design to be slightly wider so it gives

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.050 
design to be slightly wider so it gives
you<00:02:48.329> a<00:02:48.420> more<00:02:48.599> dispersed<00:02:49.459> bubble<00:02:50.459> around<00:02:50.760> the

of<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.829> mask<00:02:53.040> great<00:02:53.579> took<00:02:53.970> the

of the mask great took the

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.170 
of the mask great took the
photographer's<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.049> that<00:02:55.140> point<00:02:55.349> of<00:02:55.440> view

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
photographer's for that point of view

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.210 
photographer's for that point of view
and<00:02:57.180> because<00:02:57.480> it's<00:02:57.660> cold<00:02:57.870> water<00:02:58.019> rated<00:02:58.470> do

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
and because it's cold water rated do

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.470 
and because it's cold water rated do
have<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.700> lip<00:03:00.150> shield<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.980> mouthpiece

have this lip shield on the mouthpiece

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.759 
have this lip shield on the mouthpiece
obviously<00:03:03.480> easy<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.989> remove<00:03:04.319> but<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.620> does

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
obviously easy to remove but it does

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.680 
obviously easy to remove but it does
give<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.010> bit<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.310> comfort<00:03:05.519> around<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.120> lips<00:03:06.329> as

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
give a bit of comfort around the lips as

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.150 
give a bit of comfort around the lips as

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
he prevents that cold water flushing

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.130 
he prevents that cold water flushing
across<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:08.910> lips<00:03:09.150> keeps<00:03:09.720> me<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> little<00:03:10.019> bit

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
across the lips keeps me a little bit

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.430 
across the lips keeps me a little bit
warmer<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.000> mouthpiece<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.720> fog

silicone all the edges been rounded off

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.629 
silicone all the edges been rounded off
to<00:03:15.690> get<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> nice<00:03:16.019> smooth<00:03:16.290> finish<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.889> do<00:03:17.489> have

to get a nice smooth finish and do have

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.640 
to get a nice smooth finish and do have
this<00:03:17.760> bridge<00:03:18.090> across<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.780> top<00:03:18.930> male<00:03:19.200> face<00:03:19.440> to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
this bridge across the top male face to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.900 
this bridge across the top male face to
prevent<00:03:19.799> your<00:03:20.130> mouth<00:03:20.250> from<00:03:20.430> drying<00:03:20.670> out<00:03:20.880> so

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
prevent your mouth from drying out so

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.240 
prevent your mouth from drying out so
much<00:03:21.239> obviously<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:22.260> filter<00:03:22.920> there

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
much obviously you the filter there

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.390 
much obviously you the filter there
doesn't<00:03:23.880> have<00:03:24.030> mooster<00:03:24.780> in<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.440> normally<00:03:26.280> your

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
doesn't have mooster in so normally your

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.920 
doesn't have mooster in so normally your
mouth<00:03:26.549> will<00:03:26.760> get<00:03:26.910> very<00:03:27.150> dry<00:03:27.329> but<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.750> just

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
mouth will get very dry but it just

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.680 
mouth will get very dry but it just
helps<00:03:28.109> keep<00:03:28.799> your<00:03:28.920> mouth<00:03:29.850> a<00:03:29.880> bit<00:03:30.060> more<00:03:30.450> moist

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
helps keep your mouth a bit more moist

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.970 
helps keep your mouth a bit more moist
on<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.970> side<00:03:33.239> I've<00:03:33.780> got<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.959> venturi<00:03:34.440> control

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
on the side I've got a venturi control

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.470 
on the side I've got a venturi control
so<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.150> its<00:03:36.269> positive<00:03:36.930> mode<00:03:37.109> just<00:03:37.859> here<00:03:38.480> it's

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
so in its positive mode just here it's

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.210 
so in its positive mode just here it's
giving<00:03:39.720> your<00:03:39.840> best<00:03:39.989> flow<00:03:40.470> towards<00:03:41.160> a

giving your best flow towards a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.490 
giving your best flow towards a
mouthpiece<00:03:41.900> obviously<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.319> best

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
mouthpiece obviously the best

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.009 
mouthpiece obviously the best
performance<00:03:43.980> as<00:03:44.100> well<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:45.420> if<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:45.750> put<00:03:45.930> it

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
performance as well and if you put it

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.199 
performance as well and if you put it
into<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.200> minus<00:03:46.590> position<00:03:46.769> for<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.609> it<00:03:47.760> was

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
into the minus position for if it was

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.330 
into the minus position for if it was
for<00:03:48.630> instance<00:03:48.720> an<00:03:49.049> octopus<00:03:49.500> put<00:03:50.069> it<00:03:50.160> in<00:03:50.250> its

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
for instance an octopus put it in its

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.580 
for instance an octopus put it in its
minus<00:03:50.670> position<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.389> it<00:03:51.780> will<00:03:51.870> deflect<00:03:52.410> the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
minus position and it will deflect the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.650 
minus position and it will deflect the
air<00:03:52.739> back<00:03:53.069> towards<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.489> diaphragm<00:03:53.970> first<00:03:54.329> so

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
air back towards the diaphragm first so

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.210 
air back towards the diaphragm first so
it's<00:03:54.780> forcing<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.260> dollar<00:03:55.440> for<00:03:55.620> ml<00:03:55.859> which

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
it's forcing the dollar for ml which

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.920 
it's forcing the dollar for ml which
owes<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.489> helps<00:03:56.700> close<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.030> valve<00:03:57.510> inside

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
owes it helps close the valve inside
