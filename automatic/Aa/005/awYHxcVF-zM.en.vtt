00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.460
 And then, beauty, I'm here again. 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.530
 One more video for you and I said that 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.900
 a video tells why she's asking me 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.040
 handling tips and such is the 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.900
 comments from some previous videos 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.330
 mine and delayed for today that it is very useful 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:31.660
 both moving and improving 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:35.470
 in general in the code to play the game because 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.020
 the guy the game is a kind of floral 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.920
 for those who do not know each person who 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.219
 kills everything to postpone and who kills 20 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.829
 people are 20 years who have killed 23 ca 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:52.629
 and kill one with all weapons 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:56.140
 whoever does it wins first is and how 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.360
 is kind and there are people of all 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.379
 sides and this helps a lot to train your 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.090
 movement 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.059
 does not exist unb and in my opinion is 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.800
 there is no way to teach with it 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.850
 the map I think the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.320
 movement was a business that I 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.319
 I learned over time each has its 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.690
 understands and I think in the focus can is the 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:23.979
 helps to improve and have a move 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:25.720
 more intelligent and and the game he besides 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.959
 help improve movement 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.509
 tourist will use various weapons ie 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.550
 will learn and tico did not learn vote 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.369
 may have discovered a weapon that does not 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.259
 I knew it was good understands will test 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.310
 several virtual classes and thank you 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.229
 win and you will meet but this will not 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.599
 know how to play right year will end 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.069
 learning will have to learn it themselves 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:53.470
 is to win the game and it is very 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.690
 cool plus a fun way is 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.069
 had everything for those who do not know a divan 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.810
 deck he made a video a year ago 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.330
 showing the game and saying it was a 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.950
 so it claims to have this and it is true 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.340
 very very fun way beyond the line 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.650
 what to help you and move and 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.930
 learned to use things he does not know is 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.360
 a fun man does not have this thing of 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.550
 voice and mary any crap can not 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.510
 create easy it is to you weapon the game 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.330
 edel and really a very fun way 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.959
 he here in dops a number actually only 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.620
 had to play net project in e 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.230
 never 42 now has a new playlist 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.620
 public and is a sometimes fun when 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.900
 has when everything is in a face more or 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.430
 less of the same ability that everything ends 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.920
 creating a framework 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.049
 I do not know a little competition now 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.280
 getting a lot of fun a very 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:54.170
 cool to play and I'm really liking it 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.360
 the hardest part of passing 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.640
 it's that wii game are when in my 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.829
 opinion when catching swan for a year I 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.840
 I'm really bad, do not you see, man. 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.090
 I do not think that this match nor 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.790
 gap released two players in the team 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.519
 What on earth and man I expect so much 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.350
 that this tip is this tip have 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.600
 I helped you because I know you have 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:20.750
 new people in my carnival in the 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:23.930
 new and this type of code and I tip 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.459
 I did not know what to say, and then 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.370
 when he defended vander made a video 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:33.829
 and I realized that this helps and 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:36.799
 so it's really test a game and quito 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.739
 It's starting, you can say that you do not win. 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.889
 always keep playing until 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.650
 start to win because besides being 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.030
 is a lot of fun and help a lot but 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.410
 so this is it people who liked the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.599
 time video giving a deadline value 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.630
 of the disclosure and we were very short 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:57.069
 when you put a buffalo at home and keep 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.069
 That's it, people said. 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.040
 haha ha
