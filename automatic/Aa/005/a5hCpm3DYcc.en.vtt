00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
big goal that we were trying here this

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.200 
big goal that we were trying here this
time<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.010> needed<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.520> very<00:00:59.550> consistent

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
time is it needed to be very consistent

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.049 
time is it needed to be very consistent
with<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.079> Cadillac<00:01:01.500> portfolio<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.850> when<00:01:02.969> you

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
with the Cadillac portfolio so when you

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.119

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
get into this Escalade it has a very

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.149 
get into this Escalade it has a very
similar<00:01:05.579> family<00:01:06.149> resemblance<00:01:06.749> to<00:01:06.899> our<00:01:07.020> CTS<00:01:07.709> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
