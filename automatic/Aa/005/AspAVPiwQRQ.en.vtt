Academy and I'm here today with another
Sonic's<00:00:14.790> tip<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.870> technique<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
Sonic's tip and technique and it's the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.010 
Sonic's tip and technique and it's the
Sonic's<00:00:18.690> Oxford<00:00:19.260> trans<00:00:19.710> mod<00:00:20.600> really<00:00:21.600> what

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
Sonic's Oxford trans mod really what

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.290 
Sonic's Oxford trans mod really what
this<00:00:22.199> plug-in<00:00:22.410> does<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.100> what<00:00:23.400> most<00:00:23.699> sort<00:00:24.269> of

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
this plug-in does and what most sort of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.320 
this plug-in does and what most sort of
envelope<00:00:24.810> shapers<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.699> transient<00:00:26.699> shapers<00:00:27.119> is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
envelope shapers do transient shapers is

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.269 
envelope shapers do transient shapers is
they<00:00:27.900> allow<00:00:28.199> you<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.439> enhance<00:00:29.099> or<00:00:30.080> lessen<00:00:31.279> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
they allow you to enhance or lessen the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.330 
they allow you to enhance or lessen the
transients<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> program<00:00:33.630> material<00:00:34.340> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
transients in the program material and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.700 
transients in the program material and
so<00:00:35.670> really<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.450> add<00:00:36.690> punch<00:00:37.079> or<00:00:37.380> take

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so really you can add punch or take

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
so really you can add punch or take
punch<00:00:38.010> away<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.510> in<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.690> very

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
punch away and you can do it in a very

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.130 
punch away and you can do it in a very
simple<00:00:40.649> way<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.910> course<00:00:42.180> if<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.840> want<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
simple way and of course if you want to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.560 
simple way and of course if you want to
do<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:43.950> complex<00:00:44.430> fashion<00:00:44.730> there

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
do it in a more complex fashion there

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.319 
do it in a more complex fashion there
are<00:00:45.690> controls<00:00:46.110> for<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:47.340> again<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
are controls for that but again one of

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.830 
are controls for that but again one of
the<00:00:48.480> genius<00:00:49.260> things<00:00:49.559> about<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.660> engineers<00:00:51.660> at

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the genius things about the engineers at

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.750 
the genius things about the engineers at
Sonic's<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.739> they<00:00:52.920> develop<00:00:53.370> these<00:00:53.489> very

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
Sonic's is that they develop these very

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.750 
Sonic's is that they develop these very
sophisticated<00:00:54.000> plugins<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.920> very<00:00:56.340> simple

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
sophisticated plugins with very simple

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.849 
sophisticated plugins with very simple
interfaces<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.109> work<00:00:58.289> very<00:00:58.590> quickly

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
interfaces so you can work very quickly

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.139 
interfaces so you can work very quickly
and<00:00:59.489> get<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> very<00:01:01.140> dramatic<00:01:01.320> or<00:01:01.829> subtle<00:01:02.250> effect

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and get a very dramatic or subtle effect

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.899 
and get a very dramatic or subtle effect
right<00:01:03.570> away<00:01:03.870> without<00:01:04.650> too<00:01:05.250> much<00:01:05.519> digging

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
right away without too much digging

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.289 
right away without too much digging
about<00:01:06.299> under<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.229> hood<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.240> people<00:01:09.240> are

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
about under the hood so people are

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.240 
about under the hood so people are
always<00:01:09.450> asking<00:01:09.570> me<00:01:10.080> how<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.590> make<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> kick

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
always asking me how do you make a kick

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.990 
always asking me how do you make a kick
really<00:01:11.610> punch<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.900> mix<00:01:13.140> especially<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:14.040> EDM

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
really punch in a mix especially in EDM

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.249 
really punch in a mix especially in EDM
it's<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.570> critical<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.840> we've<00:01:19.110> all

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
it's so critical and I think we've all

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.710 
it's so critical and I think we've all
discovered<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.729> simply<00:01:21.180> turning<00:01:21.509> up

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
discovered that just simply turning up

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.450 
discovered that just simply turning up
the<00:01:21.840> fader<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> kick<00:01:22.590> drum<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:23.070> not<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the fader of the kick drum is not the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.300 
the fader of the kick drum is not the
answer<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:25.439> happens<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.250> start

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
answer because what happens is you start

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.090 
answer because what happens is you start
to<00:01:26.729> encroach<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.420> your<00:01:27.570> head<00:01:27.750> room<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.920> can

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
to encroach on your head room you can

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.600 
to encroach on your head room you can
distort<00:01:29.430> your<00:01:29.549> mix<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.890> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.189> clog

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
distort your mix and you can also clog

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.460 
distort your mix and you can also clog
up<00:01:32.820> your<00:01:32.850> low-end<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.900> way<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.320> not

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
up your low-end in a way that's not

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.490 
up your low-end in a way that's not
really<00:01:34.860> satisfying<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:37.229> are<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.350> lot<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
really satisfying so there are a lot of

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.469 
really satisfying so there are a lot of
different<00:01:37.920> methods<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.460> making<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.210> kick

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
different methods for making the kick

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.260 
different methods for making the kick
come<00:01:39.840> forward<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> mix<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> them<00:01:42.150> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
come forward in the mix one of them that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.899 
come forward in the mix one of them that
we<00:01:42.390> use<00:01:42.600> quite<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.899> bit<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.790> multi<00:01:44.790> band

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
we use quite a bit is multi band

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.730 
we use quite a bit is multi band
saturation<00:01:45.540> where<00:01:45.720> we'll<00:01:45.869> take<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
saturation where we'll take the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.460 
saturation where we'll take the
mid-range<00:01:47.240> section<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.420> kick<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.930> we'll

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
mid-range section of a kick and we'll

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.740 
mid-range section of a kick and we'll
brighten<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:49.920> with<00:01:50.399> some<00:01:50.759> bright

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
brighten it up with some bright

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.550 
brighten it up with some bright
saturation<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.710> works<00:01:52.890> great<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:54.560> this

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
saturation and that works great but this

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.940 
saturation and that works great but this
trans<00:01:55.950> mod<00:01:56.250> does<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.939> trick<00:01:57.270> with<00:01:57.689> really<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
trans mod does the trick with really to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.899 
trans mod does the trick with really to
faders<00:01:59.280> essentially<00:02:00.799> so<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.759> a

let's just give a quick listen to his

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.890 
let's just give a quick listen to his
track<00:02:17.370> I'm<00:02:17.580> gonna<00:02:17.730> bypass<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.390> plug-in<00:02:18.720> we'll

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
track I'm gonna bypass the plug-in we'll

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:39.270 
track I'm gonna bypass the plug-in we'll
give<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.140> quick<00:02:19.260> listen

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.230 

so<00:02:40.280> kind<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.850> happy<00:02:41.540> optimistic<00:02:41.810> track<00:02:42.590> and

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
so kind of a happy optimistic track and

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.000 
so kind of a happy optimistic track and
let's<00:02:44.240> take<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.450> look<00:02:44.690> here<00:02:45.140> at<00:02:45.320> our<00:02:45.770> kick<00:02:45.980> drum

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
let's take a look here at our kick drum

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.060 
let's take a look here at our kick drum
so<00:02:46.490> we'll<00:02:46.640> solo<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.510> kick<00:02:47.750> now<00:02:48.410> in<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.860> mix

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
so we'll solo the kick now in the mix

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.640 
so we'll solo the kick now in the mix
it's<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.700> nice<00:02:49.910> organized<00:02:50.570> mix<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.080> we<00:02:51.260> do<00:02:51.470> need

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
it's a nice organized mix but we do need

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.290 
it's a nice organized mix but we do need
a<00:02:51.710> little<00:02:51.920> bit<00:02:52.130> more<00:02:52.310> presents<00:02:52.850> from<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.030> kick

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
a little bit more presents from the kick

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.230 
a little bit more presents from the kick
drum<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.230> let's<00:02:54.410> let's<00:02:54.800> just<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.190> train<00:02:56.090> our

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
drum so let's let's just to train our

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.390 
drum so let's let's just to train our
ears<00:02:56.420> for<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.630> second<00:02:56.960> to<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.140> kick<00:02:57.530> drum<00:02:57.800> let's

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
ears for a second to the kick drum let's

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.970 
ears for a second to the kick drum let's
give<00:02:58.640> it<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.820> listen<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.330> solo<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:05.770> that's<00:03:06.770> our

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
give it a listen and solo and that's our

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.280 
give it a listen and solo and that's our
kick<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.660> first<00:03:08.660> thing<00:03:08.810> we<00:03:08.870> want<00:03:09.050> to<00:03:09.110> do

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
kick so first thing we want to do

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.130 
kick so first thing we want to do
actually<00:03:09.590> is<00:03:10.070> will<00:03:10.670> stay<00:03:11.360> in<00:03:11.510> solo<00:03:11.930> let's

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
actually is will stay in solo let's

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.360 
actually is will stay in solo let's
bypass<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.830> plug<00:03:13.070> in<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:14.600> two<00:03:15.370> most

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
bypass the plug in the two most

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.680 
bypass the plug in the two most
important<00:03:17.060> faders<00:03:17.540> for<00:03:18.260> at<00:03:18.560> least<00:03:18.800> kick<00:03:19.190> drum

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
important faders for at least kick drum

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.930 
important faders for at least kick drum
enhancement<00:03:20.690> really<00:03:21.440> is<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.710> ratio<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.550> I

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
enhancement really is the ratio and I

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.050 
enhancement really is the ratio and I
hate<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.240> give<00:03:23.390> away<00:03:23.540> the<00:03:23.960> punch<00:03:24.260> line<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:25.430> the

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
hate to give away the punch line and the

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.020 
hate to give away the punch line and the
overdrive<00:03:26.480> here<00:03:26.990> so<00:03:27.740> if<00:03:28.100> we<00:03:28.310> want<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.640> enhance

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
overdrive here so if we want to enhance

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.270 
overdrive here so if we want to enhance
the<00:03:29.720> transient<00:03:30.320> we're<00:03:30.470> gonna<00:03:30.560> push<00:03:30.890> up<00:03:31.130> the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
the transient we're gonna push up the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.910 
the transient we're gonna push up the
ratio<00:03:31.700> if<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.540> want<00:03:32.690> to<00:03:32.780> lessen<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.560> initial

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
ratio if you want to lessen the initial

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.500 
ratio if you want to lessen the initial
transient<00:03:34.310> we'll<00:03:34.520> pull<00:03:34.730> down<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:35.030> ratio<00:03:35.330> so

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
transient we'll pull down the ratio so

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.850 
transient we'll pull down the ratio so
let's<00:03:35.690> just<00:03:35.900> listen<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.560> what<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:36.710> sounds

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
let's just listen to what that sounds

00:03:36.860 --> 00:04:09.390 
let's just listen to what that sounds
like

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.070 

so<00:04:10.400> we<00:04:10.520> can<00:04:10.670> see<00:04:10.910> here<00:04:11.150> clearly<00:04:11.300> that<00:04:11.690> we<00:04:11.840> can

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
so we can see here clearly that we can

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.990 
so we can see here clearly that we can
either<00:04:12.260> enhance<00:04:12.590> it<00:04:13.130> or<00:04:13.250> lessen<00:04:13.910> the

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
either enhance it or lessen the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.210 
either enhance it or lessen the
transient<00:04:14.570> of<00:04:14.690> course<00:04:15.410> in<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:15.830> particular

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
transient of course in this particular

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.449 
transient of course in this particular
application<00:04:16.550> we<00:04:17.300> want<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:17.989> enhance<00:04:18.110> it<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:18.770> as

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
application we want to enhance it so as

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.160 
application we want to enhance it so as
we<00:04:19.640> push<00:04:19.970> it<00:04:20.180> up<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.510> we<00:04:20.600> get<00:04:20.720> a<00:04:20.780> little<00:04:21.049> more

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
we push it up and we get a little more

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.540 
we push it up and we get a little more
aggressive<00:04:21.820> we<00:04:22.820> are<00:04:23.150> noticing<00:04:23.660> a<00:04:24.290> bad<00:04:25.220> color

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
aggressive we are noticing a bad color

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.270 
aggressive we are noticing a bad color
here<00:04:25.910> these<00:04:26.150> red<00:04:26.210> lights<00:04:26.890> something<00:04:27.890> we<00:04:28.100> never

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
here these red lights something we never

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.190 
here these red lights something we never
want<00:04:28.520> to<00:04:28.580> see<00:04:28.790> we'd<00:04:29.090> love<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.330> clip<00:04:29.690> analog

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
want to see we'd love to clip analog

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.030 
want to see we'd love to clip analog

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040

clipping digital stuff digital plugins

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.720 
clipping digital stuff digital plugins
we<00:04:38.090> get<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.480> nasty<00:04:38.840> digital<00:04:39.650> square<00:04:40.520> wave

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
we get that nasty digital square wave

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.410 
we get that nasty digital square wave
writing<00:04:41.570> with<00:04:41.780> funky<00:04:42.700> overtones<00:04:43.700> that<00:04:43.910> sound

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
writing with funky overtones that sound

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.740 
writing with funky overtones that sound
usually<00:04:45.260> very<00:04:45.770> unmusical<00:04:46.340> so<00:04:47.330> we<00:04:47.450> don't<00:04:47.630> want

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
usually very unmusical so we don't want

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.240 
usually very unmusical so we don't want
to<00:04:47.780> do<00:04:47.900> that<00:04:48.670> and<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.810> genius<00:04:51.650> engineers

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
to do that and the the genius engineers

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.910 
to do that and the the genius engineers
at<00:04:52.550> sonic's<00:04:53.090> they<00:04:53.600> felt<00:04:53.930> our<00:04:54.110> pain<00:04:54.380> ahead<00:04:54.770> of

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:54.920 
at sonic's they felt our pain ahead of

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.520 
at sonic's they felt our pain ahead of
time<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:55.460> they've<00:04:56.000> provided<00:04:56.420> us<00:04:56.900> with<00:04:56.930> this

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
time and they've provided us with this

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.280 
time and they've provided us with this
overdrive<00:04:58.220> slider<00:04:58.580> what<00:04:59.540> this<00:04:59.720> allows<00:05:00.020> you<00:05:00.260> to

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
overdrive slider what this allows you to

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.560 
overdrive slider what this allows you to
do<00:05:00.560> is<00:05:00.740> be<00:05:00.890> much<00:05:01.220> more<00:05:01.490> aggressive<00:05:01.610> with<00:05:02.420> the

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
do is be much more aggressive with the

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.440 
do is be much more aggressive with the
ratio<00:05:03.080> but<00:05:03.890> you<00:05:04.100> won't<00:05:04.340> clip<00:05:04.670> digital<00:05:05.090> zero<00:05:05.330> in

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
ratio but you won't clip digital zero in

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.550 
ratio but you won't clip digital zero in
fact<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:06.410> can<00:05:06.910> exceed<00:05:07.910> 60<00:05:08.630> B<00:05:08.810> above<00:05:09.170> what

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
fact you can exceed 60 B above what

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.500 
fact you can exceed 60 B above what
would<00:05:09.680> be<00:05:09.800> nominal<00:05:10.220> digital<00:05:10.640> zero<00:05:10.940> without

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
would be nominal digital zero without

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.450 
would be nominal digital zero without
clipping<00:05:11.930> at<00:05:12.170> all<00:05:12.350> and<00:05:12.560> this<00:05:12.770> is<00:05:12.830> really<00:05:13.340> our

clipping at all and this is really our
