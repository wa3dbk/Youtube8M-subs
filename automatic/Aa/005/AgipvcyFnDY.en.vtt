the first thing you want to do is make a
reference<00:00:09.809> drawing<00:00:10.139> for<00:00:10.559> your<00:00:10.679> puppet<00:00:10.980> and

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
reference drawing for your puppet and

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.009 
reference drawing for your puppet and
you<00:00:11.340> want<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> do<00:00:11.610> it<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.880> size<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.630> you

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
you want to do it to the size that you

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.390 
you want to do it to the size that you
want<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.349> sculpt<00:00:13.679> your<00:00:13.769> puppet<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:16.100> then<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.160> cut

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
want to sculpt your puppet at then I cut

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.689 
want to sculpt your puppet at then I cut
two<00:00:17.609> pieces<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:18.029> our<00:00:18.630> core<00:00:18.990> aluminum<00:00:19.650> 1/8<00:00:20.430> inch

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
two pieces of our core aluminum 1/8 inch

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.769 
two pieces of our core aluminum 1/8 inch
wire<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.529> I<00:00:22.529> basically<00:00:22.769> do<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.539> simple<00:00:24.539> shape

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
wire and I basically do the simple shape

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.519 
wire and I basically do the simple shape
of<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.949> puppet<00:00:26.250> feet<00:00:27.199> legs<00:00:28.460> hips<00:00:30.140> waist<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
of the puppet feet legs hips waist and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:48.049 
of the puppet feet legs hips waist and
even<00:00:32.070> curvature<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> shoulder<00:00:47.059> next

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
even curvature of the shoulder next

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.010 
even curvature of the shoulder next
you're<00:00:48.210> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.360> tape<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> two<00:00:48.780> halves

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you're going to tape the two halves

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.260 
you're going to tape the two halves
together<00:00:52.129> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.280> done<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.579> spinal<00:00:53.879> area

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
together this is done in the spinal area

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:02.090 
together this is done in the spinal area
of<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.629> puppet<00:00:55.289> or<00:00:55.440> sculpture<00:00:55.860> I<00:01:00.890> then<00:01:01.890> place

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
of the puppet or sculpture I then place

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.260 
of the puppet or sculpture I then place
it<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.399> picture<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> make<00:01:02.850> sure<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.120> it's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
it on the picture to make sure that it's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.320 
it on the picture to make sure that it's
all<00:01:03.390> lined<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:07.250> next<00:01:08.250> I'll<00:01:08.490> roughly<00:01:08.880> estimate

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
all lined up next I'll roughly estimate

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
all lined up next I'll roughly estimate
where<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.570> hands<00:01:09.900> are<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.260> go<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.680> I'll

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
where the hands are going to go and I'll

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.109 
where the hands are going to go and I'll
clip<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.700> ends<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.900> arms<00:01:16.820> then<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> take

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
clip the ends of the arms then I take

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.230 
clip the ends of the arms then I take
some<00:01:18.150> fast<00:01:18.570> steel<00:01:18.900> or<00:01:19.650> Pro<00:01:19.890> poxy<00:01:20.310> there's<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
some fast steel or Pro poxy there's a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
some fast steel or Pro poxy there's a
two-part<00:01:21.659> epoxy<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.229> kind<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.500> blend

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
two-part epoxy that you kind of blend

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.520 
two-part epoxy that you kind of blend
together<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> putty<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.049> I'll<00:01:25.049> take<00:01:25.290> that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
together like a putty and I'll take that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920 
together like a putty and I'll take that
and<00:01:25.939> I'll<00:01:26.939> apply<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> waist<00:01:27.780> area

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and I'll apply it to the waist area

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.539 
and I'll apply it to the waist area
first<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:29.030> two<00:01:30.030> halves<00:01:34.159> now<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.340> stuff

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
first and two halves now this stuff

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.399 
first and two halves now this stuff
dries<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.909> about<00:01:35.970> five<00:01:36.270> minutes<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.110> know

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
dries in about five minutes so you know

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.160 
dries in about five minutes so you know
you<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.909> place<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:38.939> together<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.689> squish<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you just place it together and squish it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.690 
you just place it together and squish it
around<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:41.130> sure<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> shape<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
around make sure you get the shape that

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.340 
around make sure you get the shape that
you<00:01:41.909> want<00:01:41.939> I'm<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.479> using<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.840> lot<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.290> is

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
you want I'm not using a lot and this is

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.399 
you want I'm not using a lot and this is
so<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.920> move<00:01:44.490> my<00:01:44.549> armature<00:01:45.180> around<00:01:45.479> enough

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
so I can move my armature around enough

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.260 
so I can move my armature around enough
to<00:01:46.710> sculpt<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.700> want<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.970> change<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
to sculpt with if I want to change the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.960 
to sculpt with if I want to change the
size<00:01:48.450> then<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> take<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> piece<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.829> wire<00:01:50.189> at<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
size then I take a piece of wire at the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.359 
size then I take a piece of wire at the
same<00:01:51.149> 1/8<00:01:51.479> inch<00:01:51.720> size<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.829> do<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> loop<00:01:53.220> at

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
same 1/8 inch size and I do a loop at

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.819 
same 1/8 inch size and I do a loop at
the<00:01:53.399> bottom<00:01:53.579> half<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.409> now<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.619> going

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the bottom half of it now this is going

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
the bottom half of it now this is going
to<00:01:55.890> make<00:01:56.070> sure<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.520> your<00:01:57.119> head<00:01:57.390> stays

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
to make sure that your your head stays

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.789 
to make sure that your your head stays
in<00:01:57.960> place<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:59.299> doesn't<00:02:00.299> move<00:02:00.689> around<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.320> then

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
in place and doesn't move around I then

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.830 
in place and doesn't move around I then
in<00:02:01.890> place<00:02:02.070> poxy<00:02:02.820> if<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.090> an<00:02:03.149> epoxy<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.659> that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
in place poxy if I have an epoxy to that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.600 
in place poxy if I have an epoxy to that
and<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:04.649> line<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.829> up<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.189> picture<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and then line it up to the picture to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.430 
and then line it up to the picture to
see<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:05.909> all<00:02:05.969> fits

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
see if it all fits

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.779 
see if it all fits
then<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:08.560> want<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.739> make<00:02:08.860> loops<00:02:09.160> for<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.489> feet

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
then you want to make loops for the feet

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.550 
then you want to make loops for the feet
tie<00:02:10.179> downs<00:02:10.450> place<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.200> bolt<00:02:11.380> through<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
tie downs place the bolt through the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.300 
tie downs place the bolt through the
hole<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.890> make<00:02:11.950> sure<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.459> actually<00:02:12.550> fits

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.110 

next<00:02:18.310> they<00:02:18.400> make<00:02:18.520> sure<00:02:18.640> that<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.880> feet<00:02:19.090> are

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
next they make sure that the feet are

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.850 
next they make sure that the feet are
even<00:02:19.510> with<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.780> hips<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.440> rest<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.800> the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
even with the hips and the rest of the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.640 
even with the hips and the rest of the
body<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.280> it's<00:02:21.400> not<00:02:21.580> crooked<00:02:22.319> then<00:02:23.319> I<00:02:23.349> apply

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
body so it's not crooked then I apply

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.680 
body so it's not crooked then I apply
super<00:02:24.010> glue<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.459> top<00:02:24.489> half<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.269> feet

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
super glue to the top half of the feet

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.670 
super glue to the top half of the feet

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
then place a nut on top of that I let it

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.630 
then place a nut on top of that I let it
dry<00:02:29.709> do<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.519> both<00:02:30.670> feet<00:02:35.400> next<00:02:36.400> I'm<00:02:36.550> going

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
dry do this to both feet next I'm going

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.400 
dry do this to both feet next I'm going
to<00:02:36.700> take<00:02:36.849> some<00:02:37.000> epoxy<00:02:37.300> that<00:02:37.690> same<00:02:37.989> putty<00:02:38.230> that

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
to take some epoxy that same putty that

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.320 
to take some epoxy that same putty that
we<00:02:38.500> were<00:02:38.590> using<00:02:38.739> before<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.340> wrap<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.239> around

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
we were using before and wrap it around

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.539 
we were using before and wrap it around
the<00:02:41.049> outside<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.650> bolt<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.100> have<00:02:42.400> it

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
little bit at the top of the bolt making

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:46.880 
little bit at the top of the bolt making
sure<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:45.970> doesn't<00:02:46.120> go<00:02:46.299> into<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.540> holes

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
sure that it doesn't go into the holes

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.840 
sure that it doesn't go into the holes
you<00:02:47.890> want<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.160> make<00:02:48.250> sure<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.700> have

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
you want to make sure that you have

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.009 
you want to make sure that you have
enough<00:02:49.060> clearance<00:02:49.330> so<00:02:49.540> your<00:02:49.690> bolt<00:02:49.870> can

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
enough clearance so your bolt can

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.229 
enough clearance so your bolt can
actually<00:02:50.290> fit<00:02:50.530> into<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.860> nuts<00:02:51.580> for<00:02:51.880> tie<00:02:52.060> down

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
actually fit into the nuts for tie down

00:02:52.239 --> 00:03:02.880 
actually fit into the nuts for tie down
the<00:03:00.690> next<00:03:01.690> step<00:03:01.870> is<00:03:02.019> taking<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.380> dremel<00:03:02.739> or<00:03:02.799> a

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
the next step is taking a dremel or a

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.220 
the next step is taking a dremel or a
saw<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.519> cutting<00:03:04.030> some<00:03:04.239> piping<00:03:05.019> that<00:03:05.110> will

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
saw and cutting some piping that will

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.630 
saw and cutting some piping that will
actually<00:03:05.319> fit<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.890> same<00:03:06.069> size<00:03:06.099> of<00:03:06.580> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
actually fit the same size of the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.610 
actually fit the same size of the
armature<00:03:07.000> wire<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.269> you're<00:03:07.420> using<00:03:07.630> here<00:03:08.530> I'm

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
armature wire that you're using here I'm

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.310 
armature wire that you're using here I'm
cutting<00:03:08.890> two<00:03:09.010> pieces<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:10.540> will<00:03:10.750> be<00:03:10.840> used<00:03:11.049> for

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
cutting two pieces this will be used for

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.920 
cutting two pieces this will be used for
attaching<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.280> hands<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.000> actual<00:03:13.209> arms

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.479 

I'm<00:03:19.930> also<00:03:20.109> grinding<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.620> ends<00:03:20.890> make<00:03:21.310> sure

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
I'm also grinding the ends make sure

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.059 
I'm also grinding the ends make sure
that<00:03:21.609> they're<00:03:21.790> smooth<00:03:22.590> then<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.620> place<00:03:23.890> them

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
that they're smooth then I place them

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:33.670 
that they're smooth then I place them
onto<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.549> armature<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:27.130> both<00:03:27.340> sides

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.390 

we<00:03:34.680> want<00:03:34.830> to<00:03:34.890> make<00:03:34.980> sure<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.190> this<00:03:35.340> actually

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
we want to make sure that this actually

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.340 
we want to make sure that this actually
matches<00:03:36.090> up<00:03:36.240> with<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.510> size<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.960> the<00:03:37.050> puppet

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
matches up with the size of the puppet

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.590 
matches up with the size of the puppet
that<00:03:37.440> you're<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.710> be<00:03:37.770> making<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:39.420> then

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
that you're going to be making and then

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.940 
that you're going to be making and then
I<00:03:39.630> take<00:03:39.900> some<00:03:39.930> really<00:03:40.440> thin<00:03:40.920> steel<00:03:41.760> wire<00:03:42.950> you

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
I take some really thin steel wire you

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
I take some really thin steel wire you
can<00:03:44.010> get<00:03:44.130> this<00:03:44.190> at<00:03:44.340> a<00:03:44.370> hobby<00:03:44.610> store

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
can get this at a hobby store

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.920 
can get this at a hobby store
I<00:03:46.310> cut<00:03:47.310> out<00:03:47.340> about<00:03:47.580> eight<00:03:47.880> pieces<00:03:48.210> these<00:03:48.810> are

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
I cut out about eight pieces these are

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.530 
I cut out about eight pieces these are
each<00:03:49.080> are<00:03:49.290> going<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.470> be<00:03:49.560> individual<00:03:50.070> fingers

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
each are going to be individual fingers

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.530 
each are going to be individual fingers
the<00:03:51.540> length<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:51.960> them<00:03:52.110> is<00:03:52.590> up<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:56.540> but

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
the length of them is up to you but

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.760 
the length of them is up to you but
remember<00:03:57.690> you're<00:03:58.110> going<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.290> cut<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.530> size

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
remember you're going to cut that size

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.460 
remember you're going to cut that size
in<00:03:58.920> half<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.370> then<00:03:59.670> make<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.820> loop<00:04:00.320> pull<00:04:01.320> that

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
in half I then make a loop pull that

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.380 
in half I then make a loop pull that
loop<00:04:01.680> really<00:04:01.980> tight<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.610> make<00:04:02.700> even<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.090> smaller

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
loop really tight to make even a smaller

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.100 
loop really tight to make even a smaller
loop<00:04:03.630> as<00:04:04.080> you<00:04:04.170> can<00:04:04.260> see<00:04:04.410> in<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.590> picture<00:04:06.020> and<00:04:07.020> I

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
loop as you can see in the picture and I

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.190 
loop as you can see in the picture and I
want<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.320> make<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.470> really<00:04:07.830> tiny<00:04:08.250> loop<00:04:08.520> there

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
want to make a really tiny loop there

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.050 
want to make a really tiny loop there
then<00:04:10.200> I'm<00:04:10.260> going<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.410> take<00:04:10.500> my<00:04:10.650> pliers<00:04:11.060> grab

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
then I'm going to take my pliers grab

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.000 
then I'm going to take my pliers grab
the<00:04:12.210> end<00:04:12.330> of<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.690> spin<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.380> two<00:04:13.560> ends

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
the end of it and spin the two ends

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.090 
the end of it and spin the two ends
around<00:04:15.000> each<00:04:15.360> other<00:04:15.739> this<00:04:16.739> will<00:04:16.920> guarantee

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
around each other this will guarantee

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.660 
around each other this will guarantee
that<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.670> know<00:04:18.300> you<00:04:18.390> have<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.660> nice<00:04:18.930> clean

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
that you know you have a nice clean

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.930 
that you know you have a nice clean
finger<00:04:20.670> to<00:04:21.360> actually<00:04:21.600> apply<00:04:21.720> clay<00:04:22.050> to<00:04:22.820> now<00:04:23.820> you

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
finger to actually apply clay to now you

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.030 
finger to actually apply clay to now you
take<00:04:24.090> four<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.420> those<00:04:24.720> you<00:04:25.380> should<00:04:25.800> have<00:04:26.010> a

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
take four of those you should have a

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.080 
take four of those you should have a
total<00:04:26.160> of<00:04:26.280> eight<00:04:26.460> but<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:26.640> take<00:04:26.850> four<00:04:27.060> of

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
total of eight but you take four of

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.940 
total of eight but you take four of
those<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.960> measure<00:04:28.140> out<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.350> size<00:04:28.620> of<00:04:28.890> the

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
those you measure out the size of the

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.850 
those you measure out the size of the
fingers<00:04:29.280> that<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.610> actually<00:04:29.820> want<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.000> use

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
fingers that you actually want to use

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.140 
fingers that you actually want to use
and<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:32.190> can<00:04:32.220> do<00:04:32.430> them<00:04:32.580> a<00:04:32.610> little<00:04:32.700> bit<00:04:32.910> longer

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
and you can do them a little bit longer

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.250 
and you can do them a little bit longer
because<00:04:33.270> you<00:04:33.420> always<00:04:33.570> clip<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.900> ends<00:04:34.140> off

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
because you always clip the ends off

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.870 
because you always clip the ends off
just<00:04:34.830> in<00:04:34.920> case<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.280> decide<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.670> make<00:04:35.760> the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
just in case you decide to make the

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.170 
just in case you decide to make the
fingers<00:04:36.120> smaller<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.630> then<00:04:37.470> I<00:04:37.500> wrap<00:04:38.180> the

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
fingers smaller and then I wrap the

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.270 
fingers smaller and then I wrap the
wires<00:04:39.420> around<00:04:39.660> each<00:04:39.930> other<00:04:40.110> now<00:04:40.890> first<00:04:41.100> I<00:04:41.220> do

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
wires around each other now first I do

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.550 
wires around each other now first I do
two<00:04:41.490> strands<00:04:42.030> two<00:04:42.330> strands<00:04:42.630> then<00:04:42.930> all<00:04:43.170> four

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
two strands two strands then all four

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.960 
two strands two strands then all four
and<00:04:43.770> then<00:04:43.860> two<00:04:44.010> strands<00:04:44.280> two<00:04:44.520> strands<00:04:44.790> all

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
and then two strands two strands all

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.490 
and then two strands two strands all
four<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.480> keep<00:04:45.630> doing<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:45.960> process<00:04:46.170> over

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
four and keep doing this process over

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.320 
four and keep doing this process over
and<00:04:46.590> over<00:04:46.740> again<00:04:46.830> till<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.280> get<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.580> long<00:04:47.940> length

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
and over again till I get a long length

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.840 
and over again till I get a long length
of<00:04:48.540> a<00:04:49.230> hand<00:04:49.830> with<00:04:50.190> all<00:04:50.280> these<00:04:50.430> wires<00:04:50.640> made

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
of a hand with all these wires made

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.350 
of a hand with all these wires made
together

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
together

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.240 
together
I<00:04:51.390> do<00:04:51.930> this<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.290> other<00:04:52.320> side<00:04:52.680> as<00:04:52.860> well<00:04:53.010> the

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
I do this to the other side as well the

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:03.350 
I do this to the other side as well the
other<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.730> other<00:04:53.820> group<00:04:54.030> of<00:04:54.210> four

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.730 

then<00:05:04.360> I<00:05:04.450> clip<00:05:04.720> off<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.080> little<00:05:05.230> fringe<00:05:05.440> at<00:05:05.650> the

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
then I clip off the little fringe at the

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.200 
then I clip off the little fringe at the
end<00:05:08.310> don't<00:05:09.310> clip<00:05:09.550> too<00:05:09.700> much<00:05:09.850> you<00:05:09.940> want<00:05:10.060> to<00:05:10.120> make

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
end don't clip too much you want to make

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.170 
end don't clip too much you want to make
sure<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.420> you<00:05:10.510> can<00:05:10.660> size<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.110> up<00:05:11.850> then<00:05:12.850> I<00:05:12.940> take

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
sure that you can size it up then I take

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.540 
sure that you can size it up then I take
the<00:05:13.390> hands<00:05:13.870> I<00:05:14.080> shove<00:05:14.920> them<00:05:15.070> into<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.310> end<00:05:15.460> of

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
the hands I shove them into the end of

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.710 
the hands I shove them into the end of
the<00:05:15.610> tube<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.000> make<00:05:16.030> sure<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:16.330> they<00:05:16.450> actually

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
the tube to make sure that they actually

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.660 
the tube to make sure that they actually
fit<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.140> actual<00:05:17.290> size<00:05:17.620> I<00:05:17.830> want<00:05:17.980> to<00:05:18.010> do<00:05:18.160> and

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
fit the actual size I want to do and

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.580 
fit the actual size I want to do and
then<00:05:18.790> I<00:05:18.820> tap<00:05:18.940> them<00:05:19.390> with<00:05:19.510> a<00:05:19.540> nail<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.110> a<00:05:20.380> mallet

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
then I tap them with a nail and a mallet

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.840 
then I tap them with a nail and a mallet
or<00:05:20.800> a<00:05:20.890> hammer<00:05:21.210> at<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.900> joining<00:05:23.260> point<00:05:23.470> between

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
or a hammer at the joining point between

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:30.090 
or a hammer at the joining point between
the<00:05:25.230> copper<00:05:26.230> tubing<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:27.580> armature<00:05:29.100> now

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
the copper tubing and the armature now

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.710 
the copper tubing and the armature now
don't<00:05:30.310> do<00:05:30.370> it<00:05:30.460> on<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.640> exact<00:05:31.030> spot<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.570> little

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
don't do it on the exact spot a little

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.600 
don't do it on the exact spot a little
bit<00:05:31.900> inward<00:05:32.290> and<00:05:32.500> this<00:05:32.980> will<00:05:33.130> actually<00:05:33.250> make

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
bit inward and this will actually make

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.360 
bit inward and this will actually make
it<00:05:33.820> a<00:05:34.030> nice<00:05:34.330> solid<00:05:34.930> connection<00:05:35.560> to<00:05:36.220> the

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
it a nice solid connection to the

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.100 
it a nice solid connection to the
armature<00:05:36.670> and<00:05:37.390> this<00:05:37.480> will<00:05:37.630> also<00:05:37.840> save<00:05:38.080> you

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
armature and this will also save you

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.690 
armature and this will also save you
from<00:05:38.320> using<00:05:38.440> any<00:05:38.650> glues<00:05:38.950> or<00:05:38.980> putties<00:05:39.430> in<00:05:39.610> this

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
from using any glues or putties in this

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.990 
from using any glues or putties in this
area

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
area

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.280 
area
another<00:05:43.000> good<00:05:43.210> advantage<00:05:43.630> of<00:05:43.720> doing<00:05:43.840> this<00:05:43.990> is

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
another good advantage of doing this is

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.870 
another good advantage of doing this is
if<00:05:44.470> you<00:05:44.560> ever<00:05:44.680> need<00:05:44.890> to<00:05:44.920> pull<00:05:45.190> it<00:05:45.310> off<00:05:45.460> you

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
if you ever need to pull it off you

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.420 
if you ever need to pull it off you
could<00:05:46.210> and<00:05:46.510> then<00:05:46.720> re<00:05:46.990> cut<00:05:47.500> your<00:05:47.650> wire<00:05:47.860> to<00:05:48.310> make

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
could and then re cut your wire to make

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.120 
could and then re cut your wire to make
your<00:05:48.640> arms<00:05:49.000> smaller<00:05:49.620> then<00:05:50.620> I<00:05:50.710> place<00:05:50.920> some

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
your arms smaller then I place some

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.860 
your arms smaller then I place some
five-minute<00:05:51.970> epoxy<00:05:52.030> putty<00:05:53.100> inside<00:05:54.100> each

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
five-minute epoxy putty inside each

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.190 
five-minute epoxy putty inside each
little<00:05:55.870> arm<00:05:56.190> tubing<00:05:57.450> and<00:05:58.450> then<00:05:58.720> I<00:05:58.840> place<00:05:59.050> my

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
little arm tubing and then I place my

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.690 
little arm tubing and then I place my
little<00:05:59.320> hands<00:05:59.680> in<00:05:59.890> there<00:06:05.250> once<00:06:06.250> this<00:06:06.340> is<00:06:06.490> dry

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:06.700 
little hands in there once this is dry

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.310 
little hands in there once this is dry
you<00:06:06.760> can<00:06:06.940> also<00:06:07.270> add<00:06:07.630> a<00:06:07.660> little<00:06:08.050> bit<00:06:08.230> of

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
you can also add a little bit of

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.650 
you can also add a little bit of
superglue<00:06:08.620> on<00:06:08.890> the<00:06:08.980> ends<00:06:09.340> and<00:06:09.490> that<00:06:10.300> will<00:06:10.450> help

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
superglue on the ends and that will help

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.090 
superglue on the ends and that will help
to<00:06:10.840> keep<00:06:11.500> it<00:06:11.620> in<00:06:11.740> place<00:06:13.770> we've<00:06:14.770> done<00:06:14.950> this

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
to keep it in place we've done this

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.560 
to keep it in place we've done this
right<00:06:15.340> this<00:06:15.580> should<00:06:15.700> make<00:06:15.850> a<00:06:15.880> pretty<00:06:16.240> strong

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
right this should make a pretty strong

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.650 
right this should make a pretty strong
bond<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.140> you<00:06:17.770> can<00:06:17.890> do<00:06:17.980> the<00:06:18.100> same<00:06:18.280> method<00:06:18.610> for

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
bond and you can do the same method for

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.010 
bond and you can do the same method for
making<00:06:19.660> puppets<00:06:20.080> as<00:06:20.200> well<00:06:21.420> your<00:06:22.420> next<00:06:22.570> step<00:06:22.900> is

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
making puppets as well your next step is

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.410 
making puppets as well your next step is
you're<00:06:23.170> going<00:06:23.200> to<00:06:23.320> take<00:06:23.590> a<00:06:23.770> piece<00:06:24.160> of<00:06:24.190> wood<00:06:24.610> and

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:25.420 
you're going to take a piece of wood and

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.060 
you're going to take a piece of wood and
you're<00:06:25.570> going<00:06:25.690> to<00:06:25.750> attach<00:06:26.020> your<00:06:26.290> armature<00:06:26.890> to

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
you're going to attach your armature to

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.040 
you're going to attach your armature to
it<00:06:27.220> through<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.700> tie<00:06:27.850> downs<00:06:28.120> you<00:06:28.510> drill<00:06:28.900> two

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
it through the tie downs you drill two

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.860 
it through the tie downs you drill two
holes<00:06:29.080> and<00:06:29.620> just<00:06:29.800> stand<00:06:30.580> them<00:06:30.700> up<00:06:30.820> then<00:06:31.780> you

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
holes and just stand them up then you

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.110 
holes and just stand them up then you
can<00:06:32.020> take<00:06:32.140> some<00:06:32.200> aluminum<00:06:32.740> foil<00:06:32.980> and<00:06:33.280> fold

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
can take some aluminum foil and fold
