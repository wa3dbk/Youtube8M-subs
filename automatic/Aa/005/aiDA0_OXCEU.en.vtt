00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.190 
now I already have a roller that's got
primer<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.770> from<00:00:35.190> previous<00:00:35.730> project<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.140> I

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
primer on it from previous project and I

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200 
primer on it from previous project and I
put<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.620> baggie<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:38.969> does

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
put it in a baggie and what that does

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.010 
put it in a baggie and what that does
keeps<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.870> wet<00:00:40.910> so<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.450> use<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> again<00:00:42.989> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
keeps it wet so you can use it again and

smaller version of the rollers we've
been<00:00:51.239> using<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.840> thus<00:00:52.110> far<00:00:52.610> they<00:00:53.610> call<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> hot

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
been using so thus far they call the hot

dog<00:00:54.300> rollers<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.230> come<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.530> really

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
dog rollers and they come in really

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.479

handy<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.309> comes<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.840> things<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:57.960> prime

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
handy when it comes to things like prime

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.830 
handy when it comes to things like prime
where<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.579> don't<00:00:59.820> necessarily<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.600> big

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
where you don't necessarily have a big

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:22.500 
where you don't necessarily have a big
area<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.920> cover

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.620 

okay<00:01:23.510> I'm<00:01:23.810> going<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.020> take<00:01:24.140> my<00:01:24.290> drop<00:01:24.530> cloth

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:49.630 

dip<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.440> roller<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:48.190> then<00:01:49.190> I'm<00:01:49.370> just<00:01:49.490> going

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
dip the roller and then I'm just going

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.020 
dip the roller and then I'm just going
to<00:01:49.700> hit<00:01:49.940> these<00:01:50.090> spots<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.750> we<00:01:52.030> patched

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
to hit these spots that we patched

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.620 
to hit these spots that we patched
earlier

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.410 

if<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.909> areas<00:02:02.909> where<00:02:03.150> there<00:02:03.270> might<00:02:03.360> be

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
if you see areas where there might be

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.469 
if you see areas where there might be
some<00:02:04.580> smudges<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:05.610> stuff<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.150> might<00:02:06.299> want<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
some smudges and stuff you might want to

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:26.420 
some smudges and stuff you might want to
hit<00:02:06.570> those<00:02:06.750> too

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.280 

okay<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.820> most<00:02:27.970> prep<00:02:28.360> primers<00:02:28.900> only<00:02:29.080> take

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
okay so most prep primers only take

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.840 
okay so most prep primers only take
about<00:02:29.410> an<00:02:29.620> hour<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:30.070> dry<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.670> we'll<00:02:33.670> let<00:02:33.790> that

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
about an hour to dry so we'll let that

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.710 
about an hour to dry so we'll let that
dry<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.330> then<00:02:34.510> we'll<00:02:34.750> get<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.350> paint
