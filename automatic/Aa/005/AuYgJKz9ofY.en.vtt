00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.170
 moon in sagittarius she has an energy 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.630
 very positive search for 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.180
 self-knowledge then the person with the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.660
 moon in sagittarius she will always be 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.260
 using her emotions to grow 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.810
 inside the fire streets right air 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.759
 lion I commented this moon is the street with 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.340
 quality and unchanging that joining a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.440
 changeable sign 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.649
 there are three qualities there nÃ© no cardinal 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.210
 fixed and changeable within the surgery where 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.840
 I'll make a video explaining that they are 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.030
 these qualities and in the case to that moon 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.800
 positioned getting mutable from fire 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.660
 It makes them were very fast today 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.329
 so he does not get too caught up in things 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.980
 and at the same time Sagittarius has a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.730
 quality that we call in alchemy 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.430
 of his mercurial fire, then it is the fire that 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.769
 want to analyze more than you want to understand 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.020
 this taste for philosophy by religion 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.880
 people with the ims shake you many 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.119
 times have a very great attraction for the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.189
 esoterism urology ie people 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.890
 who have a taste for understanding each other 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.159
 are not content with appearances in the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.930
 inside adora gives advice and I adore 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.570
 to make a person who sought you 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.549
 and that as an issue comes out more 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.009
 happy after talking to her or 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.430
 be the person with the unis to shake it is 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.939
 always looking for some improvement in 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.500
 internal sense and also in the brain or 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.930
 whether it is helping people by 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.570
 people have a better vibration is 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.220
 a very positive moon she has to take a 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.710
 little care sometimes with the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.229
 volubility so that people with 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.939
 the moon in Sagittarius I do not say that they are 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.100
 but they are people who want to be 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.170
 very free do not like to have control 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.659
 no kind of emotional control 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.060
 then in affective relationships they can 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.130
 if those people who give that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.800
 impression that we talk about soap 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.750
 huh 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.120
 You catch a person's slide for each one. 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.820
 a lot of security sometimes because it is 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.010
 a person who exhales this freedom are 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.540
 great speakers and can be great 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.300
 teachers also have a 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.310
 too great to communicate by passing 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.030
 knowledge mainly 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.030
 deeper knowledge
