00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
you're going to take the pattern to the

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.670 
you're going to take the pattern to the
front<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.420> I'm<00:02:28.540> just<00:02:28.750> going<00:02:28.959> to<00:02:29.080> take<00:02:29.470> the

front so I'm just going to take the
pattern<00:02:30.129> all<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.430> way<00:02:30.580> around<00:02:31.030> so<00:02:31.530> that<00:02:32.530> my

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
pattern all the way around so that my

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.890 
pattern all the way around so that my
pattern<00:02:33.400> pretty<00:02:33.640> much<00:02:33.849> stays<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.450> place<00:02:34.720> and

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
pattern pretty much stays in place and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.970 
pattern pretty much stays in place and
you<00:02:34.959> just<00:02:35.080> want<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.349> do<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.620> all<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.860> way

the<00:02:59.709> pattern<00:03:00.069> it's<00:03:01.060> pretty<00:03:01.360> as<00:03:01.450> simple<00:03:01.840> as

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
the pattern it's pretty as simple as

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:17.699 
the pattern it's pretty as simple as
that<00:03:15.209> okay<00:03:16.209> now<00:03:16.480> we've<00:03:16.660> got<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.959> pattern<00:03:17.230> on

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
that okay now we've got the pattern on

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.199 
that okay now we've got the pattern on
the<00:03:17.769> back<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.489> instructions<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
the back of the instructions to the

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.120 
the back of the instructions to the
pattern<00:03:19.569> pin<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.109> staple<00:03:20.560> stapled<00:03:21.040> or

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
pattern pin to the staple stapled or
