let's<00:02:20.910> go<00:02:21.030> actually<00:02:21.360> take<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> look<00:02:22.020> at<00:02:22.200> carbon

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
let's go actually take a look at carbon

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.740 
let's go actually take a look at carbon
fibers<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.520> where<00:02:23.760> sort<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.360> like<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
fibers this is where sort of like it

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.020 
fibers this is where sort of like it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
other stuff recent RAM bar some of the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.590 
other stuff recent RAM bar some of the
stuff<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:42.450> do<00:02:42.750> recommend<00:02:43.319> turning<00:02:44.130> this<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.730> and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.460 

let's<00:02:48.600> do<00:02:48.780> application<00:02:50.600> also<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.660> can<00:02:52.200> change

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
let's do application also you can change

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.390 
let's do application also you can change
the<00:02:52.680> LCD<00:02:53.100> if<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.340> want<00:02:54.560> default<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.709> 320

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the LCD if you want default is 320

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.699 
the LCD if you want default is 320
you'll<00:02:56.820> make<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> larger<00:02:58.080> resolution<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
you'll make like a larger resolution you

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.850 
you'll make like a larger resolution you
can<00:02:58.860> put<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.489> like<00:02:59.610> 340<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.330> 360<00:03:01.110> almost

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
can put it to like 340 to 360 almost

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.400 
can put it to like 340 to 360 almost
tablet<00:03:02.310> like<00:03:02.489> which<00:03:03.150> works<00:03:03.390> really<00:03:03.720> good<00:03:04.200> on

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
tablet like which works really good on

stuff this is like very nearly identical
actually<00:03:12.870> not<00:03:13.050> not<00:03:13.350> identical<00:03:13.920> but<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:14.700> takes

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
actually not not identical but it takes

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.520 
actually not not identical but it takes
some<00:03:15.269> of<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.420> parts<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:15.870> is<00:03:16.019> like<00:03:16.200> stripe

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
some of the parts this is like stripe
