00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
67 at passing we've been using this a

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.510 
67 at passing we've been using this a

lot in our past custom tactics tutorials
and<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.299> my<00:01:09.479> opinion<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.290> perfect

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
and in my opinion this is the perfect

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
and in my opinion this is the perfect
combination<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.640> gives<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
combination and gives you the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.560 
combination and gives you the
opportunity<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.070> very<00:01:14.490> dangerous<00:01:15.360> on

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
opportunity to be very dangerous on

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.770 
opportunity to be very dangerous on
counter-attacks<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:17.100> also<00:01:17.540> provides<00:01:18.540> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
counter-attacks and it also provides a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
counter-attacks and it also provides a
nice<00:01:19.080> balance<00:01:19.680> between<00:01:19.740> short<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> long

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
nice balance between short and long

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.600 
nice balance between short and long
passes<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.500> positioning<00:01:23.040> here<00:01:23.250> will<00:01:23.490> be

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
passes the positioning here will be

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.570 
passes the positioning here will be
organized<00:01:24.090> if<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:25.020> would<00:01:25.229> use<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.710> free<00:01:26.100> form

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
organized if we would use the free form

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
organized if we would use the free form
option<00:01:27.119> then<00:01:27.299> our<00:01:27.450> players<00:01:27.869> would<00:01:28.500> change

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
option then our players would change

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.270 
option then our players would change
positions<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.850> our<00:01:30.210> own<00:01:30.630> half<00:01:31.110> while<00:01:31.560> we<00:01:31.979> build

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
positions in our own half while we build

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.819 
positions in our own half while we build
up<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.420> do<00:01:33.720> not<00:01:33.930> want<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> happen

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
up and we do not want that to happen

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.460 
up and we do not want that to happen
what<00:01:35.610> will<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:36.030> very<00:01:36.360> different<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:37.259> this

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
what will be very different for this

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
what will be very different for this
custom<00:01:37.890> tactic<00:01:38.280> will<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.820> options<00:01:39.420> in

here will be the team we

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130 
here will be the team we
we'll<00:02:14.129> select<00:02:14.610> 70<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.300> this<00:02:15.629> formation

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
we'll select 70 because this formation

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.350 
we'll select 70 because this formation
is<00:02:16.290> already<00:02:16.800> very<00:02:17.040> concentrated<00:02:17.519> in<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
is already very concentrated in the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.680 
is already very concentrated in the
center<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.500> field<00:02:19.890> maybe<00:02:20.610> too<00:02:20.879> much<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.450> we

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
center of the field maybe too much so we

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.920 
center of the field maybe too much so we
need<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.290> disperse<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.160> bit<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.550> team<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:24.330> order

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930

always covered because using of the trap
is<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.629> too<00:02:33.870> risky<00:02:34.110> moving<00:02:35.010> now<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.220> player

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730
