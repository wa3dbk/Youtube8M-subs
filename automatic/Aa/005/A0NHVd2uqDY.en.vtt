00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.620
 can 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.200
 hello friends with you again I am Dmitry 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.510
 Yegorov 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.820
 again we are in the warehouses of the store 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.000
 hand air at street star there 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.480
 one saint petersburg and today another 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.360
 overview 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.900
 yes yes again about modern basketball 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.080
 shoe 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.390
 I hope you are not bored with friends 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.710
 Before you begin the review I want to make 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.770
 small not afraid of the word 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.789
 official statement I'm not very good 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.460
 basketball player 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.589
 rather even so i'm a bad basketball player 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.510
 I like to sometimes go out with a ball to show 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.390
 how cool i can mine it on the ground 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.370
 how beautiful I can throw so no one 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.909
 I did not see that I missed though sometimes 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.920
 I can get into the general why I say this 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.319
 those model and which I talk about them 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.059
 I say let's say this with theoretical 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:58.639
 points of view trying to tell them 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.649
 history of technology but from me you are not 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:02.659
 hear what they are on the map 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.430
 for this you can read the specific 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.250
 literature see some 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.500
 special review and others but we are talking 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.710
 about sneakers like a phenomenon about sneakers 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:18.020
 how about the subject of remote sports fashion footwear 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.480
 how about everything and today's our story about 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.310
 such a wonderful basketball model 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.510
 like nike hyperfuse 2013 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.850
 remember not in the recent review 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.060
 all we talked about wonderful 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.100
 nike hyperdunk basketball sneakers 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.320
 2013 who came up with a designer like 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.610
 peter fuck and very often there 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.520
 such a comparison that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.380
 hyperfuse for hyperdunk and the same 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.170
 that how much type of pan for jordan up 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.030
 remember that Jordan is the most famous 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.870
 probably titled basketball player 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.520
 the lead singer of the chicago bulls maybe he wouldn't 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.530
 scored so many points maybe he doesn't 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.290
 became so many times a champion if next 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.690
 it was not him 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.910
 loyal friend and teammate 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.190
 scotty peep she's the same in sneakers 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.200
 Yes, we do not recommend to wear on one note 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.780
 hyperdunk and on another hyper fusion 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.360
 especially on the court though if you are really 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.640
 such an extravagant person well why 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.520
 would not but it would be funny unfashionable 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.000
 terribly stupid however back sneakers 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.400
 For the first time hyper fusions appeared in 2010. 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.650
 and they were really popular and 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.480
 interesting models very often when people 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.430
 asked what sneakers I choose 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.620
 that they are very light very 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.170
 well held ankle but people immediately 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.000
 answer yes take the hyper fyuzy the same 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.760
 the most remained in the hyper fi sample bond 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.130
 2013 very very light sneakers 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.459
 with very good galen support 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.010
 support and protection of the ankle but what 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.110
 I really liked that basketball 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.540
 sneakers starts massively 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.720
 come back design even design 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.890
 without any such functional 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.650
 functional content even 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.160
 sometimes it causes big question marks 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.989
 but he comes back and it is good in this 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.440
 Iâ€™m not afraid for design 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.440
 the words 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.680
 delicacy answer here is such a comb 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.500
 sneaker rear interesting solution 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.750
 which doesn't really affect technology 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.700
 makes you remember probably 23 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.489
 Jordan where also appeared such 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.739
 a small shark crest in the back but there was 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.239
 the crest of the shark here is unclear cock 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.459
 punk hoi comb 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.140
 or something else in this regard well yes 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.480
 it is clear that especially in this 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.690
 the colors black and pink are remembered 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.470
 and legendary sneakers and from izi 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.750
 especially 2 2 2 part where were also behind 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.510
 incomprehensible such notches here though 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.880
 not as big as they make these these 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.500
 spurs on here such basketballs 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.840
 sneakers show what you like 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.360
 gallic fighting cock ready not 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.280
 only spread everything with the ball in your hands but 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.799
 and move the spurs 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.769
 or what you frisky combo who is ready 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:00.150
 beat the horse and download and ride 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:03.630
 distance to the basket and your opponent 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.889
 possible options maybe it's just 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.720
 the finds of the designer who said a 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.400
 why not do just such a thing as 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.379
 maybe when he drew a straight 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.110
 line he accidentally hiccupped and turned out 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.540
 such a cardiogram to honest answers 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.750
 No, but I say it again very well 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.759
 that the design comes back in sneakers 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.880
 understandably what do basketballs do 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:26.889
 sneakers and don't make them color 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.440
 where the colors are black red and 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.050
 white would be a crime like 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.449
 the colors of the chicago bulls team they just 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.310
 must be in almost every 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.560
 colors basketball sneakers 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.570
 like these wonderful hyper here 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.000
 fyuzy in such a wonderful color 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.389
 understand that if you say that 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.370
 alien design in the delights you can 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:50.560
 turn to pure game models 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.720
 which is also made based 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.840
 hai perfil plant like for example this 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.460
 Hyper quick us too very easy very 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.710
 comfortable model with very good 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.370
 ankle support either so 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.660
 more advanced models are protected from behind 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.669
 heels is a hyper destructor in general 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.580
 history make more budget more 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.320
 simple options based on more 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.630
 top models she's understandably far from 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.539
 new and by the way in future reviews we still 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.479
 back to this topic similar more 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.220
 expensive simpler design and for now 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.500
 thank you so much for your attention 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.150
 play basketball play football 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.250
 play even water polo 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.500
 but better not in sneakers with you 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.690
 Dmitry Egorov see you again and again 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.320
 ask us your questions total 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.320
 good bye
