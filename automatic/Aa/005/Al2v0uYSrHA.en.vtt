that's<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.050> golden<00:02:23.410> question<00:02:23.860> everybody

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
that's the golden question everybody

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.589 
that's the golden question everybody

who's<00:02:25.870> going<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.140> win<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.560> think<00:02:27.340> it's<00:02:27.459> going<00:02:27.580> to

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
who's going to win I think it's going to

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.509 
who's going to win I think it's going to
come<00:02:27.879> down<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.269> Colombia<00:02:28.870> vs<00:02:29.709> germany<00:02:29.980> for<00:02:30.489> a

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
come down to Colombia vs germany for a

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.580 
come down to Colombia vs germany for a
chance<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.910> go<00:02:31.090> into<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.569> final<00:02:31.989> I<00:02:32.140> think

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
chance to go into the final I think

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.460 
chance to go into the final I think
ultimately<00:02:33.540> Germany<00:02:34.540> will<00:02:34.750> probably<00:02:35.080> take<00:02:35.260> it

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
ultimately Germany will probably take it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.660 
ultimately Germany will probably take it
but<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.650> think<00:02:35.709> colombia<00:02:36.250> is<00:02:36.310> going<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.519> have<00:02:36.640> a

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
but I think colombia is going to have a

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.550 
but I think colombia is going to have a
great<00:02:36.910> showing<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:37.629> on<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.989> other<00:02:38.140> side<00:02:38.530> of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
great showing and on the other side of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.680 
great showing and on the other side of
the<00:02:38.769> brackets<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.519> think<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.239> Netherlands

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
the brackets I think the Netherlands

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.150 
the brackets I think the Netherlands
have<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.900> really<00:02:41.230> good<00:02:41.349> chance<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
have a really good chance the

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.789 
have a really good chance the
netherlands<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:42.989> argentina<00:02:43.989> will<00:02:44.290> probably

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
netherlands and argentina will probably

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.890 
netherlands and argentina will probably
play<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.880> winner<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.329> match<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.870> go

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
play and the winner of that match to go

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.900 
play and the winner of that match to go
to<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.170> finals<00:02:47.590> my<00:02:47.920> final<00:02:48.220> prediction

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
to the finals my final prediction

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.539 
to the finals my final prediction
germany<00:02:49.720> vs<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.290> netherlands<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.069> I<00:02:51.310> think

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
germany vs the netherlands and I think

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.220 
germany vs the netherlands and I think
Germany<00:02:51.910> will<00:02:52.090> take<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.480> they're<00:02:52.930> just<00:02:52.959> a

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
Germany will take it they're just a

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.039 
Germany will take it they're just a
great<00:02:53.260> great<00:02:54.069> team<00:02:54.519> their<00:02:55.030> possession<00:02:55.720> team

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
great great team their possession team

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.170 
great great team their possession team
if<00:02:56.440> two<00:02:56.799> of<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:57.010> best<00:02:57.160> goal<00:02:57.400> scorers<00:02:57.790> in<00:02:57.910> the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
if two of the best goal scorers in the

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.020 
if two of the best goal scorers in the
world<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:59.590> think<00:03:00.430> they're<00:03:00.579> the<00:03:00.670> odds-on
