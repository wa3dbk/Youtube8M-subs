00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
exploring that spawn but uh pretty easy

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.580 
exploring that spawn but uh pretty easy
to<00:02:30.310> do<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.850> freezes<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.080> even<00:02:32.500> without

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
lucky that my hairiest 11 here but if

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.360 
lucky that my hairiest 11 here but if
you're<00:02:41.050> Harry's<00:02:41.319> are<00:02:41.500> going<00:02:41.709> in<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.920> areas<00:02:42.340> of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
you're Harry's are going in the areas of

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.580 
you're Harry's are going in the areas of
life<00:02:42.700> going<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.630> hide<00:02:43.870> mode<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.560> you're<00:02:44.680> also

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
life going to hide mode and you're also

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.620 
life going to hide mode and you're also
the<00:02:47.700> reason<00:02:48.700> why<00:02:48.910> I<00:02:48.940> rushed<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.420> middle

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
the reason why I rushed in the middle

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.490 
the reason why I rushed in the middle
was<00:02:49.750> because<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.019> can<00:02:50.140> get<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.350> people

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
was because you can get the people

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.380 
was because you can get the people
pushing<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:51.069> for<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.430> initial<00:02:51.670> objective<00:02:52.209> rush

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
pushing a for the initial objective rush

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.690 
pushing a for the initial objective rush

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
which is really cool yeah so you going

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.880 
which is really cool yeah so you going
to<00:02:57.760> be<00:02:57.819> really<00:02:58.120> cautious<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:59.290> riskiest<00:02:59.709> by

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
to be really cautious the riskiest by

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.500 
to be really cautious the riskiest by
this<00:03:00.130> whole<00:03:00.280> strategy<00:03:00.549> once<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.060> guess<00:03:01.299> out

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
this whole strategy once you guess out

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.130 
this whole strategy once you guess out
is<00:03:02.049> finding<00:03:03.010> a<00:03:03.040> new<00:03:03.220> bought<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.700> new<00:03:04.120> bomb<00:03:04.330> you

like<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.940> see<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.209> small<00:03:19.420> house<00:03:19.570> in<00:03:19.600> front

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
like you see that small house in front

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.599 
like you see that small house in front
of<00:03:19.959> me<00:03:20.019> they<00:03:20.140> can<00:03:20.260> ask<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.470> spawn<00:03:20.739> where<00:03:21.459> I'm

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
of me they can ask you spawn where I'm

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:22.890 
of me they can ask you spawn where I'm
looking<00:03:21.880> right<00:03:22.000> now<00:03:22.060> which<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.570> one<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.810> the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
looking right now which is one of the

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.259 
looking right now which is one of the
ribs<00:03:23.079> of<00:03:23.170> our<00:03:23.290> keep<00:03:23.440> looking<00:03:23.650> around<00:03:23.709> there

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
ribs of our keep looking around there

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.430 
ribs of our keep looking around there
they<00:03:25.269> can<00:03:25.420> also<00:03:25.540> spawn<00:03:25.780> in<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.049> riverbed

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
they can also spawn in the riverbed

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.080 
they can also spawn in the riverbed
towards<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.920> barn<00:03:27.100> which<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.640> probably<00:03:27.880> where

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
towards the barn which is probably where

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.190 
towards the barn which is probably where
most<00:03:28.150> of<00:03:28.420> them<00:03:28.540> are<00:03:28.630> spoiling<00:03:28.840> right<00:03:29.049> now

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
most of them are spoiling right now

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.420 
most of them are spoiling right now
because<00:03:29.500> that's<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.769> way<00:03:29.829> I'm<00:03:30.010> fishing<00:03:30.220> it

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
because that's the way I'm fishing it

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.640 
because that's the way I'm fishing it
which<00:03:31.120> is<00:03:31.239> probably<00:03:31.480> why<00:03:31.870> they<00:03:32.019> planted<00:03:32.350> be<00:03:32.470> to

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
which is probably why they planted be to

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.520 
which is probably why they planted be to
be<00:03:32.739> on<00:03:32.829> si<00:03:33.540> if<00:03:34.540> my<00:03:34.690> teammate<00:03:35.019> wanted<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.320> shower

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
be on si if my teammate wanted to shower

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.300 
be on si if my teammate wanted to shower
may<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:35.980> be<00:03:36.160> Terry<00:03:36.730> fair<00:03:38.100> but<00:03:39.100> otherwise

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
may that be Terry fair but otherwise

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.710 
may that be Terry fair but otherwise
they<00:03:39.609> can<00:03:39.760> spawn<00:03:39.970> on<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.239> street<00:03:40.480> where<00:03:40.570> I'm

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
they can spawn on the street where I'm

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.330 
they can spawn on the street where I'm
looking<00:03:40.989> right<00:03:41.140> now<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.920> they<00:03:41.980> can<00:03:42.100> spawn

to<00:07:02.130> redo<00:07:02.370> with<00:07:02.490> commentary<00:07:02.970> since<00:07:03.240> I<00:07:03.480> can<00:07:04.290> see

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
to redo with commentary since I can see

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.190 
to redo with commentary since I can see
