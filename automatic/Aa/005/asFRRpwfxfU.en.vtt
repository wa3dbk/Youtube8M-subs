00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.290 
way to the exit
you<00:02:45.750> really<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.710> square<00:02:47.670> off<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> corner

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
you really have to square off the corner

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.520 
you really have to square off the corner
so<00:02:48.510> you're<00:02:48.630> just<00:02:48.720> going<00:02:48.870> point<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.350> point

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
so you're just going point to point

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.170 
so you're just going point to point
you're<00:02:49.740> not<00:02:49.860> trying<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.160> roll<00:02:50.640> speed<00:02:50.880> through

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
you're not trying to roll speed through

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.880 
you're not trying to roll speed through
you<00:02:51.330> just<00:02:51.360> break<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> straight<00:02:52.620> line<00:02:52.800> at

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you just break in a straight line at

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.530 
you just break in a straight line at
that<00:02:53.010> point<00:02:53.040> try<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.700> get<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.850> thing<00:02:54.000> rotated

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
that point try and get the thing rotated

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.420 
that point try and get the thing rotated
and<00:02:54.750> don't<00:02:55.440> pick<00:02:55.650> up<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.920> throttle<00:02:56.100> until

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
and don't pick up the throttle until

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.520 
and don't pick up the throttle until
you're<00:02:57.420> almost<00:02:57.600> straight<00:02:58.080> because<00:02:58.320> if<00:02:58.440> you've

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
you're almost straight because if you've

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.020 
you're almost straight because if you've
got<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> lot<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.950> locking<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.820> put<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
got a lot of locking and you put the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.840 
got a lot of locking and you put the
power<00:03:00.209> and<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.450> seems<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.780> understeer<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:02.010> you

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
power and it seems to understeer but you

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.850 
power and it seems to understeer but you
know<00:03:02.910> each<00:03:03.060> car<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.360> guy's<00:03:03.690> way<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.170> getting

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
know each car is guy's way of getting

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.550 
know each car is guy's way of getting
lap<00:03:05.520> time<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.090> seems<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.420> be<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:07.410> way<00:03:07.530> it

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
lap time and that seems to be the way it

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.770 
lap time and that seems to be the way it
works<00:03:07.830> with<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.400> GTR<00:03:08.700> but<00:03:09.030> just<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.630> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
works with the GTR but just this the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.260 
works with the GTR but just this the
first<00:03:09.930> time<00:03:10.050> ever<00:03:10.170> driven<00:03:10.470> one<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.880> can<00:03:12.060> see

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
first time ever driven one and I can see

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.790 
first time ever driven one and I can see
why<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.630> many<00:03:12.690> friends<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.230> mine<00:03:13.380> they've<00:03:13.590> got

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
why so many friends of mine they've got

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.280 
why so many friends of mine they've got
super<00:03:14.489> cars<00:03:14.730> that's<00:03:15.540> their<00:03:15.750> everyday<00:03:16.050> car

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
super cars that's their everyday car

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.870 
super cars that's their everyday car
because<00:03:16.709> it's<00:03:16.830> so<00:03:16.980> easy<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.280> get<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:17.760> just

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
because it's so easy to get in and just

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.880 
because it's so easy to get in and just
be<00:03:18.000> able<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.270> access<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.870> performance<00:03:19.230> of<00:03:19.709> it

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
be able to access the performance of it

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.710 
be able to access the performance of it
a<00:03:19.980> little<00:03:20.640> bit<00:03:20.760> disconcerting<00:03:21.060> in<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.600> high

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
a little bit disconcerting in the high

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.080 
a little bit disconcerting in the high
speed<00:03:21.780> stuff<00:03:22.280> couldn't<00:03:23.280> work<00:03:23.459> out<00:03:23.640> how<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.850> get

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
speed stuff couldn't work out how to get

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.900 
speed stuff couldn't work out how to get
through<00:03:24.330> them<00:03:24.480> with<00:03:24.600> a<00:03:24.630> lot<00:03:24.989> of<00:03:25.110> understeer

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
through them with a lot of understeer

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.850 
through them with a lot of understeer
pure<00:03:26.910> crummy<00:03:27.209> nose<00:03:27.420> heard<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.780> but<00:03:28.020> it's<00:03:28.770> going

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
pure crummy nose heard it but it's going

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.310 
pure crummy nose heard it but it's going
to<00:03:28.950> take<00:03:29.040> me<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.130> while<00:03:29.250> longer<00:03:29.520> work<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.320> to

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
to take me a while longer work that to

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.650 
to take me a while longer work that to
drive<00:03:31.560> them<00:03:31.739> by<00:03:32.040> or<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.340> track<00:03:32.640> felt<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.540> lot

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
drive them by or the track felt a lot

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.020 
drive them by or the track felt a lot
more<00:03:33.830> natural<00:03:34.830> for<00:03:35.010> me<00:03:35.130> so<00:03:35.459> accessing<00:03:35.880> this

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
more natural for me so accessing this

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.710 
more natural for me so accessing this
performance<00:03:36.739> was<00:03:37.739> what<00:03:37.920> I'm<00:03:38.040> more<00:03:38.190> used<00:03:38.400> to

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
performance was what I'm more used to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.590 
performance was what I'm more used to
the<00:03:39.720> initial<00:03:40.080> thing<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.590> felt<00:03:40.860> was<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:42.150> it

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
the initial thing I felt was that it

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.620 
the initial thing I felt was that it
lacks<00:03:42.900> we<00:03:43.170> are<00:03:43.290> downforce<00:03:43.680> just<00:03:44.360> in<00:03:45.360> all<00:03:45.480> the

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
lacks we are downforce just in all the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.500 
lacks we are downforce just in all the
corners<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.200> rear<00:03:46.410> seems<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.100> get<00:03:47.280> run

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
corners the rear seems to get run

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.990 
corners the rear seems to get run
earlier<00:03:48.510> than<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.810> expect<00:03:49.140> it<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.459> but<00:03:50.459> what<00:03:50.880> was

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
earlier than I expect it to but what was

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.449 
earlier than I expect it to but what was
nice<00:03:51.150> about<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.480> you're<00:03:52.440> not<00:03:52.470> in<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.220> GTR

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
nice about it is you're not in the GTR

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.890 
nice about it is you're not in the GTR
you're<00:03:53.640> driving<00:03:54.000> from<00:03:54.060> point<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.450> point<00:03:54.480> in

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
you're driving from point to point in

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.490 
you're driving from point to point in
the<00:03:54.959> m5<00:03:55.640> fold<00:03:56.640> really<00:03:57.000> nicely<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:57.930> when<00:03:58.380> you

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
the m5 fold really nicely so when you

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.080 
the m5 fold really nicely so when you
get<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.739> that<00:03:58.980> limit<00:03:59.280> you<00:03:59.370> get<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.519> nice<00:03:59.730> drift

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
get to that limit you get a nice drift

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.180 
get to that limit you get a nice drift
it<00:04:00.989> really<00:04:01.290> tells<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.650> what's<00:04:01.890> about<00:04:02.040> to

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
it really tells you what's about to

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.960 
it really tells you what's about to
happen<00:04:02.430> so

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
happen so

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.080 
happen so
the<00:04:04.650> limit<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.740> lore<00:04:06.130> but<00:04:06.790> it's<00:04:06.940> more

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
the limit is lore but it's more

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.660 
the limit is lore but it's more
involving<00:04:07.510> as<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.690> driver<00:04:07.990> and<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:09.360> felt<00:04:10.360> like<00:04:10.540> I

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
involving as a driver and I felt like I

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.970 
involving as a driver and I felt like I
got<00:04:12.670> more<00:04:12.940> out<00:04:12.970> of<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.540> from<00:04:14.200> driving<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.680> car

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
got more out of it from driving the car

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.680 
got more out of it from driving the car
or<00:04:15.220> as<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.610> GTR<00:04:15.970> seems<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.299> do<00:04:16.390> more<00:04:16.600> for<00:04:16.810> me<00:04:17.280> so

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
or as the GTR seems to do more for me so

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.440 
or as the GTR seems to do more for me so
polar<00:04:19.690> opposites<00:04:20.290> really<00:04:20.440> but<00:04:21.100> both<00:04:22.000> both

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
polar opposites really but both both

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.450 
polar opposites really but both both
enjoyable<00:04:22.840> in<00:04:23.080> their<00:04:23.230> own<00:04:23.320> way<00:04:23.470> but<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.710> m5<00:04:24.130> is

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
enjoyable in their own way but the m5 is

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.030 
enjoyable in their own way but the m5 is
just<00:04:24.760> more<00:04:25.090> why<00:04:25.270> mr.<00:04:25.660> butt<00:04:25.870> is<00:04:26.410> interesting

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
just more why mr. butt is interesting

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.560 
just more why mr. butt is interesting

about lip spoiler I'd love to just put a
little<00:04:28.750> bit<00:04:28.870> more<00:04:28.960> rear<00:04:29.560> downforce<00:04:29.770> on<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.280> and

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
little bit more rear downforce on it and

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.630 
little bit more rear downforce on it and
see<00:04:30.910> how<00:04:31.060> that<00:04:31.240> was

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.600 

2.8<00:04:36.640> seconds<00:04:37.090> difference<00:04:37.510> in<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.780> teams<00:04:38.610> when

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
2.8 seconds difference in the teams when

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.260 
2.8 seconds difference in the teams when
I<00:04:39.640> got<00:04:39.880> that<00:04:40.750> was<00:04:40.900> about<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.410> difference<00:04:42.270> it's

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
I got that was about the difference it's

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.360 
I got that was about the difference it's
really<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.570> little<00:04:43.750> bit<00:04:43.960> everywhere<00:04:44.370> breaking

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
really a little bit everywhere breaking

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.040 
really a little bit everywhere breaking
they're<00:04:46.270> both<00:04:46.480> pretty<00:04:46.750> similar<00:04:47.220> but<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:49.630> GTR

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
they're both pretty similar but the GTR

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.600 
they're both pretty similar but the GTR
seems<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.410> be<00:04:50.470> able<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.710> carry<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.100> little<00:04:51.490> bit

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
seems to be able to carry a little bit

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.270 
seems to be able to carry a little bit
more<00:04:51.760> speed<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:53.470> traction<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:54.040> much

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
more speed and the traction is much

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.040 
more speed and the traction is much
better<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:54.880> with<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.360> m5<00:04:55.570> you're<00:04:55.780> really

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
better so with the m5 you're really

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.350 
better so with the m5 you're really
feeding<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.530> power<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:57.040> being<00:04:57.880> patient<00:04:58.150> and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
feeding the power and being patient and

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.640 
feeding the power and being patient and
just<00:04:58.540> working<00:04:58.750> with<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.080> traction<00:04:59.500> that<00:04:59.590> you

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
just working with the traction that you

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.160 
just working with the traction that you
have<00:04:59.860> available<00:05:00.010> with<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.670> GTR<00:05:01.000> get<00:05:01.870> it<00:05:01.960> turn

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
have available with the GTR get it turn

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.540 
have available with the GTR get it turn
to<00:05:02.200> get<00:05:02.530> as<00:05:02.620> straight<00:05:02.830> as<00:05:02.920> you<00:05:02.980> can<00:05:03.040> and<00:05:03.250> just

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
to get as straight as you can and just

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.300 
to get as straight as you can and just
fill<00:05:03.790> throttle<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.390> it<00:05:04.510> picks<00:05:04.780> up<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:05.140> goes

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
fill throttle and it picks up and goes

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.650 
fill throttle and it picks up and goes
so<00:05:06.420> i'd<00:05:07.420> say<00:05:08.280> mid<00:05:09.280> corner<00:05:09.520> speeds<00:05:09.910> bit<00:05:10.420> of<00:05:10.540> it

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
so i'd say mid corner speeds bit of it

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.330 
so i'd say mid corner speeds bit of it
but<00:05:10.840> it's<00:05:10.960> mostly<00:05:11.080> acceleration<00:05:11.860> getting<00:05:12.250> out

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
but it's mostly acceleration getting out

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.180 
but it's mostly acceleration getting out
onto<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.760> streets<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.660> just<00:05:13.950> excel<00:05:14.950> that

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
onto the streets and just excel that

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:25.690 
onto the streets and just excel that
multiplies<00:05:15.970> as<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.420> go<00:05:16.570> through<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.930> lap

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.540 

so<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.660> GTR<00:05:27.020> makes<00:05:27.260> light<00:05:27.500> work<00:05:27.530> of<00:05:27.890> the<00:05:28.040> m5<00:05:28.370> on

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
so the GTR makes light work of the m5 on

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.290 
so the GTR makes light work of the m5 on
track<00:05:29.830> it<00:05:30.830> slots<00:05:31.250> into<00:05:31.430> second<00:05:31.850> position<00:05:32.180> on

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
track it slots into second position on

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.020 
track it slots into second position on
