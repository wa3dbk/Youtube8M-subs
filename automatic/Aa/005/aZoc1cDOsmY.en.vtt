00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.409
 [Music] 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.409
 home 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:15.639
 hello friends like the games of 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.790
 traditions 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.790
 2 infinite 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.490
 good 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.990
 little we give you the red ones 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.950
 we leave them 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.590
 we expect many factors 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.960
 the file to be able to tell me 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.780
 in the ideal game and be able to put him 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.329
 example munitis racing code other 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.030
 they have how to unite other than the mega power 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.690
 and so good 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.690
 take off 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.260
 when we recorded this 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.360
 we can 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.360
 and we will save file 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.920
 where I have so outta 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.509
 Y 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.509
 if it was a taste all 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.650
 now we have them from you 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.040
 and we leave with the least symptom with 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.040
 this 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.100
 do not 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.820
 effective we leave them 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.470
 we passed them 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:14.860
 well, long ago, parents authorized 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.860
 river let's go let's fire 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.900
 and as they come immediately we get 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.900
 choose anyone 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.880
 now let's go to the topic 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.550
 that's why they will not be able to choose any 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.550
 weapon but for that we have the charts 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.420
 the first one is of all the past 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.230
 objects that is to keep the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.820
 key next to 1 and we start and today 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.990
 you live and look let's talk now and today 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.220
 power 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:02.460
 and now we speak and today room and ex 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.580
 and now we're going to give it and with that from the 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.080
 perfect combination of five themes 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.580
 all things more 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.580
 the delay of the cell 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.370
 then it's a demonstration that we have 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.370
 and it serves 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.250
 and this as to be able have like 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.250
 actors to jump a lot 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.810
 look alone 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.110
 also gives us another cable 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.110

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.390

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.630
 I'm going to write disparate so you can see 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.630
 I never fly 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.259

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.630
