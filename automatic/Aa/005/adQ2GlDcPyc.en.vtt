your leader the way I like to do is I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.250 
your leader the way I like to do is I
put<00:00:38.130> it<00:00:38.220> in<00:00:38.310> between<00:00:38.430> my<00:00:38.789> fingers<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
put it in between my fingers and then I

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.250 
put it in between my fingers and then I
slowly<00:00:40.559> unravel<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.610> again<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.899> butt<00:00:43.079> end

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
slowly unravel the again the butt end

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
slowly unravel the again the butt end
here<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.280> slowly<00:00:47.520> work<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.000> if<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.239> do

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
here and I just slowly work it if you do

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.410 
here and I just slowly work it if you do
this<00:00:48.570> too<00:00:49.110> quickly<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:49.739> without<00:00:50.670> keeping<00:00:51.210> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
this too quickly or without keeping it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.880 
this too quickly or without keeping it
around<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.719> fingers<00:00:52.020> it'll<00:00:52.289> turn<00:00:52.440> into<00:00:52.500> one

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
around your fingers it'll turn into one

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.010 
around your fingers it'll turn into one
big<00:00:53.100> mess<00:00:53.340> now<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.359> can<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.780> leader

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
big mess now you can see this leader

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.920 
big mess now you can see this leader
here<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.469> very<00:00:56.039> coiled<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:57.660> don't<00:00:57.809> want

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
here is very coiled and you don't want

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.229 
here is very coiled and you don't want
to<00:00:57.989> fish<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.940> so<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.030> need<00:01:00.149> to

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
to fish it like that so you need to

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.779 
to fish it like that so you need to
straighten<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.160> hold<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
straighten it so to do so I hold the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.280 
straighten it so to do so I hold the
leader<00:01:02.969> firmly<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.110> hand<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.559> place<00:01:04.830> the

leader firmly in one hand I place the

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.680 
leader firmly in one hand I place the
leader<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.590> leader<00:01:07.740> straightener<00:01:08.690> and

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
leader in the leader straightener and

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.660 
leader in the leader straightener and
I'll<00:01:09.780> pinch<00:01:10.080> down<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:10.979> too<00:01:11.189> hard<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.580> mean

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
I'll pinch down and not too hard I mean

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.580 
I'll pinch down and not too hard I mean
you<00:01:11.790> pinch<00:01:12.030> down<00:01:12.210> very<00:01:12.509> firm<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.140> don't

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you pinch down very firm but you don't

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.170 
you pinch down very firm but you don't
pinch<00:01:13.799> down<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.340> hard<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.759> it<00:01:14.850> won't<00:01:15.000> slide

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
pinch down so hard that it won't slide

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.490 
pinch down so hard that it won't slide
through<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> leader<00:01:15.840> straightener<00:01:16.320> I

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
through the leader straightener I

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.980 
through the leader straightener I
basically<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.549> pull<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> leader<00:01:18.360> through

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
basically just pull the leader through

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.749 
basically just pull the leader through
the<00:01:19.080> leader<00:01:19.229> straightener<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.400> once<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.700> get

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the leader straightener and once I get

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.969 
the leader straightener and once I get
about<00:01:21.119> three<00:01:21.390> feet<00:01:21.570> through<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.890> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
about three feet through I take it and I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.539 
about three feet through I take it and I
I<00:01:23.250> pull<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.329> and<00:01:25.280> basically<00:01:26.280> what<00:01:26.460> I've

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
I pull on it and basically what I've

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.700 
I pull on it and basically what I've
done<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.000> I've<00:01:27.150> stretched<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> can

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
done is I've stretched it and you can

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.649 
done is I've stretched it and you can
see<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:30.110> nice<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.470> straight<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:33.540> have

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
see now it's nice and straight you have

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.999 
see now it's nice and straight you have
to<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.900> both<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.650> both<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to do both you have to have both the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.920 
to do both you have to have both the
friction<00:01:35.460> which<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.329> pulling<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.720> through<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
friction which is pulling it through the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.440 
friction which is pulling it through the
leader<00:01:37.110> straightener<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.520> stretch<00:01:38.850> then

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
leader straightener and the stretch then

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.530 
leader straightener and the stretch then
I<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.780> stretch<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.060> that'll<00:01:42.060> straighten<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
I just stretch it that'll straighten it

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.410 
I just stretch it that'll straighten it
right<00:01:42.780> out<00:01:43.759> now<00:01:44.759> when<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:44.970> get<00:01:45.060> down<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
right out now when you get down to the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.670 
right out now when you get down to the
fine<00:01:45.600> stuff<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.500> more

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
fine stuff you have to be a little more

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.170 
fine stuff you have to be a little more
careful<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.220> don't<00:01:47.310> want<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.549> pinch<00:01:47.700> too<00:01:47.939> hard

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
careful you don't want to pinch too hard

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.420 
careful you don't want to pinch too hard
or<00:01:48.840> else<00:01:48.960> you'll<00:01:49.200> break<00:01:49.469> this<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:50.159> fine

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
or else you'll break this really fine

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.420 
or else you'll break this really fine

it<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.439> stretch<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.920> don't<00:01:56.189> even<00:01:56.310> really

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it and stretch it you don't even really

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.530 
it and stretch it you don't even really
need<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.820> run<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> through<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.329> leader

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
need to run it through a leader

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.749 
need to run it through a leader
straightener<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.350> fine<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.950> it'll

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
straightener it's so fine that it'll

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.819 
straightener it's so fine that it'll
straighten<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.479> just<00:02:00.899> fine<00:02:01.170> with<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.710> little

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
straighten out just fine with a little

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.889 
straighten out just fine with a little
bit<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.250> stretch<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:03.210> leader<00:02:03.390> straightener

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
bit of stretch the leader straightener

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.649 
bit of stretch the leader straightener
is<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:04.229> for<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.680> nice<00:02:04.950> thick<00:02:05.539> portion<00:02:06.539> of

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
is really for the nice thick portion of

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.210 
is really for the nice thick portion of
the<00:02:06.719> leader<00:02:06.930> at<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> butt<00:02:07.350> section<00:02:07.619> where<00:02:08.100> you

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the leader at the butt section where you

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.800 
the leader at the butt section where you
just<00:02:08.399> can't<00:02:08.580> straighten<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.300> your<00:02:09.450> hands

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
just can't straighten it with your hands

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.230 
just can't straighten it with your hands
so<00:02:10.220> that's<00:02:11.220> how<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.400> straighten<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> leader

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
so that's how you straighten the leader

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.530 
so that's how you straighten the leader
of<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.600> leader<00:02:13.020> straightener
