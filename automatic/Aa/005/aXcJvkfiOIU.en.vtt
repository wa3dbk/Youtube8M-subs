some advice on the carburetor of what to

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.209 
some advice on the carburetor of what to
do<00:00:14.270> from<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:14.600> rebuilder<00:00:15.170> he<00:00:15.799> seems<00:00:16.039> to<00:00:16.160> think

do from the rebuilder he seems to think

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.790 
do from the rebuilder he seems to think
of<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.580> metering<00:00:16.880> rods<00:00:16.910> aren't<00:00:17.770> good<00:00:18.770> enough

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
of the metering rods aren't good enough

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.220 
of the metering rods aren't good enough
to<00:00:19.310> react<00:00:19.789> with<00:00:20.029> the<00:00:20.089> vacuum<00:00:20.689> signals<00:00:21.050> given

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
to react with the vacuum signals given

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.599 
to react with the vacuum signals given
up<00:00:21.380> by<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:21.560> engine<00:00:21.980> so<00:00:22.099> that's<00:00:22.220> why<00:00:22.400> I<00:00:22.429> get

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
up by the engine so that's why I get

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.339 
up by the engine so that's why I get
that<00:00:22.730> part<00:00:23.029> throttle<00:00:23.179> stumble<00:00:23.720> in<00:00:23.839> the<00:00:23.869> car<00:00:24.109> so

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
that part throttle stumble in the car so

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.169 
that part throttle stumble in the car so

the parking brake on this card has a
penchant<00:01:16.399> of<00:01:16.490> slipping<00:01:16.880> that's<00:01:17.030> why<00:01:17.149> it<00:01:17.210> has<00:01:17.329> a

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
penchant of slipping that's why it has a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.289 
penchant of slipping that's why it has a
very<00:01:17.600> good<00:01:18.039> part<00:01:19.039> in<00:01:19.189> gear<00:01:19.460> in<00:01:19.549> it<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:20.119> just

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999 
anyway here's the meeting rod coming out

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:37.120 
anyway here's the meeting rod coming out
right<00:01:32.240> now<00:01:32.299> and<00:01:33.639> there's<00:01:34.639> a<00:01:34.729> spring<00:01:36.130> which

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
right now and there's a spring which

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.700 
right now and there's a spring which
will<00:01:37.310> take<00:01:37.490> out

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.270 

very<00:01:42.340> gently<00:01:42.790> very<00:01:43.470> gently<00:01:44.670> take<00:01:45.670> your<00:01:45.850> time

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
now the way these things work is there's

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.400 
now the way these things work is there's
a<00:01:49.510> piston<00:01:50.020> over<00:01:50.770> here<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.160> cylinder<00:01:51.520> and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
a piston over here and a cylinder and

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.360 
a piston over here and a cylinder and
when<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.530> engine<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:53.830> running<00:01:53.860> at<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.160> high

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
when the engine is running at a high

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.910

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
course when you when it's okay but this

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.010 
course when you when it's okay but this
meter<00:02:11.080> drug<00:02:11.320> comes<00:02:11.590> up<00:02:11.800> it<00:02:12.010> will<00:02:12.580> then<00:02:13.020> allow

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
meter drug comes up it will then allow

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.260

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
more fuel to be sucked through the jet

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.790 
more fuel to be sucked through the jet
which<00:02:16.690> then<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.959> lot<00:02:17.110> more<00:02:17.260> fill<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.500> get<00:02:17.620> pumped

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
which then a lot more fill to get pumped

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.890 
which then a lot more fill to get pumped
and<00:02:18.010> fans<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:18.340> subsequently<00:02:18.850> now<00:02:19.540> these<00:02:19.750> are

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
and fans and subsequently now these are

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.449 
and fans and subsequently now these are
too<00:02:20.020> thick<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.560> won't<00:02:20.709> allow<00:02:20.950> enough<00:02:21.220> fuel<00:02:21.430> to

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
too thick it won't allow enough fuel to

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.490 
too thick it won't allow enough fuel to
get<00:02:21.700> pulled<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.180> thus<00:02:22.660> when<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.900> get<00:02:23.110> those<00:02:23.290> lean

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
get pulled in thus when I get those lean

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.530 
get pulled in thus when I get those lean
stumbles<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.430> organism<00:02:24.910> now<00:02:25.239> what<00:02:25.420> we're

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
stumbles the organism now what we're

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.580 
stumbles the organism now what we're
gonna<00:02:25.660> do<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:25.930> we're<00:02:26.020> gonna<00:02:26.080> try<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.380> get<00:02:26.560> a

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
gonna do is we're gonna try to get a

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.110 
gonna do is we're gonna try to get a
number<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:27.010> some<00:02:27.220> sort<00:02:27.430> off<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:27.910> I'll<00:02:28.000> be

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
number of some sort off this so I'll be

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.370 
number of some sort off this so I'll be
able<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.330> tell<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.570> rebuilding<00:02:28.989> what<00:02:29.110> we<00:02:29.230> need

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
able to tell the rebuilding what we need

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.780 
able to tell the rebuilding what we need
and<00:02:29.530> he'll<00:02:29.650> give<00:02:29.800> us<00:02:29.890> some<00:02:30.070> richer<00:02:30.370> wants<00:02:30.640> to

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
and he'll give us some richer wants to

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.150 
and he'll give us some richer wants to
fit<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.300> but<00:02:32.290> basically<00:02:32.709> that's<00:02:32.890> what<00:02:32.980> we're

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
fit in but basically that's what we're

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.910 
fit in but basically that's what we're
up<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.280> right<00:02:33.550> now<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:34.000> we'll<00:02:34.390> see<00:02:34.570> more<00:02:34.920> then

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
up to right now and we'll see more then

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.260 
up to right now and we'll see more then
laying<00:02:36.130> around<00:02:36.280> with<00:02:36.550> them<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.820> few<00:02:37.150> more

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
laying around with them a few more

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.780 
laying around with them a few more
things<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.810> car<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.860> wait<00:02:39.040> take<00:02:39.550> care
