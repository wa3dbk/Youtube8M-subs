00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.120
 very good all my name is frames and 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.549
 welcome to what is a new video 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.860
 from battlefield 4 in this my channel 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.380
 secondary so good what better way 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.720
 to start a game a gameplay that 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.700
 capturing the flag must in domain not 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.350
 I know what map it is but it's a map is the 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.810
 I really liked it 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.510
 it was the second third time I played it 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.430
 and he has convinced me he has fallen in love with me 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.560
 that I will vote for him not here in the bat 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.720
 do not vote 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.250
 so I'll look for it for the next time 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.890
 that plays in domain because the truth 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.710
 is that it is an unbeatable map has 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.720
 routes on the sides has a building 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.280
 through the center you can surprise very 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.590
 well to the people behind as I go to 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.140
 do in the next action so 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.540
 this one is cool the truth I do not know how it 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.309
 calls but is totally recommended 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.930
 to play it in domain so good 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.540
 today I have many things to tell you 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.809
 many things to say to you, pretty 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.520
 cheerful he played chairs and tasty so 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.710
 I have seven minutes to talk 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.780
 I tried to shorten the video as much as 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.159
 possible because you already know that I like it 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.239
 do the videos by the way here I 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.740
 love 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.990
 Of course I do not know if small 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.759
 I wanted to be a doctor or not but the truth 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.490
 I'm getting a little taste in this 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.409
 revive people and let go of the typical 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.320
 packet so that it recovers immediately 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:20.180
 that you have no idea but goldsmith today 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.820
 first news of the day is that I'm 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.310
 improving the quality of the videos I'm going to 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.080
 start this is not done as well as what 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.210
 I'm going to say but I'm going to start recording 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.429
 videos in 1080p and upload them in 200 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.280
 2000 I do not know what but that tremendous thing 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:39.229
 tremendous quality and brutal quality for 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.929
 you my followers of the battlefield 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.090
 because I do not know I have to try another 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.850
 bianco but a bat file was doing 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.679
 Improvement quality improvement tests 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.229
 of performance of the videos network of 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.000
 rendering better said and the truth is 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.819
 that has gone very well I'm trying the 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.350
 new settings new renders and are 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.630
 giving good results so 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.319
 let's cross our fingers and hope you like it 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.929
 as much as me 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.819
 the new quality that I'm going to bring with the 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.860
 Batel fit videos with videos from 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.030
 code I will also do it in the future but 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.799
 first we start with the battlefield 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.960
 I want to see your opinions to see if 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.300
 you can appreciate is 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.070
 the rendering quality and this new 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.270
 quality that I upload to youtube not because it's going 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.040
 to be up to 1040 ko is that they are 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.250
 qualities that in my life I had heard 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.110
 but they have advised on the internet that 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.510
 let's do so American channels that 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.940
 been investigating so I hope as 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.760
 I say that the new quality I appreciate it is 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.050
 that your eyes can do 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.880
 enjoy it so good again 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.340
 here on this map trying to catch the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.680
 surprise route let's say I do not know how to 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.060
 usually say and by the way here I have 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.980
 commented that what I just skipped 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.170
 they are streaks of specialist I imagine 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.930
 that when you kill a lot and die very 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.180
 little they give him then that does not streak in 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.430
 ammunition plan or other things 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.830
 I am interested to know that many of 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.320
 you leave me saying advice 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.060
 commenting me frames look at this gallon that 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.980
 you finish chanting antal used for 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.930
 this because you already know I am very 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.060
 novice I'm trying to learn everything 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.430
 what can I do and in fact every day I learn 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.160
 more and more things you need help 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.380
 boy or sorry and be dead but 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.080
 I 'm seeing more and more things every day 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.930
 many of you are helping me 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.090
 then he accepted all the advice that I 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.720
 give all the tips that you want me 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.360
 give and propose everything I accept everything 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.440
 I read so welcome be all true 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.710
 but good 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.510
 more things kids battlefield is me 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.900
 very much like he has proposed in 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.510
 the title I like my own words 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.280
 because he gave me to do what he does 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.220
 the world not all novice always 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.350
 more or less the same happens to him I do not take a 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.210
 new game is not good and says go 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.730
 game shit me this does not work for 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.190
 nothing when it's really the game is 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.140
 brutal the truth when you get a lot 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.760
 reed, obviously you do not enjoy it 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.890
 both but when you meet 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.170
 people like that more or less scatterbrained like 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.080
 I the truth is that the game is enjoyed 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.390
 an absolute barbarity yesterday that was 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.820
 when I took out this pair of videos not from 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.200
 I had a great time but very well 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.540
 done is the second part of the gameplay 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.000
 that I already tell you another game that I've 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.010
 caught the chunk well more 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.720
 interesting you could say it's a 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.420
 streak also quite long as well 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.460
 that the previous one and the truth is that the 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.230
 I'm really enjoying playing is 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.670
 true that there are many times that I receive 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.880
 a lot because I'm against 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.800
 uncles who know enough but as soon as 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.260
 I can get a little bit of the trick and 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.810
 get a little sensitivity to the 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.430
 time to aim is enjoyed very much and 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.760
 it's something that as I say I eat my 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.960
 own words here 12 to forgiveness to q 12 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.940
 you have not tried it yet I do not know if it is 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.100
 good or bad I just saw it says that the 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.770
 I just unblocked but but it is that it is 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.540
 brutal and also the acr is that as I said 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.040
 a subscriber that right now is the 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.590
 full name I do not know I think it's 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.440
 of ezker I do not know if I pronounce it wrong or 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.290
 no but it 's very well suited to my style 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.180
 game is not super good Reloading 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.460
 the look is very good the recoil is 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.030
 can control very well has a lot 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.010
 cadence appears a rifle submachine gun 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.020
 assault is a carbine I do not imagine that 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.360
 will be that same here for sure 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.110
 I'm firing uncle 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:22.320
 perfectly bursts 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.000
 in my opinion the chest and the sky did not 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.160
 I ended up dying I do not know why not 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.830
 I know be some trick some accessories 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.300
 that you have to recommend me but in my 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.070
 opinion was shooting pretty good 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.750
 Uncle but I do not kill myself 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.940
 I finished doing an assistance 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.680
 it seems that it is called but good here a 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.970
 time more is that I love to reanimate the 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.790
 people I do not know why I took a 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.610
 Gustillo to the class of tremendous doctor 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.860
 It happens is not an engineer will be worth much 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:49.650
 of support also but to me go of doctor 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.510
 or assault call it as grace do not you 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.950
 Chifla I love but good kids 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.870
 I hope you are enjoying it example and 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.010
 new quality as I said tell me the 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.290
 comments section 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.480
 and I think you also wanted to thank you 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.970
 the reception that the 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.810
 channel and the videos of the battle film in the 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.000
 channel because you are watching 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.620
 To my surprise, many visits 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.400
 compared to the videos of the call of 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.630
 duty 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.240
 for example the vices call of duty 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.090
 reach almost 2,000 visits and these 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.370
 they reach the average of 1000 thousand 500 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.450
 visits and this is great the truth the 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.620
 reception that the 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.950
 videos of the battlefield this encourages me 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:27.320
 very much very much to bring you more videos 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.639
 of this game so kids I hope 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.310
 that you have enjoyed this example and 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:34.040
 as I say I try to improve every day and 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.810
 I think that given a big step in this 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.250
 example, you see that I have improved a little 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.440
 more than what you've seen 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.020
 previous gameplays in which good we 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.580
 we see tomorrow probably with a video 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.260
 of call of duty so as not to saturate the 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.070
 battle row so a greeting up 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.070
 see you later
