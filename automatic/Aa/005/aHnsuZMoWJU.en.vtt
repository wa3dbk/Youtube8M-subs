00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.610 
we're in 15th gear and I'm in it on the
main<00:02:35.760> green<00:02:36.060> section<00:02:36.540> which<00:02:36.900> mean<00:02:37.140> I'm<00:02:37.320> around

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
main green section which mean I'm around

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.790 
main green section which mean I'm around
about<00:02:37.970> 1,350<00:02:38.970> rpm<00:02:39.420> which<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.050> great<00:02:40.410> for<00:02:40.590> fuel

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
about 1,350 rpm which is great for fuel

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.650 
about 1,350 rpm which is great for fuel
consumption<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.640> certainly<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.360> shouldn't

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
consumption and certainly it shouldn't

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.160 
consumption and certainly it shouldn't
be<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> problem<00:02:42.900> therefore<00:02:43.560> obviously<00:02:44.280> with<00:02:44.430> it

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
be a problem therefore obviously with it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.240 
be a problem therefore obviously with it
540<00:02:46.170> horsepower<00:02:46.260> we've<00:02:46.650> got<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:46.920> make<00:02:47.070> sure

540 horsepower we've got to make sure

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.190 
540 horsepower we've got to make sure
that<00:02:47.550> we're<00:02:47.940> getting<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.210> most<00:02:48.360> economical

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
that we're getting the most economical

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:56.040 
that we're getting the most economical
position<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:50.010> possible

far as visibility is concerned I've got

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.820 
far as visibility is concerned I've got
a<00:02:58.790> good<00:02:58.940> driver<00:02:59.180> side<00:02:59.480> here<00:02:59.510> mirror<00:03:00.290> then

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
a good driver side here mirror then

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.320 
a good driver side here mirror then
we've<00:03:00.950> got<00:03:01.130> three<00:03:01.610> mirrors<00:03:01.970> on<00:03:02.120> the

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
we've got three mirrors on the

hand drive vehicle obviously that we

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.570 
hand drive vehicle obviously that we
switch<00:03:08.060> around<00:03:08.300> for<00:03:08.510> ourselves<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.890> so

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
switch around for ourselves and so

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.120 
switch around for ourselves and so
visibility<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.360> excellent<00:03:11.620> the<00:03:12.620> front<00:03:12.860> of<00:03:12.980> us

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
well and the windscreen is it's just

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.640 
well and the windscreen is it's just
about<00:03:20.240> right<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.840> wouldn't<00:03:21.110> say<00:03:21.320> it's<00:03:21.470> over

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
about right I wouldn't say it's over
