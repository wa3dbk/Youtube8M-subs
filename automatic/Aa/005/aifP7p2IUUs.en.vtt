00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
considerably faster the cooldown a 45 30

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.650 
considerably faster the cooldown a 45 30
seconds<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> mana<00:00:59.340> cost<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.760> only<00:00:59.940> 90<00:01:00.480> this

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
seconds and a mana cost of only 90 this

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.590 
seconds and a mana cost of only 90 this
ability<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.199> huge<00:01:01.829> ganking<00:01:02.460> potential<00:01:02.850> which

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
ability has huge ganking potential which

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.399 
ability has huge ganking potential which
is<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.199> clinkz<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.680> strength<00:01:05.840> his<00:01:06.840> second

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
is one of clinkz is strength his second

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.039 
is one of clinkz is strength his second
ability<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.860> searing<00:01:08.610> arrows<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.600> causes

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
ability is searing arrows this causes

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.710 
ability is searing arrows this causes
all<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.260> clinks<00:01:10.710> his<00:01:10.860> attacks<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.520> deal<00:01:11.720> 2250

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
all of clinks his attacks to deal 2250

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.620 
all of clinks his attacks to deal 2250
bonus<00:01:13.110> damage<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.650> has<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> cast<00:01:14.670> range<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.060> 600

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
bonus damage and has a cast range of 600

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.649 
bonus damage and has a cast range of 600
so<00:01:15.930> basically<00:01:16.439> his<00:01:16.710> auto<00:01:16.950> attack<00:01:17.430> range<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
so basically his auto attack range it

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
so basically his auto attack range it
costs<00:01:19.080> 8<00:01:19.259> mana<00:01:19.619> per<00:01:19.920> shot<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.850> be

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
costs 8 mana per shot so it can be

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.030 
costs 8 mana per shot so it can be
manner<00:01:21.299> intensive<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.500> attack<00:01:22.830> speed

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
manner intensive with the attack speed

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.640 
manner intensive with the attack speed
from<00:01:23.340> strafe<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.840> lungs<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.350> item

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
from strafe but with lungs as item

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.030 
from strafe but with lungs as item
builds<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.909> really<00:01:27.450> an<00:01:27.540> issue<00:01:28.040> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
builds this is not really an issue the
