00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
time yeah i made about 2,600 overloads

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.490 
time yeah i made about 2,600 overloads
or<00:04:14.340> so<00:04:14.550> probably<00:04:15.000> someone<00:04:15.900> somewhere<00:04:16.170> around

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
or so probably someone somewhere around

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.979 
or so probably someone somewhere around
there<00:04:16.830> and<00:04:17.120> pretty<00:04:18.120> sure<00:04:18.299> from<00:04:18.450> scratch<00:04:18.780> it

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
there and pretty sure from scratch it

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.969 
there and pretty sure from scratch it
cost<00:04:19.200> 77<00:04:19.830> k<00:04:19.980> to<00:04:20.040> do<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:21.140> each<00:04:22.140> overload<00:04:22.710> so

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
cost 77 k to do and each overload so

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.620 
cost 77 k to do and each overload so
this<00:04:23.100> is<00:04:23.190> about<00:04:23.250> 200<00:04:23.820> ml<00:04:23.940> worth<00:04:24.120> overloads

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630

reason why I didn't make a fourth one

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.530 
reason why I didn't make a fourth one
was<00:05:29.650> because<00:05:30.010> no<00:05:30.550> one<00:05:30.730> got<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:30.940> answer<00:05:31.300> right

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
was because no one got the answer right

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.140 
was because no one got the answer right
the<00:05:31.810> answer<00:05:31.900> was<00:05:32.170> race<00:05:32.440> by<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.070> way<00:05:33.310> you<00:05:34.000> know

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.660 
oh I don't run well yeah you you compete
you<00:05:40.000> race<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.540> other<00:05:40.630> things<00:05:40.960> and<00:05:41.550> you<00:05:42.550> know

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
you race and other things and you know

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.030 
you race and other things and you know
your<00:05:42.850> race<00:05:43.060> distinguishes<00:05:43.900> me<00:05:44.650> from<00:05:44.680> you

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
your race distinguishes me from you

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.070 
your race distinguishes me from you
because<00:05:45.250> we're<00:05:45.550> not<00:05:45.580> all<00:05:45.910> the<00:05:45.940> same<00:05:46.180> you<00:05:46.960> know

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
because we're not all the same you know

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.690 
because we're not all the same you know
you<00:05:47.140> might<00:05:47.440> your<00:05:48.010> brother<00:05:48.250> might<00:05:48.430> have<00:05:48.610> the

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
you might your brother might have the

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.210 
you might your brother might have the
same<00:05:48.910> race<00:05:49.120> as<00:05:49.150> you<00:05:49.420> but<00:05:49.690> other<00:05:50.350> people<00:05:50.680> it's

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
same race as you but other people it's

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.330 
same race as you but other people it's
not<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.490> same<00:05:51.730> but<00:05:52.570> uh<00:05:52.630> yeah<00:05:53.530> that's<00:05:54.130> pretty

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
not the same but uh yeah that's pretty

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.580 
not the same but uh yeah that's pretty
much<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:54.580> answer<00:05:54.940> to<00:05:55.030> that<00:05:55.060> one<00:05:55.360> I<00:05:55.840> should

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
much the answer to that one I should

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.620 
much the answer to that one I should
have<00:05:56.680> made<00:05:56.740> a<00:05:56.800> fourth<00:05:57.070> one<00:05:57.250> but<00:05:57.940> you<00:05:58.480> know<00:05:58.600> I

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
have made a fourth one but you know I

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.470 
have made a fourth one but you know I
figured<00:05:58.990> since<00:05:59.140> someone<00:05:59.410> got<00:05:59.560> it<00:05:59.740> then<00:06:00.010> I

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:00.480 
figured since someone got it then I

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.670 
figured since someone got it then I
don't<00:06:01.480> I<00:06:01.540> just<00:06:01.630> didn't<00:06:01.930> want<00:06:02.080> to<00:06:02.140> didn't<00:06:02.530> want

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
don't I just didn't want to didn't want

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.490 
don't I just didn't want to didn't want
to<00:06:02.740> make<00:06:02.800> another<00:06:02.950> one<00:06:03.250> but<00:06:03.970> yeah<00:06:04.960> guys<00:06:05.170> I

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
to make another one but yeah guys I

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.760 
to make another one but yeah guys I
guess<00:06:05.980> five<00:06:06.400> weeks<00:06:06.670> from<00:06:06.790> now<00:06:07.030> I<00:06:07.440> might<00:06:08.440> make

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
guess five weeks from now I might make

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.650 
guess five weeks from now I might make
