not particularly difficult it's all

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.859

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.990 
in phantom hourglass they're also pretty
easy<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.800> get<00:03:11.250> sent<00:03:12.250> away<00:03:12.310> now<00:03:12.580> we<00:03:12.640> just<00:03:12.940> need

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
easy to get sent away now we just need

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.410 
easy to get sent away now we just need
to<00:03:13.180> get<00:03:13.300> over<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.750> tower<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.260> spirits<00:03:14.830> and

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
to get over to the tower of spirits and

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.229 
to get over to the tower of spirits and
then<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:17.019> next<00:03:17.590> part<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.280> actually

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
then in the next part and actually

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.390 
then in the next part and actually
probably<00:03:19.420> next<00:03:19.690> two<00:03:19.900> or<00:03:19.930> three<00:03:20.050> parts<00:03:20.590> we<00:03:21.280> will

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
probably next two or three parts we will

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.370 
probably next two or three parts we will
be<00:03:21.550> conquering<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.540> tariff<00:03:22.810> spirits<00:03:23.140> for<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
be conquering the tariff spirits for the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.479 
be conquering the tariff spirits for the
third<00:03:23.650> time<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:24.280> think<00:03:25.269> we<00:03:25.420> need<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:26.310> go<00:03:27.310> through

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
third time I think we need to go through

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.110 
third time I think we need to go through
like<00:03:27.760> six<00:03:28.390> different<00:03:29.080> times<00:03:29.290> or<00:03:29.709> whatever

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
like six different times or whatever

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.910 
like six different times or whatever
something<00:03:31.120> like<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.450> i'm<00:03:32.350> pretty<00:03:32.620> sure<00:03:32.769> it's

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
something like that i'm pretty sure it's

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.750 
something like that i'm pretty sure it's
six<00:03:33.130> visits<00:03:33.660> so<00:03:34.660> quite<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:34.989> bit<00:03:35.550> but<00:03:36.550> anyway

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
six visits so quite a bit but anyway

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.600 
six visits so quite a bit but anyway
there<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.180> is

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610
