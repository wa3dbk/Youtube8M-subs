00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.710
 forces and I want to tell you today 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 how do you mine your minecraft too 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.460
 You can always create the latest 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.960
 version below in the video description 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.429
 you find this link there you get 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.440
 just like that and you're here as well 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.969
 I can on my homepage and here 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.369
 you download the files you 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.500
 need to create a server 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.939
 we need two files today 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.410
 to create a server 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.210
 that's the server software 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.220
 stores and wobbles and we need 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.109
 a city ​​file around the server 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.410
 to start the content you can find 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.050
 here 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.610
 We are still creating the city file 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 later we let us first now 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.540
 server software down there we click 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.920
 namely on the downloadlink today in 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.410
 I'll just do the tutorial tutorial 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.390
 Two clicks on it well will be us 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.219
 forwarded to an f and forwarded 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 we have to wait five seconds now 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.360
 and then skip to advertising 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.920
 to press 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.730
 we need to do that with google chrome 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.410
 we still say yes that pressure 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.449
 we want to keep it just click 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.329
 let's have a look and then a file 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.140
 with 20 6 mb down I have 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.460
 Of course, everything already 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.890
 That's why I break that 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.110
 whole off and you push this file 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.470
 just on your desktop like me 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.530
 I did that because I did 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.509
 pushed on my desktop so now 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.710
 we can just a folder 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.979
 put what I have already done 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.810
 server re-underlined the server 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.250
 course name as you like which is 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.990
 now only the folder of the se 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.040
 irrelevant but here come just the 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.780
 pure files 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.119
 who owns it that way we do 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.950
 push the server version the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.049
 server software in here and need 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.840
 Now again the city file so the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.390
 other lady the city file just like 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.710
 we have to create ourselves 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.320
 but we can easily do that too 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.780
 Let's copy this one here 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.540
 copy text or control c 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.310
 on the keyboard then we open our 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.520
 editor under windows 7 can be found here 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.530
 just enter editor or windows 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.869
 xp would actually have to be the editor 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.990
 find dessert by default in windows 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.120
 while clicking on the editor opened 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.730
 and we have ours here now 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.190
 start program what is here in the 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.290
 Gänsefüßchen that is the text 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.180
 he probably needs to change that 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.510
 is now my own minecraft advice 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.680
 but you have to use your powers 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.210
 as well as you are now also concept 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.060
 just go and open yours 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.550
 minecraft launcher goes on profile then 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.860
 you see under java sandbox the 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.890
 exclusive therefore we make an arrow 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.290
 purely at the mark the whole here 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.610
 change control c on the keyboard 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.280
 to copy the whole thing 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.990
 the covers also fall off and then that 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.840
 exclude 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.880
 and then we copy the whole thing 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.450
 with ctrl v 1 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.090
 and now we see the java behind 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.740
 www.axa.de no questions why it is 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.420
 just make that way that he only 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.030
 still lava point access is behind 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.710
 Here are some more things 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.670
 which one can adjust here for 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.520
 example the ram 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.200
 I actually have those now 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.150
 default setting is 512 mb minimum 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.500
 and 1 gigabyte maximum 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.830
 it always depends on how much 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.340
 the new server has gigabyte ram or 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.570
 server has pc or laptop you can 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.640
 Of course, you set how much 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.100
 but if you play alone 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.660
 or just with a friend or just with 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.459
 a plug-in then enough 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.930
 attitude is here is at god 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:27.180
 underlined itself so also ours 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.739
 server software so that's it 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.420
 now again under a beta 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.459
 time to save so we pack up 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.459
 save as we go here 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.260
 desktop and call the starting point bac 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.920
 then we give all in the file type 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.630
 Files 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.040
 that is very important that it is a beate 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.940
 file is so that you are her 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.550
 can perform 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.930
 click Save plus times 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.410
 Look that would have to be exactly that 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.120
 Nothing is the same here 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.250
 changed click here again 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.630
 save for safety's sake i 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.130
 Just wanted to see if that was me 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.880
 have done right now again 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.070
 then click on unlock 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.750
 We can minimize that and now 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.970
 we have our city files here 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.440
 Now we open our server folder 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.240
 and just pull it in here 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.690
 and make a well deserved 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.959
 double click on it so and suffers now 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.870
 he wait for the libraries please wait 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.250
 Of course, very excited 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.870
 I can go here right now 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.040
 Press on play so I'll show you 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.950
 as you can show later 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.930
 so now we get a warning here 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.640
 an info message that the server is not 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.940
 could start and that the server already 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.390
 Demand again is unitymedia 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.060
 in order to run the server dollar points 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.040
 ex tv more info just do it 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.470
 kick on any button and 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:49.480
 now open the here created euler 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.800
 pumped xt make 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.900
 you can of course with the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:57.310
 all-time noble to open I come 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.750
 here is now getting a bit off 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.880
 and then we see euler here 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.200
 but we also have to 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.700
 Otherwise , the whole thing will not work 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.270
 work that is just the 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.950
 minecraft oilers the one of course 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.150
 just have to agree to a server here 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.920
 to be able to have all that 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.610
 I believe on the website again 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.010
 read through 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.480
 We can save that 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.150
 close and can now ours 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.370
 server again start so michael zorc 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.280
 started and now we wait for the first time 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.830
 until our server is started that there 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.789
 now a little and we will see 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:33.300
 Here he starts 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.960
 Of course, magic is not and we see 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.930
 now here 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.629
 The world is being created by the spawn area 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.300
 is prepared and you can see the server 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:44.039
 so gradually everything is created here 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.900
 you can also see the files here 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:48.030
 we could still have a plug-in 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.099
 folder to add a few plugins or 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.569
 other the server properties still 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.500
 so you could set many here 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:54.419
 do many things 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.490
 we are just waiting for the 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.110
 server-ready is a 25 seconds was 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.729
 He finished and we can now again 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.229
 here we have quite a lot 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.819
 files and can now just 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.900
 we seem to be able to do that now 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:05.250
 your own server 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.500
 that's easy you have now 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.020
 namely a server on your inter 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.090
 so internally on your pc so to speak 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.860
 that's why we have to open this course 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.470
 you can and you just do it 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.380
 local house that is a local host 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.960
 locally on your pc or network there 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.759
 we click on the server and we see 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.699
 now also in the console 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.509
 if I'm logged in here , that's me 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.039
 none 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.479
 that's cool too we could 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:32.699
 now also enter commands so 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.740
 I write here first what you see 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.330
 of course everything in the console and 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:40.110
 it could be me again now 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.300
