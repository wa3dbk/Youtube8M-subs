each<00:00:27.269> section<00:00:27.810> at<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.019> time<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.680> want<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> go

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
each section at a time we want to go

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.490 
each section at a time we want to go
quite<00:00:29.519> meticulously<00:00:30.269> through<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.080> hair<00:00:31.289> so

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
you're not missing out on any of it or

you're not missing out on any of it or
getting<00:00:33.329> any<00:00:33.510> kinks<00:00:33.930> throughout<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> hair<00:00:35.100> so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
getting any kinks throughout the hair so

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.110 
getting any kinks throughout the hair so
I've<00:00:36.210> sectioned<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.870> off<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.530> where<00:00:38.120> get

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
I've sectioned this off it's where get

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.040 
I've sectioned this off it's where get
rid<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.450> hair<00:00:39.629> we're<00:00:39.780> not<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
rid of that hair we're not going to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.209 
rid of that hair we're not going to
think<00:00:40.230> about<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.770> moment<00:00:40.920> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
think about that for the moment the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.530 
think about that for the moment the
fringe<00:00:41.760> we're<00:00:41.940> going<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.210> something

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
fringe we're going to do something

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.760 
fringe we're going to do something
slightly<00:00:42.780> different<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.500> I'm<00:00:43.559> going<00:00:43.739> to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
slightly different with so I'm going to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
slightly different with so I'm going to
leave<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:43.980> out<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.579> now<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.020> just

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
leave that out for now so this is just

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.170 
leave that out for now so this is just
one<00:00:47.100> straightening<00:00:47.910> technique

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.910 

take<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> section

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.959 

about<00:00:57.699> a<00:00:58.769> centimeter<00:00:59.769> centimeter<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.760> half

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
about a centimeter centimeter and a half

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.100 
about a centimeter centimeter and a half
in<00:01:01.300> width<00:01:01.750> and<00:01:02.129> also<00:01:03.330> just<00:01:04.330> about<00:01:04.659> the<00:01:04.869> length

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
in width and also just about the length

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.160 
in width and also just about the length
just<00:01:06.009> under<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.369> length<00:01:06.700> of<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.360> plate<00:01:07.899> of

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
just under the length of the plate of

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.929 
just under the length of the plate of
the<00:01:08.409> straightening<00:01:09.130> iron<00:01:09.369> you're<00:01:09.610> going<00:01:09.790> to

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
the straightening iron you're going to

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.270 
the straightening iron you're going to
use<00:01:12.119> comb<00:01:13.119> the<00:01:13.390> hair<00:01:13.509> through<00:01:14.280> take

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
use comb the hair through take

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.350 
use comb the hair through take
straightening<00:01:15.759> iron<00:01:15.909> in<00:01:16.710> close<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:18.009> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
straightening iron in close it and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.840 
straightening iron in close it and
slightly<00:01:19.360> turn<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.520> take<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.640> all<00:01:21.729> the<00:01:21.759> way

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
slightly turn and take it all the way

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.469 
slightly turn and take it all the way
down<00:01:21.939> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.710> just<00:01:23.920> comb<00:01:24.280> that<00:01:24.549> through<00:01:27.479> as

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
down and then just comb that through as

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.450 
down and then just comb that through as
one<00:01:28.810> straightening<00:01:29.380> technique<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:30.340> other

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
one straightening technique the other

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.180 
one straightening technique the other
one<00:01:30.670> I'm<00:01:30.789> going<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:30.970> show<00:01:31.179> is<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.860> quite<00:01:33.159> a

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
one I'm going to show is that's quite a

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.389 
one I'm going to show is that's quite a
flat<00:01:33.729> straight<00:01:34.360> look<00:01:34.840> now<00:01:35.440> with<00:01:35.649> the<00:01:35.799> fringe<00:01:36.069> I

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
flat straight look now with the fringe I

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:37.800 
flat straight look now with the fringe I
don't<00:01:36.610> think<00:01:36.850> what<00:01:37.000> we<00:01:37.119> want<00:01:37.299> to<00:01:37.360> do<00:01:37.479> there<00:01:37.659> is

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
don't think what we want to do there is

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.389 
don't think what we want to do there is
just<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.170> little<00:01:38.350> bit<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.590> Bend<00:01:38.890> in<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:39.250> a

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
just have a little bit of Bend in it a

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.130 
just have a little bit of Bend in it a
little<00:01:39.789> bit<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.090> movement<00:01:40.299> in<00:01:40.569> it<00:01:40.720> rather<00:01:40.929> than

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
little bit of movement in it rather than

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.529 
little bit of movement in it rather than
it<00:01:41.289> being<00:01:41.409> just<00:01:42.190> completely<00:01:42.729> straight<00:01:43.360> and

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
it being just completely straight and

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.550 
it being just completely straight and
flat<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:45.720> take<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.840> section<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.289> hair<00:01:47.530> that

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
flat so take the section of hair that

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.350 
flat so take the section of hair that
you<00:01:47.830> that<00:01:48.069> you<00:01:48.130> want<00:01:48.429> as<00:01:48.580> much<00:01:48.789> for<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.090> fringe

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
you that you want as much for the fringe

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.090 
you that you want as much for the fringe
we<00:01:49.539> weren't<00:01:49.840> quite<00:01:49.959> a<00:01:50.049> substantial<00:01:50.289> fringe

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
we weren't quite a substantial fringe

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.399 
we weren't quite a substantial fringe
here<00:01:51.369> so<00:01:51.610> I've<00:01:51.850> taken<00:01:52.390> quite<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:52.780> bit<00:01:53.020> out<00:01:53.200> which

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
here so I've taken quite a bit out which

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.169 
here so I've taken quite a bit out which
I<00:01:53.560> sort<00:01:54.069> of<00:01:54.130> section<00:01:54.490> two<00:01:54.610> marked<00:01:54.970> out<00:01:55.149> a

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
I sort of section two marked out a

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.389 
I sort of section two marked out a
little<00:01:55.390> bit<00:01:55.539> earlier<00:01:55.929> they<00:01:56.500> can<00:01:56.799> because

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
little bit earlier they can because

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.520 
little bit earlier they can because
we're<00:01:57.549> not<00:01:57.670> trying<00:01:57.909> to<00:01:58.119> get<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.659> did<00:01:59.020> flat<00:01:59.350> and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
we're not trying to get it did flat and

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.139 
we're not trying to get it did flat and
dead<00:01:59.740> straight<00:02:00.130> right<00:02:00.490> the<00:02:00.670> way<00:02:00.789> through<00:02:00.819> the

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
dead straight right the way through the

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.120 
dead straight right the way through the
root<00:02:01.509> area<00:02:01.750> like<00:02:02.079> we<00:02:02.200> are<00:02:02.320> on<00:02:02.500> this<00:02:02.680> section

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
root area like we are on this section

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.959 
root area like we are on this section
here<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.960> is<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.520> different<00:02:06.520> technique<00:02:06.789> that

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
here this is a different technique that

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:08.639 
here this is a different technique that
you<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:07.240> use<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:07.780> just<00:02:08.049> still<00:02:08.229> comb<00:02:08.500> it

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649
