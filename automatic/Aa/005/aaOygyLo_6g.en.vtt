now I have a feeling that this is a

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.119 
now I have a feeling that this is a
reference<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.450> something<00:02:59.290> whether<00:02:59.889> it's<00:03:00.040> a

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
reference to something whether it's a

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.920 
reference to something whether it's a
movie<00:03:00.280> or<00:03:00.489> a<00:03:00.730> game<00:03:00.939> I<00:03:01.150> don't<00:03:01.239> even<00:03:01.419> know<00:03:01.599> but<00:03:01.629> as
