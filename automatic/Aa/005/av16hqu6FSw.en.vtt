explains how it all works i'm just going
to<00:01:12.150> demonstrate<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.870> so<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.560> squid<00:01:13.890> here

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
to demonstrate it so this squid here

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.390 
to demonstrate it so this squid here
will<00:01:15.360> spit<00:01:15.870> ink<00:01:16.140> at<00:01:16.320> me<00:01:16.440> if<00:01:16.680> I'm<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.250> water

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
will spit ink at me if I'm in the water

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460 
will spit ink at me if I'm in the water
with<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.630> means<00:01:18.870> that<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
with it which means that I get a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.330 
with it which means that I get a
blindness<00:01:20.280> effect<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.450> nausea

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
blindness effect and a bit of nausea

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.860 
blindness effect and a bit of nausea
until<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.370> leave<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.760> water<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.150> only<00:01:24.720> lasts

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
until I leave the water and only lasts

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.450 
until I leave the water and only lasts
for<00:01:24.990> little<00:01:25.229> time<00:01:25.440> but<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.920> very<00:01:26.070> clever

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
for little time but it's very clever

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.200 
for little time but it's very clever
because<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.500> next<00:01:29.190> to<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> squid<00:01:29.700> but

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
because I can be next to the squid but

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.740 
because I can be next to the squid but
out<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.750> water<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:32.150> you<00:01:33.150> know<00:01:33.240> it'll<00:01:33.690> only

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
out of the water or you know it'll only

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.330 
out of the water or you know it'll only
affect<00:01:34.110> me<00:01:34.200> if<00:01:34.290> I'm<00:01:34.380> near<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.620> squid<00:01:34.980> and<00:01:35.010> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
affect me if I'm near the squid and in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.490 
affect me if I'm near the squid and in
the<00:01:35.460> water<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.810> took<00:01:36.960> them<00:01:37.110> over<00:01:37.200> here

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
the water so you took them over here

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.680 
the water so you took them over here
because<00:01:38.370> you<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.760> squid<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.660> my

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690
