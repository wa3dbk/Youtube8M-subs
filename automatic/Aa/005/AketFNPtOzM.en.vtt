00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
the eyeliner and it will really set it

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
the eyeliner and it will really set it
and<00:02:10.759> make<00:02:10.910> sure<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.300> doesn't<00:02:11.480> go

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
and make sure that it doesn't go

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.650 
and make sure that it doesn't go
anywhere

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.150 

the<00:02:17.660> tricky<00:02:17.959> part<00:02:17.989> now<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.440> doing<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.769> detail

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
the tricky part now is doing the detail

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.559 
the tricky part now is doing the detail
so<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.400> want<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.640> take<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.970> eyeliner<00:02:20.330> and

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
so you want to take the eyeliner and

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.630 
so you want to take the eyeliner and
first<00:02:21.049> just<00:02:21.230> sketch<00:02:21.590> out<00:02:21.799> rough<00:02:22.040> sea<00:02:22.310> shapes

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
first just sketch out rough sea shapes

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.890 
first just sketch out rough sea shapes
which<00:02:22.910> connect<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.480> line<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.780> you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
which connect to the line that you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.229 
which connect to the line that you
previously<00:02:24.440> drew<00:02:24.790> you're<00:02:25.790> going<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:25.970> start

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
previously drew you're going to start

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.000 
previously drew you're going to start
out<00:02:26.480> with<00:02:26.540> them<00:02:26.959> larger<00:02:27.319> on<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.470> outer<00:02:27.650> corner

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
out with them larger on the outer corner

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.830 
out with them larger on the outer corner
and<00:02:28.129> slowly<00:02:28.459> getting<00:02:28.849> smaller<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.510> smaller

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
and slowly getting smaller and smaller

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.820 
and slowly getting smaller and smaller
as<00:02:29.989> we<00:02:30.200> get<00:02:30.349> further<00:02:30.620> into<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:31.010> inner<00:02:31.160> corner

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
as we get further into the inner corner

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.259 
as we get further into the inner corner
once<00:02:33.830> you<00:02:33.980> sketched<00:02:34.280> out<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.580> shape<00:02:34.790> go<00:02:35.000> over

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
once you sketched out the shape go over

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.460 
once you sketched out the shape go over
it<00:02:35.360> again<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.630> make<00:02:35.900> sure<00:02:36.049> that<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.290> lines

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
it again and make sure that the lines

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.559 
it again and make sure that the lines
are<00:02:36.620> really<00:02:36.739> visible<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.730> now<00:02:38.150> for<00:02:38.329> the<00:02:38.390> lower

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
are really visible and now for the lower

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.690 
are really visible and now for the lower
outer<00:02:38.750> corner<00:02:39.260> we're<00:02:39.410> going<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.620> start<00:02:39.980> with

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
outer corner we're going to start with

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.180 
outer corner we're going to start with
the<00:02:40.790> largest<00:02:41.239> circle<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:42.620> then<00:02:42.709> getting<00:02:42.980> into

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
the largest circle and then getting into

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.520 
the largest circle and then getting into
a<00:02:43.250> medium-sized<00:02:43.880> C<00:02:44.299> shape<00:02:44.569> and<00:02:44.989> finally

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
a medium-sized C shape and finally

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.680 
a medium-sized C shape and finally
stopping<00:02:45.860> on<00:02:46.220> a<00:02:46.280> really<00:02:46.610> small<00:02:46.790> C<00:02:47.180> shape<00:02:47.450> and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690

finish<00:02:48.530> off<00:02:48.739> we're<00:02:49.040> going<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.250> do<00:02:49.400> three<00:02:49.670> dots

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
finish off we're going to do three dots

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:59.860 
finish off we're going to do three dots
going<00:02:50.660> from<00:02:50.959> larger<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.920> medium<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.640> small

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.600

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
now on the three larger Alta sees we're

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.220 
now on the three larger Alta sees we're
going<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.790> start<00:03:03.030> doing<00:03:03.239> smaller<00:03:03.599> seas<00:03:03.900> just

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
going to start doing smaller seas just

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.800 
going to start doing smaller seas just
lining<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.980> line<00:03:05.159> and<00:03:05.430> then<00:03:06.390> which<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.540> going

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
lining the line and then which is going

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.599 
lining the line and then which is going
to<00:03:06.900> do<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.049> series<00:03:07.439> of<00:03:07.469> Criss<00:03:07.769> crosses<00:03:08.219> just<00:03:08.459> to

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
to do a series of Criss crosses just to

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:17.759 
to do a series of Criss crosses just to
fill<00:03:08.849> it<00:03:08.939> in

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769

now<00:03:18.769> for<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.010> rest<00:03:19.189> of<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.430> see<00:03:19.610> shapes

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
now for the rest of the see shapes

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.309 
now for the rest of the see shapes
you're<00:03:20.120> just<00:03:20.299> going<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.480> do<00:03:20.659> Criss<00:03:20.900> crosses

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
you're just going to do Criss crosses

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.559 
you're just going to do Criss crosses
such<00:03:21.739> as<00:03:21.950> draw<00:03:22.159> a<00:03:22.189> series<00:03:22.579> of<00:03:22.730> lines<00:03:23.000> going

right and you're just going to keep
doing<00:03:27.319> this<00:03:27.470> all<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:27.860> way<00:03:27.980> end<00:03:28.220> in<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.579> corner

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.539 

now<00:03:39.500> for<00:03:39.739> around<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.040> design<00:03:40.340> you're<00:03:40.519> going

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
now for around the design you're going

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.490 
now for around the design you're going
to<00:03:40.730> draw<00:03:40.849> dots<00:03:41.180> just<00:03:41.510> in<00:03:41.690> between<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.079> dips<00:03:42.319> in

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
to draw dots just in between the dips in

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.099 
to draw dots just in between the dips in
between<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:42.890> see<00:03:43.069> shapes<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:44.299> then<00:03:44.840> over

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
between the see shapes and then over

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.420 
between the see shapes and then over
this<00:03:45.260> you're<00:03:45.470> going<00:03:45.650> to<00:03:45.739> take<00:03:45.890> some<00:03:45.920> lash<00:03:46.220> glue

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
this you're going to take some lash glue

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.360 
this you're going to take some lash glue
going<00:03:47.090> to<00:03:47.209> apply<00:03:47.450> this<00:03:47.510> over<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.079> dots<00:03:48.370> and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
going to apply this over the dots and

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.770 
going to apply this over the dots and
once<00:03:49.549> it<00:03:49.670> gets<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.909> little<00:03:50.030> bit<00:03:50.269> tacky<00:03:50.540> you're

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
once it gets a little bit tacky you're

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.479 
once it gets a little bit tacky you're
going<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.049> apply<00:03:51.230> rhinestones<00:03:51.500> on<00:03:52.069> top<00:03:52.310> and

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
going to apply rhinestones on top and

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.130 
going to apply rhinestones on top and
you<00:03:52.760> know<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:53.000> lash<00:03:53.150> glue<00:03:53.329> is<00:03:53.480> tacky<00:03:53.690> once<00:03:54.019> it

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
you know the lash glue is tacky once it

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.539 
you know the lash glue is tacky once it
starts<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.500> go<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.620> bit<00:03:54.799> of<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:54.950> light<00:03:55.250> bluish

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
starts to go a bit of a light bluish

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:02.259 
starts to go a bit of a light bluish
color<00:03:58.239> freedom<00:04:00.129> I<00:04:01.129> finished<00:04:01.849> off<00:04:01.970> by<00:04:02.150> applying

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
color freedom I finished off by applying

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.970 
color freedom I finished off by applying
individual<00:04:02.930> lashes<00:04:03.139> on<00:04:03.440> the<00:04:03.530> upper<00:04:03.650> lid<00:04:03.859> of
