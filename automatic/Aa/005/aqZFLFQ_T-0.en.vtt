00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.610 

okay<00:00:02.550> um

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:05.620 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.610 

yeah<00:00:06.220> so<00:00:06.880> this<00:00:07.149> is<00:00:07.210> a<00:00:07.330> basement<00:00:07.960> mesh<00:00:08.469> and

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
yeah so this is a basement mesh and

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.040 
yeah so this is a basement mesh and
this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> more<00:00:11.730> at<00:00:12.180> the<00:00:12.719> morning

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.050 
this is the more at the morning

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.199 
this is the more at the morning
I'm<00:00:14.560> just<00:00:14.740> going<00:00:15.040> to<00:00:15.070> bring<00:00:15.250> this<00:00:15.460> over<00:00:15.640> to<00:00:15.970> lay

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
I'm just going to bring this over to lay

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.680 
I'm just going to bring this over to lay
up

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
up

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.150 
up
so<00:00:18.380> here<00:00:18.620> we<00:00:18.770> have<00:00:18.800> it<00:00:18.980> in<00:00:19.070> layout

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
so here we have it in layout

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.850 
so here we have it in layout
and<00:00:21.310> I'll<00:00:21.700> go<00:00:22.510> to<00:00:22.570> object<00:00:22.960> properties<00:00:23.590> and

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
and I'll go to object properties and

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.150 
and I'll go to object properties and
a<00:00:24.920> displacement<00:00:26.350> normal<00:00:27.350> displacement

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.930 

keep<00:00:30.789> the<00:00:31.060> set<00:00:31.420> one<00:00:32.050> but<00:00:32.800> will<00:00:32.980> change<00:00:33.310> normals

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
keep the set one but will change normals

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.370 
keep the set one but will change normals
to<00:00:34.300> morph<00:00:35.170> them<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:36.190> select<00:00:36.760> the<00:00:37.030> more<00:00:37.330> here

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
to morph them and select the more here

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.700 
to morph them and select the more here
with<00:00:39.830> the<00:00:39.950> texture<00:00:40.310> and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
with the texture and

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.380 
with the texture and
and<00:00:41.829> for<00:00:42.309> example<00:00:42.450> juice'

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
and for example juice'

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.650 
and for example juice'
a<00:00:44.480> procedural<00:00:45.579> texture

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.920 

and<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.410> can<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:51.090> mesh<00:00:51.750> is

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
and here you can see that the mesh is

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.060 
and here you can see that the mesh is
being<00:00:52.800> moved<00:00:54.050> based<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.559> black<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.890> white

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
being moved based on the black and white

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.470 
being moved based on the black and white
so<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:58.040> main<00:00:59.040> mesh<00:00:59.340> here

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
so the main mesh here

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.240 
so the main mesh here
tries<00:01:02.230> to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.540 

gradually<00:01:07.250> transform<00:01:08.120> into<00:01:08.420> the<00:01:08.630> NMR<00:01:09.550> based

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
gradually transform into the NMR based

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.420 
gradually transform into the NMR based
on<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.790> black<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.150> white

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.590 

so<00:01:16.590> same<00:01:17.590> thing<00:01:17.620> just<00:01:18.450> some<00:01:19.450> preset<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.170> mean

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.899 

so<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:24.040> course<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.490> can

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
so of course you can

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.550 
so of course you can
animate<00:01:26.719> this<00:01:26.869> over<00:01:27.200> time

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.050 

just<00:01:30.280> change<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:31.439> resemble<00:01:32.439> exposition

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.850 

what<00:01:38.659> uh

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.480 

well<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:42.030> basics<00:01:42.660> you<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.490> you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
well this is just basics you know so you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.630 
well this is just basics you know so you
can<00:01:44.670> use<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.360> for<00:01:46.250> you<00:01:47.250> can<00:01:47.400> for<00:01:47.550> example

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
can use this for you can for example

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.080 
can use this for you can for example
makeup<00:01:48.380> like<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.590> white<00:01:49.770> video<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.790> map<00:01:51.060> it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
makeup like in a white video and map it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.780 
makeup like in a white video and map it
to<00:01:51.300> your<00:01:51.510> object<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.880> transform<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:55.790> base

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to your object and transform the base

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.200 
to your object and transform the base
mesh<00:01:57.800> based<00:01:58.800> on<00:01:59.040> that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
mesh based on that

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.170 
mesh based on that
so<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.110> lot<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.440> things<00:02:01.650> you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.640> also

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
so a lot of things you can do and also

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.510 
so a lot of things you can do and also
of<00:02:03.600> course<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.080> can<00:02:04.260> tie<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:06.260> open<00:02:07.260> here<00:02:07.789> to

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
of course you can tie this open here to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.460 
of course you can tie this open here to
where<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.640> can't<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.970> cyclist<00:02:12.930> to

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
where you can't I cyclist to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.790 
where you can't I cyclist to
to<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.190> movement<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:17.110> could<00:02:17.410> make<00:02:17.620> it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
to this movement so you could make it

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.800 
to this movement so you could make it
cycle<00:02:18.340> whenever<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:19.240> special<00:02:19.990> movement

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
cycle whenever a special movement

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.460 
cycle whenever a special movement
on<00:02:22.380> for<00:02:22.709> example<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:23.160> robot<00:02:23.520> Hoodie<00:02:23.670> this<00:02:24.470> is

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
on for example a robot Hoodie this is

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.950 
on for example a robot Hoodie this is
being<00:02:25.770> done

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.660 

so<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:29.310> make<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.210> pretty<00:02:30.450> cool<00:02:30.600> stuff
