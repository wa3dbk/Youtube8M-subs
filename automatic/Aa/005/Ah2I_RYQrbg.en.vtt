normally do is I just save it with a
transparent<00:01:38.460> background<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.570> would

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
transparent background and then I would

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.690 
transparent background and then I would

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
drag it into GIMP and then I would just

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
drag it into GIMP and then I would just
cut<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:42.689> place<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.680> that's

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
cut it out and then place it so that's
