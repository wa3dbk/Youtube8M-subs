clock there just on the right side of
your<00:03:17.720> screen<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:18.200> at<00:03:18.319> 6am<00:03:18.829> so<00:03:19.010> that's<00:03:19.340> really

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
your screen is at 6am so that's really

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.550 
your screen is at 6am so that's really
for<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.790> period<00:03:20.150> from<00:03:20.269> midnight<00:03:20.719> through<00:03:21.290> six

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
for the period from midnight through six

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.470 
for the period from midnight through six
a.m.<00:03:21.889> so<00:03:22.099> two<00:03:22.159> areas<00:03:22.639> to<00:03:22.790> watch<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.269> area

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
a.m. so two areas to watch the area

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.080 
a.m. so two areas to watch the area
along<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.810> warm<00:03:24.200> front<00:03:24.439> and<00:03:24.709> also<00:03:25.670> along<00:03:25.790> the

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
along the warm front and also along the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.179 
along the warm front and also along the
cold<00:03:26.389> cold<00:03:26.569> front<00:03:27.139> both<00:03:27.319> will<00:03:27.560> be<00:03:27.590> capable<00:03:28.069> of

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
cold cold front both will be capable of

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:29.949 
cold cold front both will be capable of
rotating<00:03:28.400> storms<00:03:29.090> but<00:03:29.239> also<00:03:29.419> going<00:03:29.659> to<00:03:29.750> watch

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
rotating storms but also going to watch

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.619 
rotating storms but also going to watch
for<00:03:30.470> some<00:03:30.680> areas<00:03:31.069> out<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.700> south<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.299> that

warm front in the warm sector the

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.679 
warm front in the warm sector the
atmosphere<00:03:34.489> is<00:03:34.579> not<00:03:34.730> very<00:03:35.000> heavily<00:03:35.299> capped

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689

in<00:03:37.849> the<00:03:37.939> warm<00:03:38.150> sector<00:03:38.359> will<00:03:38.959> have<00:03:39.109> the<00:03:39.230> ability

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
in the warm sector will have the ability

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.170 
in the warm sector will have the ability
to<00:03:39.620> rotate<00:03:39.859> as<00:03:40.250> well<00:03:40.430> here's<00:03:40.970> what<00:03:41.090> I'm

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
to rotate as well here's what I'm

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.699 
to rotate as well here's what I'm
talking<00:03:41.510> about<00:03:41.689> in<00:03:41.780> terms<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:42.139> sheer<00:03:42.349> this<00:03:42.590> is

night into early Thursday morning so

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.379 
night into early Thursday morning so
when<00:04:18.409> you<00:04:18.500> couple<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:19.039> high<00:04:19.220> rotation<00:04:19.909> the

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
when you couple the high rotation the

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.270 
when you couple the high rotation the
fairly<00:04:20.810> impressive<00:04:21.169> instability<00:04:21.979> even<00:04:22.190> if

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
fairly impressive instability even if

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.950 
fairly impressive instability even if
the<00:04:22.400> models<00:04:22.729> are<00:04:22.820> overdoing<00:04:23.449> it<00:04:23.630> just<00:04:23.870> a

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
the models are overdoing it just a

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.330 
the models are overdoing it just a
little<00:04:23.990> bit<00:04:24.199> there's<00:04:24.680> enough<00:04:24.979> instability

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
little bit there's enough instability

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.270 
little bit there's enough instability
there<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:26.780> be<00:04:26.930> concerned<00:04:27.320> about<00:04:27.470> significant

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
there to be concerned about significant
