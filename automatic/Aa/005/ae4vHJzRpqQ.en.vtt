00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.740
 double murder presentation in the first place 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.280
 I'm in the video about the jeep 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.080
 wrangler 3.6 liters v6 very good 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.059
 jeep wrangler has brought with a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.890
 great machine perfect for smaller 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.390
 transports with trailers to buy 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.400
 our x 190 ps gasoline for the daily 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.470
 mails registration office funny 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.359
 versailler at the mileage of 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.449
 second modern representation of the viz 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.550
 A combination is these pendants 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.780
 There are times on the flat and there are 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.920
 with which the fund has why he always 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.829
 no matter 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.370
 and just for fun, let's just now 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.960
 Just buy it I can find it now 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.030
 relative insight may think that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.420
 professional hopper and now friend now 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 primarily only new items in the jeep of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.980
 fog lights we now 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.539
 I have liked that for you 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.650
 example extremely good 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.630
 we blinker we were flashes 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.080
 system via blinker right that is the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.170
 on the dance 23 button we have and that is 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.189
 the greatest barge unnecessary 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.119
 shop windows at nix going on in vienna often 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.979
 before once 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.500
 visually charts what are we going to do 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.929
 really visually pretty good out there 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.840
 there will be nothing to complain about 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:35.420
 or do not complain and we 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.140
 do not taste great there now 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.719
 We do not even look for it 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.399
 as she does with the in 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.310
 combination of course with the trailer 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.179
 because that is almost yes that is 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:55.810
 that's what they actually wanted 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:58.369
 I actually am every one of them 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.989
 we'll think twice before that 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.299
 has tested I must say in all honesty 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:05.989
 There you have to get off that one bwk the 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.509
 okay now hammas enabled with tata 

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:10.039
 Sticks and that's what we want now 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.239
 for the professional hop and then you try 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.310
 to transport him 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.930
 Of course , it is different now 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.720
 she does not go that far 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:25.540
 you can safely change remove xe 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:28.160
 get in boarding 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.680
 cool build the fence almost as always 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.310
 Many customers would have to say if it was 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.150
 that was more than bad maybe 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.750
 you might see a near 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.329
 do 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:42.970
 but we still try it okay 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.120
 Well then we have it like that 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.319
 the issue here namely partie quite well 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.709
 only thing now yard and where it now 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.299
 how should that work? 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.760
 It would be cool that everything works 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.000
 with the village 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:05.310
 apparently the pz is from the 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.830
 wide out yet 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.190
 shit button that yes okay that was 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.930
 luck gave it to good luck, tried 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:21.660
 then hd is then we want of course 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:24.810
 Only the TV and I think that 's it 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.580
 try to lock that now with 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.800
 the button r us is locked now 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.769
 not really happy and we are 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:37.560
 But now formally drive only then 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.120
 interesting but no gold flashing 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.110
 is not with chains but this is 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.480
 now really raining now before 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.910
 first decide spontaneously how 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.319
 quickly so forth being so annually 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.310
 claim that the fast 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.480
 just have to go ausschauen only good 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.310
 and now , for example, we say already 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.849
 where you want to go here we saw 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:05.160
 exactly on this piece of grass the area 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:06.290
 heard and then brakes was really nice too 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.299
 see 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.950
 stink now what if it works 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.630
 because we forgot that, so to speak 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.820
 to lock up the burden again that is 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.010
 very horny now we have a sport and 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.430
 Here you can see the Upper Franconia without 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.150
 problems and we see that 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.830
 works so good luck 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.930
 that works that way and how to do it 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.210
 now honest friends what is there 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.070
 So with a jeep wrangler for more 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.410
 to drive 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.860
 that's really cool for 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:39.110
 missions, for example, and others 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.910
 smaller yards it is sure quality 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.920
 friends the links at their description 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.530
 important to note is maybe still 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.720
 that you have to pack in the jeep wrangler 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.460
 we do not work and I say 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.230
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.230
 next show bye bye
