it turned out that to make it work all I
had<00:00:38.130> to<00:00:38.160> do<00:00:38.370> was<00:00:38.579> open<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.180> slider<00:00:39.719> because

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
had to do was open the slider because

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
had to do was open the slider because
what<00:00:40.800> had<00:00:40.920> happened<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
what had happened was that the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.180 
what had happened was that the
connections<00:00:42.540> on<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> inside<00:00:43.260> stop

that<00:01:38.819> the<00:01:38.939> headphone<00:01:39.329> jack<00:01:39.359> might<00:01:39.990> be

that the headphone jack might be

it<00:01:54.420> will<00:01:54.689> detect<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.560> thing<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it will detect it but the thing that I

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.019 
it will detect it but the thing that I
find<00:01:56.219> them<00:01:56.429> is<00:01:56.549> easiest<00:01:56.849> was<00:01:57.599> take<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.409> q-tip

00:01:59.019 --> 00:01:59.029 
find them is easiest was take a q-tip

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:01.969 
find them is easiest was take a q-tip

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
cut off the end that has the buzz that
you<00:02:02.039> can<00:02:02.249> stick<00:02:02.459> just<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.849> q-tip<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.420> push<00:02:04.109> it

you can stick just the q-tip in push it

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.879 
you can stick just the q-tip in push it
down<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.709> it<00:02:05.130> will<00:02:05.389> clear<00:02:06.389> the<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.439> mic<00:02:07.679> and

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:07.889 
down and it will clear the the mic and

down and it will clear the the mic and
if<00:02:08.220> that's<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> case<00:02:08.819> what<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.450> happen<00:02:09.810> is

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
if that's the case what will happen is

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.809 
if that's the case what will happen is
your<00:02:10.170> phone<00:02:10.500> will<00:02:10.770> switch<00:02:11.039> from<00:02:11.069> making

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
your phone will switch from making

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.510 
your phone will switch from making
sounds<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.540> not<00:02:13.319> making<00:02:13.740> sounds<00:02:14.130> because<00:02:14.400> it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
sounds to not making sounds because it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.190 
sounds to not making sounds because it
will<00:02:14.640> detect<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.180> little<00:02:15.510> spring<00:02:15.870> that's<00:02:16.020> in

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
will detect the little spring that's in

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.540 
will detect the little spring that's in
there<00:02:16.380> that<00:02:16.530> detects<00:02:16.860> whether<00:02:17.310> or<00:02:17.490> not

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
there that detects whether or not

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.220 
there that detects whether or not
something<00:02:17.819> is<00:02:17.940> plugged<00:02:18.209> in<00:02:18.390> has<00:02:18.630> been

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
triggered and so that's a very easy way

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.830 
triggered and so that's a very easy way
to<00:02:21.049> to<00:02:22.049> do<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.459> so<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.450> are<00:02:24.540> having<00:02:24.750> trouble

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
that it doesn't close all the way and

that it doesn't close all the way and
that<00:02:38.250> magically<00:02:39.030> made<00:02:39.209> mine<00:02:39.450> work<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.020> like<00:02:40.740> I

that magically made mine work and like I
said<00:02:40.980> I'll<00:02:41.220> go<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.790> sprint<00:02:42.060> store

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.750 
said I'll go to the sprint store
tomorrow<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.290> see<00:02:43.800> what<00:02:44.100> they<00:02:44.250> can<00:02:44.310> fix<00:02:44.610> it

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
tomorrow and see what they can fix it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.090 
tomorrow and see what they can fix it
for<00:02:45.260> supposedly<00:02:46.260> because<00:02:46.530> i<00:02:46.739> have<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.890> total

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
for supposedly because i have a total

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.030 
for supposedly because i have a total
protection<00:02:47.340> plan<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.120> ought<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.330> be<00:02:48.420> free<00:02:49.040> I'm

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
protection plan it ought to be free I'm

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.030 
protection plan it ought to be free I'm
it<00:02:51.000> may<00:02:51.270> be<00:02:51.380> $35<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.500> think<00:02:52.680> that's<00:02:52.800> what<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.980> is

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
it may be $35 I think that's what it is

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.380 
it may be $35 I think that's what it is
if<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.310> don't<00:02:53.459> have<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.790> protection<00:02:54.239> plan

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
if you don't have the protection plan

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.720 
if you don't have the protection plan
and<00:02:54.780> we'll<00:02:55.319> see<00:02:55.440> how<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.590> goes<00:02:55.730> especially

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
and we'll see how it goes especially

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.900 
and we'll see how it goes especially
since<00:02:56.910> i'm<00:02:57.209> running<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:58.430> alternate<00:02:59.430> firmware

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
since i'm running a alternate firmware

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.570 
since i'm running a alternate firmware
and<00:03:00.180> I've<00:03:00.630> got<00:03:00.900> my<00:03:01.170> thick<00:03:01.769> battery<00:03:02.280> pack

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
and I've got my thick battery pack

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.910 
and I've got my thick battery pack
attached<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.200> we'll<00:03:04.410> see<00:03:04.560> whether<00:03:04.739> or

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
attached to it so we'll see whether or

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.280 
attached to it so we'll see whether or
not<00:03:04.980> they<00:03:05.190> seem<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.489> think<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.880> that

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
not they seem to think that that

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.360 
not they seem to think that that
violates<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.470> warranty<00:03:07.860> even<00:03:08.130> though<00:03:08.220> it's

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
violates the warranty even though it's

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.000 
violates the warranty even though it's
clearly<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:09.019> hardware<00:03:10.019> issue<00:03:10.050> not<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.530> software

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
clearly a hardware issue not a software

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.130 
clearly a hardware issue not a software
issue
