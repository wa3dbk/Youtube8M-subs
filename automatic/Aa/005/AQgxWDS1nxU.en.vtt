Telegraph from that was way too fast to
switch<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.780> Chrome<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.430> but<00:01:06.439> what

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
switch to Chrome I not really but what

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.280 
switch to Chrome I not really but what
the<00:01:07.560> hell<00:01:07.710> she's<00:01:07.979> doing<00:01:08.930> is<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> same

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the hell she's doing is it the same

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.450 
the hell she's doing is it the same
person<00:01:10.939> think<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.150> yeah<00:01:14.090> no<00:01:15.090> snow<00:01:15.450> getting

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
person think so yeah no snow getting

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.330 
person think so yeah no snow getting
sitting<00:01:17.460> screen<00:01:17.970> rate<00:01:18.299> why<00:01:18.810> she<00:01:18.869> recording

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.719 

just<00:01:23.340> wait<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.759> see<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.000> she<00:01:24.119> does

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
just wait to see what she does

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.730 
just wait to see what she does
guess<00:01:26.729> if<00:01:26.970> she<00:01:27.240> said<00:01:27.570> she<00:01:27.990> will<00:01:28.110> drop<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.710> me

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
guess if she said she will drop for me

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.649 
guess if she said she will drop for me
so<00:01:29.250> apparently<00:01:30.119> was<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> wild<00:01:32.210> I'm<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.570> in

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
you see it 20 mil cash see what I think

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.119 
you see it 20 mil cash see what I think
is<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.750> he<00:02:10.110> told<00:02:10.319> me<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> different<00:02:10.860> sport

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
is that he told me a different sport

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.059 
is that he told me a different sport
like<00:02:11.370> here<00:02:11.760> and

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
like here and

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.860 
like here and
she<00:02:13.640> drops<00:02:13.909> it<00:02:14.090> here<00:02:14.540> I'll<00:02:15.200> run<00:02:16.129> Elle<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.870> well
