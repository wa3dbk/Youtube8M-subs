the five with a line on top make a curve

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.900 
the five with a line on top make a curve
then<00:01:16.010> make<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.729> loop<00:01:17.290> there<00:01:18.290> are<00:01:18.590> no<00:01:18.979> tricks<00:01:19.460> to

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
then make a loop there are no tricks to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:27.750 
then make a loop there are no tricks to
make<00:01:20.180> us<00:01:20.479> sick

that's<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:33.080> way<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.350> make<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:33.950> seven<00:01:36.820> make<00:01:37.820> an<00:01:38.180> S

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
that's the way to make a seven make an S

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.660 
that's the way to make a seven make an S
and<00:01:39.290> then<00:01:39.920> don't<00:01:40.340> wait<00:01:40.820> go<00:01:41.570> up<00:01:41.869> again<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:43.280> make

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
and then don't wait go up again to make

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:56.760 
and then don't wait go up again to make
an<00:01:43.940> eight<00:01:52.420> make<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.810> loop<00:01:54.410> and<00:01:54.710> then<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:56.030> line

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
an eight make a loop and then a line

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.820 
an eight make a loop and then a line
that's<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:58.220> way<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.520> make<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.149> nine<00:02:02.020> make<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.320> one

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
that's the way to make a nine make a one

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.219 
that's the way to make a nine make a one
and<00:02:04.340> then<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:05.869> zero<00:02:07.000> that's<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.360> end<00:02:08.720> with

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
and then a zero that's the end with

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.270 
and then a zero that's the end with
number<00:02:09.740> ten

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.460
