00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.040
 hey people of everyday aspects 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.960
 and welcome back to 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.370
 weekly gaming and tech now true 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440
 I 'm going to talk about the most important 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.840
 gaming and tech news from the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.219
 last week and today i have 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.929
 of course some nice news 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.060
 picked out but I thought I'd go for it 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.650
 start very briefly about what you are up to 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.320
 see the background because there is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.080
 no culture that no battlefield 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.269
 it is a game that you can steam 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.039
 get through early access and that means 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.900
 acted and game is that to alpha phase 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.790
 and that is why there is still a lot 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.040
 functions but it is a lot of fun 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.329
 play games verdick its name is 10 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.790
 but in she can't even 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.950
 look up and miss just a lot 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.800
 functions like I said because he has one 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.989
 early access is still in alpha and 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.129
 yes i just see a lot of potential 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.390
 this game 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.340
 what developers say they are all 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
 go back to it of course 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.379
 it remains to be seen whether that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 all yes by making one true 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.960
 but the sessions for a lot 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.920
 potential and I really like it 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.329
 to play 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.370
 so definitely check it out as the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.229
 gameplay already seems fun 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.689
 and then I want to talk about the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.939
 news that I have selected and the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.970
 first is about the xbox one 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.100
 as all know the playstation 3 and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.110
 the xbox 360 that have no backwards 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.000
 compatibility and that simply means 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.070
 that you have no games on your playstation 3 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.580
 of the plays u2 can play and on the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.409
 xbox 360 not from an xbox one and that 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.890
 is going to be exactly the same with the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.420
 playstation 4 and the xbox one 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 I mean tears with the xbox one that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.530
 very first xbox for the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.110
 clarity and playstation 4 and xbox 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.600
 one who initially have none 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.100
 backwards compatibility alone 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.210
 of course, there are opportunities to get one 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.009
 bit to work around 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.170
 what so already announced for the 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.210
 Playstation 4 is that they are streaming 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.790
 allowing service guy to use carr 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.829
 you have playstation 3 games can 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.780
 play on your playstation 4 but you do 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.329
 so no disk in your playstation then it 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.009
 all goes through the cloud is the game 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.329
 actually runs on a sony server 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.430
 that is then sent to your playstation 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.630
 4 streamed and therefore you can 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.280
 old playstation 3 games on you 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.530
 play playstation 4 if you can 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.000
 like 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.229
 at the s food bank is such a species 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.150
 equal 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.980
 similar method yet 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.819
 announced microsoft 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.530
 only the senior director of microsoft 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.900
 already live in an interview 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.900
 says something very nice about it and that is 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.239
 that it is ever possible to use xbox 360 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.099
 stream games to the xbox one 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.840
 so the function is n't it yet 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.269
 announced it is also not yet 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.160
 officially that function arrives the he 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.220
 just said that that functionality is there 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.129
 Well chance come in the future because that 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.720
 so is possible through the cloud that 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.480
 Microsoft has in their possession all the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.280
 ten thousands of servers that they have 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.739
 so who knows is going to come in the future 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.470
 who does not know but it is possible in everyone 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.150
 case via the cloud is now on 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.859
 marx or as he said around 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.840
 investigate how much and what costs 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.819
 experience is for the consumer 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.590
 and that actually meant case or them 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.780
 is cost effective for microsoft to do or 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.849
 no more than one on minute about the xbox one 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.290
 is finally released by releaseate too 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.010
 we in the Netherlands have the relatively few 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.920
 to 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.739
 but Marcus or Fiat for a long time the release 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.359
 time of the xbox one not told and that 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.849
 is now known for europe he appears 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.290
 namely here on November 22 in countries 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.819
 including england france and 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.359
 Germany to apply in Netherlands 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.700
 2014 out is not yet known when 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.260
 marley val we get 2 free 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.549
 games when it comes out 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.870
 the netherlands and if you are my advanced and 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.639
 the influence of the strand are still 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.769
 November that is in America and weeks 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:41.160
 later because in America there will be places you 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.730
 out on November 15 and in Europe on 29 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.609
 November 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.709
 So he comes to Europe a week later 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.419
 off unless of course you talk about it 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.040
 Netherlands but that is really super 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.260
 annoying to say all the time though 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.239
 the exception is of course the Netherlands 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.680
 weather 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.299
 then the third news is about 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.709
 battlefield 4 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.060
 everyone looks and philips out 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.750
 and of course everyone is very bad 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.579
 overdone 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.680
 but very many people look forward to 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.290
 battlefield 4 and that is of course 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.549
 fully justified too 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.430
 just a bit of a problem as with 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:14.030
 the bed in the multiplayer was you 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.320
 vehicles you have tanks you have 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.500
 jeeps you have the butter you have 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.419
 planes you have helicopters 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.410
 only there is no tutorial for new 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.350
 players 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.330
 to learn how to handle those vehicles and 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.670
 therefore you often had multiplayer 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.620
 and that with incredible noobs 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.420
 for example, was in a helicopter and 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.430
 because of that you almost went 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.740
 always open what would not, for example 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.210
 come on fly or his picked up the former bag 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.620
 from if they were able to make it there 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.210
 you didn't get any kills there of course 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.490
 can be shot 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.290
 that fills 4 which is going to be a separate tutorial 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.570
 for driving vehicles 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.360
 and that turk for beginners is beautiful 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.830
 to master yes yes the vehicles 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.540
 to get what a little so good 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.000
 things of a certain vehicle are what 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.680
 are less good things and yes 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.970
 you must have driven it of course that is 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.620
 very logical 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.540
 but yes this is of course for new 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.760
 people very nice example to 4 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.710
 because this fills 4 you are undoubtedly going 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.000
 sell more because a lot of 3 so there can 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.160
 many new players 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.710
 I think and for them that is natural 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.660
 very easy if that's in it 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.990
 and then I want it for the latest news 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.510
 have gta 5 and everyone knows 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.800
 him going to become super violence 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.170
 all goes 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.270
 sales records are likely to break and 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.650
 the is today quite a nice news 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.420
 actually came out that goes 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.070
 namely about the voice of gangsters 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.860
 gta 5 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.470
 Normally with a video game the 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.150
 characters in that give of course 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.350
 narrated by normal actors who have a 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.560
 get text for viewing 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.960
 and then you are very dependent on 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.990
 how those actors can empathize with it 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.060
 character and in the situation that he is 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.830
 should actually imagine in his head 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.960
 because it is not actually self-explanatory 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.700
 plays and therefore the voice acting 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.680
 in a certain spirit, it is quite annoying 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.510
 its because the actors just make you whole 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.000
 difficult to live in or for example 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.970
 just very boring that text is ahead 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.430
 reading without really an experience board 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.590
 to give and where gta 5 runs of course 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.570
 to gangsters and rockstar 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.040
 Made them find gangsters or the 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.880
 game members or the gang members how you do it 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.460
 want to mention 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.740
 that they have real game members for that 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.020
 hired to hire those votes 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.000
 of course just epically facking that 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.890
 really a game members who ingame texts 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.200
 just yes 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.550
 speak as if it's really him 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.950
 badly explained to me I know 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.350
 but that you are a super epic and will be there 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.540
 really make you feel more 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.220
 that you are really with 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.380
 deals with members instead of actors 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.990
 who spoke the normal without 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.220
 experience to add but level 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.570
 This was the gaming it really news for 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.430
 this week i hope you like it 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.510
 found signal that green thumbs up 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.040
 behind and then I see you next 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.740
 week again 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.670
 Thursday 7 pm thank you so much for watching 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.670
 next time or later
