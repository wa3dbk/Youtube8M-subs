00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
going to show you the Tesla coil hi guys

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.620 
going to show you the Tesla coil hi guys
yes<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.990> that's<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> teleporter<00:00:11.450> so<00:00:12.450> what

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
yes and that's the teleporter so what

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.490 
yes and that's the teleporter so what
we're<00:00:12.750> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.900> do<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.200> we're<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.440> show

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
we're going to do is we're going to show

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.939 
we're going to do is we're going to show
you<00:00:13.679> how<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> actually<00:00:14.960> making<00:00:15.960> use<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.560> Tesla

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you how to actually making use the Tesla

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.019 
you how to actually making use the Tesla
coil<00:00:18.260> these<00:00:19.260> are<00:00:19.590> kind<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.460> defensive

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
coil these are kind of a defensive

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.210 
coil these are kind of a defensive
device<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:22.109> will<00:00:22.260> actually<00:00:22.560> call<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.920> by<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
device and will actually call you by the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.470 
device and will actually call you by the
way<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:24.500> make<00:00:25.500> sure<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:26.279> at<00:00:26.490> least<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
way so just make sure I'm at least the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.859 
way so just make sure I'm at least the
road<00:00:27.630> distance<00:00:28.050> away<00:00:29.330> okay<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.750> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
road distance away okay so it is the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.280 
road distance away okay so it is the
coil<00:00:31.579> first<00:00:32.579> off<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.059> needs<00:00:33.210> before<00:00:34.200> its

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
coil first off it needs before its

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.470 
coil first off it needs before its
release<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.950> charge<00:00:35.190> five<00:00:35.820> thousand<00:00:36.360> a-year

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
release to charge five thousand a-year

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.889 
release to charge five thousand a-year
stored<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.380> which<00:00:38.280> isn't<00:00:38.489> much<00:00:38.790> for<00:00:39.660> what

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
stored in it which isn't much for what

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.869 
stored in it which isn't much for what
you<00:00:40.110> need<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:40.950> actually<00:00:41.160> connect

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
you need so you can actually connect

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.770 
you need so you can actually connect
lessor<00:00:42.210> an<00:00:42.570> MFA<00:00:43.260> or<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> bat<00:00:43.770> box<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.690> would

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
lessor an MFA or a bat box and it would

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.229 
lessor an MFA or a bat box and it would
like<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.079> use<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> pair<00:00:46.590> from<00:00:46.800> them<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.210> do<00:00:48.210> not

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
like to use a pair from them and do not

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.389 
like to use a pair from them and do not
connect<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.899> an<00:00:48.989> MF<00:00:49.230> s<00:00:49.410> or<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> whole<00:00:50.370> thing

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
connect it to an MF s or the whole thing

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.310 
connect it to an MF s or the whole thing
would<00:00:50.730> explode<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.750> ataxia

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
would explode because this on ataxia

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.709 
would explode because this on ataxia
made<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.649> voltage<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.670> he<00:00:53.760> cannot<00:00:53.969> she<00:00:54.210> still

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
made in voltage but he cannot she still

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.959 
made in voltage but he cannot she still
quite<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> bit<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.500> power<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.699> entice

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
quite a bit of power but it can entice

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.510 
quite a bit of power but it can entice
in<00:00:57.180> medium<00:00:57.989> voltage<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.280> tried<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
in medium voltage so if you tried to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.369 
in medium voltage so if you tried to
connect<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> iPods<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.570> cable<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
connect the iPods to cable to it and

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.930 
connect the iPods to cable to it and
sending<00:01:01.620> Allah<00:01:01.829> volt<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.309> will<00:01:02.460> actually<00:01:02.609> blow

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
sending Allah volt it will actually blow

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.920 
sending Allah volt it will actually blow
up<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:04.379> kind<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.860> screwed<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.930> don't

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
up on you in kind of screwed I don't

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.219 
up on you in kind of screwed I don't
want<00:01:07.049> now<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.950> okay<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.540> if<00:01:09.540> he<00:01:09.720> was<00:01:09.869> wondering

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
want now so okay so if he was wondering

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.219 
want now so okay so if he was wondering
where<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.530> am<00:01:10.680> actually<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:12.810> such<00:01:13.020> would

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
where we am actually in the such would

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.609 
where we am actually in the such would
do<00:01:13.460> we're<00:01:14.460> inside<00:01:14.820> his<00:01:15.030> head<00:01:15.290> inside<00:01:16.290> my<00:01:16.439> head

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
do we're inside his head inside my head

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.850 
do we're inside his head inside my head
which<00:01:18.229> my<00:01:19.229> top<00:01:19.619> eight<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.920> course<00:01:20.159> yes<00:01:20.850> they<00:01:21.180> go

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
which my top eight of course yes they go

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.370 
which my top eight of course yes they go
it's<00:01:22.860> nice<00:01:23.189> man<00:01:23.430> looking<00:01:23.820> good<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.810> okay

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it's nice man looking good don't do okay

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.120 
it's nice man looking good don't do okay
so<00:01:25.439> we're<00:01:25.619> gonna<00:01:25.710> jump<00:01:25.950> down<00:01:26.100> here<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.549> should

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
so we're gonna jump down here I should

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.520 
so we're gonna jump down here I should
switch<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.460> quantum<00:01:29.880> save<00:01:30.119> time

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
switch over got this quantum save time

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.010 
switch over got this quantum save time
okay<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:32.130> one<00:01:32.400> I<00:01:32.430> made<00:01:32.640> earlier<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.240> this

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
okay so is one I made earlier and this

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.010 
okay so is one I made earlier and this
will<00:01:34.200> kill<00:01:34.409> me<00:01:34.700> yeah<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.210> okay<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.659> I've<00:01:36.840> got

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
will kill me yeah so okay so I've got

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.969 
will kill me yeah so okay so I've got
that<00:01:37.259> MFE<00:01:38.250> discounts<00:01:38.909> me<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.329> box<00:01:39.600> yeah<00:01:40.560> as

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
that MFE discounts me about box yeah as

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.530 
that MFE discounts me about box yeah as
well<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.520> we'll<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.119> with<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> pair<00:01:42.509> of

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
well and we'll go up with a pair of

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.960 
well and we'll go up with a pair of
stored<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.770> keep<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.850> long

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
stored in there and you can keep as long

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.160 
stored in there and you can keep as long
as<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.210> guys<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> way<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.899> getting

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
as you guys know the way of getting

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.010 
as you guys know the way of getting
power<00:01:46.759> constant<00:01:47.759> para<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> should<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.930> all

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
power constant para to it should be all

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.620 
power constant para to it should be all
right<00:01:49.250> it<00:01:50.250> only<00:01:50.399> activates<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:51.299> there's<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
right it only activates if there's a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.590 
right it only activates if there's a
live<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:51.960> live<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.270> turned<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
live in live for and so if we turned it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.600 
live in live for and so if we turned it
on<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:55.049> wouldn't<00:01:55.320> had<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.530> try<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.829> power<00:01:56.040> well

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
on it wouldn't had to try and power well

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.520 
on it wouldn't had to try and power well
it<00:01:56.700> would<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.030> store<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> power<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.259> drained

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it would it store the power it drained

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.929 
it would it store the power it drained
the<00:01:58.649> pair<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.979> store<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.399> there<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.790> bit
