00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
changes the nine volts to 24 volts this

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.630 
changes the nine volts to 24 volts this

when play more than one note at a time
first<00:02:04.759> I'll<00:02:05.000> play<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.390> dry<00:02:05.630> signal<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:06.320> then

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
first I'll play the dry signal and then

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:37.339 
first I'll play the dry signal and then
I'll<00:02:06.860> kick<00:02:07.130> in<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.460> octave<00:02:07.880> ik's
