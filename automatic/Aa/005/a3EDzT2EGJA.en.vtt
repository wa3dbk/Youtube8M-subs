00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
it is a fun map is a map does not lag at

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.620 
it is a fun map is a map does not lag at
all<00:01:43.439> well<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.159> mean<00:01:44.460> for<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.759> most<00:01:44.939> cases<00:01:45.270> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
all well I mean for the most cases of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.499 
all well I mean for the most cases of
the<00:01:45.720> lag<00:01:45.930> um<00:01:46.250> streamers<00:01:47.250> good<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
the lag um streamers good it's just the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.020 
the lag um streamers good it's just the
most<00:01:48.659> consistent<00:01:49.530> map<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.460> opinion

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
most consistent map in my opinion

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.330 
most consistent map in my opinion
although<00:01:51.840> i<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.110> count<00:01:52.530> down<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.070> back

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
although i do like count down and back

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.480 
although i do like count down and back
up<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.700> lot<00:01:54.530> now<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> never<00:01:55.829> play<00:01:56.040> on<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> void

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
up a lot now I never play on the void

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.100 
up a lot now I never play on the void
and<00:01:56.820> never<00:01:57.030> play<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.360> alert<00:01:57.630> because<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.930> hate

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
and never play on alert because I hate

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.810 
and never play on alert because I hate
those<00:01:58.259> who<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:58.920> all<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> parts<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.460> okay

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
those who have so all the parts in okay

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.950 
those who have so all the parts in okay
map<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> lacks<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.899> lot<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.340> lot

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
map but it lacks a lot as in like a lot

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.510 
map but it lacks a lot as in like a lot
so<00:02:03.960> anyways<00:02:04.469> let's<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:05.280> all<00:02:05.899> else<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.110> there

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.570 

yeah<00:02:10.520> yeah<00:02:11.270> the<00:02:11.510> r<00:02:11.540> equal<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.050> not<00:02:12.290> bad<00:02:12.560> in<00:02:12.950> the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
yeah yeah the r equal is not bad in the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.820 
yeah yeah the r equal is not bad in the
end<00:02:13.790> with<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.210> grip<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.200> realize<00:02:15.650> it

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
end with the grip I just to realize it

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.860 
end with the grip I just to realize it
and<00:02:15.980> with<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.160> flash<00:02:16.460> hider<00:02:16.790> on<00:02:17.060> I'll<00:02:17.390> make<00:02:17.600> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
and with a flash hider on I'll make the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.770 
and with a flash hider on I'll make the
right<00:02:18.560> now<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.520> you'll<00:02:19.880> see<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.450> muscle

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
right now you you'll see that the muscle

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.930 
right now you you'll see that the muscle
functions<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.230> lot<00:02:21.500> smaller<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.070> it's<00:02:22.700> thanks

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
functions a lot smaller and it's thanks

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.090 
functions a lot smaller and it's thanks
to<00:02:23.060> flash<00:02:23.360> hider<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:24.080> on<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.470> does<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:24.830> it

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
to flash hider so on it does have it

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.250 
to flash hider so on it does have it
have<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.580> uses<00:02:26.090> on<00:02:26.270> dogs<00:02:26.570> with<00:02:26.810> bigger<00:02:26.990> muzzle

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
have it uses on dogs with bigger muzzle

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.350 
have it uses on dogs with bigger muzzle
flashes<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.490> definitely<00:02:28.700> helps<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.240> hit

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
flashes and it definitely helps it hit

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.770 
flashes and it definitely helps it hit
firing<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.050> um<00:02:30.920> yeah<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.190> mixes<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.510> it

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
firing and um yeah I mixes I and it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.620 
firing and um yeah I mixes I and it
seems<00:02:33.110> like<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.440> has<00:02:34.070> even<00:02:34.250> less<00:02:34.610> recoil<00:02:34.910> if<00:02:35.420> I

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
seems like it has even less recoil if I

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.530 
seems like it has even less recoil if I
then<00:02:36.170> if<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.530> had<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.800> grip<00:02:37.070> on<00:02:37.460> I<00:02:38.240> don't<00:02:38.450> know

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
then if I had to grip on I don't know

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.850 
then if I had to grip on I don't know
and<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.810> do<00:02:38.870> pick<00:02:39.170> at<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.350> sea<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.620> six

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
and I do pick at the sea and six

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.370 
and I do pick at the sea and six
prototype<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.490> couple<00:02:40.880> times<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.750> get

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
prototype a couple times and you get

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.230 
prototype a couple times and you get
some<00:02:42.620> kills<00:02:42.890> with<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:43.550> I'm<00:02:43.760> here<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.060> just

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
in my opinion easy for and other guns as

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
know in my opinion the three best

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.820 
know in my opinion the three best
weapons<00:04:32.010> are<00:04:32.130> locked<00:04:32.340> yet<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:33.240> TX<00:04:34.169> or<00:04:34.350> Reaper

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
weapons are locked yet the TX or Reaper

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.040 
weapons are locked yet the TX or Reaper
the<00:04:35.040> opiate<00:04:35.460> 55<00:04:35.910> in<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.120> ACM<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.930> then

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
the opiate 55 in the ACM and then

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.439 
the opiate 55 in the ACM and then
there's<00:04:37.380> this<00:04:37.560> gun<00:04:37.800> put<00:04:38.699> it<00:04:38.729> up<00:04:39.000> but<00:04:39.240> just

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
there's this gun put it up but just

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.610 
there's this gun put it up but just

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
because I see that the basket doesn't

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.189
