00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.830
 Come on, let's go. 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.980
 this video here would be demonstrating 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:14.540
 common build on the face of profile to 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.240
 Who does not know what profile is aside? 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.869
 then start with the circle enclosure is the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.380
 base for the technical construction of the face 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.380
 in the manga style 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.890
 you may be using an ellipse has 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.929
 problem or bad will 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.989
 however you have to be careful in 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.010
 adaptation a circus i believe it to be 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.469
 the simpler technique more practical and 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.219
 efficiently comes much closer to the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:53.039
 perfect even begins marking there the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:57.449
 center on the pizza now separates it 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.879
 half of the circles there alone 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.910
 for you to have a notion that are spaces 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.159
 similar 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:13.070
 this inclined curve and serves as the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:18.060
 Character profile 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.070
 this central vertical line is the line of 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.250
 ear processing 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.060
 then the profile already changes the name 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.060
 that would be the reference line 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.829
 of the profile positioning part 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.150
 then this reference line to the line 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.540
 side 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:43.110
 she can not be too keen end 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.810
 Pedro is very curved 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.970
 first I make the eye shape 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.740
 now begins to work apart from the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.409
 nose 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.649
 then an analysis and start a little bit 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:00.579
 below the eye see form acute bridge 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.070
 nose pinch 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:09.429
 the formal staircase to the mouth and then the 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.099
 cheese is relative depends a lot 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.500
 of the designer incidence is a stretch 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.750
 the longer it is to make a one line a 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.239
 a little further down the chin and 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.720
 balanced 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:25.299
 It does the way I used to 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.560
 given the way I'm riding there gave 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.940
 tilt now in my speech in beauty 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.620
 continuing this line of positioning 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.620
 of the ear where the jaw will go 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.910
 remembering that he is an adult character 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:48.040
 You are an adult character. 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.910
 then the line of the jaw under the right 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.350
 ear placement guide 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.750
 but it is relative to this line of 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.230
 conditioners if you are a child 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.730
 sometimes it does not rise exactly in the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.459
 ear sewing thread a little bit 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.989
 before 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:12.010
 now see the benchmark in 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:19.180
 each angle and the shape of the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.900
 eyebrow shifts a little from the brightness in the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.319
 eye 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:26.950
 the details of the ear the more 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:30.220
 You have to practice there to give 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.600
 Better ear construction will be more 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.819
 perfect will be your trait after 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.760
 reinforced the ear contour 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.760
 now just put the position of the neck 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:53.230
 remembering that remembering is not emphasizing 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.660
 the idea that the thickness of the neck 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:59.379
 You may be halfway through the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:04.380
 half in the back of the brain know 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.380
 there to where goes the width 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.709
 now reinforcing the shape of the head 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.079
 put some cracks to 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:20.530
 Shadow and then you 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:27.490
 is playing in the shade with well hatches 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:32.080
 smooth and completing or have the image of 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.520
 sketch put a shadow on the front 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:43.240
 So far we have to put the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:45.130
 shadow the lines you use 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.590
 to build technically you 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.960
 can be paying 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.419
 in this specific case that I am 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.539
 leaving is precisely because people 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:59.169
 need these lines in the construction 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:02.530
 then you need this example there . 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.800
 The way I 'm riding, see the 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:10.240
 balance the way you perfection 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:15.240
 can acquire with this technical form 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.240
 development of face structure 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:26.830
 see the eye positioning line 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.690
 half of the 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.240
 Eye positions for the for 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:36.060
 three cases is the same 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:40.020
 the ear positioning line 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.020
 she is a wand 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.669
 so that if you see the line 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.550
 processing of the ear with the face of 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:51.820
 front will change what the face of front 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.820
 is a face balance line 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.480
 I'm putting the sexes right 2 and 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:02.590
 no male 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:05.500
 so team assembled the construction there 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:10.750
 third face three different angles 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.790
 For you are training one of a 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.540
 more direct way the more 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:20.940
 secondly in a technical way from the third party 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.940
 also in a more technical way 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:30.870
 so look through practice I like 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.870
 closely and bring it on even more
