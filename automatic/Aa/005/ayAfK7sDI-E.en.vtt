you know he was definitely that guy I

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.770 
you know he was definitely that guy I
looked<00:02:40.470> up<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.859> his<00:02:41.010> he<00:02:41.760> kept<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.150> sick<00:02:42.420> he<00:02:42.569> kept

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
looked up to his he kept it sick he kept

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.990 
looked up to his he kept it sick he kept
it<00:02:42.930> cool<00:02:43.109> he<00:02:43.470> filmed<00:02:44.010> but<00:02:44.159> he<00:02:44.250> also<00:02:44.400> competed

it cool he filmed but he also competed
and<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.659> think<00:02:46.170> there's<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.409> fine<00:02:46.650> line<00:02:46.680> I

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
and I think there's a fine line I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.210 
and I think there's a fine line I
totally<00:02:47.700> did<00:02:47.819> not<00:02:47.970> think<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.599> ever<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:49.290> my

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
totally did not think as ever in my

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.210 
totally did not think as ever in my
realm<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.940> win<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> gold<00:02:51.329> medal<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.959> she<00:02:52.220> yeah

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
realm to win a gold medal so she yeah

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.599 
realm to win a gold medal so she yeah
that<00:02:53.940> seems<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.540> far-fetched<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.250> slopes

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
that seems so far-fetched and slopes

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.220 
that seems so far-fetched and slopes
that<00:02:56.700> wasn't<00:02:57.060> even<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.389> Olympics<00:02:57.780> until

that part that parts sick that comes

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.330 
that part that parts sick that comes
with<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.519> but<00:03:47.609> it's<00:03:47.760> not<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.709> it's<00:03:49.709> weird<00:03:50.129> you

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
with it but it's not the it's weird you

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.979 
with it but it's not the it's weird you
can<00:03:50.489> either<00:03:50.699> keep<00:03:50.940> going<00:03:51.449> that<00:03:51.660> way<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.840> think
