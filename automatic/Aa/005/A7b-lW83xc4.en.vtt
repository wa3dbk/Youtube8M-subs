00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:10.330
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.280
 my youtube channel 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.550
 I would like to show you today how 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.340
 you with the gopro hero 3 inconspicuous 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.050
 It could be filming though 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.530
 already quite small and much smaller 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.570
 as the gopro hero 2, however, there is 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.529
 two things the unobtrusive 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.619
 interfere with filming 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:35.229
 First, this is a relatively loud one 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.420
 Beep and the other you can see if 

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:39.850
 we are look at us something more 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.420
 There are a total of four LEDs that are red here 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.879
 flash 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.979
 on the one hand at the front at the bottom 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.859
 behind and on top 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:55.120
 the forte led i show you today 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:57.999
 once you both beep the loud 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.129
 and turn off the red leds 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:02.129
 to find something less obvious 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.520
 we have to turn off both things 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.250
 first of all in the settings 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.140
 switch 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:26.979
 We can then go down to the 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:33.759
 area setup and then continue 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:36.069
 down cd4 we choose and here 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:40.179
 Now we can choose if we all 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:43.989
 Four LEDs only two of the four LEDs or 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.549
 no led have no red led on 

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:46.750
 if we want to film or 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.689
 taking photos 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:56.829
 we do not want to have anything here so put 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:58.780
 If we turn this on we go on in 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.549
 the settings the next point the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.670
 we have here is such a key 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.340
 with a 100 that means we're here 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.739
 a volume of 100 percent 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.929
 We have the area we choose 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.680
 Here we can do that in 70 percent 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.549
 lower or switch off completely 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.250
 and if we did that and 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.579
 then again from the settings 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.889
 going out 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:29.319
 then the camera is in a mode in 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:31.030
 which she is very inconspicuous when I am 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.810
 Now, for example, the film 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.810
 activate 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.829
 then you see the camera filming without 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.650
 Something brings or shines somewhere here 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.669
 quiet and quiet and we have too 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.500
 no more beeping 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:46.989
 that was it from me when you the film 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.760
 liked then thumbs down subscribed 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.290
 I recommend myself and write 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.290
