00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.860 

so<00:00:01.770> we've<00:00:01.890> come<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.340> end<00:00:02.370> of<00:00:02.970> our<00:00:03.120> cycle<00:00:03.689> of

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
so we've come to the end of our cycle of

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.690 
so we've come to the end of our cycle of
major<00:00:04.200> scales<00:00:04.710> we're<00:00:04.980> all<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.310> way<00:00:05.400> around

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
major scales we're all the way around

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.849 
major scales we're all the way around
the<00:00:05.850> circle<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.240> fifths<00:00:06.420> at<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.319> key<00:00:07.560> with

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
the circle of fifths at the key with

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.759 
the circle of fifths at the key with
just<00:00:08.220> one<00:00:08.550> flat<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.389> that's<00:00:09.630> F<00:00:09.900> major

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
just one flat and that's F major

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.850 
just one flat and that's F major
okay<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:11.759> we're<00:00:11.940> start<00:00:12.150> on<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.420> T<00:00:13.410> string<00:00:13.650> here

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
okay so we're start on the T string here

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.220 
okay so we're start on the T string here
fourth<00:00:14.219> finger<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.580> F<00:00:14.969> we're<00:00:15.960> going<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.139> use

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
fourth finger on F we're going to use

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.500 
fourth finger on F we're going to use
some<00:00:16.470> second<00:00:16.949> fingers<00:00:17.279> or<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> b-flat<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.390> then

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
some second fingers or a b-flat and then

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.570 
some second fingers or a b-flat and then
our<00:00:18.600> F<00:00:18.720> natural<00:00:19.130> once<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.279> get<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
our F natural once we get to the a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.609 
our F natural once we get to the a
string<00:00:20.699> need<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.630> reach<00:00:21.810> back<00:00:22.020> for<00:00:22.080> our<00:00:22.380> B<00:00:22.590> flat

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
string need to reach back for our B flat

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.769 
string need to reach back for our B flat
then<00:00:23.519> after<00:00:23.910> we<00:00:23.970> played<00:00:24.180> our<00:00:24.300> C<00:00:24.539> we're<00:00:24.750> going

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
then after we played our C we're going

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.330 
then after we played our C we're going
to<00:00:24.930> shift<00:00:25.350> up<00:00:25.590> instead<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.949> playing<00:00:26.220> our

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
to shift up instead of playing our

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.710 
to shift up instead of playing our
fourth<00:00:26.550> finger<00:00:26.640> we're<00:00:27.150> actually<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.539> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
fourth finger we're actually going to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.529 
fourth finger we're actually going to
first<00:00:28.019> finger<00:00:28.349> right<00:00:28.529> here<00:00:28.560> then<00:00:29.460> play<00:00:29.730> three

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
first finger right here then play three

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.659 
first finger right here then play three
and<00:00:30.779> four<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.140> we've<00:00:31.349> got<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> d<00:00:31.710> e<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.430> F

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and four so we've got a d e and F

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.690 
and four so we've got a d e and F
natural<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.239> that's<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.399> could

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
natural and that's it and you could

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.250 
natural and that's it and you could
possibly<00:00:36.270> do<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> different<00:00:36.840> fingering<00:00:37.140> up

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
possibly do a different fingering up

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.990 
possibly do a different fingering up
here<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.649> could<00:00:37.739> possibly<00:00:38.160> go<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> fourth

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
here you could possibly go to fourth

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.970 
here you could possibly go to fourth
position<00:00:39.149> instead<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.989> certainly<00:00:40.710> wouldn't

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
position instead I certainly wouldn't

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.729 
position instead I certainly wouldn't
have<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.129> problem<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:42.260> but<00:00:43.260> yet<00:00:43.410> for<00:00:43.440> now

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
have a problem with that but yet for now

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.010 
have a problem with that but yet for now
what<00:00:43.920> we're<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.219> do<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.640> shift<00:00:44.850> up<00:00:45.120> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
what we're going to do is shift up to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.560 
what we're going to do is shift up to
first<00:00:46.320> finger<00:00:46.739> on<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> D<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.969> let's<00:00:48.180> get<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
first finger on the D so let's get that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.279 
first finger on the D so let's get that
a<00:00:48.600> try<00:00:48.930> together<00:00:49.489> starting<00:00:50.539> fourth<00:00:51.539> finger<00:00:52.170> F

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
a try together starting fourth finger F

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.500 
a try together starting fourth finger F
