00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.600
 Modest Tastes cuisine from armful loves 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.040
 we have a local recipe in this section 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.680
 we will reach our beautiful Gaziantep 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.680
 and "Pirpirim Market" 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.240
 But let's take a look at the necessary materials before you choose 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.760
 2 bunch of purslane 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.040
 3 tomatoes 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.320
 2 green, 1 red pepper 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.480
 1 piece of dry onion 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 3 cloves of garlic 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 1 piece of lemon 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.840
 1 tablespoon of pomegranate syrup 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.640
 2 teaspoons sumac 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.360
 according to desire; olive oil 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.880
 After learning the necessary materials for the pyrimp ... 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.240
 Let's start our operations by chopping the pirpirim 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.200
 separating the thick branches, we chop large leaves 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.840
 now we chop our onion 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.720
 but we chop the onion in a smaller way rather than a chunk 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.440
 chopped onions 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.080
 no original operation 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.400
 but we rub with a little salt to lose its vitality 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.200
 and adding to our pirpirim 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.800
 Now let's make the garlic thin 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.520
 we cut the garlic well, let's sprinkle now 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.760
 row of peppers 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.160
 we use both green pepper and red pepper 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.680
 can't chop too finely 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.960
 Now let's cut our red pepper 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.160
 we can go to tomatoes now 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.040
 We're not robbing but you can rob it if you want 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.160
 tomatoes we have cut, now we're laying on again 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.760
 pomegranate 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.800
 because it is a sour garnish, we call lemon juice extra 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
 and plenty of sumac sprinkle 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.680
 In Gaziantep, some houses do not use olive oil for this recipe 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.680
 some are also using 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.160
 we said we should be the ones who use it and show us some olive oil 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.960
 be confused 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.400
 but let the light bottom-top to be seen from below pirpirim 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.800
 we had made a very nice traditional salad 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.600
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.040
 We were in Gaziantep and shared the description of "Pirpirim Market" 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.240
 as soon as possible, I would ask you to remember us and Gaziantep, sir 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.120
 goodbye...
