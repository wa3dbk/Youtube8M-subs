00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.740
 hi teese is eventful moving forward 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:08.410
 today I am in a storm 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.530
 we are in the sleeve affluent click 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.400
 who is waiting for us by the sea and we 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.400
 left to join him 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.279
 only flourish plus bananas welcome 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.279
 to Friday 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.800
 it is still better here at low cost 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.300
 what are we going to do if I'm going to let you 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.910
 to present yeah of course 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.700
 so my name is florent locusts I 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.340
 32 years old and I am from the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.600
 neck in lower Normandy and because 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.820
 I mainly do in the photo 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.160
 it's like never and in normandie I 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.680
 do a lot of seaside 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.129
 I'm often on the coast 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.830
 after that I also like to travel 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.790
 proves to others our our edge of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.940
 sea ​​but it's mainly a 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.560
 activity after it also happens to me rather 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.509
 summer doing portraits 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.100
 to change me a little bit 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.840
 ideas too to avoid getting bored of 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.130
 do all the time the same thing 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.560
 seaside to go around in circles 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.840
 after good I am amateur photographer 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.850
 so 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.229
 it also allows me to be a fan of 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.479
 do a little bit of what I want 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.549
 and not having any step constraints 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.390
 to have two 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.369
 of obligations will say in the photo is 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.470
 to really do everything I love 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.450
 that's why I really decided 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.759
 to be an amateur photographer and not 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.450
 to do my job I wondered 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.159
 how you organize photos outputs 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.830
 in fact it is of course when I have the 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.090
 time on weekends and as soon as I see that 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.009
 I have a little bit of time but I 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.659
 look I look at the weather of course 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.920
 is paramount in what I 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.659
 were looking at picture is what the sky 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.570
 for me it's 50% of the success of a 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.399
 photo and no I really look at the the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.679
 very very important weather of course the 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.880
 marsh anyway as in the sleeve 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.679
 and marshes that are relatively 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.030
 important so it's very important 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.420
 to have the right height of water at the right 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.610
 in law 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.610
 so I regularly go on board 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.340
 sea ​​for for really spotted at such 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.269
 spot spotted a frame that I like 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.190
 see see tell them what time and 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.569
 the sea in the right place to go back 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.250
 when there are better conditions 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.780
 which I really pity 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.600
 ahistorical to be of each 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.870
 where you go where there are plans 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.000
 accurate with the right height of water and I 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.060
 I take note wade good height 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.040
 of water the game 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.989
 in fact I really know the schedule 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.180
 accurate when had to go home I 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.470
 look at the water level the noise I 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.329
 note if there is wind because the wind 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.700
 can also be taken into account on the 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.230
 water level and when when I find 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.790
 that conditions are really conducive 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.250
 to go back if the height of is 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.850
 good I surrender otherwise I do not go 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.260
 I do not make another exit elsewhere I 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.720
 organize me, I organize myself like that 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.900
 a lot of photos of you had to do 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.239
 even noise 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.860
 from the bay of ecalgrain that's what 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.540
 you always manage to vary a little bit 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.280
 the work you do on a 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.510
 difference that actually when I come 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.670
 on a photo spot is that I have a 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.459
 very specific idea of ​​what I'm looking for 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.709
 and as long as I do not have the picture there 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.040
 really talk to me 100% 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.579
 I'll come back to it until I really 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.489
 the good photo 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.189
 as long as we do not see aguri go that wants 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.129
 say that will never have had afp again that 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:35.730
 you 're still very demanding 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:37.650
 turn around yeah bah I try g1j a 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.560
 goal was actually I set myself a goal 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.750
 staff is to evolve with each 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.159
 every way out is really about being 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.159
 better than the time before it's 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:51.120
 really I see some pictures of some 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:54.859
 American photographers who are very 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.000
 very strong and that's really I will say 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.660
 while remaining amateur I really 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.040
 want to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.830
 to achieve this is the right method I 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.420
 think to progress we have three hundred 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.030
 Swiss and the beauty that's what 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.560
 I search after I am amateur so 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.570
 I do what I like is the advantage 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.140
 is that I can really do 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.120
 photos where I want when I if the photos 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.519
 I do not like it so much I have not seen 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.560
 no one to say that the photos are 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.760
 not successful or what the 6th photos 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.250
 not like and dream of my computer 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.300
 or delete it 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.180
 good I still saw that you had not 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.890
 bad photos in the corner but you 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:38.180
 travels also not bad I saw 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:41.190
 photos in iceland also in iceland 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.210
 yeah well it's true it's 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.790
 a lot of seaside simply 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.830
 because I live at the seaside but 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.360
 but I also like the photo on 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:52.140
 will say in small mountains like 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.730
 iceland school just that attracts me 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.390
 really much this type of atmosphere 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.940
 even maybe more than the seaside 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.720
 a report to what I propose but 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:06.540
 necessarily as I live at the seaside 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.720
 but I already know it must be 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.720
 worst
