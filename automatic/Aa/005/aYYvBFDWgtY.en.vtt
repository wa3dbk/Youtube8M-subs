00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
the rest of its life so you know

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.700 
the rest of its life so you know
supposed<00:06:19.570> to<00:06:19.690> be<00:06:19.810> the<00:06:19.930> other<00:06:19.960> you<00:06:20.409> know<00:06:20.530> the

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
supposed to be the other you know the

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.200 
supposed to be the other you know the
quality<00:06:21.130> it<00:06:21.190> gets<00:06:21.340> a<00:06:21.430> little<00:06:21.580> better<00:06:21.820> it<00:06:22.060> gets

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
quality it gets a little better it gets

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.499 
quality it gets a little better it gets
a<00:06:22.270> little<00:06:22.469> softer<00:06:23.469> you<00:06:23.740> know<00:06:23.860> the<00:06:24.580> driver

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
a little softer you know the driver

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:27.779 
a little softer you know the driver
relaxes<00:06:26.259> I<00:06:26.380> guess<00:06:26.590> because<00:06:26.770> it<00:06:27.190> was<00:06:27.340> never<00:06:27.520> on

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
relaxes I guess because it was never on

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.149 
relaxes I guess because it was never on
so<00:06:28.090> it<00:06:28.210> actually<00:06:28.469> you<00:06:29.469> know<00:06:29.590> it<00:06:29.650> just<00:06:29.680> sounds<00:06:29.949> a

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159 
so it actually you know it just sounds a

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:32.189 
so it actually you know it just sounds a
little<00:06:30.250> clearer<00:06:30.580> I've<00:06:31.240> burned<00:06:31.599> them<00:06:31.750> in<00:06:31.870> and

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
little clearer I've burned them in and

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.570 
little clearer I've burned them in and

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
you know to me I think it has gotten a

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.640 
you know to me I think it has gotten a
little<00:06:36.729> better<00:06:36.940> but<00:06:37.270> I<00:06:37.300> don't<00:06:37.659> know<00:06:37.779> if<00:06:38.380> it's
