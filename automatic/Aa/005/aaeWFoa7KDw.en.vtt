00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.569
 europe 1 william galibert favor it 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.400
 of the African player is that he is not 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.750
 but football is not just that 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.150
 football is also the technique of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.309
 the intelligence of the discipline these words 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.990
 they were not pronounced at the counter 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.400
 of a bar of fans after a match a 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.500
 not too watered no it's willy sagnol 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.300
 the coach of the girondins de bordeaux who 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.740
 is the author goodnight naveed I said 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.760
 we are at Gabon all night 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.109
 a journalist at france football 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.699
 African football specialist 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.160
 regularly found on the antenna 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.390
 of europe 1 you heard these words from 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.980
 willy sagnol for you what is it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.719
 a verbal slip is a mistake of 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.309
 language or so these are words 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.140
 clearly racist how you judge 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.550
 know where I do not know personally 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.399
 or 10 spanish so I could not 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.140
 to charge racism in any case to the listened 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.210
 from his words we can say that he must 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.460
 must save the soldier willy prejudices 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.680
 I would say that it is rather about 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.750
 who are dismaying fool limit and 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.520
 silly disappointing so both because he 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.059
 there is still a position of responsibility 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.070
 important 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.960
 there is still educator more 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.149
 to be a coach, that means 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.489
 there are also young categories that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.149
 hear that yaya his players his 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.860
 own players 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.450
 now if you want us to come back 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.670
 about the words and we order them 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.100
 the fact together would not be willy alone 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.479
 sagnol then in the entirety of this 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.220
 interview also says that a team is 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.360
 a mixture that needs everything but that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.860
 does not remove this vision 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.830
 show African players who 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.750
 would be understood less intelligent 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.869
 less disciplined than the others it is 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.860
 that is extremely embarrassing the first 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.200
 parameter that of the african cup 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.140
 nations actually the whole state 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.369
 objective parameters two years for the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.509
 nomada sex and african players 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.189
 are without return 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.720
 it makes me laugh anyway because 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.220
 every two years French clubs 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.430
 discover that they at the african cup 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.840
 of nations means here it is a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.159
 false surprise actually it's 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.960
 embarrassing for a coach in his 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.759
 effective because willy sagnol is going 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.439
 maybe see leaving a lot of 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.049
 players but the om knows it's the same 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.680
 on the side of marcelo bielsa it is 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.850
 like reims so I find 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.280
 that it's still a little hypocritical 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.259
 what to do with these words there and on 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.740
 intelligence on discipline on the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.210
 technical 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.990
 it's completely it's completely 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.619
 wrong and then it's sad the players 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.970
 techniques 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.259
 finally I mean this problem it's 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.709
 to ethnicize the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.540
 the debate and the technical players 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.069
 it means anything and everything 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.290
 will be arriving tomorrow in his locker room 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.549
 going to see webi khazri who is that a 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.180
 player of Tunisian origin so a 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.849
 African player 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.769
 he is the most technical player of his 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.299
 cloakroom so according to his words if 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.470
 the africa can not be technical he 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.420
 is going to have trouble precisely where willy 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.069
 Sagnol to face his locker room at 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.540
 to explain himself he will have to justify himself 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.000
 apparently 2 Girondins de Bordeaux 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.799
 have communicated at that level so they 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.269
 said that there was absolutely no 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.560
 racism or anything since 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.090
 hours I'll see besides the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.220
 communicated Girondins de Bordeaux this 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.260
 evening and to sum up to defend willy 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.209
 sagnol the club recalls that he appointed a 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.099
 Senegalese player lamine sanÃ© as 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.480
 captain this is a defense that can 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.060
 get along a month my friend and my 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.480
 neighbor and black my brother-in-law is whole 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.430
 that's what happened to this first black 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.200
 yeah that's extremely equally 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.340
 once clumsy in saxony is always 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.349
 a slippery ground then we are in a 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.579
 company where there are detentions there are 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.190
 tugging there is also one of 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.310
 demoratie complications of words 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.750
 racist racism there are these 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.400
 statements to his insidious in the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.290
 sense where me what shocks me the most 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.489
 that's when he says earlier we're going 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.379
 take Nordics because they have 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.329
 a good mentality that implies what 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.010
 it implies that the original players 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.079
 African would have a bad mentality 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.699
 the championship of France today he 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.900
 is not racist it is populated with 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.549
 players of African descent 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.440
 the problem is the representation 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.510
 that we are African and 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.949
 the african and the powerful the african 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.690
 he's not a dog, he looks like he looks like 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.359
 cattle excuse me no but no but 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.370
 somewhere we can push up to the 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.319
 the way things are expressed 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.720
 you think a player like nicolas 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.730
 nkoulou of the olympic marseille 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.109
 central defender kane player who has a 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.160
 extraordinary game vision 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.329
 it's a player who is not 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.400
 smart yet it comes from 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.930
 cameroon he was recruited into 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.400
 Cameroon training centers so 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.840
 it's actually in French football 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.609
 we want butter and buttery money 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.349
 we want the Africans cheap because 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.540
 it is true that they are cheaper on 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.220
 wants them to be available all the way 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.329
 time on the other hand we will never hold 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.159
 same speeches for southern players 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.959
 Americans who are sometimes on the side 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:12.000
 that we will look for further and in 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.519
 plus the advantage of recruiting players 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.019
 Africans is that there is no 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.310
 really of adaptation problem because 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.950
 they are francophones 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.930
 there is a real cultural proximity and 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.160
 that we do not say it also nabil 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.600
 djellit of that also means that 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.530
 the lessons were not retained because 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.840
 remember the sphere of 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.400
 quotas in 2011 its remarks held within 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.170
 of the French Football Federation 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.430
 where where laurent blanc describe the players 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.240
 blacks I quote as big beefy 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.740
 powerful 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.550
 we have not learned the lessons of this then 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.470
 that it was four years ago already 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.280
 almost not with a little humor I 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.380
 could you say that it's the sphere 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.580
 quotas season 2 co no but that's it 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.500
 but in a way it will not go much 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.660
 far because so that's it going to be 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.310
 it's going to settle down then it's willy 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.090
 sagnol he counts in football 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.730
 French 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.440
 so I think I think that way 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.820
 me making me care what 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.200
 who smooth that sketch that annoys me there 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.870
 in this is the message that is conveyed 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.100
 young people to young people here in the 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.030
 cloakrooms in training centers 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.860
 because the players talk to each other 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.640
 between them they say things before 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.740
 the history of quotas 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.540
 the guys they knew that if you were 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.490
 rather profile like that you had less 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.570
 of luck that if you were profiling like 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.070
 that's where the problem is 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.180
 now I just before I say to 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.230
 your show I had fun passing 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.820
 just a quick quick call to a 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.440
 agent who offers original players 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.890
 African and some clubs 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.450
 league 1 he could sometimes hear we want 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.490
 no central defender or two 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:29.040
 African custodians they have swings from 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:31.740
 concentration for example we're going rather 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.220
 recruit Danish players or players 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.710
 from the east 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.850
 all that shows that racism is 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.200
 not limit to what we see in the 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.280
 tribunes with screams of monkey 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.380
 bananas launched on African players 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.700
 it also concerns the leaders of the 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.950
 french football the coaches the 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.990
 middle of the football but racism it is 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.250
 as in society finally and as he 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.970
 there is racism in football as it 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.190
 there are some in society 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.910
 so absolutely no surprises and I 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.680
 not want to do politics 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.660
 politician but if you have a party 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.430
 far right who enjoys a 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.550
 context of economic crisis which has 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.600
 today at 20 25 % intentions of 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.910
 vote we imagine that these ideas 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.919
 also progress in people's minds 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.450
 so I'm not saying that bleeding forgetfulness 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.070
 the racists I think it's because I 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.040
 am saying in any case I 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.330
 find that it's awkward and that's it then 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.340
 especially when you know that he played in 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.720
 France team with players 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.370
 of African descent in 2006 win 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.630
