00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.570
 video of how to make a new bag of 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.170
 the cap 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.089
 As you can see in my channel, you will have several 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.549
 bags but they are all different 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.429
 I upload the videos to give you the idea and 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.979
 you the one you like or do it 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:14.679
 because I like me just do my 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.289
 nieces and also from time to time it is 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:20.319
 one way to enter money is and 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.929
 hello kitty bags from Pepa Pete 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:25.440
 It is what sells the most and 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.390
 small purses 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.970
 so today we are going to make a new 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.370
 little bag different from these 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.640
 Well, what I've done is cut back 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.590
 in eva rubber as you see what the 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.830
 bottom part ending in round and 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.650
 I'm right here I made one and I've 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.170
 traced to get the two then I've 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.330
 cut a strip that is a little wide 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.830
 but little that this is going to be what I 'm going to 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.810
 go hitting on the edge 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.990
 and satin ribbon this is what 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.200
 we are going to put of paras of tin they left the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.890
 bag to hold the handles of 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.900
 pocket 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.550
 and I've also made a pepa pepa that 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.240
 I have in the template that I lower it in 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.700
 google the lae copied rubber eva and then 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.620
 I throw the black border and I've put 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.959
 cheek in red so that 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.850
 highlight a little more then what are we going to 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.640
 do in the first place is to go hitting 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.790
 from up here little by little and giving it 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.330
 the way to finish it until you get 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.330
 up to this point 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.000
 I 've already pasted it and now what 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.260
 let's do is cut out what we 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.450
 over here and once we have it 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.030
 clipped we're going to throw silicone 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.030
 here and little by little we are hitting 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.060
 as you always see my bag is very 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.030
 very original pimp are going to stay and are 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.160
 super easy are very simple for 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.620
 do it in 5 minutes 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.200
 I'll cut this and turn this already 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.080
 I teach 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.530
 I have already stuck it 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.490
 for what to do is 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.940
 paste the tape of this rasa I'm going to paste 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.069
 a piece here on one side and the other on 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.420
 here on the other hand you can 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.030
 do 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.610
 according to the measure as the girls know 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.620
 of the little one or the big one should do well 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.360
 kid and also what I'm going to do 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:30.480
 is already sticking the face of the pit pit 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.459
 here for example or wherever you want 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.170
