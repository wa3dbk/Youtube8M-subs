00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
minors of all of those chords I do an a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.929 
minors of all of those chords I do an a
minor<00:01:16.890> than<00:01:17.700> an<00:01:17.850> E<00:01:18.000> minor<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.750> minor<00:01:19.439> E<00:01:19.890> minor<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
minor than an E minor a minor E minor a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.370 
minor than an E minor a minor E minor a
minor<00:01:21.689> E<00:01:22.049> minor<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> G<00:01:23.189> again

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
minor E minor then a G again

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.620 
minor E minor then a G again
so<00:01:25.130> it<00:01:25.189> has<00:01:25.310> like<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.520> like<00:01:26.150> kind<00:01:26.299> of<00:01:26.360> a<00:01:26.420> dark

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
so it has like a like kind of a dark

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.789 
so it has like a like kind of a dark
twist<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:27.049> it<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.320> higher<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.680> voice

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
twist to it and the higher the voice

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.560 
twist to it and the higher the voice
goes<00:01:28.009> higher<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:28.610> it's<00:01:28.729> kind<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:28.939> kind<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.479> a

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
goes higher so it's kind of kind of a

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.230 
goes higher so it's kind of kind of a
cool<00:01:29.750> little<00:01:29.930> element<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.250> when<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:31.909> play<00:01:32.090> it

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
cool little element so when you play it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.030 
cool little element so when you play it
you<00:01:32.420> just<00:01:32.780> kind<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.140> keep<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.440> rhythm<00:01:33.590> up<00:01:33.860> and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
you just kind of keep the rhythm up and

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.680 
you just kind of keep the rhythm up and
kind<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.280> chugging<00:01:34.610> along<00:01:34.700> with<00:01:35.060> your<00:01:35.299> chord

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
kind of chugging along with your chord

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.450 
kind of chugging along with your chord
progression<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:36.770> then<00:01:36.860> what<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.130> want<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.340> do
