00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
didn't figure out how to make these

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.009 
didn't figure out how to make these
demos<00:00:10.679> or<00:00:10.920> get<00:00:11.219> them<00:00:11.400> from<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.910> folders<00:00:12.300> my

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
demos or get them from the folders my

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.470 
demos or get them from the folders my
editor<00:00:13.380> preds<00:00:13.830> told<00:00:14.099> me<00:00:14.160> about<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.639> he

putting a link in the description you've
got<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.109> go<00:00:22.199> check<00:00:22.350> me<00:00:22.529> out<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.519> basically<00:00:24.029> um<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
got to go check me out so basically um a

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.679 
got to go check me out so basically um a
demo<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.800> really<00:00:26.340> small<00:00:26.550> file<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.539> can

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
demo is a really small file that you can

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.929 
demo is a really small file that you can
replay<00:00:28.380> put<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.220> put<00:00:29.400> back<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.640> your<00:00:29.730> vault

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
segment clips so that your editor can

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.459 
segment clips so that your editor can
like<00:00:37.800> record<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.930> first<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.350> all

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
end with dot demo so what you want to do

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.270 
end with dot demo so what you want to do
is<00:00:59.039> go<00:00:59.399> into<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> game<00:00:59.910> fire<00:01:00.660> hit<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> clip<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:01.920> I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
is go into a game fire hit a clip like I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.080 
is go into a game fire hit a clip like I
know<00:01:02.640> anyclip<00:01:03.120> they<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> clip<00:01:04.409> within<00:01:04.619> um

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
know anyclip they get a clip within um

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.640 
know anyclip they get a clip within um
for<00:01:06.090> people<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.510> slow<00:01:06.869> computers<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.470> think

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
for people with slow computers I think

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.350 
for people with slow computers I think
you'd<00:01:07.770> probably<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> quit<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> game<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you'd probably have to quit the game and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.450 
you'd probably have to quit the game and
then<00:01:09.479> go<00:01:09.630> into<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.990> folder<00:01:10.320> for<00:01:11.130> people<00:01:11.369> with

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
then go into this folder for people with

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.850 
then go into this folder for people with
faster<00:01:11.850> cuidate<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.479> probably<00:01:12.860> alter

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
faster cuidate you just probably alter

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.240 
faster cuidate you just probably alter
minimize<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.760> then<00:01:15.390> go<00:01:16.110> right<00:01:16.770> click<00:01:17.009> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
minimize it and then go right click and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.050 
minimize it and then go right click and

forgot<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.759> say<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.850> earlier<00:01:27.060> it's<00:01:27.770> getting

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
forgot to say this earlier it's getting

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.359 
forgot to say this earlier it's getting
demos<00:01:29.070> as<00:01:29.220> i<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:30.500> really<00:01:31.500> hard<00:01:31.740> cuz<00:01:32.009> not

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
demos as i really really hard cuz not

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.760 
demos as i really really hard cuz not
hard<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:33.079> it's<00:01:34.079> hard<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.350> get<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
hard but like it's hard to get if you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.080 
hard but like it's hard to get if you
get<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.009> wrong<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.520> lose<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> clip<00:01:36.000> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
get it wrong then you lose the clip so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359 
get it wrong then you lose the clip so
you<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.570> be<00:01:36.600> really<00:01:36.869> careful<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.799> yeah

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
you have to be really careful so yeah

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.010 
you have to be really careful so yeah
