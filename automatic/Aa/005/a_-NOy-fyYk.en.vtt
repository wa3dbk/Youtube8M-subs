00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hello everyone, cat in the second lesson 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.859
 on the basics of roller skating 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.859
 it's about skating back 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.990
 scooter rack shifted center of gravity 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.210
 most of the weight is transferred by two 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.520
 front wheels with heels off the ground 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.320
 do not come off 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.710
 for this you need to tilt the whole body 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.050
 forward perpendicular to the ground about which 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.129
 said in the first lesson turns into 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.230
 oblique as a lead 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.000
 exercises are used exercise 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.559
 reverse flashlight or hourglass 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.870
 stand in place we reduce socks 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.600
 and heels we breed to in different directions 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.300
 next push off the front wheels 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.000
 videos and simultaneously describe each 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.850
 foot arc distributing weight evenly on 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.070
 both legs do not be afraid that you are in 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.350
 unknown direction and do not try 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.890
 abruptly stop with ease 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.750
 push off need to crouch slightly 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.940
 moment when the distance between the rollers 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.280
 reach approximately 2 distance 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.470
 between shoulders we begin to reduce 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.140
 and straighten the legs to the original 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.210
 states do not forget that the legs 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.369
 never fully straightened 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.369
 and the center of gravity is shifted forward 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.869
 unlike a flashlight 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.790
 when rolling your back, your legs should be together 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.190
 describe the arc then into one then into another 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.869
 the side 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.240
 when most of the weight is on 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.759
 left leg then this leg upright 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.070
 position right leg under small 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.780
 slope to the ground 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.509
 push off and describe the legs arc 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.970
 convex part to the right when 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.790
 this left leg makes an arc with a smaller 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.670
 radius gradually transferring weight to 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.220
 right foot then do double 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:03.130
 convex part to the left side and so 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.700
 further to begin to practice the case 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.019
 end up alternately with each leg 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.630
 then try to move your legs 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.959
 simultaneously and more smoothly carry 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.959
 body weight 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.910
 the main error is wrong 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.930
 body weight distribution when you 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.650
 roll back 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.140
 sheep front wheels and rollers carry 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.140
 in the middle of the boot 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.850
 there is a syndrome of flying hands in 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.030
 this moment is a sudden braking 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.049
 legs and the body is still moving backwards 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.230
 inertia is the main cause of this problem 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.570
 fear of falling ahead remember that fall 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.230
 better forward than back to avoid 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.530
 injuries 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.600
 use protection if the rear wheels 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.030
 take off the ground then it means you 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.579
 put too much weight on the sock 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.250
 One wheel boot is not normal 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.829
 you push the rollers will slip and 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.080
 just like back and forth you need to roll 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.939
 they walk 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.040
 a series of problems arises due to the inability 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.860
 transfer body weight from one foot to 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.269
 another first person problem is 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.400
 limping in a particular case the left leg 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.680
 rises into the air when everything is on it 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.690
 still leg support can be torn off 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.099
 off the ground but body weight at this moment 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.170
 must be completely on the other foot 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.150
 the second problem is like legs all the time 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.629
 are at a great distance from each 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.930
 friend 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.909
 center of gravity in the middle of the body in this 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.090
 gravity compensation case 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:43.489
 you have to walk in this position 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.700
 legs get tired quickly and suffer 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.349
 maneuverability and the third problem is 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:56.870
 makes only one leg 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:58.340
 and should both when riding back you 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.829
 must see where you are going 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.799
 it does not need to fold the neck 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.260
 remember that your body is not a log and it 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.629
 bends along with turning neck 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.620
 twist the body and unfold the shoulders 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.970
 about 30-45 degrees 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.549
 to quickly feel the balance 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.340
 ask for help from a friend or acquaintance 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.010
 you must partially lean on his hands 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.570
 and try to drive back 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.760
 a small support on the arm to force 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.550
 shift your center of gravity forward 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.729
 body weight will shift to the toes of the rollers and 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.430
 legs will move more freely and you 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.560
 do not be afraid that your fall forward 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.010
 a friend should just watch the support 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.410
 on hand 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.389
 as soon as you feel you can 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.060
 control the movement of the legs and keep 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.650
 balance begin to ease the pressure on 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.300
 hands keeping rack 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.849
 and then completely separate your hands is important 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.979
 in no case can you remember sharply 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:57.470
 reduce reliance on arms or sharply 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.050
 stop otherwise you can drag 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:03.199
 his assistant on himself and with him 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.289
 fall if your friend rolls badly then 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:09.590
 better that he was without rollers on it 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.990
 all hope this lesson was helpful and 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.510
 will help you learn to ride back 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.669
 if you have any questions then 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.889
 you can easily post them on the forum

 skating now I will or such a hurry 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.539
 thoughts hurry me to start moving at all 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
