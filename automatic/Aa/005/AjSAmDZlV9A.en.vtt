00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
get on the dyno I'm going to run it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.250 
get on the dyno I'm going to run it
through<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.270> paces<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.110> kind

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
through the the paces and see what kind

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:25.719 
through the the paces and see what kind
of<00:01:13.320> power<00:01:13.500> increase<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.010> got

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729

away<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.030> know<00:01:36.479> our<00:01:36.780> powers<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.470> our<00:01:37.740> pipes

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
away and I know our powers and our pipes

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.100 
away and I know our powers and our pipes
make<00:01:38.340> power<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:39.149> this<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.479> unreal

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
make power but this is unreal

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.499 
make power but this is unreal
if<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.920> look<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> graph<00:01:41.549> what<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.360> can

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
if you look to the graph what you can

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.490 
if you look to the graph what you can
see<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:43.200> max<00:01:43.830> horsepower<00:01:44.330> went<00:01:45.330> from<00:01:45.539> 77

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
see here is max horsepower went from 77
