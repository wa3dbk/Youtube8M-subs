and it took all the fans will remember

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.000 
and it took all the fans will remember
for<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.390> long<00:02:52.510> time<00:02:54.810> five<00:02:55.810> games<00:02:56.230> in<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.500> row<00:02:56.530> and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
for a long time five games in a row and

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:23.470 
for a long time five games in a row and
he's<00:02:57.250> found<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.700> target<00:02:57.910> he's<00:02:58.510> on<00:02:58.720> fire

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.020 

and<00:03:23.569> in<00:03:24.440> all<00:03:24.590> probability<00:03:24.769> there'll<00:03:25.640> be<00:03:25.700> no

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
and in all probability there'll be no

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.130 
and in all probability there'll be no
way<00:03:26.209> back<00:03:26.450> from<00:03:26.629> that<00:03:28.299> was<00:03:29.299> a<00:03:29.330> good<00:03:29.540> shot<00:03:29.599> to<00:03:30.019> be

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
honest I thought it was going wide but

00:03:31.700 --> 00:04:01.370 
honest I thought it was going wide but
it<00:03:31.790> went<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.090> off<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.239> left-hand<00:03:32.750> post
