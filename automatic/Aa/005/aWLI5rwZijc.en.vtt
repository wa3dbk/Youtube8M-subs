these<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.570> probably<00:00:30.960> some<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> most

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
these are probably some of the most

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.229 
these are probably some of the most
seaworthy<00:00:32.070> kayaks<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.640> there<00:00:32.850> they're<00:00:33.059> much

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
seaworthy kayaks out there they're much

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.900 
seaworthy kayaks out there they're much
stronger<00:00:33.600> than<00:00:33.809> fiberglass<00:00:34.050> kayaks<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.070> I

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
stronger than fiberglass kayaks and I

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.200 
stronger than fiberglass kayaks and I
put<00:00:36.120> my<00:00:36.239> life<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.630> them<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.170> time<00:00:38.059> we<00:00:39.059> also

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
put my life in them all the time we also

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.750 
put my life in them all the time we also
build<00:00:40.140> will<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:40.920> building<00:00:41.280> traditional

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
build will be building traditional

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.479 
build will be building traditional
paddles<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.239> learning<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> use<00:00:42.660> them<00:00:42.840> as<00:00:43.020> well

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
paddles and learning to use them as well

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
paddles and learning to use them as well
these<00:00:44.489> paddles<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.570> save<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> lot<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.960> wear

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
these paddles will save a lot of wear

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.900 
these paddles will save a lot of wear
tear<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.530> your<00:00:46.680> back<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.070> they're<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.460> lot

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
tear on your back so they're a lot

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.110 
tear on your back so they're a lot
healthier<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.660> shoulders<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.370> these

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
healthier for your shoulders and these

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
healthier for your shoulders and these
really<00:00:51.360> would<00:00:51.719> even<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.199> even<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.949> start

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
really would even with even if you start

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.790 
really would even with even if you start
with<00:00:53.370> no<00:00:54.149> woodworking<00:00:54.750> skills<00:00:54.899> these<00:00:55.500> boats

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
with no woodworking skills these boats

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.459 
with no woodworking skills these boats
can<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.039> built<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:57.360> well<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.930> you'll

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
can be built really well and you'll

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.000 
can be built really well and you'll
learn<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.649> lot<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.129> process<00:01:00.829> these<00:01:01.829> are

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
learn a lot in the process these are

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.369 
learn a lot in the process these are
ocean-going<00:01:02.730> sea<00:01:03.390> kayaks<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.199> they're

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
ocean-going sea kayaks and then they're

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.690 
ocean-going sea kayaks and then they're
extremely<00:01:05.010> seaworthy<00:01:06.560> I've<00:01:07.560> taken<00:01:07.890> one<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
extremely seaworthy I've taken one of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
extremely seaworthy I've taken one of
these<00:01:08.850> boats<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.420> 30<00:01:09.810> day<00:01:09.960> trip<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:10.680> to

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
these boats on a 30 day trip out to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.760 
these boats on a 30 day trip out to
Vancouver<00:01:11.700> Island<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.689> they<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.990> take<00:01:13.170> 30

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
Vancouver Island and so they can take 30

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.370 
Vancouver Island and so they can take 30
days<00:01:13.860> worth<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.310> food<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.850> capacity<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.290> all

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
days worth of food and capacity for all

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380 
days worth of food and capacity for all
your<00:01:16.530> gear<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.100> kind<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.340> stuff<00:01:17.460> so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
your gear and all that kind of stuff so

wear whatever it is you might want to do
with<00:01:20.490> your<00:01:20.640> kayak<00:01:21.000> these<00:01:21.509> are<00:01:21.780> certainly

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
with your kayak these are certainly

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.340 
with your kayak these are certainly
capable<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.570> in<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.750> process<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.320> will

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
capable of it in the process we will

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.999 
capable of it in the process we will
learn<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> bend<00:01:25.890> ribs<00:01:27.439> such<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.590> these<00:01:28.770> right

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
learn to bend ribs such as these right

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.609 
learn to bend ribs such as these right
here<00:01:29.250> through<00:01:29.640> steam<00:01:29.909> bending<00:01:30.470> we'll<00:01:31.470> learn

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
here through steam bending we'll learn

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.670 
here through steam bending we'll learn
complicated<00:01:32.189> joints<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.590> mortise<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
complicated joints like this mortise and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.460 
complicated joints like this mortise and
tenon<00:01:35.009> joint<00:01:35.280> right<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.840> we'll<00:01:37.229> last

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
tenon joint right here and we'll last

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.050 
tenon joint right here and we'll last
things<00:01:37.770> together<00:01:37.979> there's<00:01:38.579> no<00:01:38.820> metal

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
things together there's no metal

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.910 
things together there's no metal
anywhere<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> boat<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.619> boat<00:01:40.799> is

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
anywhere in this boat the boat is

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.730 
anywhere in this boat the boat is
entirely<00:01:41.310> joint<00:01:41.850> pegged<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.740> lashed

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
entirely joint pegged and lashed

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.690 
entirely joint pegged and lashed
together<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.600> amazing<00:01:46.439> how<00:01:46.590> much<00:01:46.740> an

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
together so it's a amazing how much an

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.810 
together so it's a amazing how much an
old<00:01:48.180> style<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.600> construction<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:49.320> still

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
old style of construction is still

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.039 
old style of construction is still
comparable<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.939> all<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.390> Magnificent

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049

today<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.570> boats<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.840> will<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.170> building

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
today the boats that will be building

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.300 
today the boats that will be building
will<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.740> coated<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.190> skin<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.900> nylon

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
will be coated in skin with nylon

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.380 
will be coated in skin with nylon
especially<00:01:59.310> kind<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.549> nylon<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.000> was<00:02:00.180> once

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
especially kind of nylon that was once

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.680 
especially kind of nylon that was once
used<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.720> bulletproof<00:02:01.409> vests<00:02:02.190> but<00:02:02.369> today<00:02:02.690> we

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
used in bulletproof vests but today we
