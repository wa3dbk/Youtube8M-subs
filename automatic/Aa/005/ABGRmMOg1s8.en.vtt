00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hey guys welcome back so since our last

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.809 
hey guys welcome back so since our last
episode<00:00:04.140> I<00:00:04.170> actually<00:00:04.440> did<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.830> lot<00:00:05.190> of<00:00:05.250> work<00:00:05.549> on

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
episode I actually did a lot of work on

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.179 
episode I actually did a lot of work on
the<00:00:06.299> bathhouse<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:07.470> that's<00:00:07.890> why<00:00:08.069> I'm

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
the bathhouse and so that's why I'm

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.390 
the bathhouse and so that's why I'm
starting<00:00:08.490> back<00:00:08.820> here<00:00:09.360> instead<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.960> up<00:00:10.469> at<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
starting back here instead of up at the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.100 
starting back here instead of up at the
top<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.700> elevator<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.630> reason<00:00:12.929> for<00:00:13.049> that

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
top of the elevator the reason for that

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.039 
top of the elevator the reason for that
is<00:00:13.349> because<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.679> made<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> lot<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.250> changes<00:00:15.049> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
is because I made a lot of changes to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.650 
is because I made a lot of changes to
the<00:00:16.500> bathhouse<00:00:16.680> since<00:00:17.250> our<00:00:17.369> last<00:00:17.490> episode<00:00:18.029> one

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the bathhouse since our last episode one

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.810 
the bathhouse since our last episode one
of<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:18.900> being<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:20.010> bathhouse<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.609> now

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
of them being that the bathhouse is now

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.640 
of them being that the bathhouse is now
12<00:00:21.300> blocks<00:00:21.570> longer<00:00:22.310> from<00:00:23.310> front<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.580> back<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
12 blocks longer from front to back and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.070 
12 blocks longer from front to back and
because<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.640> hallway<00:00:27.119> has<00:00:27.539> changed

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
because of that this hallway has changed

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.439 
because of that this hallway has changed
it<00:00:28.289> used<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.619> go<00:00:28.769> straight<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.730> way<00:00:29.789> now<00:00:30.240> it

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
it used to go straight that way now it

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.490 
it used to go straight that way now it
goes<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.840> way<00:00:30.900> an<00:00:31.320> extra<00:00:31.920> 12<00:00:32.160> blocks<00:00:33.500> anyway

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
goes this way an extra 12 blocks anyway

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.040 
goes this way an extra 12 blocks anyway
didn't<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.190> doesn't<00:00:35.730> change<00:00:35.880> much<00:00:36.149> movie

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
didn't really doesn't change much movie

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.010 
didn't really doesn't change much movie
wise<00:00:37.579> it<00:00:38.579> still<00:00:38.850> makes<00:00:39.030> sense<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.840> just

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
wise it still makes sense if you just

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.780 
wise it still makes sense if you just
change<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> angle<00:00:40.739> from<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.340> way<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
change the angle from that way to this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.430 
change the angle from that way to this
way<00:00:43.760> but<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.000> allowed<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.570> lot<00:00:45.930> more<00:00:46.170> things

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
way but it allowed for a lot more things

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.110 
way but it allowed for a lot more things
to<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.620> added<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.430> make<00:00:47.550> room<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.969> lot<00:00:48.090> of

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
to be added to make room for a lot of

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.639 
to be added to make room for a lot of
things<00:00:48.390> anyway

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
things anyway

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.600 
things anyway

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
with office and I worked for a while to

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.680 
with office and I worked for a while to
figure<00:05:05.220> out<00:05:05.340> how<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.610> make<00:05:06.150> it<00:05:06.180> so<00:05:06.479> that<00:05:06.510> you

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
figure out how to make it so that you

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.500 
figure out how to make it so that you
can

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
can

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.300 
can
stop<00:05:08.200> and<00:05:08.530> then<00:05:08.970> continue<00:05:10.650> but<00:05:11.650> what<00:05:12.280> I

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
stop and then continue but what I

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.420 
stop and then continue but what I
figured<00:05:12.700> out<00:05:12.820> was<00:05:12.880> just<00:05:13.450> a<00:05:13.810> button<00:05:14.220> for<00:05:15.220> the

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
figured out was just a button for the

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.100 
figured out was just a button for the
guest<00:05:15.610> rooms<00:05:15.790> and<00:05:15.940> a<00:05:16.000> button<00:05:16.300> for<00:05:16.570> you<00:05:16.630> Baba's

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
guest rooms and a button for you Baba's

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.530 
guest rooms and a button for you Baba's
office<00:05:17.440> so<00:05:17.830> there's<00:05:18.280> two<00:05:18.460> floors<00:05:18.670> and<00:05:19.090> you

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
office so there's two floors and you

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.940 
office so there's two floors and you
have<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.810> choose<00:05:20.080> which<00:05:20.380> one<00:05:20.560> you<00:05:20.650> want<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.860> go

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
have to choose which one you want to go

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.690 
have to choose which one you want to go
to<00:05:21.040> from<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.430> bottom<00:05:21.700> and<00:05:23.280> so<00:05:24.280> if<00:05:24.460> we<00:05:24.580> go<00:05:24.670> to

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
to from the bottom and so if we go to

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.180 
to from the bottom and so if we go to
the<00:05:24.880> guest<00:05:25.030> rooms<00:05:25.590> it<00:05:26.590> looks<00:05:26.770> like<00:05:26.950> it<00:05:27.070> does

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
the guest rooms it looks like it does

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.040 
the guest rooms it looks like it does
the<00:05:27.400> movie<00:05:27.670> just<00:05:28.060> a<00:05:28.180> bunch<00:05:28.360> of<00:05:30.870> long-haul<00:05:31.870> away

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.200 
the movie just a bunch of long-haul away
and<00:05:32.290> these<00:05:32.890> are<00:05:33.220> this<00:05:33.460> is<00:05:33.610> white<00:05:33.850> stained

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210

it's<00:06:00.010> gone<00:06:00.160> over<00:06:00.310> a<00:06:00.460> lot<00:06:00.880> of<00:06:01.050> redesigning<00:06:02.050> and

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
it's gone over a lot of redesigning and

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
basically I think I will save this area

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.000 
basically I think I will save this area
for<00:06:08.110> next<00:06:08.410> episode<00:06:08.830> and<00:06:10.350> kind<00:06:11.350> of<00:06:11.410> explain<00:06:11.800> how

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
for next episode and kind of explain how

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.430 
for next episode and kind of explain how
this<00:06:12.250> a<00:06:12.630> two-part<00:06:13.630> elevator<00:06:14.020> or<00:06:14.170> this<00:06:14.320> two

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
this a two-part elevator or this two

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.960 
this a two-part elevator or this two
floor<00:06:14.650> elevator<00:06:14.980> works<00:06:15.250> basically<00:06:15.550> it's<00:06:15.910> just

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
floor elevator works basically it's just

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.820 
floor elevator works basically it's just
a<00:06:16.690> set<00:06:17.230> of<00:06:17.350> Pistons<00:06:17.620> that<00:06:18.040> push<00:06:18.640> these<00:06:18.940> blocks

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
a set of Pistons that push these blocks

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.670 
a set of Pistons that push these blocks
here<00:06:20.830> so<00:06:20.860> that<00:06:21.310> it<00:06:21.430> blocks<00:06:22.300> you<00:06:22.540> from<00:06:22.680> being

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
here so that it blocks you from being

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.330 
here so that it blocks you from being
automatically<00:06:24.370> ejected<00:06:25.060> out<00:06:25.300> here<00:06:26.110> so<00:06:26.830> when

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
automatically ejected out here so when

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.310 
automatically ejected out here so when
you<00:06:27.370> when<00:06:27.730> you<00:06:27.790> press<00:06:28.030> the<00:06:28.210> top<00:06:28.390> button<00:06:28.450> it

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
you when you press the top button it

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.890 
you when you press the top button it
pushes<00:06:29.800> these<00:06:29.920> out<00:06:30.190> and<00:06:30.520> makes<00:06:31.390> you<00:06:31.540> continue

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
pushes these out and makes you continue

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.480

all<00:06:32.020> the<00:06:32.050> way<00:06:32.200> to<00:06:32.260> the<00:06:32.410> top<00:06:32.620> when<00:06:33.220> you<00:06:33.310> press

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
all the way to the top when you press

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.910 
all the way to the top when you press
the<00:06:33.640> bottom<00:06:33.940> one<00:06:34.090> it<00:06:34.240> doesn't<00:06:34.510> eject<00:06:34.750> or<00:06:35.410> push

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
the bottom one it doesn't eject or push

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.830 
the bottom one it doesn't eject or push
these<00:06:36.070> out<00:06:36.310> and<00:06:36.490> you<00:06:37.000> get<00:06:37.150> automatically

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
these out and you get automatically

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.080 
these out and you get automatically
ejected<00:06:38.350> so<00:06:38.590> that's<00:06:39.250> how<00:06:39.550> it<00:06:39.730> works

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
ejected so that's how it works

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.500 
ejected so that's how it works
and<00:06:40.770> it's<00:06:41.770> pretty<00:06:42.070> pretty<00:06:42.580> simple<00:06:42.850> it<00:06:43.390> was

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
and it's pretty pretty simple it was

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:47.190 
and it's pretty pretty simple it was
really<00:06:43.720> hard<00:06:43.930> to<00:06:43.990> to<00:06:44.920> wire<00:06:45.130> it<00:06:45.400> but<00:06:46.120> figured<00:06:47.050> it

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.200 
really hard to to wire it but figured it

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.910 
really hard to to wire it but figured it
out<00:06:47.350> so<00:06:48.600> next<00:06:49.600> episode<00:06:50.050> we<00:06:50.200> will<00:06:50.350> continue

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:50.920
