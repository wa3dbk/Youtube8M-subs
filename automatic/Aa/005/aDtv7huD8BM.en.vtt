00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.649 
I really like the one for this mascara
because<00:01:43.920> I've<00:01:44.220> been<00:01:44.250> using<00:01:44.670> my<00:01:45.180> covergirl

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
because I've been using my covergirl

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.750 
because I've been using my covergirl
LashBlast<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.619> it's<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.860> rubber<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.640> this

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
LashBlast and it's a rubber one and this

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.200 
LashBlast and it's a rubber one and this
one<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.060> actually<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.479> fiber<00:01:49.280> type<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.400> one<00:01:50.610> we

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
one is actually a fiber type of one we

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.230 
one is actually a fiber type of one we
just<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:51.840> nice<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.970> I'm<00:01:54.060> just

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
just really really nice so I'm just

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:04.860 
just really really nice so I'm just
gonna<00:01:54.390> rock<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.840> on<00:01:56.990> my<00:01:57.990> lashes

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.810 

so<00:02:05.870> that's<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.800> is<00:02:06.950> what<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:07.280> looks<00:02:07.580> like

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
so that's that is what it looks like

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.710 
so that's that is what it looks like
after<00:02:08.090> one<00:02:08.720> coat<00:02:09.350> of<00:02:09.410> mascara<00:02:10.360> now<00:02:11.360> I<00:02:11.390> gotta

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
after one coat of mascara now I gotta

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.330 
after one coat of mascara now I gotta
say<00:02:12.110> um<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:14.060> holds<00:02:14.600> curl<00:02:15.050> extremely<00:02:15.860> well<00:02:16.040> but

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
say um it holds curl extremely well but

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.090 
say um it holds curl extremely well but
it<00:02:16.460> doesn't<00:02:16.730> give<00:02:16.940> as<00:02:17.090> much<00:02:17.240> volume<00:02:17.540> as<00:02:18.100> this

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
it doesn't give as much volume as this

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.860 
it doesn't give as much volume as this
other<00:02:19.340> mascara<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:19.880> i<00:02:20.030> will<00:02:20.210> be<00:02:20.330> using<00:02:20.480> and

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
other mascara that i will be using and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.090 
other mascara that i will be using and
it<00:02:20.930> doesn't<00:02:21.200> give<00:02:21.320> as<00:02:21.440> much<00:02:21.590> volume<00:02:21.860> as

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
it doesn't give as much volume as

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.430 
it doesn't give as much volume as
covering<00:02:22.730> your<00:02:22.790> lash<00:02:23.030> blast<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:24.080> i<00:02:24.110> really

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
covering your lash blast but i really

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.470 
covering your lash blast but i really
really<00:02:24.560> like<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.100> if<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.250> want<00:02:25.460> to<00:02:25.610> give<00:02:25.820> your

it's<00:02:37.730> really<00:02:38.000> good<00:02:38.270> for<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.510> bottom<00:02:38.690> lashes<00:02:39.020> i

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
it's really good for the bottom lashes i

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.980 
it's really good for the bottom lashes i
think<00:02:39.650> because<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.430> one<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.850> not<00:02:41.030> too<00:02:41.690> big<00:02:41.959> and

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
think because the one is not too big and

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:52.900 
think because the one is not too big and
it's<00:02:42.320> not<00:02:42.530> hard<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.890> use<00:02:43.220> on<00:02:43.480> lower<00:02:44.480> lashes

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.240 

so<00:02:53.510> that's<00:02:53.690> what<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:53.930> looks<00:02:54.260> like<00:02:54.470> after<00:02:54.710> one

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
so that's what it looks like after one

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.860 
so that's what it looks like after one
coat<00:02:57.250> I'll<00:02:58.250> take<00:02:58.490> a<00:02:58.550> picture<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.210> post<00:02:59.660> it

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
coat I'll take a picture and post it

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:08.460 
coat I'll take a picture and post it
right<00:03:00.290> now

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.630 

alright<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:09.770> now<00:03:09.950> I'm<00:03:10.040> going<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.250> move<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:10.610> to

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
alright so now I'm going to move on to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.920 
alright so now I'm going to move on to
this<00:03:11.540> one<00:03:11.930> right<00:03:12.200> here<00:03:12.370> so<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:14.240> brush<00:03:14.630> is

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
this one right here so the brush is

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.800 
this one right here so the brush is
actually<00:03:15.650> curve<00:03:16.130> so<00:03:17.060> it's<00:03:17.210> quite<00:03:17.510> different

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
actually curve so it's quite different

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.810 
actually curve so it's quite different
and<00:03:18.200> it's<00:03:18.670> very<00:03:19.670> bendable<00:03:20.980> but<00:03:21.980> I<00:03:22.010> don't<00:03:22.250> see

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
and it's very bendable but I don't see

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.230 
and it's very bendable but I don't see
the<00:03:22.940> point<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.300> that<00:03:23.360> but<00:03:23.780> really<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:26.030> brush

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
the point of that but really the brush

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.200 
the point of that but really the brush
is<00:03:26.450> curve<00:03:27.080> right<00:03:27.380> like<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.760> usually

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
is curve right like that so I usually

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.930 
is curve right like that so I usually
apply<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.600> this<00:03:30.140> way<00:03:30.440> up<00:03:30.740> so<00:03:31.610> I'm<00:03:31.670> just<00:03:31.820> going

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
apply it this way up so I'm just going

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.410 
apply it this way up so I'm just going
to<00:03:32.030> apply<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:33.620> mascara<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:37.640> brush<00:03:37.970> is<00:03:38.000> lower

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
to apply the mascara the brush is lower

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.830 
to apply the mascara the brush is lower
than<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.110> other<00:03:39.290> one<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:40.210> that's<00:03:41.210> why<00:03:41.540> it's<00:03:41.750> a

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
than the other one and that's why it's a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.600 
than the other one and that's why it's a
little<00:03:42.110> bit<00:03:42.700> more<00:03:43.780> tricky<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:46.100> apply<00:03:46.580> the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
little bit more tricky to apply the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.150 
little bit more tricky to apply the
mascara<00:03:47.350> because<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.590> don't<00:03:48.770> really<00:03:48.860> like

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
mascara because you don't really like

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.250 
mascara because you don't really like
blah<00:03:49.550> bit<00:03:49.790> which<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.150> always<00:03:50.540> do<00:03:53.260> the

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
blah bit which I always do the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.890 
blah bit which I always do the
formulation<00:03:54.860> is<00:03:55.010> a<00:03:55.040> little<00:03:55.490> more<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:56.030> wet<00:03:56.480> but

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
formulation is a little more of wet but

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.710 
formulation is a little more of wet but
it<00:03:57.860> doesn't<00:03:58.340> weigh<00:03:59.090> down<00:03:59.270> my<00:03:59.450> lashes

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
it doesn't weigh down my lashes

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.350 
it doesn't weigh down my lashes
whatsoever<00:04:03.100> if<00:04:04.100> anything<00:04:04.730> had<00:04:05.000> actually

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
whatsoever if anything had actually

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.120 
whatsoever if anything had actually
helped<00:04:05.660> curl<00:04:06.110> it<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.320> little<00:04:06.530> bit<00:04:06.710> because<00:04:06.830> of

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
helped curl it a little bit because of

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:21.650 
helped curl it a little bit because of
the<00:04:07.280> shape<00:04:07.580> of<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.790> one

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.190 

so<00:04:22.290> I<00:04:22.320> can<00:04:22.560> totally<00:04:22.800> see<00:04:23.370> right<00:04:23.640> now<00:04:23.670> that<00:04:24.200> the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
so I can totally see right now that the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.160 
so I can totally see right now that the
falsies<00:04:25.920> mascara<00:04:26.160> actually<00:04:26.910> give<00:04:27.170> more

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
falsies mascara actually give more

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.800 
falsies mascara actually give more
length<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:29.390> don't<00:04:30.390> know<00:04:30.450> if<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:30.600> can<00:04:30.690> actually

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
length I don't know if you can actually

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.010 
length I don't know if you can actually
see<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.290> difference<00:04:31.710> but<00:04:32.010> to<00:04:32.250> me<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.840> kind<00:04:33.840> of

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
see the difference but to me is kind of

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.010 
see the difference but to me is kind of
different<00:04:34.170> I<00:04:34.680> mean<00:04:34.980> not<00:04:35.010> that<00:04:35.250> much<00:04:35.760> but<00:04:36.150> if

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
different I mean not that much but if

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.370 
different I mean not that much but if
you<00:04:37.140> want<00:04:37.320> to<00:04:37.410> be<00:04:37.530> really<00:04:37.830> nitpicky<00:04:38.400> about<00:04:38.430> it

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
you want to be really nitpicky about it

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.740 
you want to be really nitpicky about it
the<00:04:40.380> only<00:04:40.700> bad<00:04:41.700> thing<00:04:41.760> about<00:04:42.030> this<00:04:42.270> mascara<00:04:42.630> is

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
the only bad thing about this mascara is

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.960 
the only bad thing about this mascara is
that<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.080> one<00:04:43.290> is<00:04:43.560> you<00:04:44.250> got<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.430> get<00:04:44.580> used<00:04:44.790> to

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
that the one is you got to get used to

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.610 
that the one is you got to get used to
it<00:04:45.150> otherwise<00:04:45.540> he<00:04:45.840> will<00:04:45.960> blab<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.290> all<00:04:46.560> over

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
it otherwise he will blab it all over

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.530 
it otherwise he will blab it all over
and<00:04:47.190> I<00:04:47.250> don't<00:04:47.430> really<00:04:47.580> like<00:04:47.700> this<00:04:48.000> mascara<00:04:48.330> for

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
and I don't really like this mascara for

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.510 
and I don't really like this mascara for
the<00:04:48.660> boat<00:04:48.870> for<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.410> bottom<00:04:49.710> lashes<00:04:49.890> because

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
the boat for the bottom lashes because

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.640 
the boat for the bottom lashes because
again<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.390> one<00:04:51.630> is<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.870> little<00:04:52.140> bit<00:04:52.290> more

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
again the one is a little bit more

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.820 
again the one is a little bit more
tricky<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.670> it's<00:04:54.540> a<00:04:54.990> little<00:04:55.200> bit<00:04:55.290> bigger<00:04:55.530> let

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
tricky and it's a little bit bigger let

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.980 
tricky and it's a little bit bigger let
me<00:04:55.950> give<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.310> comparison<00:04:56.700> of<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.300> size<00:04:57.780> of

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
me give you a comparison of the size of

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.350 
me give you a comparison of the size of
the<00:04:58.050> one<00:05:01.520> all<00:05:02.520> right

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.499 

so<00:05:05.990> this<00:05:06.710> one<00:05:07.009> is<00:05:07.159> the<00:05:07.310> falsies<00:05:07.699> mascara<00:05:07.909> and

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:08.509

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.909 
so this one is the falsies mascara and
this<00:05:09.169> one<00:05:09.469> is<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:10.069> Maybelline<00:05:10.310> lash<00:05:10.819> stiletto

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
so as you can see it is a little bit

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.610 
so as you can see it is a little bit
bigger<00:05:15.580> this<00:05:16.580> one<00:05:16.729> is<00:05:16.849> curve
