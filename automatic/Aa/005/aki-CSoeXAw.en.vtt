00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.539
 various analyzes that day at a crossroad of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.000

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.720
 both parties blamed each other 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.270
 What we are talking about is 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.119
 that one government generated all the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.120
 problems that we are living today and the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.620
 another continues where do you get

 that the problems were generated by my government 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.000

 problem generated by my government what 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.129
 deepened the match arena the casualties 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 economic growth rates and 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.750
 low levels of private investment 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.430
 come from the letrán governments in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.720
 the carts to the government sanchez cerén 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.150
 because if the government sanchez cerén 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.699

 of industry the cart in sense 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:15.360
 differently analyze reality and help 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:23.520
 to the government to this poll as he left 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:25.260
 work the carts and the 50 that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.549
 think about this judge's decision not 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.810
 had the subject of asking 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.270
 you respect the case of francisco flor 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.240

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.829
 he sent home to the house I present to you 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.960
 francisco flowers is now a clear 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.049
 example you will see how he governed the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.700
 former president candidate's flowers 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.789
 presidential party arena norman 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.950
 quijano honorary member of the party 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.330
 sand and until recently because still 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.340
 they remain a member until recently 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.960
 influential person in the decisions that 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.280
 take the game arena or see you 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.289
 as government 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.869
 see you sand have to some 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.460
 way to explain that the 80's have been made 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.899
 millions of dollars that according to the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.789
 investigation of the special commission 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.920
 investigator the legislative assembly the 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.539
 President Flores would have defrauded and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.940
 that's not going to take charge arena is going to 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.440
 say it's my fault we will remove 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.660
 another ball of larreta of the management 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.120
 public and donato I liked 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.310
 as they have tried to turn the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.440
 talk that we had initially the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.840
 fiscalía titulates its critics five years 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.549
 and a hundred days of deep lies 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.690
 he responded that they governed by 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:32.019
 decades was a lie that lasted all the 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.050
 life if it's not a hundred days that's another 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.940
 excuse more and another lie more 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.950
 and that they are the same officials that 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.959
 is 65 years old they are working 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.420
 it is the same we should say of sand 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.099
 sand ruled 20 years do not want 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.290
 take over the last 5 years of the ex 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.239
 president takes out being that he was 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.920
 Sand party president during 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.050
 those five years besides being president 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.510
 of the executive and there were officials who 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.720
 they repeated and only officials that now 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.400
 try to give recipes and formulas how 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.060
 govern when in the past they did 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.060
 and they failed 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.420
 thinks closed an unusual debate of the 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.670
 political rivals that were 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.230
 in front of the channel 20 audience 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.209
 manuel burgos news events 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.900
