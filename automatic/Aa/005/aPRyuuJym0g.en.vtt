 This is a tap delay that is newly released from Visual Sanson, though 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:13.610
 Well, it's a simple digital delay. 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.299
 Tap Tempo You can also set the delay time in real time by tap tempo 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.650
 The 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.550
 Also be set in the manual is to be able to say also directed appointment form to delay 4 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.390
 Unusual that Well are able to drink comparatively waterfall

 Frequently effect level you doing 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:31.100
 In addition to the knob called repeat delay time, that knob is tap 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:35.690
 In the other two branches for input 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:39.050
 Do you play in 8 copies or to

 You can choose the mode to play in 3 stations 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:48.829
 God of users had it in the most Hajikko become a knob over the modulation to the memorial so 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:52.190
 Well it has become the knob to that chorus thing 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.710
 In addition to that, there are two small knobs here . 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:00.600
 Tone knob This magnetic excitation tone this dust 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:05.189
 Light in the in if digital cases if wind up the and had become umami 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.729
 It will be a clear tone delay sound or if you squeeze the tone like an analog case 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:13.290
 You can also set the color to feel warm 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.320
 This switch here is the delay time in manual mode or tap mode 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.940
 It is a switch to switch something 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:26.640
 Kedomo I external input does not smoke a little It is here upside down 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:29.820
 Although the input and the output 12 are connected now and it becomes unconditional condition 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.300
 There is that in the output next to the output City 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.480
 This is to 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.330
 I can also output a beautiful sound but 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.190
 It depends on the internal switch 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:44.950
 From the output 2 input your celebration and dry sound I do not know that f 1 is a lion 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.610
 Let 's output and make it technical 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.969
 It has become a terminal called obtain the effect 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:58.390
 Another one here external tap input

 This is an external tap input and tap using an external device 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.740
 To by inputting the signal 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.310
 It is a terminal to control the delay time to the outside world 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.310
 yeah
