00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
batteries here is the first set of

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.609 
batteries here is the first set of
rechargeable<00:01:10.600> batteries<00:01:10.990> that<00:01:11.170> we<00:01:11.350> bought

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
rechargeable batteries that we bought

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.149

these are the in loops these are

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.399 
these are the in loops these are
probably<00:01:15.789> the<00:01:15.909> old<00:01:16.240> series<00:01:16.810> I<00:01:16.840> don't<00:01:17.229> think

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
probably the old series I don't think

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.319 
probably the old series I don't think
these<00:01:17.530> were<00:01:17.799> pre<00:01:18.130> charged<00:01:18.490> like<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.030> new<00:01:19.149> ones

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
these were pre charged like the new ones

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.539 
these were pre charged like the new ones
are<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:20.500> here's<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.770> little<00:01:21.039> charger<00:01:21.399> that

charge two batteries at a time or four
batteries<00:01:26.259> at<00:01:26.439> a<00:01:26.469> time<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:26.829> can't<00:01:27.039> just<00:01:27.280> do

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
batteries at a time you can't just do

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.260 
batteries at a time you can't just do
one<00:01:27.609> and<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:29.049> charged<00:01:29.710> I<00:01:30.009> want<00:01:30.219> to<00:01:30.310> say<00:01:30.520> and

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
about eight ish hours it would charge up

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.940 
about eight ish hours it would charge up
those<00:01:34.420> batteries<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.229> we<00:01:35.320> would<00:01:35.499> swap<00:01:35.770> them

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
those batteries and we would swap them

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
batteries or all the way up to the top I

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
batteries or all the way up to the top I
can<00:03:40.299> and<00:03:41.079> they<00:03:41.680> will<00:03:41.709> each<00:03:42.040> charge

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750

independently of the other batteries
another<00:03:47.169> thing<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:47.530> like<00:03:47.680> about<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:48.160> charger

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
another thing I like about this charger

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.920 
another thing I like about this charger
is<00:03:48.669> the<00:03:49.209> power<00:03:49.419> cord

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
is the power cord

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.580 
is the power cord
this<00:03:50.560> power<00:03:50.829> cord<00:03:51.190> looks<00:03:51.790> some<00:03:52.030> more<00:03:52.239> like<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
this power cord looks some more like the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.150 
this power cord looks some more like the
mouse<00:03:53.799> port<00:03:54.220> on<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.489> laptop<00:03:55.139> so<00:03:56.139> there's<00:03:56.620> no<00:03:56.949> way

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
mouse port on a laptop so there's no way

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.759 
mouse port on a laptop so there's no way
that<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.489> can<00:03:57.549> get<00:03:57.790> this<00:03:58.209> power<00:03:58.959> cord<00:03:59.290> confused

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
that I can get this power cord confused

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.420 
that I can get this power cord confused
with<00:04:00.040> any<00:04:00.340> other<00:04:00.579> power<00:04:00.879> cords<00:04:02.129> here<00:04:03.129> you<00:04:03.250> can

with any other power cords here you can

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.270 
with any other power cords here you can
see<00:04:03.699> that<00:04:04.000> we<00:04:04.299> have<00:04:04.480> all<00:04:04.780> eight<00:04:05.440> of<00:04:05.799> the

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
or not now if I already take out one

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.820 
or not now if I already take out one
battery<00:04:21.389> you'll<00:04:22.389> see<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:22.960> that<00:04:23.260> indicator

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
battery you'll see that that indicator

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.730
