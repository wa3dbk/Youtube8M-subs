00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.010
 all welcome on my channel again I 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:11.880
 me here is another video 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:16.640
 slightly in this format outdoor well wait 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.619
 the simple reason that I am on vacation and 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.980
 here is the third day at work legit 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.439
 I don't appear in a way, but in principle 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.560
 There are ideas and now, too, decided to raise 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.719
 principle video in such a blow to anyone 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.700
 format I 'm in the country something 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.469
 the sun just shone 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.280
 Now here is the smile of a cloud 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.989
 the pillar rolled overcast but in 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.800
 principle anyway pretty nice on 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:52.399
 street well and here let's a nice green 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:56.120
 Pictures moved so to speak in our 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.120
 technical world 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:10.320
 Well, as you can see another package wrapped 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:19.150
 Chinese writing another device 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:25.229
 I want to show it to you here 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:28.900
 You see, here's a plan for this device 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.430
 I don't even know how to call it digital 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.430
 Thermometer should China so suddenly 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.030
 bucks but a pretty useful thing truth 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:44.440
 now showing 34 degrees 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.360
 33 and 34 is almost a pretty thing 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.910
 useful in that company of you first you 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.070
 you can use it somewhere at home 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.550
 that is, an elementary thermo pair this 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.100
 throwing out somewhere but in everyone there behind 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.840
 the window at the door to measure and the future 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.530
 the temperature in the room can be measured 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.459
 the temperature 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:08.110
 Well, and he has a very say 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:10.680
 you can see this nice application 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.069
 here it is here for the slits such go 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.900
 on the side of such a plan for the cheeks that is 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.660
 it can be valid fix it in 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.239
 computer he is like a cat 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.310
 will be fixed on the computer and 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.790
 actually you can with his help 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.380
 die some temperature inside not 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:34.480
 Well, that is, there to reconcile and say 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.610
 CPU temperature on the video card 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.480
 there is well somewhere else inside 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.670
 hull fix it you can say on 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.700
 here is the front panel where the plugs under 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.080
 drive under the topic let's say this stub 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.840
 cut to shape 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.420
 hole here you snap and you 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.040
 there will be such a thermometer plan 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.140
 principle pretty nice pretty 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.739
 handy thing he eats from two 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.010
 items 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.930
 let's demonstrate these from 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.460
 two elements 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.400
 so let's say batteries tablet type 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.120
 Well, actually if you wish, you can 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.170
 power from the computer there comes coming 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.590
 pull the wire and place 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.800
 elements to put power from 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.060
 the computer is already such a useful one 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.810
 the thing is not cunning 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.030
 oh extremely helpful meaning you see yes 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.340
 completely dry such a thermometer is very 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.650
 convenient to use it at home 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.410
 some conditions or 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.330
 let's say in terms of the computer that is where 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.090
 something like some temperature 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.800
 very handy thing worth saying 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.750
 something quite expensive there about three 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.480
 bucks 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.530
 Well, that is, here is such 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.100
 convenient multifunction wire thing 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.620
 ku ku him for me as it probably with 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.100
 meter posting length may be shorter 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:03.230
 what is the support on the end he peeps 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.420
 again the sun here is well that is here 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.160
 here is a useful device 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:13.220
 who will be interested in a personal link 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:15.310
 I'll take off on this device but for now 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.310
 meeting
