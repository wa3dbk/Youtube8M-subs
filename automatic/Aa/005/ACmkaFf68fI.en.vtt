00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
surprised at Costa Rica play tonight I

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.410 
surprised at Costa Rica play tonight I
thought<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:03.250> large<00:01:04.250> segments<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:04.880> the<00:01:05.000> game<00:01:05.210> are

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
thought a large segments of the game are

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.570 
thought a large segments of the game are
pretty<00:01:05.630> even<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.080> they<00:01:06.230> were<00:01:06.290> obviously<00:01:07.010> more

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
pretty even and they were obviously more

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:18.960 
pretty even and they were obviously more
opportunistic<00:01:08.180> in<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.630> US

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.620 

I<00:01:19.090> think<00:01:19.780> overall<00:01:20.640> they<00:01:21.640> were<00:01:22.000> probably<00:01:22.330> the

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
I think overall they were probably the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.710 
I think overall they were probably the
better<00:01:22.780> team<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.470> for<00:01:23.680> that<00:01:23.770> matter

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
better team so for that matter

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.480 
better team so for that matter
they<00:01:26.230> probably<00:01:26.470> deserve<00:01:26.770> to<00:01:26.950> win<00:01:27.130> I<00:01:27.250> was<00:01:27.370> just

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
they probably deserve to win I was just

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.230 
they probably deserve to win I was just
a<00:01:27.610> little<00:01:27.820> bit<00:01:27.910> disappointed<00:01:28.480> that

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
a little bit disappointed that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.539 
a little bit disappointed that
you<00:01:29.750> know<00:01:29.869> we<00:01:29.990> didn't<00:01:30.259> get<00:01:30.829> one<00:01:31.009> back<00:01:31.159> and<00:01:31.430> sort

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
you know we didn't get one back and sort

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.010 
you know we didn't get one back and sort
of<00:01:31.670> give<00:01:31.790> them<00:01:31.939> you<00:01:32.479> know<00:01:32.570> put<00:01:32.750> them<00:01:32.840> under

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
of give them you know put them under

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.270 
of give them you know put them under
pressure<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.979> don't

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
pressure and you don't

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.490 
pressure and you don't
I<00:01:34.310> see<00:01:35.299> what<00:01:35.450> they<00:01:35.570> could<00:01:35.630> come<00:01:35.869> up<00:01:36.020> with<00:01:36.200> you

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
I see what they could come up with you

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.070 
I see what they could come up with you
know

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
know

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.810 
know
I<00:01:37.170> don't<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.010> don't<00:01:38.130> think<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> score<00:01:38.730> is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
I don't think I don't think the score is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.250 
I don't think I don't think the score is
indicative<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> way<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.600> played<00:01:39.870> I<00:01:39.900> think

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
indicative of the way we played I think

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.220 
indicative of the way we played I think
we've<00:01:40.350> got<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:40.680> better<00:01:40.800> than<00:01:40.980> 30<00:01:42.170> but<00:01:43.170> at

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
we've got a lot better than 30 but at

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.780 
we've got a lot better than 30 but at
the<00:01:43.290> end<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.590> day<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:44.010> you<00:01:44.070> don't

and making the bus you know and not
playing<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.470> defensive<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.010> really<00:01:59.550> getting

00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
playing so defensive and really getting

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.600 
playing so defensive and really getting
after<00:01:59.880> them<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.230> know

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
after them and they just get you know

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.440 
after them and they just get you know
333<00:02:02.610> chances<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.570> three<00:02:03.660> goal<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:04.050> know

so it's just a bad break for us but the

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.660 
so it's just a bad break for us but the
most<00:02:08.979> important<00:02:09.280> thing<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.459> that<00:02:09.489> we've

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
most important thing is that we've

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.550 
most important thing is that we've
qualified<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.300> we<00:02:10.569> like<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:11.019> said<00:02:11.170> we<00:02:11.290> just<00:02:11.440> got

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
walk there

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.140 
walk there
we<00:02:25.180> didn't<00:02:25.330> finish<00:02:25.420> our<00:02:25.600> chances<00:02:25.780> and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
we didn't finish our chances and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.330

that's<00:02:27.659> where<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> went<00:02:27.959> wrong<00:02:28.069> they<00:02:29.069> score

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
that's where I went wrong they score

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.830 
that's where I went wrong they score
great<00:02:29.549> goals<00:02:29.579> so<00:02:29.909> you<00:02:30.000> gotta<00:02:30.150> tip<00:02:30.390> your<00:02:30.420> hat<00:02:30.659> in

schools like that so

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.510 
schools like that so
some<00:02:33.360> fortunate<00:02:33.660> but
