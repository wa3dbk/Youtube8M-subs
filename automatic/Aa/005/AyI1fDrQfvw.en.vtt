00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:06.420
 an everyday scene of the stove is called 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.760
 used storage space 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.160
 the resulting danger is but 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.929
 often underestimated 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.059
 most often fires occur in the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.420
 kitchen half of all kitchens burns 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.400
 cooking is often done on the stove 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.150
 good on the switched hearth plate 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.920
 to forget 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.760
 It can be one of the most special 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.949
 dangerous fat burns are still coming 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.430
 more often, however, arises through before 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.620
 the stove turned off objects such as 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.180
 fast it in such a situation too 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 can show a fire shows the 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:44.940
 try in the lab human 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.160
 misbehavior is only the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.750
 second most common cause of fire like the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.660
 statistics of the institute for 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.879
 damage prevention time is the most common 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.399
 cause of a fire are defective 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.329
 in electrical appliances or fault in 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.940
 the electrical installation there 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.159
 example power strip not rare 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.350
 are too many consumables with 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.540
 too high a current consumption to a 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.939
 multiple power strip connected 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.689
 the bar is overloaded and will 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.689
 warm by that 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.189
 as a result of this overheating it can 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.790
 ultimately to the brand of power strip 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.790
 come 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.570
 we have the remains of a brand 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.890
 affected table power strip as 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.189
 they are barely recognizable 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.140
 There are a total of three main reasons 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.130
 to burn a tablecloth most 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.130
 being able to lead 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.229
 that is the internal error in one 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.270
 the bar often at cheap devices too 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.399
 observe where internal the contacts 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.259
 not properly in and faulty 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.959
 see which then lead to brand damage 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.149
 Then there is the electrical overload 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.069
 by connecting too many big ones 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.170
 electrical consumers to the bar 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.989
 and then there is a mechanical one 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.329
 pull action to occur 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.620
 damage to the plastic housing 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.430
 ultimately lead to one 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.430
 can cause a fire 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.480
 next to the one shown here 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.129
 tensile load is also pressure loads 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.049
 for example, by squeezing or 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:31.450
 kinking the leads potential 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:33.730
 causes for fires are electrical appliances 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.370
 It is impossible to imagine life without our lives 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.720
 a variety of useful helper is 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.329
 every day in use 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.250
 however, electrical appliances also always harbor those 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.170
 danger of a technical defect 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.190
 not least a fire hazard 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.739
 can mean 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.319
 in current investigations we have 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.150
 found out that there are drier ones 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.450
 to turn on by itself 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.359
 this is due to a broken switch 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.500
 who just supposedly turned it off 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.010
 but by, for example, light 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.690
 temperature changes in a 1 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:10.169
 position can then move on and off 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.169
 surrounding material 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.260
 we therefore recommend when not in use 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:43.060
 to pull the plug 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.269
 Many electrical appliances generate heat 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.250
 for some, this is quite obvious 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.980
 such as the iron at 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.880
 fryers or toaster but also lamps 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.880
 produce heat 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.269
 the shown fire test shows 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.069
 clearly that the temperatures the 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.160
 areas of light emerge in a position 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.750
 ignite flammable material 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.129
 Here are the indications of the luminous 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.810
 to pay attention to what the 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.739
 safety distances to this combustible 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.500
 material concerns 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.079
 the most dangerous are the heat accumulation 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.819
 especially with complete evasion 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.269
 or development of the light emerge 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.700
 can 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.560
 the temperatures then rise above 400 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.100
 grad to what a quick inflammation 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.100
 can lead
