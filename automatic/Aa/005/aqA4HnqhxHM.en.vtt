00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 Yes , I'm shopping today. I think it's new to Ito-san's new products and again today. 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.560

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:15.750
 Many of the king tea in your Hisashi

 It is that it is the smell first, but I think that you want to watch the video of that there 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.060
 Then there are eight affairs, but it is something like a touch pen 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.210
 In addition 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:29.160
 I do not know for a while what I had 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.160
 It is a pink touch pen 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:39.309
 If you do so I would like to see together from the raw material day first 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:42.120
 I think it's probably the same, but it's green tea, soft drink 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:46.070
 Raw material name is green tea Japan 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.070
 It is that vitamin c 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.920
 If you do that, it's 0 kcal 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:01:00.339
 Here 's 哀悼 hydrochloric acid 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:04.019
 It is the contents of the confectionery aroma 1st application tea of ​​the taste, but it is a normal tea and it is so 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.019
 I would like to come 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.920
 No 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.880
 that 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:20.159
 It is a home sales surge taste but firm power char 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.600
 It is a flavor , but it is a taste that you can enjoy the smell of that kind of green tea fat . 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.080
 Because 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.030
 The water I'm buying is a little different 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:34.369
 Per here it will have Yavuakaii feeling 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:38.860
 Well that's it, but it's also easy to drink with a little American feeling.

 I'm sorry , but there 's a bit of tea coming to my mind, but now I 'm stepping on it 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:59.470
 Though it is difficult to express if you put in 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:02.950
 I feel the water itself is very soft with a soft touch and a good deal of tea and this astringency 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.729
 At first it is delicious after all , but tea of moving garden 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.869
 It's about applying applied cherries first 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.259
 It's easy but I want to sleep 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.259
