and<00:00:07.360> one<00:00:07.540> thing<00:00:07.720> I<00:00:07.810> wanted<00:00:08.080> to<00:00:08.170> show<00:00:08.320> y'all<00:00:08.559> was

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.800 
and one thing I wanted to show y'all was

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.060 
and one thing I wanted to show y'all was
the<00:00:08.980> strength<00:00:09.430> of<00:00:09.760> these<00:00:10.000> claws<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.889> this

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
the strength of these claws with this

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.060 
the strength of these claws with this
urethane<00:00:12.610> casting<00:00:13.120> resin<00:00:13.299> they're<00:00:14.200> very

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
urethane casting resin they're very

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.670 
urethane casting resin they're very
strong<00:00:15.369> and<00:00:15.879> flexible<00:00:16.390> so<00:00:17.080> they<00:00:17.350> could<00:00:17.500> take<00:00:17.650> a

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
strong and flexible so they could take a

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.800 
strong and flexible so they could take a
little<00:00:17.949> bit<00:00:18.100> of<00:00:18.220> abuse<00:00:18.520> without<00:00:18.970> breaking<00:00:19.720> it

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
little bit of abuse without breaking it

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.349 
little bit of abuse without breaking it
all<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:22.210> one<00:00:23.820> I'll<00:00:24.820> show<00:00:25.179> you<00:00:25.240> a

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
all this one I'll show you a

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:33.540 
all this one I'll show you a
demonstration<00:00:30.210> all<00:00:31.210> right<00:00:31.950> see<00:00:32.950> how<00:00:33.130> much<00:00:33.310> I'm

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
demonstration all right see how much I'm

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:42.090 
demonstration all right see how much I'm
bending<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:39.960> okay<00:00:40.960> that's<00:00:41.500> pretty<00:00:41.770> strong

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
bending it okay that's pretty strong

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.010 
bending it okay that's pretty strong
stuff<00:00:44.160> now<00:00:45.160> of<00:00:45.340> course<00:00:45.520> I<00:00:45.940> wouldn't<00:00:46.720> recommend

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
stuff now of course I wouldn't recommend

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.190 
stuff now of course I wouldn't recommend
doing<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:49.450> your<00:00:49.660> claws

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
doing that with your claws

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.440 
doing that with your claws
you'll<00:00:50.620> end<00:00:50.860> up<00:00:50.980> with<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.250> little<00:00:51.970> deformed

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
you'll end up with a little deformed

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.730 
you'll end up with a little deformed
claw<00:00:52.840> and<00:00:53.140> what<00:00:53.710> you'll<00:00:53.860> notice<00:00:55.470> with<00:00:56.470> the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
claw and what you'll notice with the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.670 
claw and what you'll notice with the
casting<00:00:57.370> powder<00:00:57.550> service<00:00:58.150> as<00:00:58.780> you<00:00:59.200> do<00:00:59.530> that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
casting powder service as you do that

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.610 
casting powder service as you do that
the<00:00:59.890> surface<00:01:00.310> of<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.580> resin<00:01:00.970> actually

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
the surface of the resin actually

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.799 
the surface of the resin actually
spreads<00:01:02.620> apart<00:01:02.770> and<00:01:03.310> it'll<00:01:04.000> pull<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.210> casting

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
spreads apart and it'll pull the casting

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.240 
spreads apart and it'll pull the casting
powder<00:01:04.960> apart<00:01:05.409> you'll<00:01:05.650> end<00:01:05.799> up<00:01:05.920> with<00:01:06.070> some

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
powder apart you'll end up with some

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.090 
powder apart you'll end up with some
wrinkles<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.450> definitely<00:01:08.020> don't<00:01:08.200> do<00:01:08.440> that<00:01:08.680> on

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
wrinkles so definitely don't do that on

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.120 
wrinkles so definitely don't do that on
purpose<00:01:10.050> all<00:01:11.050> right<00:01:11.230> one<00:01:11.440> other<00:01:11.560> thing<00:01:11.830> I<00:01:11.920> want

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
purpose all right one other thing I want

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.540 
purpose all right one other thing I want
to<00:01:12.190> show<00:01:12.340> you<00:01:12.400> is<00:01:12.820> a<00:01:13.750> test<00:01:14.500> for<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.130> strength

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
to show you is a test for the strength

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.570 
to show you is a test for the strength
of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.960> wire<00:01:17.230> that's<00:01:17.710> coming<00:01:18.160> out<00:01:18.280> of<00:01:18.310> your

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
of the wire that's coming out of your

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.360 
of the wire that's coming out of your
claw<00:01:21.240> like<00:01:22.240> any<00:01:22.540> wire<00:01:22.840> if<00:01:23.200> you<00:01:23.680> repeatedly

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
claw like any wire if you repeatedly

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.940 
claw like any wire if you repeatedly
bend<00:01:24.760> it<00:01:24.970> in<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.330> same<00:01:25.510> spot<00:01:25.870> it<00:01:26.680> will

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
bend it in the same spot it will

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.640 
bend it in the same spot it will
eventually<00:01:27.250> break<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:29.110> don't<00:01:29.290> really<00:01:29.440> have

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
eventually break you don't really have

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.000 
eventually break you don't really have
to<00:01:29.800> worry<00:01:30.010> about<00:01:30.190> that<00:01:30.580> with<00:01:31.510> normal<00:01:32.050> use<00:01:32.290> on

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
to worry about that with normal use on

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.490 
to worry about that with normal use on
your<00:01:33.340> claws<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.840> I<00:01:34.900> would<00:01:35.200> not<00:01:35.380> recommend

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.770 

fitting<00:01:38.500> them<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:39.720> several<00:01:40.720> different<00:01:41.080> people

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
fitting them to several different people

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.200 
fitting them to several different people
with<00:01:43.890> completely<00:01:44.890> different<00:01:45.040> sized<00:01:45.580> hands

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
with completely different sized hands

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.960 
with completely different sized hands
you<00:01:46.960> bend<00:01:47.200> them<00:01:47.350> back<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.770> forth<00:01:48.010> enough<00:01:48.670> and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
you bend them back and forth enough and

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.550 
you bend them back and forth enough and
like<00:01:49.150> I<00:01:49.180> said<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.600> will<00:01:49.690> break<00:01:49.930> so<00:01:51.240> there's<00:01:52.560> one

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
like I said it will break so there's one

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.500 
like I said it will break so there's one
Bend<00:01:53.860> like<00:01:54.100> we<00:01:54.340> would<00:01:54.460> normally<00:01:54.610> make<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.330> fit

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
Bend like we would normally make to fit

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.990 
Bend like we would normally make to fit
the<00:01:55.659> claw<00:01:55.870> if<00:01:56.799> you<00:01:56.979> bend<00:01:57.220> it<00:01:57.370> back<00:01:57.549> in<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
the claw if you bend it back in the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the claw if you bend it back in the
completely<00:01:58.450> opposite<00:01:59.110> direction<00:02:00.000> okay

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.260 

as<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.200> can<00:02:33.260> see<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:33.710> pretty<00:02:33.890> strong<00:02:34.310> you

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
as you can see it's pretty strong you

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.820 
as you can see it's pretty strong you
shouldn't<00:02:35.600> really<00:02:35.690> have<00:02:35.930> any<00:02:36.110> problems<00:02:36.590> with

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
shouldn't really have any problems with

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.020 
shouldn't really have any problems with
it<00:02:38.200> one<00:02:39.200> thing<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.500> will<00:02:39.740> say<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:40.400> did<00:02:40.640> happen<00:02:40.820> to

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
it one thing I will say it did happen to

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.510 
it one thing I will say it did happen to
me<00:02:41.180> one<00:02:41.360> time<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.870> as<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.710> was<00:02:42.740> bending<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.370> I

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
me one time is as I was bending it I

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.740 
me one time is as I was bending it I
nicked<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.420> wire<00:02:45.190> with<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.240> you<00:02:47.240> know<00:02:47.270> with<00:02:47.510> the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
nicked the wire with a you know with the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.320 
nicked the wire with a you know with the
wire<00:02:48.650> cutter<00:02:49.040> parts<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:50.180> my<00:02:50.360> pliers<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:52.330> where

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
wire cutter parts of my pliers and where

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.150 
wire cutter parts of my pliers and where
I<00:02:53.360> nicked<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.990> wire<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:55.070> forced<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:57.770> one<00:02:58.010> of

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
I nicked the wire it forced the one of

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.680 
I nicked the wire it forced the one of
the<00:02:58.720> wire<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.750> bend<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.500> one<00:03:00.830> spot<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.690> you

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
the wire to bend in that one spot so you

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.810 
the wire to bend in that one spot so you
definitely<00:03:03.350> don't<00:03:03.530> want<00:03:03.740> to<00:03:03.800> do<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.130> because

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
definitely don't want to do that because

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.660 
definitely don't want to do that because
now<00:03:05.390> it'll<00:03:06.080> Bend<00:03:06.290> in<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.620> one<00:03:06.860> spot<00:03:07.190> and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
now it'll Bend in that one spot and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.100 
now it'll Bend in that one spot and
it'll<00:03:08.120> break<00:03:08.300> a<00:03:08.630> lot<00:03:09.500> easier<00:03:10.690> than<00:03:11.690> if<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
it'll break a lot easier than if the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.010 
it'll break a lot easier than if the
wire<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.320> intact<00:03:12.920> without<00:03:13.310> any<00:03:13.580> Nicks<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.780> keep

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
wire is intact without any Nicks so keep

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.740 
wire is intact without any Nicks so keep
that<00:03:15.200> in<00:03:15.260> mind<00:03:15.670> if<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.880> have<00:03:17.030> any<00:03:17.209> feedback<00:03:17.480> or

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750
