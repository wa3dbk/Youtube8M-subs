00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.380 
Linna they went all over the place now
that<00:02:06.270> was<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.659> close<00:02:07.079> range<00:02:07.910> you<00:02:08.910> step<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
that was that close range you step a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.420 
that was that close range you step a
little<00:02:09.420> bit<00:02:09.840> farther<00:02:10.140> back<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:13.739> gets<00:02:13.920> much

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
little bit farther back and it gets much

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.320 
little bit farther back and it gets much
much<00:02:14.970> worse<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.530> probably<00:02:16.890> about

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
much worse and this is probably about

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.509 
much worse and this is probably about
double<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.360> distance<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.800> look<00:02:22.980> where<00:02:23.310> those

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
double the distance and look where those

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.820 
double the distance and look where those
bullets<00:02:23.970> land<00:02:24.239> they<00:02:24.660> went<00:02:24.959> all<00:02:25.170> over<00:02:25.200> I<00:02:25.590> got
