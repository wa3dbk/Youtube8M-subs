00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
construction of the wing which was a

very thin wing constructed in such a

very thin wing constructed in such a

by the design of the wing spar and at
one<00:01:18.830> time<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.340> was<00:01:19.490> thought<00:01:19.759> that<00:01:20.060> would<00:01:20.180> be

one time it was thought that would be
impossible<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.869> put<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:21.200> into<00:01:21.409> mass

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
of the war I can understand the modern

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.199 
of the war I can understand the modern
pilot<00:02:11.330> looking<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.200> askance<00:02:13.130> at<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.550> Spitfire

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
and of course I can tell you my answer

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
Spitfire was designed for the war as

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.160 
Spitfire was designed for the war as

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
frankly it was the most outstanding
