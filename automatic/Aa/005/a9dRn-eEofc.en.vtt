00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.630
 current 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.710
 how can you see 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.670
 the USB 2.0 cable to be able to connect it to 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.560
 the computer or power adapter 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.560
 standard headphones 3.5 mm 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.980
 we also have a screen protector 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.500
 which includes the brand yes we can see 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.360

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.270
 and a small manual 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.360
 on how to open the phone and how 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 place the tape 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.409
 we are going to place this here and we are going to 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.659
 place the battery 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.229
 let's find the slot to open the 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.400
 phone that is here on the right side 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.690
 near the rest button 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.690
 let's take out the battery 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.760
 remember that here is the slot for 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.850

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.300
 tape 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.440
 similar normal as we can see 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.790
 of a normal size 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.790
 we put the cover 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.970
 and we are going to remove the protector 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.970
 let's show our model 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.230
 let's go let's go the classic screen of 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.230
 movistar 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.890
 we hope our model turns on 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:52.210
 the phone has an internal memory of 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.590
 4gb 2.8 are used for data of the 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.630
 user and 1.2 gigabytes are 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.760
 specifically for applications the 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.260
 microprocessor is a dual core of 1 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.340
 giga hertz and the ram memory of 512 the 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.000
 expandable memory can be done up 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.000
 64 gigabytes 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.750
 as we can see around here is the camera 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.110
 of 5 megapixels and the front camera or 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.260
 secondary 1.3 megapixel with the 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.490
 ability to record video also both 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.400
 cameras 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.500
 here on the right side we find the 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.660
 rest button 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.350
 on the left side we find the 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.350
 volume buttons 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.790
 here we find the buttons 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.150
 classics and up here we find 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.540
 the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.740
 USB port with the input also from 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.130
 headphones 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.680
 begins the initial we see as in the 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.240
 first screen we give next 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.840
 remember that we have placed no 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.390
 SIM card 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.340
 we place the automatic time zone 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.709
 to recognize our region 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.900
 we could set up a wifi network or the 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.770
 mobile network of our tape 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.640
 in this case we are going to leave the 2 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:20.109
 since you will use your service with a 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.469
 plan 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.110
 a mobile prepaid movistar we configure 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:27.819
 a wifi network to be able to do the 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.939
 corresponding configurations we are going to 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:33.360
 configure one as following we see that 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:36.219
 it is already configured and we give it in 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.580
 end gives us a message 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.349
 welcome 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.569
 and we are ready within the system 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:45.259
 operative let's go to 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:47.210
 settings or settings we're going 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.370
 down and we look about the 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.860
 device 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.979
 we give a touch and so we find the 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:00.760
 Android version as you can see the 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.760
 version is 4.4 points 2 or kit kat 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.520
 once again remembering that being this 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.770
 an android operating system you must 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.960
 set up your gmail account to be able to 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.420
 make downloads from the store what 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.040
 otherwise it will not allow you to do otherwise 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.310
 you have one gives you the opportunity to 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.630
 create it equally to be able to enjoy all 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.000
 the benefits offered by the system 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.390
 operative it would be best if you create a 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.480
 realize that now we already know a little 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.190
 more about the new andy 5 and remember 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.170
 that you can find this or more 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.200
