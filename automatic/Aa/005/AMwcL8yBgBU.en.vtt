 now the race we are going to see 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.710
 the race historically does not degrade the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.280
 friends what happens that the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.539
 Americans, the Yankees 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.840
 approximately about 80 years we 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.390
 they took from a Mediterranean acronym and 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.280
 they put this nickname is this 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.809
 race name is actually a 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.030
 miniature comes from a race that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.609
 sure you know it belongs to the islands of 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.829
 courts of a sicily sardinia that now 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.450
 same in the area the little caps more 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.120
 small ones are extinct 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.250
 they do not exist and what are the 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.020
 which thrown to the cross of these 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.910
 adult burritos 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.860
 well look at the miniature hats and 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.770
 some associations where they are registered 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.640
 and others like the miniature and has 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.560
 to be below 90 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.750
 centimeters on the cross so that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.850
 reconsider 90-91 so you 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.330
 consider a miniature and we have them 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.860
 up to 63 65 centimeters the most 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.190
 little ones that exist that call them 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.140
 millimeters and miniatures 60 centimeters 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.390
 of salt is a pin how much that weighs 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.820
 because the animal can begin environments 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.650
 adults I can have a weight by 50 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.200
 55 kilos approximately 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.390
 these burritos you raise them dream 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.450
 dear how many do you have then I have 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.920
 approximately fourteen fifteen 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.690
 or less now I am having labor on 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.880
 the spring summer time when 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.040
 I have new new births then 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.290
 I have wide before yesterday was born one 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.540
 hired someone thought of doing 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.800
 mules of these burritos they are still 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.260
 I know people because of the people that I eat 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.120
 and of course they have these are 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.600
 less adjusted with the horse in 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.600
 miniature 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.410
 Argentine and similar have not gotten in 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.320
 the miniature wall of course but what 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.960
 really wonderful thing and for what 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.730
 has people a miniature hamburg 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.920
 so you buy if you sell them 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.170
 so that he buys you 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.780
 has a miniature donkey simply 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.840
 to rejoice with wonder to 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.910
 me to the aesthetic that is a donkey I do not love 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.520
 the donkeys and the mule is considered that you 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.470
 It's a pet you have in your house 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.630
 just like you can have a dog from another 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.980
 animal this the donkey can be had in 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.220
 a garden because I have enough 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.680
 space and have them caprice 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.240
 it's just not unusual that they lived 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.180
 work someone can put a 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.370
 cart to walk to walk with 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.840
 but they can not ride on them 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.910
 almost not children because not all have 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.740
 the ground understands this because if by 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.840
 height that has what color is the 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.060
 Fur, they never inhabit it 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.550
 the variety of layers is very large since 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.050
 donkeys that are completely black to 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.480
 donkeys that are white and some 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.670
 appear albinos concretely in a 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.280
 island where it is characterized is called thus 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.100
 nothing that is in the north in the north of 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.200
 Sardinia because there was a line there 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.120
 Miniature donkeys with flowers there 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.270
 we call pink of course yes clear 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.370
 friends and they have red eyes and they are 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.280
 white full coat with albino 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.640
 total if you have them from brown in 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.500
 gray and almost all the cross as 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.930
 the more clearly they are marked more still 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.420
 the cross of this characteristic of the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.160
 donkeys or directly without the Herran 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.470
 to err walk around the world 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.700
 we do not cling to each other 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.489
 because as they do not work 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.160
 the problem of foot wear is 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.100
 a joke concretely the opposite 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.620
 we have to cut the helmets because 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.890
 continuously when once a year 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.080
 also and as it is stains are advanced 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.500
 as we say here in Argentina only 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.630
 obviously from below but they are tamed with 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.470
 what the Argentine Creole says with the 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.140
 rib 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.690
 and the flannel is to say the contact from 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.930
 very small with the human being touching him 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.150
 and allowing you to take confidence with 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.980
 the manoseo by looks with donkeys with what 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.770
 which is very gentle, very affable character 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.720
 Of course, most of them do not have 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.330
 are subjected to mistreatment are very 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.520
 given to become very familiar with the 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.070
 people but from the time you are little you have 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.160
 tried to do have with contact with 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.020
 the people this is increase let's say 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.210
 the docility of the animal I'm going to do 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.800
 a question that I never do I have 30 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.590
 years of radio and television and I 've never 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.800
 made to the air but I am very interested 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.320
 how much is a miniature donkey worth these 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.210
 animals here in Spain are still 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.940
 very little known animals is an animal 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.950
 and friends the exotic within what is 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.710
 used as pets is very varied 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.820
 price is between 2,000 and 6000 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.490
 euros of an animal of these 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.120
 characteristics and they have a tab and 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.889
 pedigree friends who are enrolled in 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.050
 an association and they have a card with 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.620
 logical genius with the ancestors in 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:21.650
 where, above all, the measures or 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.210
 the heights of grandparents my grandparents 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.180
 well up a lot of generations 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.539
 back are very long lived if the 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.580
 behavior life expectancy and 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:32.900
 other is like a normal donkey like no 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.650
 They are subject to a lot of work for 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.779
 they come to live between 40 years 30-40 years 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:43.069
 without much difficulty if there are no problems 

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:46.370
 of crosses have a foal for paris 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:48.740
 I do not even eleven months and peak of gestation 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.199
 that has an exact normal donkey many 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.229
 Sometimes this extends even to the 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:57.830
 twelve and a half thirteen months if it is 11 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.479
 year and sometimes you do not have one for 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.729
 year because the seasons take a 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.740
 little and then the conditions there are always 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.289
 a few small pieces of the discovered 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.539
