anything<00:01:09.030> with<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.689> multiply<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
anything with it to multiply it

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.570 
anything with it to multiply it
that's<00:01:11.970> essentially<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.170> those<00:01:13.470> who<00:01:13.860> say<00:01:14.280> we

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
that's essentially what those who say we

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.940 
that's essentially what those who say we
need<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.909> stop<00:01:15.180> using<00:01:15.210> oil<00:01:15.840> coal<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.619> natural

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
need to stop using oil coal and natural

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.950 
need to stop using oil coal and natural
gas<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.610> telling<00:01:17.850> us<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.659> leave

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
gas are telling us to do just leave

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.740 
gas are telling us to do just leave
those<00:01:19.290> those<00:01:19.799> resources<00:01:20.520> buried<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
those those resources buried in the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440 
those those resources buried in the
ground<00:01:21.960> rather<00:01:22.650> than<00:01:23.130> pulling<00:01:23.909> them<00:01:24.090> out<00:01:24.180> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
ground rather than pulling them out and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.690 
ground rather than pulling them out and
multiplying<00:01:25.290> their<00:01:25.770> value<00:01:26.280> for<00:01:26.549> human

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
multiplying their value for human

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.230 
multiplying their value for human
benefit<00:01:28.250> yeah<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.520> that's<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.090> they're

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
benefit yeah that that's what they're

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
benefit yeah that that's what they're
saying<00:01:30.450> because<00:01:30.780> when<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.380> pull<00:01:31.650> them<00:01:31.979> out<00:01:32.220> of

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
saying because when you pull them out of

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.819 
saying because when you pull them out of
the<00:01:32.549> ground<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:33.090> human<00:01:33.390> benefit<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.079> releases

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the ground for human benefit it releases

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.219 
the ground for human benefit it releases
carbon<00:01:35.310> into<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.030> air<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.479> causes<00:01:36.960> climate

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
carbon into the air and causes climate

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.530 
carbon into the air and causes climate
change<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.700> real<00:01:38.850> dirty<00:01:39.210> way<00:01:39.509> to

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
change and it's a real dirty way to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.980 
change and it's a real dirty way to
create<00:01:40.110> energy<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:41.159> would<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:42.090> why<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:42.930> do

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
create energy that would be why what do

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.789 
create energy that would be why what do
you<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.229> say<00:01:43.380> Steve

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
you have to say Steve

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
you have to say Steve
well<00:01:44.310> maybe<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.700> God's<00:01:44.970> little<00:01:45.180> experiment

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
well maybe it's God's little experiment

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.310 
well maybe it's God's little experiment
to<00:01:45.899> see<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.290> we're<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:48.140> destroy<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to see if we're going to destroy the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.710 
to see if we're going to destroy the
world<00:01:49.470> by<00:01:49.710> burning<00:01:50.100> coal<00:01:50.329> yeah<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.450> could<00:01:51.600> be

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
world by burning coal yeah that could be

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
world by burning coal yeah that could be
that<00:01:52.049> could<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.290> God's<00:01:52.470> experiment<00:01:52.860> yeah<00:01:53.759> God

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
that could be God's experiment yeah God

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.560 
that could be God's experiment yeah God
works<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.170> mysterious<00:01:55.320> ways<00:01:56.270> what<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> hear

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
works in mysterious ways what I hear

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.690 
works in mysterious ways what I hear
yeah<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.259> guess<00:01:58.740> that's<00:01:58.950> why<00:01:59.100> God<00:01:59.340> put<00:01:59.549> all

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
yeah I guess that's why God put all

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.370 
yeah I guess that's why God put all
