00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.490 
thought it was interesting a lot of
people<00:02:38.420> think<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.780> Berlin<00:02:39.080> is<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.260> pretty

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
boring opening but Levon Aronian told me

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.390 
boring opening but Levon Aronian told me
for<00:02:42.200> one<00:02:42.350> that<00:02:42.530> that's<00:02:42.680> what<00:02:42.860> he<00:02:42.980> plays<00:02:43.190> when

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
for one that that's what he plays when

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.430
