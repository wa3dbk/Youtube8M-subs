00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.499 
kink it you can actually take this
material<00:01:57.840> fold<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.710> half<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.729> will<00:02:00.299> not

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
material fold it in half and it will not

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.580 
material fold it in half and it will not
leave<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> kink<00:02:01.109> in<00:02:01.289> it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
leave a kink in it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.590 
leave a kink in it
so<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.159> really<00:02:02.429> bomb-proof<00:02:02.729> very<00:02:03.359> very

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
so it's really bomb-proof very very

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.770 
so it's really bomb-proof very very
resilient<00:02:03.929> the<00:02:04.500> slider<00:02:04.859> itself<00:02:05.490> sits<00:02:06.420> proud

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
resilient the slider itself sits proud

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.419 
resilient the slider itself sits proud
which<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.350> nice<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.979> makes<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.369> really

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
which is nice because it makes it really

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.600 
which is nice because it makes it really
easy<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:09.030> grip<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.570> in<00:02:10.500> fact<00:02:10.770> even<00:02:11.250> when<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> add

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
easy to grip and in fact even when I add

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.040 
easy to grip and in fact even when I add
my

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
my

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.220 
my
in<00:02:12.170> my<00:02:12.320> hand<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.860> can<00:02:13.520> move<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.910> slider<00:02:14.230> without

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
in my hand I can move the slider without

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.530 
in my hand I can move the slider without
putting<00:02:16.040> my<00:02:16.160> paddle<00:02:16.640> down<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.270> very<00:02:17.390> easy

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
putting my paddle down so it's very easy

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.720 
putting my paddle down so it's very easy
to<00:02:17.900> use<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.470> make<00:02:18.590> those<00:02:18.710> micro<00:02:19.160> adjustments

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
to use and make those micro adjustments

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.640 
to use and make those micro adjustments
on<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.060> fly<00:02:20.090> even<00:02:20.720> in<00:02:20.810> rough<00:02:21.020> conditions

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
on the fly even in rough conditions

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.800 
on the fly even in rough conditions
where<00:02:22.250> I'm<00:02:22.340> really<00:02:22.640> not<00:02:22.910> tempted<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.510> let<00:02:23.660> go

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
where I'm really not tempted to let go

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.750 
where I'm really not tempted to let go
of<00:02:23.930> my<00:02:24.080> paddle<00:02:26.290> I've<00:02:27.290> been<00:02:27.500> really<00:02:27.980> happy<00:02:28.340> with

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
of my paddle I've been really happy with

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.870 
of my paddle I've been really happy with
this<00:02:28.910> cake<00:02:29.150> system<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.630> my<00:02:29.750> Chatham<00:02:30.170> 16<00:02:30.880> it's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
this cake system in my Chatham 16 it's

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.240 
this cake system in my Chatham 16 it's
highly<00:02:32.240> effective<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.780> wind<00:02:33.110> that<00:02:33.530> balances

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
highly effective in wind that balances

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.060 
highly effective in wind that balances
out<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.520> boat<00:02:34.700> very<00:02:35.030> very<00:02:35.270> well<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:36.070> it's

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
out the boat very very well and it's

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.240 
out the boat very very well and it's
super<00:02:38.000> durable<00:02:38.240> and<00:02:38.540> it's<00:02:38.780> giving<00:02:39.050> me

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
super durable and it's giving me

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.100 
super durable and it's giving me
absolutely<00:02:40.250> no<00:02:40.610> trouble<00:02:40.940> whatsoever

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
absolutely no trouble whatsoever

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.590 
absolutely no trouble whatsoever
I<00:02:42.140> think<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.980> neck<00:02:43.160> design<00:02:43.640> team<00:02:43.880> really

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
I think the neck design team really

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.380 
I think the neck design team really
nailed<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:45.020> just
