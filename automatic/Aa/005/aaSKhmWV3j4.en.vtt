00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.160 
so what I just demonstrated was just a
tune<00:00:14.310> I<00:00:14.430> just<00:00:14.610> made<00:00:14.790> up<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.270> is<00:00:15.660> um<00:00:15.930> really

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
tune I just made up that is um really

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.080 
tune I just made up that is um really
the<00:00:16.620> essence<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.460> I'm<00:00:17.670> trying<00:00:17.970> to

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
the essence of it is I'm trying to

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.380 
the essence of it is I'm trying to

achieve a classic amp sound like you

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.290 
achieve a classic amp sound like you
might<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.990> 60s<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.830> was<00:00:23.010> back<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.940> Stax

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
from that era that was just playing

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
early R&amp;B what you might find is an amp

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.930 
early R&amp;B what you might find is an amp
that's<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.890> little<00:00:38.129> hairy<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:38.670> it's

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
that's a little hairy because it's

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.680 
that's a little hairy because it's
cranked<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.620> a<00:00:40.790> tremolo<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.030> board<00:00:42.270> tremolo

setting<00:00:43.110> within<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.800> amp<00:00:43.949> people<00:00:44.610> played

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
setting within the amp people played

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.970 
setting within the amp people played
there<00:00:45.449> weren't<00:00:45.989> really<00:00:46.110> pedals<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.710> plugged

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
there weren't really pedals they plugged

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.920 
there weren't really pedals they plugged
right<00:00:47.040> into<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.430> amp<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.730> dialed<00:00:48.570> everything

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
right into the amp and dialed everything

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.780 
right into the amp and dialed everything
up<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.290> this<00:00:49.739> was<00:00:49.920> similar<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.339> the<00:00:50.519> sound

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
up and this was similar to the sound

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.180 
up and this was similar to the sound
that<00:00:51.000> they<00:00:51.120> might<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.360> gotten<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:52.040> have<00:00:53.040> an

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that they might have gotten I have an

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549 
that they might have gotten I have an
amp<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.460> was<00:00:53.760> nowhere<00:00:54.600> near<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.320> had

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
amp that was nowhere near what they had

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.710 
amp that was nowhere near what they had
back<00:00:55.800> then<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.519> a<00:00:56.640> two-channel<00:00:56.820> Rivera<00:00:57.479> amp

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
back then it's a two-channel Rivera amp

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.780 
back then it's a two-channel Rivera amp
which<00:00:57.900> is<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.080> great<00:00:58.470> amp<00:00:58.710> I'm<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.580> going

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
which is a great amp I'm just going

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.880 
which is a great amp I'm just going
clean<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.870> I've<00:01:00.989> done<00:01:01.110> is<00:01:01.290> I've<00:01:01.440> taken<00:01:01.470> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
clean and what I've done is I've taken a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280 
clean and what I've done is I've taken a
tremolo<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.790> believe<00:01:03.239> sounds<00:01:03.659> closest<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
tremolo that I believe sounds closest to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.380 
tremolo that I believe sounds closest to
what<00:01:04.440> an<00:01:04.559> onboard<00:01:05.280> amp<00:01:05.519> tremolo<00:01:06.030> would<00:01:06.180> sound

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
what an onboard amp tremolo would sound

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.510 
what an onboard amp tremolo would sound
like<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.840> super<00:01:07.110> trim<00:01:07.350> by<00:01:07.650> full<00:01:07.890> tone<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
like this super trim by full tone it's a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.440 
like this super trim by full tone it's a
very<00:01:08.790> warm<00:01:10.250> analog<00:01:11.250> sounding<00:01:11.670> tremolo<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
very warm analog sounding tremolo and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
very warm analog sounding tremolo and
then<00:01:13.409> my<00:01:13.530> favorite<00:01:13.740> pedal<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.370> full<00:01:14.820> tone

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
then my favorite pedal the full tone

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.870 
then my favorite pedal the full tone
first-generation<00:01:15.539> OCD<00:01:16.289> pedal<00:01:16.610> again<00:01:17.610> drive

first-generation OCD pedal again drive
all<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> way<00:01:18.210> down<00:01:18.509> I'm<00:01:19.259> basically<00:01:19.710> using<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
all the way down I'm basically using it

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.920 
all the way down I'm basically using it
as<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.789> two<00:01:21.780> emulated<00:01:22.259> cranked<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.039> a

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
as a two emulated cranked and as a

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.359 
as a two emulated cranked and as a
transparent<00:01:24.930> sounding<00:01:25.259> overdrive<00:01:25.649> so<00:01:26.250> what

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
transparent sounding overdrive so what

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.580 
transparent sounding overdrive so what
I'm<00:01:26.460> getting<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.090> musical

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
I'm getting is a very musical

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.139 
I'm getting is a very musical
representation<00:01:28.609> through<00:01:29.609> pedals<00:01:29.969> and

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
representation through pedals and

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.450 
representation through pedals and
through<00:01:30.750> different<00:01:31.229> settings<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.890> what<00:01:32.369> it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
through different settings of what it

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.740 
through different settings of what it
would<00:01:32.520> sound<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.359> plugging

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
would sound like if I was just plugging

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.420 
would sound like if I was just plugging
my<00:01:33.840> Telecaster<00:01:34.469> into<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.920> an<00:01:35.039> old<00:01:35.219> vintage

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
my Telecaster into a just an old vintage

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.090 
my Telecaster into a just an old vintage
tweed<00:01:36.149> amp<00:01:36.359> what<00:01:37.259> I've<00:01:37.350> done<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.859> far<00:01:38.039> as

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
tweed amp what I've done with as far as

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.940 
tweed amp what I've done with as far as
the<00:01:38.189> settings<00:01:38.609> very<00:01:39.600> simple<00:01:40.020> drive<00:01:40.649> all<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the settings very simple drive all the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.639 
the settings very simple drive all the
way<00:01:40.979> down<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.789> overdrive<00:01:42.179> pedal<00:01:42.649> volume

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
way down on the overdrive pedal volume

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.679 
way down on the overdrive pedal volume
to<00:01:43.770> match<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.310> clean

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.309 

maybe<00:01:47.259> a<00:01:47.350> little<00:01:47.530> bit<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.859> a<00:01:47.920> boost<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.869> then

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
maybe a little bit of a boost and then

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.959 
maybe a little bit of a boost and then
as<00:01:50.439> far<00:01:50.590> as<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.770> tremolo<00:01:51.009> I<00:01:51.369> have<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.759> at<00:01:51.939> about

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
as far as the tremolo I have it at about

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:52.739 
as far as the tremolo I have it at about
12<00:01:52.450> o'clock

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
12 o'clock

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.819 
12 o'clock

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
mix and rape on on like a medium to slow

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.209 
mix and rape on on like a medium to slow
slow<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.369> medium<00:01:57.759> speed<00:01:58.689> on<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.200> tremolo

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
slow to medium speed on the tremolo

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:01.590 
slow to medium speed on the tremolo
it's<00:02:00.459> not<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.670> hard<00:02:00.909> tremolo<00:02:01.240> it's<00:02:01.329> a<00:02:01.390> soft

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
it's not a hard tremolo it's a soft

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.940 
it's not a hard tremolo it's a soft
tremolo

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
tremolo

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.980 
tremolo
almost<00:02:03.729> barely<00:02:03.909> noticeable<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.720> that's<00:02:04.840> what

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
almost barely noticeable and that's what

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.260 
almost barely noticeable and that's what
gives<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.439> that<00:02:06.130> very<00:02:06.369> warm<00:02:06.729> rounded

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
gives you that that very warm rounded

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.999 
gives you that that very warm rounded
effect<00:02:07.360> that<00:02:08.080> I<00:02:08.110> think<00:02:08.349> is<00:02:08.470> really<00:02:08.709> just

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
effect that I think is really just

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.570 
effect that I think is really just
pretty<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:10.450> think<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> lot<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.580> just

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
pretty and I think that a lot of just

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.250 
pretty and I think that a lot of just
slow<00:02:13.450> R&amp;B<00:02:15.030> ballads<00:02:16.030> work<00:02:16.420> great<00:02:16.900> with<00:02:17.080> this

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
slow R&amp;B ballads work great with this

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.250 
slow R&amp;B ballads work great with this
and<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:18.220> really<00:02:18.489> pop<00:02:18.760> out<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.239> mix<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:19.810> I

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
and you really pop out of the mix and I

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.840 
and you really pop out of the mix and I
find<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.650> if<00:02:20.800> you're<00:02:20.920> backing<00:02:21.280> up<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.489> singer

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
find that if you're backing up a singer

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.240 
find that if you're backing up a singer
or<00:02:22.000> if<00:02:22.810> you're<00:02:22.959> playing<00:02:23.260> where<00:02:23.890> you're<00:02:24.010> really

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
or if you're playing where you're really

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.550 
or if you're playing where you're really
a<00:02:24.280> texture<00:02:24.880> you're<00:02:25.060> not<00:02:25.180> really<00:02:25.360> playing<00:02:25.750> down

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
a texture you're not really playing down

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.559 
a texture you're not really playing down
beats<00:02:26.890> you're<00:02:27.160> not<00:02:27.340> really<00:02:27.640> your<00:02:28.180> role<00:02:28.360> in<00:02:28.480> the

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
beats you're not really your role in the

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.180 
beats you're not really your role in the
rhythm<00:02:28.810> section<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.319> really<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.650> add<00:02:29.800> color

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
rhythm section is really to add color

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.330 
rhythm section is really to add color
and<00:02:30.459> fill<00:02:31.360> up<00:02:31.480> space<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:32.230> texture<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.860> think

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
and fill up space with texture I think

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.860 
and fill up space with texture I think
this<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.550> a<00:02:33.580> great<00:02:33.940> effect<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.420> use<00:02:34.599> for<00:02:34.840> that

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
this is a great effect to use for that

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.910 
this is a great effect to use for that
and<00:02:35.230> it's<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> very<00:02:35.769> natural<00:02:35.920> sounding<00:02:36.489> one<00:02:36.670> too
