00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.320
 not 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.270
 the 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.160
 hello my name is thierry nephew I 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.870
 am teaching director of a center 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.340
 driving training and the 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.170
 nuclear security we will see 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 today how to position well 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.190
 on the roadway in traffic well 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.440
 position on the floor is no 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.269
 just do not bother others do not 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.460
 to surprise but it's also 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.800
 respect each other's place 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 will see that there are places 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.790
 specific for certain categories 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.310
 users a certain category of 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.830
 vehicles and that to position oneself on the 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.670
 pavement is not only occupy his 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.500
 place on the road 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.480
 but it's when you change places 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.809
 try to communicate with others 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.700
 users 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.309
 to position yourself on the road 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.350
 in a general way we will roll some 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.719
 right side of the roadway 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.210
 it is the meaning and the place of circulation 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.670
 the most common on all roads 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.739
 two-way but also on 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.000
 roads we will be double-headed 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.420
 same one way where there are several 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.640
 way 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.199
 when this way is available it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.559
 always choose the most 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.930
 right 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.790
 the same way when we arrive on 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.980
 a roundabout and we see the right or 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.939
 all right we will be well positioned 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.390
 on the right 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.870
 if there is no vehicle that I have here 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.970
 so I liked that such a case 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.200
 and I sit well right always 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.640
 that we will remain in normal circulation 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.640
 will always stay on the box 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.350
 tomorrow when the voice is wide 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.450
 we're going to be able this center is a little bit 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.900
 more about seeing it is no use of 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.660
 absolutely graze sidewalks or so the 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.790
 way across the street we try to 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.500
 center on the way that also allows 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.690
 to tell others we're fine 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.850
 continue straight on his sock 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.930
 when we are sure we know if we decide 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.810
 to change direction 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.150
 we will be squeezing ourselves forever on knowing 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.600
 on the side we are going to want to change 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.690
 direction 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.500
 for example if we will turn left 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.510
 so I'm going to shake myself to the left of 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.110
 twenty or even g before watching if there 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.870
 had nobody 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.460
 and of course justiniac I'm using the 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.500
 left side of my voice but I'm 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.480
 always on the same track when the 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.350
 pavement is narrower or with very 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.630
 little visibility 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.090
 on the other hand, it has remained more 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.670
 right possible reduce blue week in 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.960
 effect of vehicles can come in front 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.650
 as there can be obstacles like 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.630
 this is the case here 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.510
 you have to be very gentle 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.129
 clear without getting on bottom 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.959
 and immediately take back the side 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.299
 right of the floor so sometimes in 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.790
 agglomerations where the roadway is 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:36.409
 separated and shared to be able to 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.409
 accommodate different categories 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:42.280
 users like here for example or 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.390
 reserved lanes for cyclists 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.040
 the marking on the ground is recognizable 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.319
 easily since it is wider and 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.940
 narrower than normal marking it is 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.140
 what are called reserved lanes the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.819
 reserved lanes like this one we can 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.290
 so find for both wheels so 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.879
 the bikes for the nozzles for the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.739
 slow vehicles you have to know 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.659
 today what motorist are 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.159
 not the only users of the 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:02.989
 especially in the 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.549
 agglomerations there are more and more 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.190
 users of different categories 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.139
 we can thus mention the pedestrians the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.790
 bicycles the two motorized wheels the 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:13.480
 public transport heavy goods vehicles 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.799
 but also rollers etc etc 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.599
 so we try to make sure that 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.549
 everyone can have his place to be 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.769
 safe to move 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.900
 also as he wishes 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.510
 the departure route and the street are not 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.739
 reserved only for cars 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.540
 so be placed correctly on the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.280
 pavement is taking into account all 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.349
 categories of users for them to 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.549
 are all safe to position themselves 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.079
 on the pavement is one of the elements 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.230
 that you have to know to be able to 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.190
 drive safely 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.629
 so it's an event that needs to be 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.949
 know when we pass the code of the 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.000
 road 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.220
 we'll see in an upcoming video 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.060
 how to prepare for this 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.060
 test of the highway code
