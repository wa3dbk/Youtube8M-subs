00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.780
 arches 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.730
 welcome guys back here and mick this 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.190
 is the second episode of the fifa rat 14 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.320
 and in this episode there will be like 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.450
 I had said three games the place that 2 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 as I told you I would come back 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.230
 at the usual three games there will be the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.849
 two final matches of the tournament that 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.739
 I will win then I take off the surprise 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.390
 so I am very happy since the 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.750
 so I win the first tournament I do 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 close we call a tournament 40 there is the series 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.000
 40 and then there will be the third game will be 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.450
 an eighth-finals of a new tournament 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.240
 with the new team that I don't tell you 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.480
 which is why you will see it soon is one 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.950
 very strange team that is not one of me 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.350
 you advised because I already had it 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.960
 I wanted to do it at the beginning 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.530
 see if you can use it for a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.390
 next one 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.340
 you like to win easy and it is 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.890
 absolutely possible to use it since 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.140
 it's very strong and then you see what it is then 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.869
 I tell you nothing 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.310
 I'll probably use some of yours 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.859
 team you recommended me from 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.159
 third tournament onwards as I have already told you 

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:20.280
 I would like to do 4 5 tournaments to take 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.520
 a few credits and then at least get me 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.200
 a good gold team to advance by 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.110
 category 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.329
 so thank you especially for 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.729
 anyway you have me in so many 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.530
 recommended for recommended teams 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.990
 apples still that is if it comes to mind 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.189
 something because maybe you've tried it 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.189
 to one that is very strong 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.149
 tell me that promotes and then maybe I can 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.149
 also consider it 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.860
 tell him to try the team of 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.860
 Korea because very good that is if you want 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.319
 starting is normally between playing 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:00.479
 normal games without risking 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:02.099
 because however playing in the nel 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.509
 leagues however you risk 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:06.179
 find a player like I already had 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.369
 said maybe less good but you re 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.110
 I do not write a very good one either 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.910
 so if you want to play with these 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.730
 teams that the teams of 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.120
 bronze let's say they put all the players 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.680
 more or less on the same level because 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.709
 even if the player is good anyway 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.890
 features of the bronze player 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.880
 the otello we say do not favor it e 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.380
 so I strongly recommend the 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.010
 Korea team here as you have seen 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.340
 I win the tournament the first tournament 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.639
 I open the package they give me 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.220
 because from the first tournament no win 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:46.319
 one thousand creti plus a premium package though 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.840
 I'm not mistaken though if I don't remember 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.730
 bad already from the second tournament onwards there 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.209
 they only give credits so if I win 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.190
 the next tournament will only have credits 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.470
 I'll probably be selling some 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:05.160
 player and this is the team that me 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.130
 the Ghanaian bronze team is made 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.870
 with the English goalkeeper why not 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.349
 there was a Ghanaian bronze goalkeeper 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.849
 but I hope you will forgive me I didn't know 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.920
 that putting in a door put in a 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.340
 player that I played cares about me 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.700
 seemed a bit of a suicide 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.190
 and as you will soon see it is devastating 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.459
 opted for a 4 4 2 because it seems to me not 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.129
 have midfielders and second strikers 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.610
 so the 4 4 ​​2 looked like the form 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:38.250
 even more normal more balanced 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.160
 between the parties and is truly devastating 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.010
 as a team especially frimpong this 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.040
 here that makes this color really very much 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.180
 strong it seems to me very very distracted like 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.810
 team 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.819
 the two are really the attackers 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.640
 they are animals, they are very strong 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.099
 facts will probably see a little bit like 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.040
 improve it on my personal account 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.450
 maybe I can even do an episode of it 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.040
 you like to win easy because it is 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.769
 really very strong I didn't expect it 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.129
 I expected to have problems 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.720
 let's say we start with the first problems 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.239
 already with this team 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.979
 while instead it is very very strong of it 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.239
 that for this first game has not me 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.900
 given no problem at all now 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.270
 we will see tomorrow with the other long ones 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.430
 guys the finished episode I hope that 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.289
 you enjoyed remembering to leave 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.450
 i like it and sign up and nothing us 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.450
 we feel tomorrow with 1 beautiful episode
