00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.400
 can be very economical heavy information technologies and the 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.019
 communication allow us thanks to internet 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.559
 communicate in the same way we do with the telephone network 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:16.539
 traditional 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.399
 but they also offer us added services at a lower cost and that is 

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.269
 internet is changing among other things the form of what commonly 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.269
 we call you by phone 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.050
 When we call a person from the home phone, what we do is 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.150
 use the traditional telephone network 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.470
 is based on a technology that can only transmit and receive sounds in 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.470
 other words our voice and the noise that is around us 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.380
 However, today we have another option and that purpose to make calls to 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.690
 through the internet infrastructure 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.910
 instead of the typical life-long phone subject through 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.880
 requesting a computer with sound card 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.970
 nowadays any modern model is already incorporated 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.430
 also from a speaker microphone and a broadband connection 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.760
 The advantages with respect to traditional telephony are varied. 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.600
 you can only keep a conversation you can also send data for example 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.850
 photographs and videos a document 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.270
 something very important in business 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.220
 to this we must add that generally with the telephony of a lifetime only 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.400
 can have a conversation with internet 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 make several calls at the same time and with different people 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.260
 but how can we use this technology 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.260
 there are multiple programs that make it possible 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.410
 and for cool 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.850
 the device 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.540
 its use is simple and we have several options 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.910
 The first one is the most usual if the computers have installed by 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.610
 example pescaíto people who do not use can call each other to 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.840
 through the internet 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.960
 they just need to get an account to do that program and this does not mean 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.080
 economic cost some 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.970
 the second one is being implanted little by little it's about using the computer to 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.420
 call traditional numbers that is to say mobile coapi jos 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.160
 for this, programs like ska and copi for color offer us bonuses that we 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
 allow to make this type of calls at a very competitive price 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.769
 and the third option has been implemented mainly in the 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.649

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:23.739
 telephone 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.980
 its secret is based on using and combining the traditional telephone network 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.319
 Internet 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.090
 but it requires the acquisition and implementation of different solutions 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.370
 computer as central and taxco telephone terminals all to this 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.349
 type of communication 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.620
 but the best thing is to see an example of how we can call from a computer to a 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.620
 traditional phone 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.290
 we need a previous program how to download install is there so 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.140

 to be able to make calls to conventional telephones and the first thing 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:01.669
