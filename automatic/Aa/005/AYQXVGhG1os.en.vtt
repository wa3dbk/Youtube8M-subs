00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.330
 dynamo tv is presented to you by 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:20.039
 Asti your expert on apple products app 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.039
 development and service 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:30.400
 For four years, it was very clear to us 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.570
 So of course we had more ball possession 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.800
 Either way, we have been in 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.540
 just begged for it 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.270
 we made unnecessary mistakes there 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.820
 Just vote 15 times alone 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.050
 Almost in front of goal and have easy 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.270
 luck that we are not alone 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.040
 then have to go back to the end of the 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.760
 had a few chances at first half-time 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.790
 where we do it 10 I do yes and then im 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.379
 we really have an end effect 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.030
 begged for it and then still 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.519
 deservedly that the goat 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.070
 cashed anyway I do not know now 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.320
 Tell it is somehow 08 15 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.989
 That's why I have to think carefully 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.010
 what I say 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.490
 first the opponent scored a goal 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:13.750
 we can not get him in and then 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.090
 We wanted to playfully solve how 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.190
 the last or the last games 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.310
 since then the new coach is there too 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.479
 opponent has the rooms we have no 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.250
 Therefore, you have to leave room 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.280
 sometime beginning somehow longer 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.960
 to play balls but we already notice it 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.340
 somehow just telling storytelling 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.939
 narration and we have no points and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.040
 situation outside is waiting 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.560
 yes not so not so sparkling you have to 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.630
 we say lost in the individual I have 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.060
 now is, or we have to 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.890
 analyze with the team where ours 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.560
 For our mistakes, I believe we were 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.710
 have lost too many tackles too 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.509
 simple mistakes made and the opponent 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.960
 as effectively as we did against 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.659
 dortmund has disgusted compact 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.140
 moved and then on a counter 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.310
 played and the session so directly 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.440
 after the game I do not know if that 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.049
 first half was as catastrophic as 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.850
 that's why you described it now 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.000
 I hold myself in the opinion times 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.489
 back we have a home game again 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.030
 lost 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.319
 do it hard to fetch us yes 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.459
 a bit baffled right now I just 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.560
 now we have tried to stay 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.420
 games judges to put in the hunting race 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.690
 have clear in the square that was not 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.000
 every ball can come it is clear that 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.640
 because mistakes happen but they were 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.340
 nevertheless too many mistakes and above all 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.239
 we have always been relative to the errors 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.010
 we reacted badly there 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.459
 bad and so could the good counter 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.910
 drive and therefore we are 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.829
 must also count on errors and then 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.329
 behind it are good actually 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.290
 I think I was not there 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.549
 highlight sowas also carries if this 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.690
 of course for people to come back today 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:07.569
 were then wearing but now too 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.950
 somehow lacks the ease and me 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.420
 So do not like me that you 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.970
 But I do not think so 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.790
 so easy now an apt somehow 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.590
 to find analysis yes I try too 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.940
 honestly just my opinion 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.880
 but to say so right after the game 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.990
 And at the moment every week is not 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.820
 so easy 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.360
 yes, we try to build on the outside 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.340
 what he was our plan and I play 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.440
 I 'm stupid fit him in the middle 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.560
 I thought the pilot comes in short and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.990
 can then play directly long then was 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.730
 too short and the player goes 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.080
 in between only inter could have so 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.790
 also in the first half a few 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.520
 counterfeit cash since there had been more luck and 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.170
 in one situation, that's what stops you 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.180
 that's what's on my cap 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.830
 and I just do not have the ball there 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.340
 so light in the middle player 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:01.860
 must come clearer or the line long 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.860
 and goes on my cap
