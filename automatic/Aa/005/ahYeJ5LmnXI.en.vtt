00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.880 
begin to govern our behavior in a game
so<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.790> if<00:02:14.090> I'm<00:02:14.390> playing<00:02:14.720> tennis<00:02:14.990> in<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.710> game

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
so that if I'm playing tennis in a game

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.550 
so that if I'm playing tennis in a game
of<00:02:16.010> tennis<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.820> I'm<00:02:17.030> serving<00:02:17.540> first<00:02:17.780> I

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
of tennis and I'm serving first I

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.260 
of tennis and I'm serving first I
have<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.830> hit<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.130> ball<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.819> service

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
have to hit the ball to that service

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.880 
have to hit the ball to that service
court<00:02:20.599> over<00:02:20.870> there<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.410> reason<00:02:21.739> I<00:02:21.830> do

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
court over there and the reason I do

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.800 
court over there and the reason I do
that<00:02:22.069> is<00:02:22.430> because<00:02:22.700> I've<00:02:23.090> stepped<00:02:23.390> into<00:02:23.599> this

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
that is because I've stepped into this

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.920 
that is because I've stepped into this
place<00:02:24.110> called<00:02:24.440> tennis<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.069> suddenly<00:02:25.849> I<00:02:26.209> am

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
place called tennis and suddenly I am

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.140 
place called tennis and suddenly I am
being<00:02:27.650> governed<00:02:28.069> by<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.250> set<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.580> rules<00:02:28.760> right

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
being governed by a set of rules right

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.860 
being governed by a set of rules right
that<00:02:29.480> govern<00:02:29.840> these<00:02:29.959> these<00:02:30.739> dynamics<00:02:31.870> games

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
that govern these these dynamics games

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.680 
that govern these these dynamics games
also<00:02:33.290> really<00:02:34.250> good<00:02:34.489> games<00:02:34.790> define<00:02:35.330> player

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
also really good games define player

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.720 
also really good games define player
identity<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.530> some<00:02:36.800> games<00:02:37.099> you<00:02:37.310> might<00:02:37.550> be

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
identity so in some games you might be

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.130 
identity so in some games you might be
asked<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.090> take<00:02:38.300> on<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.630> role<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.989> a

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
solve complex problems within the games

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.590 
solve complex problems within the games
you<00:02:58.220> have<00:02:58.400> an<00:02:58.519> artillery<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.120> things<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.510> you

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
you have an artillery of things that you

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.720 
you have an artillery of things that you
use<00:02:59.810> within<00:03:00.080> the<00:03:00.290> game<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.709> to<00:03:00.950> solve

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
use within the game so you to solve

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.830 
use within the game so you to solve
problems<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.980> what<00:03:04.580> if<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.299> know<00:03:05.450> anything

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
problems so what if we know anything

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.880 
problems so what if we know anything
about<00:03:06.250> systems<00:03:07.450> what<00:03:08.450> happens<00:03:08.959> in<00:03:09.140> systems<00:03:09.650> is

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
about systems what happens in systems is

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.089 
about systems what happens in systems is
that<00:03:10.069> they<00:03:10.190> give<00:03:10.370> rise<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:11.540> certain<00:03:11.690> things

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
that they give rise to certain things

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.100 
that they give rise to certain things
conditions<00:03:13.099> rise<00:03:13.430> out<00:03:13.849> of<00:03:13.880> systems<00:03:14.390> right<00:03:14.660> so

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
conditions rise out of systems right so

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.750 
conditions rise out of systems right so
let's<00:03:15.470> look<00:03:15.620> at<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:15.890> conditions<00:03:16.310> that<00:03:16.400> rise

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
let's look at the conditions that rise

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.080 
let's look at the conditions that rise
out<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.180> out<00:03:17.989> of<00:03:18.049> games<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.890> we<00:03:19.700> believe<00:03:20.060> that

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
out of out of games and we believe that

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.430 
out of out of games and we believe that
these<00:03:20.390> are<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.690> things<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:20.959> make<00:03:21.170> them<00:03:21.290> so

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
these are the things that make them so

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.800 
these are the things that make them so
enticing<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:22.400> one<00:03:22.609> thing<00:03:22.820> that<00:03:22.850> they<00:03:23.480> give

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
enticing so one thing that they give

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.870 
enticing so one thing that they give
rise<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:24.049> is<00:03:24.380> a<00:03:24.410> sense<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.890> relevance<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.760> know

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
rise to is a sense of relevance you know

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.729 
rise to is a sense of relevance you know
why<00:03:26.120> you're<00:03:26.359> doing<00:03:26.570> what<00:03:26.750> you're<00:03:27.019> doing<00:03:27.200> in

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
why you're doing what you're doing in

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.520 
why you're doing what you're doing in
games<00:03:28.040> there's<00:03:28.670> also<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:29.079> embodied<00:03:30.079> action

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
games there's also a embodied action

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.349 
games there's also a embodied action
like<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:30.829> actually<00:03:30.980> take<00:03:31.340> action<00:03:31.549> to<00:03:32.120> like

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
like you actually take action to like

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.720 
like you actually take action to like
make<00:03:32.780> things<00:03:33.049> happen<00:03:33.230> in<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.590> game<00:03:33.799> there's

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
make things happen in a game there's

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.759 
make things happen in a game there's
social<00:03:35.060> interplay<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:36.019> games<00:03:36.230> are<00:03:36.410> highly

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
social interplay so games are highly

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.300 
social interplay so games are highly
social<00:03:37.220> game<00:03:38.180> games<00:03:38.720> give<00:03:39.049> rise<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.319> emotions

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
social game games give rise to emotions

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.520 
social game games give rise to emotions
right<00:03:40.609> so<00:03:40.790> there<00:03:41.000> is<00:03:41.120> an<00:03:41.269> emotional<00:03:41.930> endeavor

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
right so there is an emotional endeavor

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.140 
right so there is an emotional endeavor
it's<00:03:42.709> an<00:03:42.799> emotional<00:03:43.400> engagement<00:03:43.549> when<00:03:44.030> you're

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
it's an emotional engagement when you're

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.940 
it's an emotional engagement when you're
playing<00:03:44.359> games<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:44.900> also<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.350> sense<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.739> place

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
playing games and also a sense of place

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.629 
playing games and also a sense of place
games<00:03:46.280> tend<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.030> be<00:03:47.209> very<00:03:47.480> context-specific

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
games tend to be very context-specific

so<00:05:28.710> that<00:05:28.949> school<00:05:29.849> looks<00:05:30.509> more<00:05:30.930> like<00:05:31.259> this

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
so that school looks more like this

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.610 
so that school looks more like this
where<00:05:32.419> and<00:05:33.419> and<00:05:33.629> it<00:05:33.749> doesn't<00:05:34.050> just<00:05:34.229> have<00:05:34.379> to<00:05:34.409> be

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
where and and it doesn't just have to be

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.709 
where and and it doesn't just have to be
school<00:05:35.159> it<00:05:35.339> could<00:05:35.490> be<00:05:35.669> outside<00:05:36.240> of<00:05:36.389> school<00:05:36.599> too

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
school it could be outside of school too

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.390 
school it could be outside of school too
how<00:05:37.110> might<00:05:37.349> we<00:05:37.500> create<00:05:37.710> learning

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
how might we create learning

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.100 
how might we create learning
environments<00:05:38.669> that<00:05:39.150> look<00:05:39.389> more<00:05:39.599> like<00:05:39.659> this

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
environments that look more like this

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.529 
environments that look more like this
and<00:05:41.900> less<00:05:42.900> like<00:05:43.139> this<00:05:44.060> where<00:05:45.060> kids<00:05:45.360> are

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
and less like this where kids are

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.230 
and less like this where kids are
telling<00:05:45.930> us<00:05:46.050> that<00:05:46.229> they're<00:05:46.379> completely

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
telling us that they're completely

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.389 
telling us that they're completely
alienated<00:05:48.240> from<00:05:48.479> the<00:05:48.659> experience<00:05:49.259> they<00:05:49.800> feels

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:50.399 
alienated from the experience they feels

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:55.219 
alienated from the experience they feels
completely<00:05:50.969> irrelevant<00:05:53.629> we<00:05:54.629> want<00:05:54.870> to<00:05:54.990> create

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
completely irrelevant we want to create

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.110 
completely irrelevant we want to create
experiences<00:05:55.949> where<00:05:56.430> kids<00:05:56.610> are<00:05:56.729> taking<00:05:57.029> on

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
experiences where kids are taking on

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.730 
experiences where kids are taking on
these<00:05:57.330> kinds<00:05:57.930> of<00:05:58.020> roles<00:05:58.289> where<00:05:58.620> they're

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
these kinds of roles where they're

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.740 
these kinds of roles where they're
actually<00:05:58.889> being<00:05:59.370> given<00:05:59.789> the<00:05:59.879> opportunity<00:06:00.599> to

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
actually being given the opportunity to

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.679 
actually being given the opportunity to
solve<00:06:00.930> a<00:06:01.139> complex<00:06:01.500> problem<00:06:01.830> right<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:02.789> so<00:06:03.419> in

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:03.689 
solve a complex problem right and so in

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:08.929 
solve a complex problem right and so in
one<00:06:04.199> game<00:06:06.289> this<00:06:07.289> there's<00:06:08.250> this<00:06:08.399> one<00:06:08.669> game

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:08.939 
one game this there's this one game

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:11.839

this<00:06:52.240> week<00:06:52.479> a<00:06:52.660> team<00:06:52.690> playing<00:06:53.139> on<00:06:53.320> the

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
this week a team playing on the

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.890 
this week a team playing on the
application<00:06:53.949> unlock<00:06:54.430> the<00:06:54.639> structure<00:06:55.210> of<00:06:55.360> an

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
application unlock the structure of an

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.810 
application unlock the structure of an
enzyme<00:06:56.139> that<00:06:56.740> could<00:06:57.039> lead<00:06:57.280> to<00:06:57.310> an<00:06:57.580> AIDS

enzyme that could lead to an AIDS

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.890 
enzyme that could lead to an AIDS
fighting<00:06:58.360> protein<00:06:58.990> so<00:06:59.680> it<00:07:00.340> seems<00:07:00.850> to<00:07:01.000> me<00:07:01.180> that

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:01.900 
fighting protein so it seems to me that

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.200 
fighting protein so it seems to me that
if<00:07:02.080> games<00:07:02.440> are<00:07:02.889> creating<00:07:03.490> the<00:07:03.639> conditions

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
if games are creating the conditions

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.360 
if games are creating the conditions
where<00:07:05.080> kids<00:07:05.650> can<00:07:06.009> do<00:07:06.190> this<00:07:06.520> kind<00:07:07.180> of<00:07:07.419> stuff<00:07:08.370> we

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
where kids can do this kind of stuff we

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.760 
where kids can do this kind of stuff we
should<00:07:09.639> be<00:07:09.759> looking<00:07:10.270> at<00:07:10.419> games<00:07:10.690> very<00:07:11.380> very

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
should be looking at games very very

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.310 
should be looking at games very very
seriously<00:07:12.340> to<00:07:12.699> see<00:07:13.330> if<00:07:13.479> we<00:07:13.600> can<00:07:13.780> transform

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320 
seriously to see if we can transform

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.010 
seriously to see if we can transform

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.020 
learning in the 21st century so that we

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.930 
learning in the 21st century so that we
can<00:07:17.199> enable<00:07:17.440> kids<00:07:17.800> to<00:07:18.400> do<00:07:18.580> the<00:07:18.729> very

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
can enable kids to do the very

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.310 
can enable kids to do the very
remarkable<00:07:19.889> thank<00:07:20.889> you<00:07:20.979> very<00:07:21.130> much
