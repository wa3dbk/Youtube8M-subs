00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.570
I really didn't know that much about
urban agriculture at all

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.289
before I came to DePaul; it by actually blew my mind
when I found out that

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.029
people could farm in the city

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.169
I've heard about urban agriculture culture

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.409
in other classes that I was like that is
awesome I wanna learn more about food

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:37.050
more about growing food.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.329
Urban agriculture is a kind of new movement in sustainable foods

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.809
sort of taking back the city as a place
where we can

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.829
produce food for ourselves be self sufficient.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.170
And there's a really strong interest
in urban agriculture

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.290
among environmental science studies
students and among

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.920
just younger populations in general.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.540
I first developed an urban agriculture
class and in that class there's a

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.380
couple of major purposes, one of which is
to learn the techniques of gardening

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.450
in an urban environment. The class is
urban agriculture 101

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.290
for anybody that's interested in urban
agriculture but doesn't really have an idea

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.450
how to get started.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.420
So we have an outdoor garden, we have an
indoor garden, we're starting some rooftop

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.539
farming as well.

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.319
It's very experiential learning and so
when you're inside learning and then you

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.880
can go outside to this garden and apply it.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.630
You're actually incorporating what our
professors told us

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.929
in class like ,the day after in the garden.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.569
We want to teach students how to plant
a seed, how to water it, how to weed,

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.899
learning about the soil, how to compost. I
was excited to actually be

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.189
in the garden and be in the greenhouse and
learning a skill that could be used

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.060
after DePaul - that was it was really
appealing to me.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.869
There's a lot of social issues that come with
learning where food comes from that

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.079
I think a lot of people don't realize.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.579
It's relevant in the city just because you have

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.729
what people refer to as food deserts:

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.229
areas that are typically minority and
low-income

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.470
and actually don't have access to fresh,
fresh food.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.160
Community members that live in food
deserts where

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.610
they only have fast food or they only
have convenient food stores,

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.459
they really do need urban agriculture -
they need these

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.230
healthy food supplies, healthy, affordable
organic, food supply to come to them

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.240
because it's not getting there
as it is now and so this solves that problem.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.850
If someone's committed to living in an
urban setting,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.840
I think it's very important because so
much of the food we eat we don't think

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.740
about where it comes from or how it's made

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.100
and we can take the information we learn
and use it

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.650
outside of school, and so I I feel like I
could go volunteer in an urban garden

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.160
and really contribute.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.330
To have them connect full-circle on where the food is grown,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.580
how it's sold, how it ends up a table, to have them see that we think is invaluable.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.600
They want to do it as a hobby they want to do is a life

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.390
skill because they want to provide

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.460
some of their own food. They want to do it
because they

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.740
they they want to be part of solving the
problems of food access and food

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.050
security within urban food systems.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.610
The students are the most
passionate that I have.
