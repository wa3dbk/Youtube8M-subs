00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
own project so I'm going to break down

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.470 
own project so I'm going to break down
each<00:02:29.930> episode<00:02:30.410> into<00:02:30.980> its<00:02:31.400> major<00:02:31.790> restoration

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
each episode into its major restoration

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.900 
each episode into its major restoration
phases<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.590> one<00:02:33.890> stripping<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.520> down<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.819> its

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
phases so one stripping it down to its

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.390 
phases so one stripping it down to its
bare<00:02:35.120> bones<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.600> what<00:02:36.410> I've<00:02:36.560> learned<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.370> far

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
bare bones of what I've learned so far

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.970

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
but I found in stripping it and

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.770 
but I found in stripping it and
inspecting<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.819> so<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:40.940> can<00:02:41.150> document<00:02:41.360> things

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
inspecting it so I can document things

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.290 
inspecting it so I can document things

top of the engine bay I'm kind of scared
to<00:03:14.420> see<00:03:14.750> what's<00:03:14.960> under<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.560> know<00:03:15.950> there's<00:03:16.190> a

this<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:32.990> not<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.350> original<00:03:33.440> silver<00:03:34.010> there

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
this is not the original silver there

this is not the original silver there
was<00:03:34.460> a<00:03:34.490> beautiful<00:03:35.210> sparkly<00:03:36.170> silver<00:03:36.770> I<00:03:36.980> think

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
was a beautiful sparkly silver I think

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.720 
was a beautiful sparkly silver I think
it's<00:03:37.580> called<00:03:37.790> Polaris<00:03:38.120> if<00:03:38.840> I'm<00:03:39.050> not<00:03:39.140> mistaken

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
it's called Polaris if I'm not mistaken

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
when they did this paint job it was not

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.680 
when they did this paint job it was not
done<00:03:45.170> properly<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:45.820> was<00:03:46.820> peeling<00:03:47.390> off

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
everywhere you can tell on the engine

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.940 
everywhere you can tell on the engine
bay<00:03:50.390> because<00:03:50.660> there's<00:03:50.810> drip<00:03:51.080> marks<00:03:51.440> we're

bay because there's drip marks we're

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.500 
bay because there's drip marks we're
gonna<00:03:52.040> be<00:03:52.220> using<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.670> walnut<00:03:53.000> blasting

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
gonna be using a walnut blasting

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.090 
gonna be using a walnut blasting
technique<00:03:53.930> that's<00:03:54.260> gonna<00:03:54.410> expose<00:03:54.800> all<00:03:55.070> the

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
technique that's gonna expose all the

technique that's gonna expose all the
get<00:03:55.490> rid<00:03:55.610> of<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.790> rust<00:03:56.060> it's<00:03:56.780> going<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.230> leave

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640

hoping I'm just not left with a cheesy
car<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.270> holes<00:04:02.570> if<00:04:02.960> we<00:04:03.230> have<00:04:03.350> a<00:04:03.380> car<00:04:03.590> left<00:04:03.830> after

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
car of holes if we have a car left after

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.070 
car of holes if we have a car left after
the<00:04:04.490> walnut<00:04:04.970> blasting<00:04:05.480> then<00:04:05.750> we're<00:04:05.930> going<00:04:06.050> to

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
the walnut blasting then we're going to

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.230 
the walnut blasting then we're going to
be<00:04:06.200> putting<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.530> floor<00:04:06.770> pans<00:04:07.040> in<00:04:07.280> doing<00:04:08.120> all

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
be putting the floor pans in doing all

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.460 
be putting the floor pans in doing all
the<00:04:08.330> metal<00:04:08.540> work<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:08.930> I'm<00:04:09.020> gonna<00:04:09.140> be<00:04:09.320> showing

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
the metal work and I'm gonna be showing

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.380 
the metal work and I'm gonna be showing
you<00:04:09.620> guys<00:04:09.860> how<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.190> do<00:04:10.520> that<00:04:10.670> with<00:04:10.850> an<00:04:11.000> expert

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
you guys how to do that with an expert

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.390 
you guys how to do that with an expert
and<00:04:12.290> then<00:04:12.500> we're<00:04:12.620> going<00:04:12.710> to<00:04:12.800> be<00:04:12.950> doing<00:04:13.250> the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
and then we're going to be doing the

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.900 
and then we're going to be doing the
painting<00:04:14.000> process<00:04:14.210> so<00:04:15.400> what<00:04:16.400> takes<00:04:16.640> to<00:04:16.760> do<00:04:16.880> a

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
painting process so what takes to do a

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.729 
painting process so what takes to do a
good<00:04:17.120> paint<00:04:17.810> job<00:04:17.870> how<00:04:18.230> to<00:04:18.260> prepare<00:04:18.710> it

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
good paint job how to prepare it

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.220 
good paint job how to prepare it
everything<00:04:19.670> of<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:19.790> sort<00:04:20.210> and<00:04:20.359> then<00:04:21.049> we'll

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
everything of that sort and then we'll

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.830 
everything of that sort and then we'll
move<00:04:21.350> into<00:04:21.470> engine<00:04:22.310> work<00:04:22.580> all<00:04:23.480> the

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
move into engine work all the

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.920 
move into engine work all the
electricals<00:04:24.380> for<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.650> inside<00:04:24.980> the<00:04:25.400> interior

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
electricals for the inside the interior

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.790 
electricals for the inside the interior
everything<00:04:26.930> like<00:04:27.020> that<00:04:27.170> the<00:04:27.440> engine<00:04:27.710> is

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
everything like that the engine is

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.380 
everything like that the engine is
actually<00:04:27.950> in<00:04:28.190> pretty<00:04:28.250> good<00:04:28.610> shape<00:04:28.670> the

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
actually in pretty good shape the

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.570 
actually in pretty good shape the
distributor<00:04:29.960> cap<00:04:29.990> was<00:04:30.530> busted<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:31.340> you<00:04:31.400> can

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
distributor cap was busted and you can

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.100 
distributor cap was busted and you can
tell<00:04:31.760> it's<00:04:31.970> being<00:04:32.090> dropped<00:04:32.390> one<00:04:32.660> way<00:04:32.840> and

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
tell it's being dropped one way and

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.990 
tell it's being dropped one way and
because<00:04:33.440> of<00:04:33.470> that<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.980> exhaust<00:04:34.400> manifolds

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
because of that the exhaust manifolds

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.300 
because of that the exhaust manifolds
got<00:04:35.300> damaged<00:04:35.690> in<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.900> process<00:04:36.020> so<00:04:36.920> those<00:04:37.130> need

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
got damaged in the process so those need

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.190 
got damaged in the process so those need
to<00:04:37.430> be<00:04:37.550> replaced<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.180> exhaust<00:04:38.720> system<00:04:39.080> is

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
to be replaced the exhaust system is

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.260 
to be replaced the exhaust system is
most<00:04:39.650> likely<00:04:39.920> gonna<00:04:40.040> need<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.430> be<00:04:40.550> gutted<00:04:40.730> the

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
most likely gonna need to be gutted the

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.480 
most likely gonna need to be gutted the
carburetors<00:04:41.840> don't<00:04:42.350> seem<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.890> be<00:04:43.010> working

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
carburetors don't seem to be working

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.550 
carburetors don't seem to be working
properly<00:04:43.940> but<00:04:44.690> all<00:04:44.900> seems<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.200> be<00:04:45.320> minor

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
properly but all seems to be minor

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.410 
properly but all seems to be minor
mechanical<00:04:46.250> things<00:04:46.520> that's<00:04:47.120> all<00:04:47.240> I<00:04:47.270> really

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
mechanical things that's all I really

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.240 
mechanical things that's all I really
know<00:04:47.630> about<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.870> car<00:04:48.050> because<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:48.920> bought<00:04:49.100> it

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
know about the car because I bought it

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.210 
know about the car because I bought it
from<00:04:49.700> a<00:04:50.210> shop<00:04:51.080> where<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.470> didn't<00:04:51.830> even<00:04:51.920> get<00:04:52.100> the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
from a shop where I didn't even get the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.159 
from a shop where I didn't even get the
keys<00:04:52.430> so

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
keys so

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.140 
keys so
a<00:04:54.259> couple<00:04:55.069> mistakes<00:04:55.219> have<00:04:55.520> already<00:04:55.789> made<00:04:55.909> so

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
a couple mistakes have already made so

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.219 
a couple mistakes have already made so
far<00:04:58.930> No

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
far No

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:03.010 
far No
okay<00:05:01.099> so<00:05:01.159> don't<00:05:01.699> do<00:05:01.849> what<00:05:01.999> I<00:05:02.029> did<00:05:02.150> because<00:05:02.599> I

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
okay so don't do what I did because I

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.339 
okay so don't do what I did because I
think<00:05:03.080> I<00:05:03.379> just<00:05:03.759> stripped<00:05:04.759> some<00:05:05.029> of<00:05:05.180> these

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
think I just stripped some of these

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:11.350 
think I just stripped some of these
clearly<00:05:07.270> but<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.539> should<00:05:08.900> be<00:05:08.930> all<00:05:09.999> solvable<00:05:10.999> I

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
clearly but it should be all solvable I
