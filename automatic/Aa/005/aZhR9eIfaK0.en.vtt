00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
moment we are looking pretty dire for

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.850 
moment we are looking pretty dire for
fitness<00:02:20.750> I<00:02:20.930> think<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.470> may<00:02:21.590> have<00:02:21.620> mentioned

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
fitness I think I may have mentioned

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.190 
fitness I think I may have mentioned
that<00:02:22.130> in<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.370> last<00:02:22.610> episode<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.480> our

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
that in the last episode and that our

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.840 
that in the last episode and that our
squad<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:24.709> looking<00:02:25.069> pretty<00:02:25.250> dodgy<00:02:25.550> for

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
squad is looking pretty dodgy for

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.970 
squad is looking pretty dodgy for
fitness<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.450> we<00:02:26.600> are<00:02:26.780> just<00:02:27.050> putting<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:27.799> some

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
fitness so we are just putting in some

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.009 
fitness so we are just putting in some
players<00:02:28.250> rotating<00:02:28.850> them<00:02:28.970> about<00:02:29.239> making<00:02:29.989> sure

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
players rotating them about making sure

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.569 
players rotating them about making sure
that<00:02:30.350> we<00:02:30.440> are<00:02:30.470> getting<00:02:30.709> all<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:30.980> our<00:02:31.250> fitness

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:31.579 
that we are getting all of our fitness

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.880 
that we are getting all of our fitness
back<00:02:31.760> before<00:02:32.120> each<00:02:32.269> game<00:02:32.500> anyway<00:02:33.500> we<00:02:33.620> go<00:02:33.739> into

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
back before each game anyway we go into

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.060 
back before each game anyway we go into
our<00:02:33.980> next<00:02:34.250> game<00:02:34.430> a<00:02:34.459> full<00:02:34.790> 12<00:02:35.000> 12<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:35.959> believe<00:02:36.799> it

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
our next game a full 12 12 I believe it

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.020 
our next game a full 12 12 I believe it
is<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:38.290> empowered<00:02:39.290> champ<00:02:39.799> or<00:02:40.070> in<00:02:40.430> power<00:02:40.790> leave

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
is a empowered champ or in power leave

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.210 
is a empowered champ or in power leave
one<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.420> can't<00:02:41.780> really<00:02:41.930> tell<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.620> my<00:02:42.950> clean

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
one I can't really tell and my clean

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.800 
one I can't really tell and my clean
screen<00:02:43.670> was<00:02:43.790> tiny<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.420> didn't<00:02:44.690> actually

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
screen was tiny and I didn't actually

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.960 
screen was tiny and I didn't actually
look<00:02:45.140> before<00:02:45.350> we<00:02:45.620> having<00:02:46.010> started<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.700> can't

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
look before we having started so I can't

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.970 
look before we having started so I can't
actually<00:02:47.180> say<00:02:47.510> but<00:02:48.170> he<00:02:48.590> took<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.829> lead

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
actually say but he took the lead

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.470 
actually say but he took the lead
against<00:02:49.370> us<00:02:49.430> early<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.730> but<00:02:50.030> we<00:02:50.150> tramped

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
against us early on but we tramped

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.720 
against us early on but we tramped
inserts<00:02:50.900> all<00:02:51.049> right<00:02:51.170> we<00:02:51.350> went<00:02:51.530> 10<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.489> think

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
inserts all right we went 10 I think

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.170 
inserts all right we went 10 I think
that<00:02:52.850> would<00:02:53.299> sir<00:02:53.570> EA<00:02:53.810> saying<00:02:54.200> hell<00:02:54.440> no

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
that would sir EA saying hell no

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.849 
that would sir EA saying hell no
