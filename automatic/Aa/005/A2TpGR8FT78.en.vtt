00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
something that you know I can see myself

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.540 
something that you know I can see myself
having<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.140> four<00:00:40.710> or<00:00:40.829> five<00:00:40.860> years<00:00:41.040> because

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
having in four or five years because

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
having in four or five years because
I'll<00:00:41.640> probably<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.420> beat<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.500> I

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
I'll probably have it to beat up but I

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:44.750 
I'll probably have it to beat up but I
figured<00:00:44.010> I'll<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.129> keep<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.579> short

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
figured I'll just keep this one short

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.729 
figured I'll just keep this one short
and<00:00:45.270> then<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> little<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.260> feet<00:00:46.500> just

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
and then do a little on feet just

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.770 
and then do a little on feet just
because<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.090> shoe<00:00:48.180> that's<00:00:48.629> already

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
