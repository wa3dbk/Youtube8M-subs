00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
see him blast it but it wasn't really

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.910

brushes<00:01:43.890> drills<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:45.390> thing<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> lot<00:01:46.110> of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.420 
brushes drills this thing was a lot of
help<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:48.290> then<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.439> used<00:01:49.710> tubing<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
help right here then I used tubing to

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.649 
help right here then I used tubing to
plug<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.470> fuel<00:01:52.470> injector<00:01:52.860> holes<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.659> masking

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
plug the fuel injector holes in masking

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.260 
plug the fuel injector holes in masking
tape<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:54.930> cover<00:01:55.380> other<00:01:55.710> things

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.950 

so<00:02:03.140> as<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.590> can<00:02:03.770> see<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.450> far<00:02:05.720> from

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
so as you can see this is far from

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.910 
so as you can see this is far from
perfect<00:02:06.939> but<00:02:07.939> I<00:02:08.270> had<00:02:08.810> put<00:02:08.989> a<00:02:09.020> lot<00:02:09.289> of<00:02:09.500> time<00:02:09.649> into

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
perfect but I had put a lot of time into

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.400 
perfect but I had put a lot of time into
cleaning<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.459> up<00:02:10.610> and<00:02:10.910> quite<00:02:11.630> frankly<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.140> got

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
cleaning it up and quite frankly I got

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.120 
cleaning it up and quite frankly I got
tired<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.069> so<00:02:13.760> I'm<00:02:13.849> gonna<00:02:13.970> call<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.420> good

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
tired of it so I'm gonna call it good

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.800 
tired of it so I'm gonna call it good
without<00:02:16.130> sandblasting<00:02:17.000> it<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.330> don't<00:02:17.510> think<00:02:17.720> I

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
without sandblasting it I don't think I

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.210 
without sandblasting it I don't think I
can<00:02:18.020> get<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.260> much<00:02:18.410> better<00:02:18.680> than<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:21.220> I'm

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
can get it much better than this I'm

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.580 
can get it much better than this I'm
