defendant<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.640> rotate<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:45.819> Phantom<00:02:46.180> to

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
defendant to rotate the Phantom to

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.530 
defendant to rotate the Phantom to
horizontally<00:02:47.109> one<00:02:47.380> round<00:02:48.389> after<00:02:49.389> that's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
horizontally one round after that's

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.129 
horizontally one round after that's
complete<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.230> lights<00:02:50.440> will<00:02:50.590> turn<00:02:50.620> green<00:02:52.139> he

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
complete the lights will turn green he

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.270 
complete the lights will turn green he
then<00:02:53.319> has<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.530> rotate<00:02:53.799> the<00:02:54.069> plane

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
then has to rotate the plane

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.680 
then has to rotate the plane
perpendicular<00:02:54.609> to<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.660> ground<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:57.690> rotate

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
perpendicular to the ground and rotate

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.569 
perpendicular to the ground and rotate
this<00:02:58.900> na<00:02:59.859> 360<00:03:00.790> degrees<00:03:01.350> when<00:03:02.350> that's<00:03:02.590> done<00:03:02.829> the

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
this na 360 degrees when that's done the

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:04.949 
this na 360 degrees when that's done the
lights<00:03:03.790> are<00:03:03.910> changed<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.450> its<00:03:04.510> normal<00:03:04.660> state

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
lights are changed to its normal state

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.759 
lights are changed to its normal state
which<00:03:05.859> is<00:03:05.889> flickering<00:03:06.280> green<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:08.440> start

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
which is flickering green to start

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.699 
which is flickering green to start
flying<00:03:09.310> your<00:03:09.519> phantom<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:10.350> pull<00:03:11.350> down<00:03:11.470> both

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
flying your phantom to pull down both

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.830 
flying your phantom to pull down both
joysticks<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.340> bottom<00:03:12.670> ends<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.420> start<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
joysticks to bottom ends to start the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.670 
joysticks to bottom ends to start the
propellers<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:16.239> stop<00:03:16.569> do<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.440> exact<00:03:17.650> same

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
propellers to stop do the exact same

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.150 
propellers to stop do the exact same
thing

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.150 

to<00:03:21.160> record<00:03:21.460> while<00:03:21.730> flying<00:03:22.770> switch<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.950> camera

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
to record while flying switch the camera

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.900 
to record while flying switch the camera
to<00:03:24.790> Wi-Fi<00:03:25.710> then<00:03:26.710> control<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:27.400> to<00:03:27.550> your<00:03:27.700> phone

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
to Wi-Fi then control it to your phone

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.380 
to Wi-Fi then control it to your phone
and<00:03:31.530> there<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:32.620> have<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:33.400> DJI<00:03:33.760> phantom<00:03:33.880> 2

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
and there you have it the DJI phantom 2

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.470 
and there you have it the DJI phantom 2
