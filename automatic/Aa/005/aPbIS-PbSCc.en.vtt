couple of other fairly irrelevant bits
of<00:01:23.939> paper<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.570> well<00:01:25.009> just<00:01:26.009> looking

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
of paper there as well just looking

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.590 
of paper there as well just looking
around<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> back<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> couple<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.000> minor<00:01:27.330> things

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
around the back a couple of minor things

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.289 
around the back a couple of minor things
to<00:01:27.750> point<00:01:27.900> out<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> rear<00:01:29.400> tire<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:30.030> getting

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to point out the rear tire is getting

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.179 
to point out the rear tire is getting
close<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.840> tread<00:01:31.170> wear<00:01:31.350> indicator<00:01:31.829> these

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
close to this tread wear indicator these

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.920 
close to this tread wear indicator these
are<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> tread<00:01:32.640> when<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.939> wear<00:01:33.420> indicators

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
are the tread when you wear indicators

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.800 
are the tread when you wear indicators
here<00:01:34.170> that's<00:01:34.829> within<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.490> millimeter<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.600> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
here that's within a millimeter of that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.200 
here that's within a millimeter of that
so<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.259> always<00:01:37.380> change<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.829> tire<00:01:38.210> sooner

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so you can always change it tire sooner

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.179 
so you can always change it tire sooner
rather<00:01:39.360> than<00:01:39.600> later

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.600 

this

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
this

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.430 
this
and<00:01:46.090> exhaust<00:01:46.510> has<00:01:46.780> got<00:01:46.930> a<00:01:46.960> couple<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.230> minor

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
and exhaust has got a couple of minor

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.980 
and exhaust has got a couple of minor
dents<00:01:47.800> on<00:01:48.100> my<00:01:48.280> end<00:01:48.610> cap<00:01:48.970> there<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.450> can<00:01:49.840> only

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
dents on my end cap there I can only

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.480 
dents on my end cap there I can only
assume<00:01:50.140> that's<00:01:50.470> where<00:01:50.650> Sanders<00:01:50.920> backed<00:01:51.250> it

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
assume that's where Sanders backed it

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.120 
assume that's where Sanders backed it
close<00:01:52.420> to<00:01:52.720> a<00:01:52.750> wall<00:01:53.020> or<00:01:53.320> something<00:01:53.500> don't<00:01:54.010> know
