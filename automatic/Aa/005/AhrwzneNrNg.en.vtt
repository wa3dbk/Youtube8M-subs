00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello dear friends with you channel 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.690
 Elena and today I want to answer 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.460
 some questions asked me 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.019
 my viewers 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.900
 it means now a question such as the first one 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.789
 pass on the rights in America may not be 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.490
 knowing English very well and 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.550
 In general, how to go on the right now I 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.720
 came to such a department 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.480
 called money in English 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.210
 stands for depart mats mouse 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.690
 car in large in general some your 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.230
 on machines in general, something incomprehensible 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.399
 I do not remember but fuckers in the academy here we are 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.480
 we publish to the right 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.280
 that is, we give our data all over again 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.989
 in order to get both 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.350
 ID card ID 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.430
 then my take a little book is a little book 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 in Russian it is a booklet well 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.780
 anyway in san diego in california 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.769
 Call the directory drivers states 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.729
 california and you can read everything and 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.920
 how to learn the right in English 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.290
 it is not difficult at all 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.350
 difficult that is it is purely logical only 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.210
 thinking is basically better of course 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.549
 just learn the signs i don't think they 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.009
 very different these signs and in general 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.009
 rules that in other former Soviet 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.710
 our republics are not much different in 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.329
 principle if you were even near somewhere 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.220
 with the driver sat then you don't care 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.530
 already some specific rules in 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.079
 have a head means you need to learn 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.200
 Signs they of course on English so 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.259
 this is the most important thing to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.020
 you can take the test for the test too 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.759
 in Russian you say that you hand over 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.450
 in Russian come here this 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.200
 departments 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.320
 they give you a test there questions and answers 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.990
 it means you're from a long time I handed over 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.689
 we think of the five that there should 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.469
 choose one correct is allowed by 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.619
 I think 13 is a lot of mistakes but enough 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.460
 allowed and you pass the theory to you 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.070
 will give such temporary rights 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.000
 driver permit these temporary rights 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.190
 allow you some time studying 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.920
 drive a car if you do not know how 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.290
 to drive in the presence of some 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.300
 a person who has a good already 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.920
 great driving experience and he has the right 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.230
 teach ie it is not necessary 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.080
 instructor it could be your husband or 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.330
 your friend who enters the machine no less 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.730
 five years then you sit with him 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.620
 are studying how long does it take training 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.260
 it is absolutely important to nobody that 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.540
 did you learn to drive a car drive 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.930
 California is not difficult that the most important thing 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.900
 highlight pedestrians so few 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.360
 all the failure of pedestrians like that 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.760
 whatever they went for red on just 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.770
 losses down the street you must stop and 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.090
 skip this one most important thing for 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.610
 drivers in san diego what about in general 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.830
 Basically, I think it's all over America. 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.630
 approximately the rules are the same they 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.310
 norma good is slightly different 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.590
 but here we have for example in california 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.270
 red light is allowed on 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.220
 right subject to if no other interference 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.140
 states of this are not allowed that is it 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.780
 you need some great differences 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.020
 know that there is nothing complicated here i am 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.730
 never drove the car came here 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.920
 It turned out two or three weeks after work 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.170
 then got behind the wheel but because 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.040
 go to work and went well where are you 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.330
 getting around here and permit when you get 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.340
 first learn 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.240
 and decide what you can already pass on 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.670
 right you come here 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:56.330
 designate an experienced so -called then 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.150
 there is a specific date and time of the test 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.670
 for driving and now driving test 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.180
 you give in English that is with you 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.300
 will be 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.880
 English speaking instructor no matter who 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.030
 there will be but English speaking you should 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.270
 know basic translation 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.310
 certain things like headlights 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.910
 light turn on turn on 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.450
 wipers and turn right left 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.970
 dimensions show to park as you 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.790
 should know what he is telling you 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.070
 English you must understand this 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.850
 what he wants from you but in principle 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.370
 nothing complicated here is the route from this 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:40.160
 department is about 10 minutes 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.320
 Here is a little test you asked 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.940
 drive along the street observing a certain 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.220
 speed on each street its own speed 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.620
 You should watch these signs which 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.140
 limit driving speed clearly 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.750
 It stops at the feet of a stop in any 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.060
 case is not no easy drive this to you 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.610
 hundred percent you did not know means stop 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.380
 should be soft not yes not hard so 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.420
 calmly stopped for a little three seconds 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:07.160
 there at 15 stood go farther here and 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.710
 you can park 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.650
 it is here that the parallel parking requests 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:15.410
 from afar if you knew you would get here 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.030
 same rights and it doesn’t matter that you don’t 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.890
 speak fluent English that is 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.900
 basic things you just need to know 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.460
 in English and so in general it is not 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.250
 scary that is if you come from 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.680
 another country then you some time this 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.960
 helped within three months you can 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.650
 use your international type 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.660
 get right and drive 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.380
 after three months you must have 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.870
 my california rights on this here's what 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.150
 concerned in the water driving here and putting 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.590
 for driving at the same depart find you 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.600
 will check surely upon receipt 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.180
 rule losing you this is right for 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:58.910
 driving check eyesight necessarily a 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:01.250
 already people who are older than 5 10 5 or 6 10 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.800
 that's clearly not remembering the medical 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.300
 certain things requirements will be 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.140
 take the test 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.480
 here's driving every year ie those 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.150
 who are already older people just really 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.050
 many had a situation we have accidents when 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.879
 older people fall 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.310
 in an accident because they already 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:22.740
 incorrectly assess the situation on the wrong 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.720
 the pedal presses mainly in america 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.490
 us here here anyway exactly 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.889
 san diego 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:31.409
 most carries automatic machine 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.330
 it is absolutely easy to do yourself 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:36.479
 you know the big difference is clearly different 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.819
 the car did not sit on the machine at all 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.400
 do but here the elderly confuse the pedal 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.440
 gas and brake and gets into an accident 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.479
 so many victims happen therefore 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:49.020
 check every year they have older people 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:52.409
 it's 55 or 60 pam still 60 well 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.870
 if you have any questions yet 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:57.030
 maybe some 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.919
 driving moment and something else we can 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.409
 say that it is easy to enter here 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:04.889
 more or less free free you are here 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:07.949
 very good environments connect there friend 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:10.590
 with friend transitions speed on straight 65 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:13.770
 the streets are mostly 45 small 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:18.750
 25 streets I say Miley I can not 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:20.039
 clearly say kilometer well here 25 is 40 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.099
 kilometers i look 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:26.279
 65 is 110 kilometers like this 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:28.590
 approximately 45 this is 70 kilometers on the streets 

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:32.849
 that is, here are our speeds 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:35.190
 driving is easy enough of course well and 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:36.650
 all kinds of people on the road are where they are not 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:39.630
 happens to be a jerk 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:41.099
 nurofen just have to be careful well 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.050
 what was Elena with you 

00:07:41.099 --> 00:07:45.110
 ask your questions and see you soon 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.110
 meeting
