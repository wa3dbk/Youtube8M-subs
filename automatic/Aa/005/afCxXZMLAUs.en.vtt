I was ding girl you know a lot of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.580 
I was ding girl you know a lot of
practice<00:02:59.150> time<00:02:59.299> on<00:02:59.540> his<00:02:59.659> road<00:02:59.870> trip<00:03:02.470> over<00:03:03.470> they

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
practice time on his road trip over they

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.429 
practice time on his road trip over they
have<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.739> lifetime<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.849> know<00:03:04.939> neither<00:03:05.239> but<00:03:05.540> you

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:06.439 
have a lifetime you know neither but you

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:07.599 
have a lifetime you know neither but you
know<00:03:06.530> at<00:03:06.650> least<00:03:06.680> would<00:03:06.890> have<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.370> crowd

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
know at least would have the crowd

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.250 
know at least would have the crowd
behind<00:03:07.819> us<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.329> I<00:03:08.599> think<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:09.049> would<00:03:09.140> be<00:03:09.230> a

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
behind us and I think it would be a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.670 
behind us and I think it would be a
better<00:03:09.470> show<00:03:10.870> before<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:11.959> game<00:03:12.109> I<00:03:12.260> was<00:03:12.349> asking

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
better show before the game I was asking

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.379 
better show before the game I was asking

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
John about the current Kentucky team if

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:15.759 
John about the current Kentucky team if
I<00:03:14.450> can<00:03:14.629> defeated<00:03:15.139> and<00:03:15.260> what<00:03:15.379> would<00:03:15.500> that<00:03:15.530> mean

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
I can defeated and what would that mean
