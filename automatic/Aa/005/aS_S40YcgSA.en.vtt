00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:02.350
 do not 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.460
 by last 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.540
 by last 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.899
 finally the most used way to make the forecast is the hand to 

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:15.059
 As we have seen in the previous chapter this can be done by filling in 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.999
 the ticket but assigned or asking the program to place us the 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.159
 more logical for that day look here in motilleja a powerful base of 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:27.650
 data that is periodically updated and analysis tools that will 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.239
 they allow to order the signs of more to less and logical according to the 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.450
 games to play 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.970
 all this architecture allows other ways of making the forecast to the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.130
 which can be accessed through the drop-down menu located at the end 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.630
 lower left 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.490
 if we select logical forecast this window is opened with another menu 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.100
 drop-down below the ticket in this case there are two options and we will try 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.390
 the triple and double 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.660
 in the new window but let's say for example with nine triples and three doubles 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.450
 we go back to the previous screen and we see that the program proposes its 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.310
 combination with the triple and double we have ordered in addition to the two 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.170
 fixed signs that you consider more logical 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.130
 here we can click on statistics and the program informs us of what 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.540
 hit percentage has had this combination in recent seasons 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.370
 the 14 successful 29% while 35% stayed in the thirteen we accept 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.570
 summer we see the main screen where we only need to place the 15 and 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.480
 condition the prognosis 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.770
 we also have the option to take a forecast from a betting file 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.990
 that has more saved in the computer 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.710
 we open it and we will only need to put the conditions that we want for 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.250
 lower the number of bets 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.530
 a third option is the forecast by percentages that in this 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.780
 case already done on the 15 matches in this window we can enter in each 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.020
 check what percentage we want of each sign in each match 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.640
 to define a fixed sign we put 100% in the corresponding box to 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.100
 doubles and triples we can set variable percentages by default when 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.730
 we open the window the program uses for each game the percentages of its base 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.840
 of data and at any time we can recover them with this first button 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.400
 from the lower left 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.030
 finally on the right side we put the number of total bets per 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.230
 example 50 thousand ineca who will be responsible for generating them based on the percentages 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.439
 that we have introduced 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.469
 if we go back to the main screen and we calculate we want the distribution 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.019
 of the signs in the bets is very similar to the one we had defined 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.019
