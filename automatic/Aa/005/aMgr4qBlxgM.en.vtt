00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
game I think anyway you have to get this

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.150 
game I think anyway you have to get this
thing<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:29.810> try<00:00:30.810> not<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.109> drop<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.529> these<00:00:31.949> guys

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
thing and try not to drop it these guys

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.440 
thing and try not to drop it these guys
aren't<00:00:32.340> no<00:00:32.550> angst<00:00:32.730> if<00:00:32.940> they<00:00:33.030> hate<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.239> you

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
aren't no angst if they hate you you

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.100 
aren't no angst if they hate you you
drop<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.899> then<00:00:34.020> you're<00:00:34.140> thrown<00:00:34.320> back<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
drop it then you're thrown back and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.720 
drop it then you're thrown back and
actually<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.230> don't<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.010> get<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
actually you don't have to get this I

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.590 
actually you don't have to get this I
would<00:00:39.180> actually<00:00:39.809> not<00:00:40.290> get<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.489> we<00:00:42.450> get

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
would actually not get this and we get

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.560 
would actually not get this and we get
two<00:00:42.809> extra<00:00:43.170> bricks<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.770> think<00:00:44.070> because<00:00:44.670> we

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
two extra bricks here I think because we

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.180 
two extra bricks here I think because we
were<00:00:45.660> being<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:46.020> stupid<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:46.829> not<00:00:46.920> paying

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
were being really stupid and not paying

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.130 
were being really stupid and not paying
attention<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:48.480> kind<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.750> doing<00:00:48.930> this

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
attention just just kind of doing this

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380 
attention just just kind of doing this
but<00:00:49.440> anyway<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> want<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.120> brick

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
but anyway if you want to get this brick

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.700 
but anyway if you want to get this brick
I<00:00:51.539> forgot<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:51.840> color<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.530> got

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
I forgot what color was so you just got

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.939 
I forgot what color was so you just got
to<00:00:52.739> come<00:00:53.190> over<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.489> put<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.149> and

right<00:04:49.550> here<00:04:49.910> because<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.479> had<00:04:50.660> one<00:04:50.840> heart<00:04:51.289> left

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
right here because I had one heart left

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.409 
right here because I had one heart left
and<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:51.919> was<00:04:52.039> just<00:04:52.460> about<00:04:52.669> to<00:04:52.789> get<00:04:52.850> on<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.150> it<00:04:53.270> but

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
and I was just about to get on to it but

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.939 
and I was just about to get on to it but
that's<00:04:53.660> why<00:04:53.900> that<00:04:54.080> beam<00:04:54.260> is<00:04:54.410> really<00:04:54.710> annoying

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
that's why that beam is really annoying

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.340 
that's why that beam is really annoying
just<00:04:55.310> because<00:04:56.120> you<00:04:56.300> can<00:04:56.449> be<00:04:56.600> that<00:04:56.780> close<00:04:57.050> and

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
just because you can be that close and

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.620 
just because you can be that close and
then<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:57.590> beam<00:04:57.770> kills<00:04:58.100> you<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.970> it's<00:04:59.210> usually

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
then the beam kills you and it's usually

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.420 
then the beam kills you and it's usually
of<00:04:59.930> course<00:04:59.990> at<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.620> timing<00:05:01.100> where<00:05:01.280> you

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430
