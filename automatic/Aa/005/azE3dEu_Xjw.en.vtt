like super easy so what I have is a two

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.390 
like super easy so what I have is a two
cups<00:00:07.020> chopped<00:00:07.610> watermelon<00:00:08.840> cucumber<00:00:10.400> red

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
cups chopped watermelon cucumber red

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.970 
cups chopped watermelon cucumber red
pepper<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.540> some<00:00:12.870> cilantro<00:00:13.500> from<00:00:13.889> my

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
pepper this is some cilantro from my

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.519 
pepper this is some cilantro from my
garden<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:15.089> I<00:00:15.120> grew<00:00:15.420> myself<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.260> then<00:00:16.500> I

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
garden that I grew myself and then I

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.710 
garden that I grew myself and then I
have<00:00:17.070> about<00:00:17.430> I'd<00:00:17.730> say<00:00:17.760> half<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.300> cup<00:00:18.480> green

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
have about I'd say half a cup green

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.810 
have about I'd say half a cup green
onion<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.800> easy<00:00:20.010> because<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.400> ratio<00:00:20.760> is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
onion and it's easy because the ratio is

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.420 
onion and it's easy because the ratio is
just<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.869> two<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.260> two<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:22.560> perfect

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
just like one two one two one perfect

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.890 
just like one two one two one perfect
and<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.180> put<00:00:24.600> about<00:00:24.930> I'd<00:00:25.350> say<00:00:26.630> this<00:00:27.630> should

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
and then I put about I'd say this should

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.140 
and then I put about I'd say this should
be<00:00:28.050> six<00:00:28.349> cups<00:00:28.619> when<00:00:28.890> it's<00:00:29.010> blended<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:29.970> that's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
be six cups when it's blended so that's

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.600 
be six cups when it's blended so that's
how<00:00:30.330> I<00:00:30.359> gauge<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.949> kind<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.340> put<00:00:32.520> it

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
how I gauge it and I just kind of put it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
how I gauge it and I just kind of put it
in<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.910> X<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.239> figured<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.290> become<00:00:34.590> six

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
in the X I figured it will become six

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:53.920 
in the X I figured it will become six
cups<00:00:35.190> once<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.700> blend

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930
