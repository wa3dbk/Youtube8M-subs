00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.370
 welcome guys to this video where 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.900
 I will illustrate how I changed a screen 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.250
 a precise 13-inch MacBook Pro 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.860
 I didn't change the screen but I have 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.660
 changed the external glass of ours 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.189
 Macbook Pro in size 13 inches where 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.529
 you can see from the pictures 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.170
 indeed where you can see from the video is 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.859
 broken in the upper right corner took a 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.340
 bad blow 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.679
 we will change it for a cost 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.610
 simply of 39 euros and 40 and from 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.950
 lose around an hour and tools that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.969
 we need are a glass macbook pro 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.820
 got on ebay at the simple piece of 39 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 euro with the writing macbook pro 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.110
 a pick as you can see from the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.360
 images is an oven the fund will serve us 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.180
 to dissolve the glue that is found 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.460
 near this glass near the glass 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.910
 old glued to the shell of the macbook 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.710
 pro we start I obviously did the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.670
 speeded up video otherwise we would have it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.189
 put an hour 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.110
 as you can see from the images 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.540
 we begin to choose the glue of ours 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.130
 macbook pro 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.520
 obviously try not to throw the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.259
 heat inside the screen 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.540
 inside the glass ie in the part 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.400
 central otherwise it could damage 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.460
 lcd that is under our glass 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.130
 be patient in dissolving the bubble 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.960
 because it will take a long time 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.090
 meanwhile while passing the hole 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.270
 tried occasionally hit bed to see 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.759
 if it begins to enter inside the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.070
 shell don't do too much strength otherwise 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.390
 you could then break the pick yes 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.520
 could break the glass as it is 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.119
 happened to me in the beginning in part 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.649
 up right a little because it already was 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.350
 broken glass and there were already some 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.920
 splinters or a little because I applied 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.780
 too much strength in trying to do 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.969
 get inside the complex in 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.350
 moments when the pick begins and 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.990
 to come in 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.570
 always look for accompanying you with the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.370
 hole to move either right or left 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.730
 until you can get in 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.489
 all 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.230
 in all the outline of the glass in the 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.129
 moment in which he managed to get into 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.200
 you should not have all the outline of the glass 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:28.540
 you don't have to do anything you need to do 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:31.060
 only to be the macbook glass 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.060
 pro I repeat, I don't recommend guys 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.680
 apply too much force otherwise yes 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.620
 could break both the true and the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.980
 roof images I think I hope they are 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.390
 quite clear as I believe it 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.329
 important when you have 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.510
 removed the glass clean 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:52.720
 the lcd screen with a spray that 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:56.349
 we will find a spray for LCD cleaners with 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.680
 a good 390 cloth at the beginning they wanted ho 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.450
 made a great parade obviously with 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.970
 a cloth that cannot leave residues 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.450
 fortunately it has not broken me in 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.459
 even the glass is clean 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.930
 image I then turned the computer back on 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.359
 to see if he gave me problems he didn't 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.549
 given absolutely no problems at the moment 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.470
 in which you put the glass back you don't have to 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.930
 do nothing but force yourself 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.139
 remove the stickers behind it and 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.849
 in the part of all is also inserted the 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.769
 double-sided adhesive is already incorporated in the see 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.079
 make a slight pressure in the corners 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.880
 this law must be called the version 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.799
 yango the wind will adapt 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.819
 automatically to the shell of yours 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.319
 macbook pro 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.519
 I hope you enjoyed the video if you 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.290
