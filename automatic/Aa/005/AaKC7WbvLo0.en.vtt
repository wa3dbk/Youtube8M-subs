00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.540
 work his abs soothe his 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.940
 joint pain delaying 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.650
 effects of aging his body the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.019
 ebe headdress has it all 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.170
 this particular method that mixes 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.510
 aqua fitness and aqua fitness will soon make 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.310
 his appearance at the return to the Senate on 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.050
 sailing club lucenay 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.510
 the method was recently proposed to 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.119
 test title in four short and 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.219
 obviously is the most based on 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.920
 specific exercises this method will 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.100
 practice in total weightlessness then the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.370
 cua finish is a new technique 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.130
 France aquagym that helps 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.800
 to work without land support one is 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.450
 fully carried by the water which 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.559
 really makes it work 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.680
 the body the muscles deeply and 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.899
 So to improve our condition 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.170
 general physics our endurance and 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.600
 our strength 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.030
 so the work 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.320
 without music that really allows to adapt 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.409
 the rhythm rings 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.650
 to our capacity of the moment so we 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.400
 happens to fast results because 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.710
 it's really movements 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.930
 specific to work in water 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.390
 and that really gives results 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.159
 designed in a pilot center to form to 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.050
 quimper this method is exported 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.670
 now in clubs and this is the case 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.080
 to him his novel purpose of this form and 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.750
 so people to this method 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.560
 today you should know that 80% of 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:41.360
 Aquagym animators are not or little 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.550
 trained 90% do not practice this themselves 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.380
 that they do do so we're on a 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.940
 serious problematic ie 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.720
 they do not have a return 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.970
 exercises 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.950
 they feel dry by putting them 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.990
 in the water without having experienced them 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.550
 so to a high demand 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.350
 there are many people who do not dare 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.509
 still do aqua aerobics because 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.970
 to teach water aerobics because they 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.310
 not found benchmarks and that's for sure 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.649
 can not transpose a fitness class 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.880
 or a fitness class in 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.410
 water without apprehending the physiology of 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.790
 water is actually at the end of the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.860
 course the reactions were very 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.519
 positive that turns out that his music 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.470
 it's better we're listening to it 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.140
 the gentleman advised us well I 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.519
 think the abdominals 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.739
 it will make us work more 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.600
 Abdominal really I'm happy 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.310
 if he helps this morning as to the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.870
 aqua phoebe method she should do 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.390
 emulators in other associations 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.829
 it is in any case the goal I have a very 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.720
 good feeling since I believe 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.760
 enormously since the twenty years 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.310
 experience gives since we have a rate 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.739
 loyalty that is greater than 90% 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.299
 that is to say that people stay for life 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.670
 practically since we develop 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.140
 other body consciousness and one 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.120
 works the muscles tremendously 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.340
 deep in that people are under a 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.680
 form of education and rehabilitation 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.360
 especially in our language the air time 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.130
 today we use very badly our 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.829
 body is there in the lower rhine 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.940
 we come to a kind of reeducation 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.890
 while working 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.380
 we are not at all in his 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.900
 thing in balance with easy attention 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.910
 be careful the headdress there will be so 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.440
 offered to CNL members at the 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.340
 coming back a respite sin 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.340
 intercommunal
