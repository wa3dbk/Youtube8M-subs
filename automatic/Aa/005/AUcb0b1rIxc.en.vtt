00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.900
 hey he's welcome again 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.849
 hello that reads my name is Alberto and he 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.910
 was and I bring you a video that I had 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:16.030
 pending and it is the drawing of the month of 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.820
 August during that month I received some 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.470
 booklets and I want to teach you one of 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.870
 those he receives during the month of 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.020
 August was the puzzle book by 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.790
 Maria Fernanda my land and this is a 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.820
 book I think childish and it's a 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.140
 love story but here then 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.929
 particular is that it is located during 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.620
 the war of the Malvinas then is 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:41.589
 for him a story of love but 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.839
 with a very peculiar context another thread 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.480
 that I also received during this month was 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.370
 I think this is the last in the saga of 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.410
 daughter of a very bone that is dreams of 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.810
 gods and monsters of amy taylor 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.210
 this book I'm not really sure what to do 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.000
 with him if you want the riffs to play a 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.129
 contest around this book first 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.650
 here in the comments to take it in 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.780
 another account that also receive during 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.550
 the month of August was the book of the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.090
 maggie scorpio racing 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.790
 stiefvater is a little strange sofÃ­a and 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.860
 this one really caught my attention 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.650
 this book then headline you've already 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.509

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.759
 apart I want that I also arrived and that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.930
 it's like a little bit strange is the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.960
 adultery by Pablo Coelho 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.780
 the truth at a glance and prejudging 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.630
 the book was made to me as justice 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.570
 change of prey by Pablo Polo but 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.400
 I still do not read it then I'm not very 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.160
 sure if there is a relationship 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.620
 conflicting shades of brain constitute 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.010
 you read it tell me down here yes yes there 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.750
 a seemed or not or I am totally 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.550
 wrong another block I also received 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.290
 during the month of August it was walking 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.260
 of the activity of the first governor 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.149
 part by Robert Kirkman and James Bond 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.600
 and zynga because they all have names 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:06.350
 very weird I do not know and this one is based on 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.640
 Well, the famous television series the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.040
 walking dead that is really a 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.160
 graphic novel and after they started to 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.140
 make as a saga of books another book 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.950
 that I also received during the month of 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.670
 August that you have already read in high school 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.640

 this is a book that was one of the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.580
 first I read a long time ago 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.100
 so if it's like it has a value 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.569
 for me and the beautiful tradition because the 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.360
 edition that I had was a bit 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.950
 feito and then now I do have a 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.460
 edition although it 's pocket if I do not 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.490
