 most successful search engine in the world 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.930
 Google gives us all the information 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.330
 of the internet we work every day 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.020
 to find ideas for them 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.760
 Search engines even better google 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.670

 know already gives a lot 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.000
 because I praise quite a rally 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.680
 scratch me frightening googles 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.750

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.830
 German internet and penetrates in always 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:03.720
 more areas of life is google too 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.460

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.500
 Google has a form of power like 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.909
 they are not even the most extreme forms of 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.909
 state power had ever had 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.939
 from the search engine company google is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.100
 one of the most powerful companies of the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.039
 become world and google wants to continue 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.179
 to grow 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.460
 frederik drives therefore the 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.560
 creative spirit of silicon valley in 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.240
 keep the giant company awake and with 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.000
 always new products possible 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.590
 to give competitors no chance in 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.360
 a replica founding garage 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.850
 He supports the development teams at 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.920
 your future visions google 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.500
 therefore more and more areas of life 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.569
 Include a good race for the world of 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.659
 morning 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:56.399
 many of our projects seem to be going on 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.439
 to be coupled by the search engine 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.959
 At first glance, even if you look 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.280
 our mission looks at our goal 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:04.909
 we the information of the world 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.979
 organize and everyone at any time 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.329
 want to make accessible and usable 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.069
 then you can see that many again 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.319
 projects again under this goal 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.780
 also case the internetexperte and 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.910
 net activist markus beckedahl knows the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.090
 Tricks of the internet companies and operates 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.470
 with lectures seminars and blogs 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.590
 enlightenment in the seemingly enlightened 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.540
 digital age he knows who to look for 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.670
 google services logs the reads 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.220
 conditions of use mostly not 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.959
 before he agrees with them and googles the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.240
 sport not see all the data 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.680
 be collected 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.440
 what we do not see there but what a lot 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.480
 More relevant is what we are in 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.610
 network therefore move on which pages 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.350
 we were at what time where have 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.030
 we clicked on where we were after 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.910
 what did we possibly buy? 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.770
 this information so that are somewhere 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.890
 saved we do not see it 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.500
 Now everyone can and must do it for themselves 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.180
 decide which offers he offers 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.400
 uses and what he maybe 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.050
 when there is another user uses there 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.870
 the user totally free in his 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.900
 decision and we also find that 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.730
 Of course we are only welcome 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.270
 own fault if we google services 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.520
 use 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.860
 how safe are our data at all 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.050
 at google since the revelations of 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.400
 former US Intelligence Edward 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.170
 snowden we know that the 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.970
 Data lines of the big us 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.490
 Internet companies of Western 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.140
 Secret services were also tapped 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.030
 if that has been finished 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.030
 There are other possibilities
