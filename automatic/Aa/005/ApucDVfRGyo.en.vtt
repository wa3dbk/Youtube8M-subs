00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.839
 i 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.410
 if not 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.330
 hello guys today we are here in this 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.910
 new video to make another pixels in 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.460
 this case we go the pixel area the cookie 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.980
 well what does this pillar have to do next? 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.590
 nothing nothing but I do not like his 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.330
 texture its shape the colors and everything 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.650
 It pleases a lot and well, well, we start with 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.930
 a base of six gray wool cubes 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.290
 brown wool gray wool or coffee as 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.540
 I mean we go back to cover with wool 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.059
 orange when you remove this type can 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.000
 climb and well then on the banks we're going 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.860
 to place another two wool 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.620
 now yes brown as they want 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.930
 say brown coffee no problems already know 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.290
 what I mean and good well now 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.140
 come on now so it attracts many pixels 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.690
 since they are not displayed in the update 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.330
 and that we can use creative mode and that 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.760
 our worlds and all that like that 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.640
 They love to play and we all begin to 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.180
 do for so mega constructions 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.740
 in our worlds and good is good 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.470
 be a little ahead of what will be the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.930
 next video but they will have it tomorrow 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.390
 because I will have upload a daily video 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.180
 let's say triple should record this in the 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.420
 voice because what strictly after and 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.560
 then I go with the other video north you 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.119
 I say that he will treat 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.079
 and then diagram one and this video what 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.270
 I'm going to save for the day after tomorrow and so 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.240
 na wai and as advance not video every time 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.460
 so to have spare parts from here system 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.970
 each one can have another one stored there and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.039
 good now yes that after them good 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.890
 encourage the construction that I am 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.039
 doing now well and good is a mega 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.979
 building a roll something like this 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.500
 It is without reducing lines a few sources 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.069
 spectacular tickets is super 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.810

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.209
 picture and good as in the edition 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:21.090
 I'm going to create a lot is pixelar because 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.750
 this one I think are easy tutorials if 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.290
 there are not many 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.110
 and what 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.450
 most show them from the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.250
 dead shows them built with the 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.329
 I do not know about mario and there's already 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.400
 You put lehman's youtube is the show 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.500
 Maybe I can explain how it's done 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.750
 anything while not only 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.329

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.480
 account is so good that in some cases 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.389
 we do not and well then we go now yes 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.319
 that makes many pixels for some because 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:01.099
 you have it in the next 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.169
