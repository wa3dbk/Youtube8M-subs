00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
commands that make a lot more sense

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.170 
commands that make a lot more sense
voice<00:00:57.690> commands<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.350> talking<00:00:58.649> about<00:00:59.180> so

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
issuing voice commands and things like

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.600 
issuing voice commands and things like
that<00:01:26.430> i<00:01:27.200> really<00:01:28.200> recommend<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.770> program<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that i really recommend this program and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.569 
that i really recommend this program and
i<00:01:30.240> think<00:01:30.540> people<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.130> there's<00:01:32.130> been<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.340> lot<00:01:32.549> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
i think people of there's been a lot of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.340 
i think people of there's been a lot of
discussion<00:01:33.119> around<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.570> oculus<00:01:33.930> rift<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
discussion around the oculus rift and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.859 
discussion around the oculus rift and
they're<00:01:34.500> gonna<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> fact<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.970> they're

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
they're gonna and the fact that they're

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.179 
they're gonna and the fact that they're
going<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.320> think<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.710> some<00:01:37.950> really

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
going to have to think up some really

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.060 
going to have to think up some really
cool<00:01:38.400> new<00:01:38.729> innovative<00:01:39.380> control<00:01:40.380> schemes<00:01:40.799> for

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
cool new innovative control schemes for

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
cool new innovative control schemes for
the<00:01:41.130> oculus<00:01:41.520> rift<00:01:41.790> new<00:01:42.119> peripherals<00:01:42.750> things

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the oculus rift new peripherals things

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.960 
the oculus rift new peripherals things
like<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.460> this

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
like that but I think with this

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.210 
like that but I think with this
particular<00:01:45.180> program<00:01:45.689> voice<00:01:46.229> attack<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
particular program voice attack that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.649 
particular program voice attack that
solves<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.119> those<00:01:48.329> problems

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
solves a lot of those problems

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.260 
solves a lot of those problems
immediately<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.610> program<00:01:51.090> by

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
immediately and just this program by

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.910 
immediately and just this program by
itself<00:01:52.729> really<00:01:53.729> does<00:01:53.909> make<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.570> game<00:01:54.780> feel<00:01:55.530> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
itself really does make the game feel so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.770 
itself really does make the game feel so
much<00:01:56.100> more<00:01:56.159> immersive<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.479> really

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
much more immersive it's just really

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.740 
much more immersive it's just really
really<00:01:57.990> kill<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.770> I've<00:01:58.860> never<00:01:59.040> kind<00:01:59.340> of

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
really kill and I've never kind of

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.780 
really kill and I've never kind of
