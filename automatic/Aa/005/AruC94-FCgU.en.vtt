the<00:04:40.630> most<00:04:41.500> exciting<00:04:41.770> day<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.430> my<00:04:42.580> life<00:04:42.850> but<00:04:43.240> I

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
the most exciting day of my life but I

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.120 
the most exciting day of my life but I
did<00:04:43.870> have<00:04:43.960> someone<00:04:44.200> by<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.530> video<00:04:44.919> actually

did have someone by the video actually

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.120 
did have someone by the video actually
so<00:04:45.550> I<00:04:45.730> made<00:04:46.150> a<00:04:46.180> bit<00:04:46.330> of<00:04:46.360> money<00:04:46.540> off<00:04:46.810> of<00:04:46.900> it<00:04:47.070> I'm<00:04:48.070> a

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
so I made a bit of money off of it I'm a

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.220 
so I made a bit of money off of it I'm a
total<00:04:48.520> sellout<00:04:48.790> by<00:04:49.060> the<00:04:49.120> way<00:04:49.300> obviously<00:04:49.870> as

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
total sellout by the way obviously as

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.010 
total sellout by the way obviously as
you<00:04:50.350> can<00:04:50.500> kind<00:04:50.740> of<00:04:50.830> tell<00:04:51.130> but<00:04:51.850> but<00:04:52.510> no<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:52.720> think

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
you can kind of tell but but no I think

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.990 
you can kind of tell but but no I think
as<00:04:53.500> this<00:04:53.770> gameplay<00:04:54.130> is<00:04:54.340> kind<00:04:54.580> of<00:04:54.669> wrapping

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
as this gameplay is kind of wrapping

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.570 
as this gameplay is kind of wrapping
down<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.389> kind<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:55.960> wrap<00:04:56.200> it<00:04:56.350> up<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:56.710> we

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
down I kind of wrap it up and we

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.129 
down I kind of wrap it up and we
actually<00:04:57.729> lose<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.389> game<00:04:58.630> so<00:04:58.870> don't<00:04:58.930> go
