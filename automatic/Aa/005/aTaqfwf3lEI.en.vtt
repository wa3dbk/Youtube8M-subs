actually<00:02:28.459> pull<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.700> out<00:02:28.760> right<00:02:28.910> now<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:31.010> is

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
actually pull it out right now it is

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.840 
actually pull it out right now it is
that<00:02:31.370> loose<00:02:34.540> there<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.660> is

professor<00:02:37.850> is<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.450> loose<00:02:39.730> basically<00:02:40.730> blew

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
professor is that loose basically blew

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.100 
professor is that loose basically blew
this<00:02:41.239> capacitor<00:02:41.780> loose<00:02:41.959> from<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.230> board<00:02:44.110> and

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
this capacitor loose from the board and

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.720 
this capacitor loose from the board and
this<00:02:45.560> one<00:02:45.739> is<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.280> one<00:02:46.459> here<00:02:46.580> it's<00:02:46.700> very

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
this one is this one here it's very

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.590 
this one is this one here it's very
loose<00:02:47.120> too

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
loose too

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.160 
loose too
I<00:02:49.180> could<00:02:50.180> probably<00:02:50.269> pull<00:02:50.510> it<00:02:50.630> out<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:50.900> phone

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
I could probably pull it out to phone

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:58.990 
I could probably pull it out to phone
into<00:02:54.700> it's<00:02:55.700> just<00:02:55.850> amazing<00:02:57.400> we<00:02:58.400> just<00:02:58.430> kind<00:02:58.910> of

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
into it's just amazing we just kind of

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000 
into it's just amazing we just kind of
think<00:02:59.239> how<00:02:59.480> much<00:02:59.780> voltage<00:03:00.140> went<00:03:00.680> through<00:03:00.890> this

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
think how much voltage went through this

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.770 
think how much voltage went through this
thing<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:02.810> get<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.350> hot<00:03:04.630> that's<00:03:05.630> just

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
thing to get it that hot that's just

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.050 
thing to get it that hot that's just
like<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.320> first<00:03:06.350> part<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.489> showed<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.880> blew

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
like the first part I showed you blew

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.410 
like the first part I showed you blew
the<00:03:08.150> capacitor<00:03:08.540> completely<00:03:08.959> off<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.170> board

these<00:07:21.900> three<00:07:22.169> boards<00:07:22.349> here<00:07:23.690> in<00:07:24.690> our<00:07:24.780> pulls

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.050 
these three boards here in our pulls

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.920 
these three boards here in our pulls
from<00:07:25.460> HP<00:07:26.460> Compaq<00:07:27.030> systems<00:07:27.389> which<00:07:27.539> I<00:07:27.720> had

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
from HP Compaq systems which I had

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.370 
from HP Compaq systems which I had
another<00:07:28.199> one<00:07:28.410> which<00:07:28.560> I<00:07:28.680> threw<00:07:28.889> away<00:07:30.380> that's

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 
another one which I threw away that's

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.980 
another one which I threw away that's
basically<00:07:31.889> for<00:07:32.479> compared<00:07:33.479> to<00:07:33.720> four<00:07:34.650> eight

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:35.990 
basically for compared to four eight

basically for compared to four eight
twelve<00:07:38.360> like<00:07:39.360> fourteen<00:07:39.840> different<00:07:39.960> boards

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:42.020 
twelve like fourteen different boards

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.229
