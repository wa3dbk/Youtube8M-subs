00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.789
 hello everybody does not know me 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.350
 I hope you all go well so 

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:07.299
 today we find ourselves on a draw at 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.130
 croisy the book for a new video 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.500
 I will make you my first tutorial 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.420
 a special tutorial since a lot of 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.880
 people ask this kind of question and 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.970
 so it's having a beautiful city 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.650
 so to have a beautiful city a 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.330
 very pretty city ​​very low it requires 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.460
 go through several stages 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.740
 you have to know that each step counts 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.170
 so here is really very attentive to this 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.119
 that I will tell you now so the 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.890
 first step is not to 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.420
 rush to develop his city because 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.980
 that if you rush like a sick 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.510
 behind your screen to advance the date 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.359
 cheat everywhere and touba in fact you 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.769
 are going to start doing anything 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.420
 everything will go in all directions and where 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.710
 late bresse with a disaster 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.010
 this is the most important step 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.409
 do not rush to develop his 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.649
 city ​​is really be very patient 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:59.920
 So here is the second step 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.799
 are the paths actually a lot of 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.869
 perch of desolate a lot of people 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.250
 say that if we have no way down the 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.350
 city is naked it's as if ben 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.549
 in fact she is ugly and all and in 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.200
 the more it prevents us from having life 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.039
 perfect bah I'll answer that kind 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.479
 received ideas 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:16.570
 abbas is actually that's totally 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.329
 wrong we can very well not see any 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.009
 way in the city but watch out if 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.200
 you choose if you choose not to 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.820
 put your way in your bile in 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.100
 your city ​​and ben you have to be sure 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.079
 to master because if you do not know 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.390
 too much to do without his way 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.490
 behaved to the risks of defects in 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.929
 formations if he can say that like that 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.759
 two holes and everything in your city ​​so 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.219
 this is really a big choice to 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.750
 do I let you choose because 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.020
 her way it can be very pretty 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.390
 super natural and everything but it's necessary 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.219
 to master and with path that can do 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.659
 very pretty girl whose those there it is to 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.579
 you choose I let you do 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.170
 your choice 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.990
 this is me for example my point of view 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.319
 is that I prefer with path so 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.600
 by the way we go to the third stage 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:04.090
 the third step is to choose 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.979
 his ways so I can tell you that he 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.020
 are many choices and many 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.270
 sites we propose so there is the sister of 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.100
 this is a fine design bibi 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.620
 regional enormously I leave you 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.600
 choose so here and to choose this 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.480
 way we must already rely on this 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.960
 kind of questions what is the theme of 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.400
 my city because there really 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.560
 enormously me for example it's 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.380
 cute kawaii fairy that's all that 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.810
 I love what so bah my dull era he 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.790
 they will give 100 euros without 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.990
 really huge pater is the same as 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:41.340
 I created here is really to be based 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.200
 on this kind of questions 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.640
 so then the state of katz and the 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.380
 flowers the flowers that's what they have 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.810
 want the most your life is really 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.640
 what goes to the colorful bring him 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.170
 joy and all because frankly 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.730
 without flowers in your low town and 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.340
 as if it's a black city and 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.440
 white all sad 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.090
 finally here and in addition it prevents you 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.410
 to see the perfect life so that's it 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.460
 really bigger fault if they knew 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.800
 if you did not get done in your 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.030
 city ​​so of course obviously the 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.710
 best and most beautiful flowers 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.450
 flowers these are the hybrid flowers so 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.510
 it's really pretty much every 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.580
 colors and to reproduce the flowers 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.820
 hybrid low it's better to have one at 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.990
 see again in gold and a fertilizer but that wants 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.520
 not say that without this material you 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.890
 can not have kids hybrids 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.330
 that's working so try for 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.310
 to make hybrids you have to place 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.800
 flowers side by side of the same species but 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.990
 not the same color and of course it takes 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.400
 water 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.770
 so now we go to step 5 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.570
 it's greenery so the opinion of the 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.300
 greenery I speak of everything that is 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.010
 fruit trees in brice also not 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.180
 need to hunger not necessarily my ten 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:48.660
 fruit trees fir trees bushes 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.400
 and finally clover is all what 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.930
 all that will fill your city 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.340
 and it's going to embellish it as much as 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.190
 flowers so do not hesitate to do it by 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.570
 example a forest of trees or low of that 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.030
 that you want finally here is same 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.060
 a lot of greenery what then there we 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:08.280
 go to step 6 this is the last 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.750
 stage it is public works 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.200
 here I am going to stop there so of 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.370
 public works 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.130
 do not hesitate to put some finally we put 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.410
 different in your city they 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.910
 should be scattered everywhere a little 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.889
 everywhere in your city so that must 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.250
 not be tight for example you can 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:32.900
 put 10 in the first part of 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.250
 the city and 10 down and voila what has to 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.080
 really do not hesitate to put some 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.580
 a lot so I believe that in these 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:42.950
 time then in this opus we can in 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.630
 put 30 maximum in here is so bah 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.630
 I think I said everything for this 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.130
 video the crazy so yeah we'll get 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.200
 leave lhasa not super fast 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.380
 but just before I will reveal to you the 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.030
 key to this video 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.669
 so in fact it's only to see a 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.169
 beautiful city must have the envy so 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.000
 makes an effort because 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:04.700
 frankly clearly without effort you 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.710
 will have no result here it is 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.740
 really the basis what make an effort 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.910
 and so I tell you who defiles 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.080
 everyone and we'll see you soon 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.830
 for a new video 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.830
 ciao everyone
