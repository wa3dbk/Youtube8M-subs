pretty cheap but it's gonna need some
work<00:00:06.440> one<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.589> first<00:00:07.770> things<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.069> need<00:00:08.340> to

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
work one of the first things I need to

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.370 
work one of the first things I need to
do<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.880> replace<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.450> handlebars<00:00:09.870> as<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.260> can

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
do is replace the handlebars as you can

do is replace the handlebars as you can
see<00:00:10.590> their<00:00:11.340> bet<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:12.300> side<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.870> down<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> think

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
see their bet this side is down I think

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.870 
see their bet this side is down I think
both<00:00:13.830> sides<00:00:13.860> are<00:00:14.130> kind<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.309> actually<00:00:14.639> bent

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
both sides are kind of actually bent

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.340 
both sides are kind of actually bent
down<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> little<00:00:15.269> bit<00:00:15.420> but<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.809> side<00:00:16.049> is

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
down a little bit but this side is

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.019 
down a little bit but this side is
definitely<00:00:17.039> down<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.430> little<00:00:17.609> bit<00:00:17.730> more<00:00:17.910> you

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
definitely down a little bit more you

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.390 
definitely down a little bit more you
can<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.660> just<00:00:19.199> not<00:00:19.380> symmetrical<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
can see that just not symmetrical you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.070 
can see that just not symmetrical you
don't<00:00:20.640> want<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> try<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.060> bend<00:00:21.510> handlebars

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
don't want to try to bend handlebars

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.710 
don't want to try to bend handlebars
back<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.769> mean<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.250> but<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.269> really

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
back I mean you can but you really

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.410 
back I mean you can but you really
shouldn't<00:00:25.260> because<00:00:26.189> when<00:00:26.820> they<00:00:26.910> Bend<00:00:27.180> you

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
shouldn't because when they Bend you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.790 
shouldn't because when they Bend you
bend<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.660> back<00:00:27.840> you're<00:00:28.380> weakening<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
bend the back you're weakening the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.910 
bend the back you're weakening the
handlebars<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.689> that<00:00:30.710> increases<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
handlebars and that increases the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.190 
handlebars and that increases the
potential<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:33.239> they're<00:00:33.420> going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.719> break

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
potential that they're going to break

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.430 
potential that they're going to break
and<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.760> want<00:00:36.390> handlebars<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.230> break

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and you do not want handlebars to break

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.110 
and you do not want handlebars to break
while<00:00:37.680> you're<00:00:37.800> riding<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.160> bike<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:39.090> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
while you're riding the bike that is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.450 
while you're riding the bike that is
just<00:00:39.480> extremely<00:00:39.960> dangerous<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:41.280> cause

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
just extremely dangerous and can cause

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.119 
just extremely dangerous and can cause
severe<00:00:42.059> injury<00:00:42.469> it's<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.680> better<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.950> go

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
severe injury it's just better to go

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.090 
severe injury it's just better to go
ahead<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.789> replace<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.480> handlebars<00:00:46.140> they're

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
ahead and replace the handlebars they're

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.819 
ahead and replace the handlebars they're
not<00:00:47.309> very<00:00:47.670> expensive<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:49.110> they're<00:00:49.620> gonna<00:00:49.710> be

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
not very expensive and they're gonna be

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.650 
not very expensive and they're gonna be
a<00:00:49.860> lot<00:00:49.950> cheaper<00:00:50.010> than<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.969> hospital<00:00:51.449> bills

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a lot cheaper than the hospital bills

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.799 
a lot cheaper than the hospital bills
that<00:00:52.020> you're<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.129> get<00:00:53.340> if<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.670> break<00:00:53.910> so

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
that you're to get if they break so

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.869 
that you're to get if they break so
anyway<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.649> why<00:00:55.860> I'm<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.699> today

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
anyway that's why I'm going to do today

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.319 
anyway that's why I'm going to do today
pretty<00:00:57.719> easy<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.309> bike<00:00:59.489> didn't<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.000> grips

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
pretty easy the bike didn't have grips

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.990 
pretty easy the bike didn't have grips
on<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.690> when<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> got<00:01:01.289> them<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.190> don't<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
on it when I got them so I don't have to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.179 
on it when I got them so I don't have to
remove<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> old<00:01:03.420> grips<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.739> some<00:01:04.920> videos

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
remove the old grips I have some videos

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.670 
remove the old grips I have some videos
on<00:01:05.400> replacing<00:01:05.700> grips<00:01:06.090> already<00:01:06.680> they're

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
on replacing grips already they're

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.679 
on replacing grips already they're
pretty<00:01:07.890> simple<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.520> jam<00:01:09.060> something<00:01:09.479> under

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
pretty simple just jam something under

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.969 
pretty simple just jam something under
there<00:01:09.840> like<00:01:10.020> an<00:01:10.140> Allen<00:01:10.409> wrench<00:01:10.439> squeaks

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
there like an Allen wrench squeaks

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.370 
there like an Allen wrench squeaks
squirts<00:01:11.490> them<00:01:11.640> alcohol<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
squirts them alcohol in there it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.719 
squirts them alcohol in there it
lubricates<00:01:13.560> them<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.250> slide<00:01:14.490> them<00:01:14.580> right

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
lubricates them and you slide them right

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.210 
lubricates them and you slide them right
off<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.380> watch<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.650> other<00:01:16.710> videos<00:01:17.070> on

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
off but you watch my other videos on

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.660 
off but you watch my other videos on
that<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.210> let's<00:01:18.630> get<00:01:18.960> started

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
that so let's get started

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.230 
that so let's get started
okay<00:01:20.670> I'm<00:01:20.820> gonna<00:01:20.909> start<00:01:21.150> off<00:01:21.390> by<00:01:21.750> removing<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
okay I'm gonna start off by removing the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.190 
okay I'm gonna start off by removing the
brake<00:01:24.240> shifu's<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.930> there<00:01:25.049> they're

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
brake shifu's on there they're

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.780 
brake shifu's on there they're
integrated<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.650> here<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.189> there's<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.670> one

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
integrated on here so there's just one

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.210 
integrated on here so there's just one
clamp<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.320> both<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> brakes<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
clamp for the both the brakes and

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.060 
clamp for the both the brakes and
shifters<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.380> an<00:01:31.439> Allen<00:01:31.680> wrench<00:01:31.710> on

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
shifters so just with an Allen wrench on

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
shifters so just with an Allen wrench on
here<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.610> looks<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> five<00:01:33.240> millimeter

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
here it looks like the five millimeter

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:43.249 
here it looks like the five millimeter
just<00:01:34.229> loosen<00:01:34.619> these<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.720> sometimes<00:01:43.049> there's

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
just loosen these and sometimes there's

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.980 
just loosen these and sometimes there's
an<00:01:43.380> issue<00:01:43.500> if<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.340> cable<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.720> long

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
an issue if the cable is just not long

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.380 
an issue if the cable is just not long
enough<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.740> won't<00:01:47.040> reach<00:01:47.280> out<00:01:47.549> tap<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.149> end

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
enough it won't reach out tap to the end

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.840 
enough it won't reach out tap to the end
of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.990> bar<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.130> is<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.399> loosen

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
of the bar so what you do is just loosen

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.749

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.320 
sure that they're cut about where I want
them<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.480> be<00:03:57.689> they<00:03:58.439> look<00:03:58.560> pretty<00:03:58.709> good

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.220 

then<00:04:09.420> I'll<00:04:09.480> take<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:13.610> shifters<00:04:14.610> here<00:04:15.230> and

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
then I'll take the shifters here and

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.890 
then I'll take the shifters here and
slide<00:04:16.560> these<00:04:16.709> on<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:23.660> they're<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.690> little

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
slide these on and they're a little

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.690 
slide these on and they're a little
tight<00:04:25.140> going<00:04:25.380> over<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.800> end<00:04:25.980> so<00:04:26.280> I'm<00:04:26.490> going<00:04:26.640> to

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
tight going over the end so I'm going to

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.160 
tight going over the end so I'm going to
just<00:04:26.790> take<00:04:27.000> a<00:04:27.030> screwdriver<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.750> kind<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.080> a

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
just take a screwdriver and kind of a

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.350 
just take a screwdriver and kind of a
pry<00:04:28.470> apart<00:04:29.220> this<00:04:29.580> clamp<00:04:29.880> just<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.210> little<00:04:30.930> bit

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
pry apart this clamp just a little bit

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:40.970 
pry apart this clamp just a little bit
so<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.480> can<00:04:33.540> get<00:04:33.750> over<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:34.050> end<00:04:34.200> here<00:04:39.980> usually

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
so I can get over the end here usually

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.650 
so I can get over the end here usually
to<00:04:41.250> get<00:04:41.310> past<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:41.760> little<00:04:41.820> end<00:04:42.180> part<00:04:42.420> there

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
to get past that little end part there

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.160 
to get past that little end part there
then<00:04:43.530> they'll<00:04:43.770> slide<00:04:43.980> right<00:04:44.160> on<00:04:44.310> like<00:04:44.490> that

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.950 

and<00:04:49.170> try<00:04:49.380> this<00:04:49.620> one<00:04:49.770> over<00:04:49.950> here<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.970> same

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
and try this one over here and same

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.120 
and try this one over here and same
thing<00:04:51.990> over<00:04:52.260> here<00:04:52.380> so<00:04:52.770> I'll<00:04:52.860> just<00:04:52.890> take<00:04:53.070> a

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
thing over here so I'll just take a

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.240 
thing over here so I'll just take a
screwdriver<00:04:53.990> kind<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.080> pry<00:04:55.470> it<00:04:55.530> apart<00:04:55.680> the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250
