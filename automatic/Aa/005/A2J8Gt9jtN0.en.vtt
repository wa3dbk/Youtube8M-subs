lot of fun i actually think i did have a
3<00:00:51.120> bar<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.930> game<00:00:52.199> play<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:53.309> really

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
3 bar in this game play it's really

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.729 
3 bar in this game play it's really
quick<00:00:54.020> unfortunately<00:00:55.020> i<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.199> was<00:00:55.289> four<00:00:55.559> on

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739

three<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.280> four<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:57.030> most<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> game<00:00:58.070> so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
three or four on for most of the game so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.250 
three or four on for most of the game so
kill<00:00:59.879> counts<00:01:00.239> not<00:01:00.359> really<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.750> high<00:01:00.930> but

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
kill counts not really that high but

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.000 
kill counts not really that high but
still<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> pretty<00:01:02.039> decent<00:01:02.489> game<00:01:02.670> place<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.270> uh

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010
