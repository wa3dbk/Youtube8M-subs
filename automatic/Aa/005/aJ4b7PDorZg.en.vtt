but you'll also see me aim down in the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.670 
but you'll also see me aim down in the

window where you can get the rock but
it's<00:01:23.549> actually<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.180> other<00:01:24.360> side<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.689> you

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
it's actually on the other side but you

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.510 
it's actually on the other side but you
can<00:01:24.930> still<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.229> rock<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.040> did
