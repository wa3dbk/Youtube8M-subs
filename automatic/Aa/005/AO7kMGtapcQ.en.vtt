00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello welcome one more day is cooking 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.299
 for everyone today we will make crepes 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.820
 ingredients that we will need are 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.170
 the following for two people 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:16.670
 we will need 500 milliliters of milk 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 160 grams of wheat flour 2 eggs 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.789
 a pinch of salt a teaspoon of 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.250
 oil and a little butter if not 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.859
 you have a weight or a measuring jar you can 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.650
 prepare crepes knowing that 500 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.260
 milliliters are two glasses of milk and that 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 160 grams of wheat flour are 20 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.969
 scoops rasas the first thing we have 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.200
 what to do is add the flour in a 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.079
 container 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.079
 Next we add the milk 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.290
 happen 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.610
 and the oil 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.399
 and the eggs 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.870
 and we spent everything we took a blender 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.870
 electrical and we start to beat 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.280
 once we have the mass completely 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.590
 homogeneous so that it acquires more softness 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.869
 we're going to let him rest half an hour 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.420
 once he has spent half an hour in a 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.060
 pan we put a little butter and 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.680
 we are spreading it since we have put 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.680
 the fire to the maximum 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.910
 once the butter is 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.120
 completely split and the pan is 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.880
 hot with the help of a saucepan we put 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.260
 more in our pan so that we 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.260
 the pancake is rounded 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.760
 and we wait for it to be done on one side 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.830
 to be able to turn it around little by little 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.100
 let's take off the edges with the help of 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.100
 A spatula 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.659
 As you can see, the 13th is made by 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.360
 one side because you can see that it has come out very 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.570
 pretty then with the help the same 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.060
 spatula we are going to turn it around 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.009
 and we let it be done on this side with 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.290
 help from a spatula we raise and already 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.020
 it is golden on this side also so 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.209
 that we take out a plate and do what 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.800
 same with the rest of the mass if I am 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.570
 crafty in our part use 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.520
 spatula simply with our hands 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.930
 we can turn it around this is simple 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.510
 how to do or yes 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.340
 and the return we have finished doing 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.159
 all the crepes and in total we have 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.230
 left 7 now I'm going to teach the 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.290
 different ways of folding crepes that 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.770
 there is the first fan-shaped is 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.380
 as simple as catching a pancake 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.440
 then let's see in half and in this 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.090
 half we folded it in another half and already 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.560
 we have our believe in the form of 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.120
 fan 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.739
 now I'm going to teach you square 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.380
 we take this end and take it towards 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.410
 half the other end also what 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.170
 we bring in half and with these two 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.840
 ends more towards the middle also and 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:09.459
 this halfway too and we already have 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.459
 a square shaped pancake 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.950
 the next way is the cigar you have 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.290
 to take this end in half 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.690
 is halfway through and by this 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.870
 end we start to roll come on 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.930
 rolling 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.200
 until we finish winding and here 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.330
 you have the three presentations here of 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.310
 she to all the crepes finished with 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.970
 different fillings and different shapes 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.430
 of dubbing for example here we have the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.180
 of sweet milk caramel and almond 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.329
 chopped here the candied fruit here 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.569
 it's lemon juice and icing sugar here 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:52.329
 the cream cheese and ham and for 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:56.769
 Last the cream of cocoa and hazelnuts 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:59.560
 chocolate and cream and you see the variety so 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.150
 great that we can make from crepes if 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.799
 you want to see a video in which 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.140

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:07.510
 crepes in a link below in the 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.640
