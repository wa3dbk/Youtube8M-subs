impressive<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.260> my<00:00:34.290> opinion<00:00:34.920> me<00:00:35.040> obviously<00:00:35.899> if

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
impressive in my opinion me obviously if

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
impressive in my opinion me obviously if
we're<00:00:37.170> basing<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.770> judges<00:00:38.100> scorecards

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
we're basing it on the judges scorecards

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.139 
we're basing it on the judges scorecards
it<00:00:38.879> still<00:00:39.120> wasn't<00:00:39.329> enough<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:40.440> um<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:41.149> thought

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
it still wasn't enough but um I thought

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.709 
it still wasn't enough but um I thought
the<00:00:42.300> rail<00:00:42.510> foot<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:43.649> he<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.520> up<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the rail foot as if he was up in the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.779 
the rail foot as if he was up in the
last<00:00:46.050> couple<00:00:46.440> rounds<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.430> thought<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
last couple rounds and I thought that

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.510 
last couple rounds and I thought that
was<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> bad<00:00:48.270> decision<00:00:48.539> by<00:00:49.020> him<00:00:49.350> okay<00:00:50.070> he<00:00:50.250> needed

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
was a bad decision by him okay he needed

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.850 
was a bad decision by him okay he needed
to<00:00:50.640> really<00:00:50.879> go<00:00:51.090> out<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> warrior<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.379> not

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
to really go out like a warrior and not

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.939 
to really go out like a warrior and not
go<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.640> he's<00:00:53.910> Friday<00:00:54.440> comfortably<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.920> I

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
go out like he's Friday comfortably so I

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.790 
go out like he's Friday comfortably so I
was<00:00:56.670> very<00:00:56.910> disappointed<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.620> um

the<00:01:47.549> 11th<00:01:48.060> round<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.450> believe<00:01:48.750> okay<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.619> think

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the 11th round I believe okay so I think

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.069 
the 11th round I believe okay so I think
I'm<00:01:50.189> not<00:01:50.340> sure<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.540> pretty<00:01:51.720> much<00:01:51.930> on

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
I'm not sure but I was pretty much on

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.730 
I'm not sure but I was pretty much on
par<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.470> whatever<00:01:53.040> Steve<00:01:53.310> Arwood<00:01:53.640> had<00:01:54.180> okay

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
par with whatever Steve Arwood had okay

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.569 
par with whatever Steve Arwood had okay
so<00:01:56.490> anyway<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> thought<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.479> fight<00:01:57.659> was<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> draw

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
so anyway I thought the fight was a draw

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.550 
so anyway I thought the fight was a draw
Darrell<00:02:00.240> was<00:02:00.509> coming<00:02:00.780> back<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> second

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
Darrell was coming back in the second

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.770 
Darrell was coming back in the second
half<00:02:01.740> because<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.490> thought<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:03.000> Gail<00:02:03.240> was<00:02:03.540> just

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
half because I thought the Gail was just

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.810 
half because I thought the Gail was just
trying<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.170> land<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.710> big<00:02:04.740> shot<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.430> fell<00:02:05.640> in

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
trying to land one big shot and fell in

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.359 
trying to land one big shot and fell in
love<00:02:06.000> with<00:02:06.119> his<00:02:06.600> power<00:02:06.840> he<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.740> throwing<00:02:08.069> the

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
love with his power he was throwing the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.779 
love with his power he was throwing the
right

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
right

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.729 
right
look<00:02:08.909> he<00:02:09.450> was<00:02:09.599> still<00:02:09.840> drawing<00:02:10.049> over<00:02:10.409> here<00:02:10.619> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
look he was still drawing over here and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.979 
look he was still drawing over here and
left<00:02:10.920> which<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.459> punch<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.030> before<00:02:12.659> the

half of the fight this is well this is

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.979 
half of the fight this is well this is
why<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:50.010> thought<00:02:50.609> Darrell<00:02:51.000> was<00:02:51.239> coming<00:02:51.569> back<00:02:51.750> at

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
why I thought Darrell was coming back at

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.539 
why I thought Darrell was coming back at
this<00:02:52.139> point<00:02:52.379> most<00:02:52.590> people<00:02:52.859> don't<00:02:53.010> Darrell<00:02:53.400> was

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.970 
this point most people don't Darrell was
winning<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:53.970> lot<00:02:54.209> of<00:02:54.389> the<00:02:54.569> second<00:02:55.230> half<00:02:55.409> of<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
winning a lot of the second half of the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.250 
winning a lot of the second half of the
fighting<00:02:56.220> routes<00:02:56.489> but<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.720> know<00:02:57.870> it's<00:02:58.079> really

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
fighting routes but you know it's really

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.979 
fighting routes but you know it's really
hard<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.799> come<00:02:58.980> back<00:02:59.280> when<00:02:59.909> you're<00:03:00.060> down<00:03:00.329> you

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989

you got knocked down twice in one round

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.250 
you got knocked down twice in one round
and<00:03:05.250> it's<00:03:06.209> really<00:03:06.480> hard<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.780> come<00:03:06.900> back<00:03:07.109> you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260

and it's really hard to come back you
really<00:03:07.560> really<00:03:08.069> gotta<00:03:08.220> have<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.459> show<00:03:08.670> that

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
really really gotta have to show that

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.240 
really really gotta have to show that
Morrie's<00:03:09.299> mentality<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.049> one<00:03:10.230> thing<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.709> win

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
Morrie's mentality it's one thing to win

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.670 
Morrie's mentality it's one thing to win
rounds<00:03:11.879> and<00:03:12.060> you're<00:03:12.690> out<00:03:12.840> boxing<00:03:13.349> them<00:03:13.500> and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
rounds and you're out boxing them and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.229 
rounds and you're out boxing them and
your<00:03:13.769> winning<00:03:14.129> rounds<00:03:14.639> a<00:03:14.730> little<00:03:14.940> bit<00:03:15.090> of

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
your winning rounds a little bit of

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.409 
your winning rounds a little bit of
activity<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:16.829> another<00:03:17.129> thing<00:03:17.430> when<00:03:17.489> the

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
activity but it's another thing when the

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.409 
activity but it's another thing when the
gal<00:03:19.040> his<00:03:20.040> punches<00:03:20.459> still<00:03:20.730> had<00:03:20.940> more<00:03:21.209> effect

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
gal his punches still had more effect

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.990 
gal his punches still had more effect
than<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.230> rels<00:03:22.650> even<00:03:23.310> though<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.549> realm<00:03:23.790> was

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
than the rels even though the realm was

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.720 
than the rels even though the realm was
landing<00:03:24.419> more<00:03:24.660> to<00:03:25.230> gal<00:03:25.500> his<00:03:25.980> punches<00:03:26.489> still

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
landing more to gal his punches still

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.150 
landing more to gal his punches still
had<00:03:27.030> more<00:03:27.269> effect<00:03:27.419> when<00:03:27.959> he<00:03:28.169> didn't<00:03:28.530> land<00:03:28.680> okay

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
had more effect when he didn't land okay

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.830 
had more effect when he didn't land okay
to<00:03:29.220> go<00:03:29.489> have<00:03:29.730> more<00:03:29.910> power<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.449> said<00:03:30.660> all<00:03:30.780> of

to go have more power and I said all of
this<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.530> know<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.680> picked<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.489> relative<00:03:32.849> win

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
this you know I picked the relative win

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.080 
this you know I picked the relative win
because<00:03:33.150> um<00:03:33.629> I<00:03:34.349> was<00:03:34.650> more<00:03:34.919> of<00:03:35.220> picking<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.910> guy

scorecard<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.169> thought<00:03:49.410> that<00:03:49.530> was<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.650> little

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
scorecard I thought that was a little

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.189 
scorecard I thought that was a little
too<00:03:50.190> stretched<00:03:50.879> stretched<00:03:51.629> out<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:52.049> know<00:03:52.139> I

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
too stretched stretched out you know I

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:53.960 
too stretched stretched out you know I
was<00:03:52.319> filing<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.709> found<00:03:52.949> a<00:03:53.040> lot<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.400> people<00:03:53.730> on

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970

was filing I found a lot of people on
Twitter<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.510> I've<00:03:55.049> never<00:03:55.409> I<00:03:55.760> mean<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.940> most

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
Twitter and I've never I mean the most

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.899 
Twitter and I've never I mean the most
that<00:03:57.510> I've<00:03:57.629> seen<00:03:57.959> on<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.340> scorecard<00:03:59.340> up<00:03:59.609> was

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
that I've seen on a scorecard up was

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.210 
that I've seen on a scorecard up was
maybe<00:04:00.180> Darrell<00:04:00.629> or<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.139> Gail<00:04:01.349> up<00:04:01.560> by<00:04:01.889> three

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
maybe Darrell or to Gail up by three

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.909 
maybe Darrell or to Gail up by three
rounds<00:04:02.609> I<00:04:02.760> was<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.090> biggest<00:04:03.870> stretch<00:04:04.169> but<00:04:04.889> I

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
rounds I was the biggest stretch but I

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.680 
rounds I was the biggest stretch but I
really<00:04:05.310> didn't<00:04:05.549> see<00:04:05.699> too<00:04:05.879> many<00:04:06.000> people<00:04:06.419> seen

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
really didn't see too many people seen

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.140 
really didn't see too many people seen
Darrell<00:04:07.530> winning<00:04:08.069> so<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.340> kind<00:04:08.729> of<00:04:08.819> figured

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
Darrell winning so I kind of figured

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.270 
Darrell winning so I kind of figured
that<00:04:09.180> -<00:04:09.780> Gail<00:04:09.989> will<00:04:10.169> probably<00:04:10.530> get<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.829> win<00:04:11.040> if

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
that - Gail will probably get to win if

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.089 
that - Gail will probably get to win if
not<00:04:11.609> a<00:04:11.819> draw<00:04:12.209> okay<00:04:12.569> now<00:04:13.199> as<00:04:13.470> far<00:04:13.680> as<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.889> future

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
not a draw okay now as far as the future

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.240 
not a draw okay now as far as the future

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870 
the thing about Andre Darrell it seems

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.960 
the thing about Andre Darrell it seems
like<00:07:03.050> every<00:07:03.289> time<00:07:03.470> he<00:07:03.530> opened<00:07:04.159> up<00:07:04.280> he<00:07:04.729> wouldn't

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:04.970 
like every time he opened up he wouldn't

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.460 
like every time he opened up he wouldn't
get<00:07:05.120> hurt<00:07:05.360> more<00:07:05.599> he<00:07:05.780> would<00:07:05.930> get<00:07:06.050> hurt<00:07:06.259> with<00:07:06.440> a

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:06.470 
get hurt more he would get hurt with a

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.010 
get hurt more he would get hurt with a
shot<00:07:06.740> and<00:07:06.889> it'll<00:07:07.130> go<00:07:07.220> back<00:07:07.490> slowing<00:07:08.300> down<00:07:08.479> just

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.020 
shot and it'll go back slowing down just

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.320 
shot and it'll go back slowing down just
trying<00:07:09.289> to<00:07:09.380> pass<00:07:09.889> out<00:07:10.250> a<00:07:10.280> little<00:07:10.490> bit<00:07:10.699> you<00:07:11.300> know

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
trying to pass out a little bit you know

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.570 
trying to pass out a little bit you know
it<00:07:11.990> seemed<00:07:12.199> like<00:07:12.349> every<00:07:12.560> time<00:07:12.590> he<00:07:12.979> tried<00:07:13.310> to

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580 
it seemed like every time he tried to

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.670 
it seemed like every time he tried to
open<00:07:13.849> up<00:07:13.970> door<00:07:14.120> more<00:07:14.300> combinations<00:07:15.020> he<00:07:15.440> would

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 
open up door more combinations he would

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.409 
open up door more combinations he would
get<00:07:15.860> countering<00:07:16.310> her<00:07:16.520> so<00:07:16.759> he<00:07:16.880> was<00:07:17.000> a<00:07:17.030> lot<00:07:17.240> he

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:17.419 
get countering her so he was a lot he

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.059 
get countering her so he was a lot he
was<00:07:17.539> very<00:07:17.690> tentative<00:07:18.259> to<00:07:18.349> throw<00:07:18.560> more<00:07:18.800> punches

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:19.069 
was very tentative to throw more punches

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:21.430 
was very tentative to throw more punches
at<00:07:19.669> points<00:07:20.210> in<00:07:20.270> a<00:07:20.360> fight<00:07:20.569> but<00:07:20.960> I<00:07:21.020> still<00:07:21.289> thought

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
at points in a fight but I still thought

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.230 
at points in a fight but I still thought
he<00:07:21.500> was<00:07:21.740> more<00:07:21.979> active<00:07:22.430> in<00:07:22.550> his<00:07:22.669> second<00:07:23.000> half<00:07:23.120> of

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
he was more active in his second half of

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.480 
he was more active in his second half of
the<00:07:23.300> fight<00:07:23.449> it<00:07:23.840> just<00:07:24.080> wasn't<00:07:24.530> enough<00:07:24.560> for<00:07:25.130> the

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
the fight it just wasn't enough for the

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.430 
the fight it just wasn't enough for the
judges<00:07:26.120> to<00:07:26.389> give<00:07:26.539> him<00:07:26.690> the<00:07:26.810> win<00:07:26.960> all<00:07:27.110> right<00:07:27.229> so

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 
judges to give him the win all right so

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.279 
judges to give him the win all right so
not<00:07:27.650> a<00:07:27.710> bad<00:07:27.979> decision<00:07:28.520> you<00:07:28.849> know<00:07:29.330> I<00:07:29.810> thought<00:07:30.139> it

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:30.289 
not a bad decision you know I thought it

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:32.439 
not a bad decision you know I thought it
would<00:07:30.409> be<00:07:30.530> a<00:07:30.560> split<00:07:30.949> or<00:07:31.159> something<00:07:31.610> I<00:07:31.819> thought

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:32.449 
would be a split or something I thought

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:35.320 
would be a split or something I thought
it<00:07:32.750> would<00:07:32.930> be<00:07:33.080> a<00:07:33.110> majority<00:07:33.770> or<00:07:33.800> a<00:07:33.949> split<00:07:34.430> I<00:07:34.759> was

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.330 
it would be a majority or a split I was

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.110 
it would be a majority or a split I was
very<00:07:35.479> shocked<00:07:35.840> at<00:07:35.960> the<00:07:36.050> 117<00:07:36.710> 109<00:07:37.219> but<00:07:37.789> I'm<00:07:37.940> not

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.120
