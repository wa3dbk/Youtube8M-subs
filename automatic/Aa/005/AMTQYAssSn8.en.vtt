00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
extra spare and then ring in the middle

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.780 
extra spare and then ring in the middle
there<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.560> low<00:01:52.890> goal<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> vanity<00:01:53.579> girl

there is a low goal the vanity girl
Hollywood<00:01:54.390> logo<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.409> then<00:01:56.219> there's<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
Hollywood logo and then there's the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.209 
Hollywood logo and then there's the
mirror<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.570> then<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.259> side<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.040> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
mirror and then on this side this is the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.639 
mirror and then on this side this is the
dimmer<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.000> this<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.719> where<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.079> turn<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
dimmer and this is where you turn the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.289 
dimmer and this is where you turn the
switch<00:02:01.799> off<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.880> on

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
switch off and on

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.289 
switch off and on
and<00:02:04.509> then<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.649> have<00:02:05.920> this<00:02:06.310> slider<00:02:06.789> thing

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
and then you have this slider thing

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.960 
and then you have this slider thing
right<00:02:07.509> here<00:02:07.719> which<00:02:07.960> helps<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.739> dim<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.700> light

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
right here which helps to dim the light

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.630 
right here which helps to dim the light
so<00:02:10.300> here<00:02:10.899> we<00:02:11.110> have<00:02:11.290> like<00:02:11.319> a<00:02:11.470> low<00:02:11.739> steady<00:02:12.040> medium

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
so here we have like a low steady medium

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.720 
so here we have like a low steady medium
setting<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.209> then<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:14.290> goes<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.530> bright<00:02:15.280> you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
setting and then it goes to bright you

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.180 
setting and then it goes to bright you
know<00:02:15.790> for<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.180> very<00:02:16.300> different<00:02:17.019> makeup<00:02:17.950> looks

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
the reason why it did this was because

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.920 
the reason why it did this was because
there<00:02:34.239> was<00:02:34.360> no<00:02:34.660> room<00:02:35.049> on<00:02:35.440> my<00:02:36.209> desk<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:37.900> I
