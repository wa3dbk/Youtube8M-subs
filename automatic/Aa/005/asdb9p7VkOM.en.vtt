00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
have that one time to do it so this

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.210 
have that one time to do it so this
white<00:02:01.810> moves<00:02:02.020> quite<00:02:02.320> quickly<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:02.890> you've<00:02:03.040> got

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
white moves quite quickly so you've got

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.620 
white moves quite quickly so you've got
the<00:02:03.340> first<00:02:03.610> chord<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.149> it<00:02:04.270> will<00:02:04.360> sound<00:02:04.509> like

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
the first chord and it will sound like

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.760 
the first chord and it will sound like
this<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.720> move<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.170> D<00:02:08.319> major<00:02:08.530> chord

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
this then you move to the D major chord

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.040 
this then you move to the D major chord
remember<00:02:09.729> where<00:02:09.850> your<00:02:09.970> base<00:02:10.209> note<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:10.630> landing

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
remember where your base note is landing

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.340 
remember where your base note is landing
now<00:02:11.200> is<00:02:11.350> on<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> D

the second or first finger stay in the
same<00:02:16.420> place<00:02:16.480> they're<00:02:16.870> always<00:02:17.020> tackling<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.800> B

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
same place they're always tackling the B

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
and the g strings that never move so

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.450 
and the g strings that never move so
you've<00:02:20.260> almost<00:02:20.410> got<00:02:20.650> an<00:02:20.770> anchor<00:02:21.070> point<00:02:21.100> with

you've almost got an anchor point with

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.400 
you've almost got an anchor point with
your<00:02:21.580> right<00:02:21.760> hand<00:02:21.790> as<00:02:22.180> well<00:02:22.300> it's<00:02:22.810> mainly<00:02:23.050> only

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.350 
your right hand as well it's mainly only
the<00:02:23.530> thumb<00:02:23.740> that's<00:02:23.860> moving<00:02:24.070> around<00:02:24.360> next

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
the thumb that's moving around next

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.780 
the thumb that's moving around next
chord<00:02:25.570> is<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.810> C<00:02:25.990> major<00:02:26.170> add<00:02:26.410> 9<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.920> move<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
chord is the C major add 9 so move the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.870 
chord is the C major add 9 so move the
two<00:02:28.150> fingers<00:02:28.570> across<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.700> second<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.790> third

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
two fingers across it second and third

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.420 
two fingers across it second and third
same<00:02:31.480> chord<00:02:31.780> as<00:02:31.870> before<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.980> bass<00:02:33.160> note

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
same chord as before and the bass note

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.020 
same chord as before and the bass note
tackles<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.090> same<00:02:34.300> bit<00:02:34.600> as<00:02:34.720> before

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.850 

and<00:02:38.180> then<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> G<00:02:38.990> chord

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.070 

you<00:02:42.400> can't<00:02:42.640> just<00:02:42.730> use<00:02:42.970> two<00:02:43.180> fingers<00:02:43.660> for<00:02:43.990> that

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
you can't just use two fingers for that

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.050 
you can't just use two fingers for that
G<00:02:44.290> chord<00:02:44.530> because<00:02:44.740> that<00:02:45.310> we're<00:02:45.520> not<00:02:45.610> using<00:02:45.820> any

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
G chord because that we're not using any

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.750 
G chord because that we're not using any
other<00:02:46.210> notes<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:47.110> round<00:02:47.560> again

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.730 

you

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.950 

you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.440 

now<00:02:59.530> for<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.100> you've<00:03:00.400> got<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.670> really<00:03:01.000> slow

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
now for that you've got to really slow

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.970 
now for that you've got to really slow
down<00:03:01.660> if<00:03:01.810> you<00:03:01.900> spent<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.290> time<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.800> this<00:03:02.860> is

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
down if you spent the time and this is

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.220 
down if you spent the time and this is
what<00:03:03.100> I<00:03:03.130> hope<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.520> have<00:03:03.550> done<00:03:04.020> making<00:03:05.020> sure

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
what I hope you have done making sure

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.770 
what I hope you have done making sure
that<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.560> had<00:03:05.770> the<00:03:05.800> rhythm<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.780> right

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
that you had the rhythm and the right

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.810 
that you had the rhythm and the right
hand<00:03:08.110> finger-picking<00:03:08.740> pattern<00:03:08.920> sorted<00:03:09.640> and

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
hand finger-picking pattern sorted and

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.760 
hand finger-picking pattern sorted and
so<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:10.750> didn't<00:03:10.960> have<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.140> think<00:03:11.320> about<00:03:11.410> it<00:03:11.620> too

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
so you didn't have to think about it too

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.830 
so you didn't have to think about it too
much<00:03:11.800> now<00:03:12.730> when<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:12.970> introduce<00:03:13.420> these<00:03:13.600> new

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
much now when you introduce these new

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.170 
much now when you introduce these new
chords<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.350> should<00:03:14.590> be<00:03:14.770> a<00:03:14.800> little<00:03:15.010> easier<00:03:15.220> to

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
chords it should be a little easier to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.360 
chords it should be a little easier to
think<00:03:16.840> about<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.200> left<00:03:17.380> hand<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.830> not<00:03:18.130> think

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
think about the left hand and not think

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.560 
think about the left hand and not think
about<00:03:18.460> the<00:03:18.730> right<00:03:18.880> hand<00:03:19.060> because<00:03:19.300> that's<00:03:19.450> what

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
about the right hand because that's what

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.390 
about the right hand because that's what
you<00:03:19.600> want<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.840> be<00:03:19.900> doing<00:03:19.930> if<00:03:20.290> you're<00:03:21.010> spending

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
you want to be doing if you're spending

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.620 
you want to be doing if you're spending
a<00:03:21.460> lot<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.610> time<00:03:21.700> thinking<00:03:21.880> about<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.480> right

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
a lot of time thinking about the right

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.630 
a lot of time thinking about the right
hand<00:03:22.840> go<00:03:23.020> back<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.710> just<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.070> G<00:03:24.280> major<00:03:24.520> chord

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
hand go back to just that G major chord

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.060 
hand go back to just that G major chord
and<00:03:25.030> play<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.840> again<00:03:26.350> and<00:03:26.500> again<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.770> again

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
and play it again and again and again

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.160 
and play it again and again and again
until<00:03:27.280> you<00:03:27.520> get<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.760> feel<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.450> groove<00:03:28.870> in

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
until you get the feel and the groove in

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.440 
until you get the feel and the groove in
this<00:03:29.320> right<00:03:29.590> hand<00:03:29.890> before<00:03:30.700> attempting<00:03:31.330> to

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
this right hand before attempting to

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.570 
this right hand before attempting to
bring<00:03:31.630> in<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.840> other<00:03:31.870> course<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:33.310> that's<00:03:33.460> the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
bring in the other course so that's the

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.540 
bring in the other course so that's the
pre-chorus<00:03:34.060> or<00:03:34.300> i<00:03:34.360> call<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.720> pre-chorus

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.430 

does<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.330> twice

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.370 

and<00:03:45.920> then<00:03:46.100> what<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.370> call<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:47.060> chorus<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:47.870> quite

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
and then what I call the chorus is quite

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.400 
and then what I call the chorus is quite
an<00:03:48.500> easy<00:03:48.620> one<00:03:48.860> this<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.220> goes<00:03:49.400> from<00:03:49.610> e<00:03:49.880> minor<00:03:50.410> to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
an easy one this it goes from e minor to

00:03:51.410 --> 00:04:00.300 
an easy one this it goes from e minor to
G<00:03:51.440> major<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:53.620> minor<00:03:54.820> to<00:03:55.820> G<00:03:55.850> major<00:03:56.180> a<00:03:57.070> minor<00:03:58.540> D<00:03:59.540> and

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
G major a minor to G major a minor D and

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.590 
G major a minor to G major a minor D and
then<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.400> start<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.850> whole<00:04:02.060> process<00:04:02.090> from

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
then you start the whole process from

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.320 
then you start the whole process from
the<00:04:02.960> very<00:04:03.350> beginning<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:04.580> basically<00:04:05.090> a

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
the very beginning so basically a

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.020 
the very beginning so basically a
minor's<00:04:05.810> 2<00:04:05.990> g's<00:04:06.230> and<00:04:06.590> then<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.340> put<00:04:07.490> in<00:04:07.610> a<00:04:07.700> d<00:04:07.880> at

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
minor's 2 g's and then you put in a d at

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.640 
minor's 2 g's and then you put in a d at
the<00:04:08.120> very<00:04:08.300> end<00:04:08.480> there<00:04:08.690> just<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.080> take<00:04:09.380> you<00:04:09.470> back

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
the very end there just to take you back

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.160 
the very end there just to take you back
into<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.310> verse<00:04:10.690> same<00:04:11.690> finger-picking

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
into the verse same finger-picking

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.600 
into the verse same finger-picking
pattern<00:04:12.350> as<00:04:12.710> you've<00:04:12.890> just<00:04:13.100> been<00:04:13.190> doing<00:04:13.490> but

in<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.770> same<00:04:15.950> place<00:04:16.010> because<00:04:16.549> it's<00:04:16.640> always<00:04:16.850> on

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
in the same place because it's always on

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.420

some chord shapes and we've learned

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.179 
some chord shapes and we've learned
where<00:05:30.089> the<00:05:30.120> base<00:05:30.449> note<00:05:30.809> of<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.589> thumb<00:05:31.860> is

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
where the base note of the thumb is

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:34.010

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
experience on how to use finger-picking

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.519 
experience on how to use finger-picking
in<00:05:37.680> your<00:05:38.310> player<00:05:38.839> key<00:05:39.839> things<00:05:40.110> with<00:05:40.259> finger

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:40.529 
in your player key things with finger

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.559 
in your player key things with finger
picking<00:05:40.740> is<00:05:41.009> to<00:05:41.189> really<00:05:41.520> get<00:05:41.759> the<00:05:41.909> right<00:05:42.209> hand

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
picking is to really get the right hand

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.949 
picking is to really get the right hand
so<00:05:43.560> you<00:05:43.589> don't<00:05:43.979> have<00:05:44.189> to<00:05:44.339> think<00:05:44.520> about<00:05:44.699> it<00:05:44.999> slow

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:45.959 
so you don't have to think about it slow

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:48.469 
so you don't have to think about it slow
the<00:05:46.169> tempo<00:05:46.379> down<00:05:46.770> right<00:05:47.249> down<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:48.209> that<00:05:48.360> you

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 
the tempo down right down so that you

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.619 
the tempo down right down so that you
can<00:05:48.689> play<00:05:49.409> the<00:05:49.439> chord<00:05:49.889> changes<00:05:50.120> smoothly<00:05:51.120> and

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629 
can play the chord changes smoothly and

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:54.619 
can play the chord changes smoothly and
slowly<00:05:52.349> and<00:05:52.680> then<00:05:52.800> when<00:05:53.729> you're<00:05:53.849> ready<00:05:53.909> only

00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:54.629 
slowly and then when you're ready only

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:56.839 
slowly and then when you're ready only
then<00:05:54.839> do<00:05:55.259> you<00:05:55.289> then<00:05:55.560> start<00:05:55.770> building<00:05:56.459> up<00:05:56.610> the

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
then do you then start building up the

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.429 
then do you then start building up the
tempo<00:05:57.270> so<00:05:57.509> you<00:05:57.599> get<00:05:57.779> a<00:05:57.810> little<00:05:57.990> bit<00:05:58.259> quicker

00:05:58.429 --> 00:05:58.439 
tempo so you get a little bit quicker

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.439 
tempo so you get a little bit quicker
it's<00:05:59.099> to<00:05:59.279> be<00:05:59.370> honest<00:05:59.610> the<00:05:59.729> song<00:05:59.939> itself<00:06:00.089> is

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:00.449 
it's to be honest the song itself is

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.110 
it's to be honest the song itself is
playing<00:06:00.719> lightning<00:06:01.020> fast<00:06:01.439> compared<00:06:02.009> to<00:06:02.120> you
