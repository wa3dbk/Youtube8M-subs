00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.180
 but if you akai a check for a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.599
 million lives at the time today first 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.400
 January I'm pouring an hour later to guys 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.770

 Cala Creta 23 5 10 15 of those times 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.300
 days but in the interval it starts again 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.730
 the interests on this the bank that 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.829
 cream has money under guy 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.030
 up to the first Italian newspaper from 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.280
 first January onwards 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.980
 this is the currency theme this 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.250
 so it's that interval I know you're a 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.500
 crime banks take the interest 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.090
 on other people's money that they also make of 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.680
 worse 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.590
 hypothesizing every day towards 10 thousand 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.440
 euro and manager of courtesy of 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.470
 showed things immediately in cash 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.770
 that before they did more today there is 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.610
 plus a legislation he makes puts you 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.759
 Currency discovered the 4 days 5 for 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.920
 time in which dinner will be credited 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.329
 if all this balance and if you are not 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.000
 by no means discovered why you money either 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.560
 money nor any but what if 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.860
 we will find the right time project 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.510
 be every day 10 thousand euros is 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.460
 time of accreditation year after five 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.210
 days he does of who john will be on average 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.400
 discoveries of 50 thousand 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:38.040
 euro as it would have been appreciated on 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.040
 robbery have never dreamed of giving 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.450
 the sick cytism consists in the fact that 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.370
 you quarterly interest instead of 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.250
 charge interest payable each 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.870
 year the charges each type and then then 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.390
 enter the capital on which one is 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.090
 will apply other interest to a 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.600
 certain point the cassation declared 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.899
 legitimate illegitimacy legitimize the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.729
 devised plan devised there yes 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.980
 although legitimate when they come 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.500
 applied quarterly interest both 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.780
 passive than assets and means 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.910
 take for the professor's idiots 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:25.130
 because it is that if you are active from the 0.1 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.340
 of interest roe to the liabilities of take me 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.340
 on average in the last ten years the 13th e 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.610
 30 and but of interest to live with work 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.880
 they feel every day 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.739
 matured and the judiciary pretending 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.020
 not to understand that to make equal equals 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.180
 interest means yes to establish criteria 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.970
 and quarterly both in type II assets 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.090
 yes but also storm surges from the point of 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.090
 quantitative view what equalization is 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.690
 we do the reconstruction of the balance 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.020
 of which comes from you 1 and says I have a 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.110
 balance of one thousand and 500 thousand euros, that is to say a 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.630
 current account for 30 years and then we see 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.200
 a moment of mistakes is not so we give it 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.570
 to my contagion they said that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.370
 what these girls will be and upload 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.300
 what comes out of your jump 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.810
 it is not less than 500 thousand but it is more a million 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.270
 and a half understood because adding up all the 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.880
 money you give stolen for 30 years you 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.460
 maybe you have a big trust comes 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.370
 completely different out on sale 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.900
 I make the causes to recover these 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.180
 money that the banks that have that 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.820
 jersey he stole and let's say the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.140
 first degree is usually obtained 30 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.810
 40 percent 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.640
 then we continue to go well let's say 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.270
 dear judges but because this is not me 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.790
 you gave it 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.860
 these are causes that are won and me 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.440
 I always say that by now the only thing to 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.600
 the companies are rich are i 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.459
 claims against banks that 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.980
 they can make the case within ten 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.780
 years from the defense of the current account e 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:25.160
 no matter how old and private 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:25.160
