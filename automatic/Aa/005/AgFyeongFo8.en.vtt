to be making this is my very first
tutorial<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.750> in<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.260> tutorial<00:00:10.500> we'll<00:00:11.130> just

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
tutorial and in this tutorial we'll just

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.970 
tutorial and in this tutorial we'll just
go<00:00:11.700> up<00:00:11.730> some<00:00:12.210> basics<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.990> converting<00:00:13.860> your

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
go up some basics and converting your

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.150 
go up some basics and converting your
files<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.030> DDS<00:00:15.480> format<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.260> Starcraft<00:00:16.949> 2

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
files to the DDS format that Starcraft 2

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.510 
files to the DDS format that Starcraft 2
uses<00:00:17.960> and<00:00:18.960> along<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> way<00:00:19.710> we'll<00:00:19.949> also<00:00:20.189> be

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
uses and along the way we'll also be

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.200 
uses and along the way we'll also be
learning<00:00:20.670> how<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.470> use<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.680> texture<00:00:23.210> Asuran

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
learning how to use this texture Asuran

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.290 
learning how to use this texture Asuran
to<00:00:24.390> rein<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.810> our<00:00:24.960> maps<00:00:25.250> so<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.640> my<00:00:26.880> picture

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
to rein in our maps so I have my picture

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.620 
to rein in our maps so I have my picture
right<00:00:27.570> here<00:00:28.220> it's<00:00:29.220> nothing<00:00:29.820> fancy<00:00:30.210> or

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
right here it's nothing fancy or

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.290 
right here it's nothing fancy or
anything<00:00:30.779> l<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.219> random<00:00:32.669> texture

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
anything l it's just a random texture

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
anything l it's just a random texture
so<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.829> right<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.100> it's

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
so all I have to do it right now it's

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.690 
so all I have to do it right now it's
opening<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.630> with<00:00:36.930> something<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:37.980> Photoshop

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
opening up with something like Photoshop

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.430 
opening up with something like Photoshop
or<00:00:39.329> GIMP<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:40.590> convert<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.780> I'm<00:00:42.780> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> be

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
or GIMP to convert it I'm going to be

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.520 
or GIMP to convert it I'm going to be
using<00:00:43.860> obviously<00:00:44.100> Photoshop<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.210> this

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
using obviously Photoshop in this

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.650 
using obviously Photoshop in this
tutorial<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.860> literally<00:00:47.700> all<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.539> do

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
tutorial and literally all I have to do

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.810 
tutorial and literally all I have to do
is<00:00:48.840> say<00:00:49.140> ass<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.090> speak<00:00:51.360> DDS<00:00:52.079> format<00:00:52.820> as

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
is say ass and just speak DDS format as

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.380 
is say ass and just speak DDS format as
my<00:00:54.750> format<00:00:55.289> option<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.280> I'll<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.940> give<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
my format option and I'll just give it a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.069 
my format option and I'll just give it a
random<00:00:57.809> name<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.789> get<00:00:59.789> or<00:00:59.940> see<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> bit<00:01:00.809> random

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
random name I get or see a bit random

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.460 
random name I get or see a bit random
name<00:01:01.550> and<00:01:02.570> this<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.629> something<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.260> want

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
name and this is something that you want

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.460 
name and this is something that you want
to<00:01:04.530> make<00:01:04.680> sure<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.280> way

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
to make sure it's this way

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.490 
to make sure it's this way
they<00:01:07.470> generate<00:01:08.040> MIP<00:01:08.610> maps<00:01:09.119> option<00:01:09.930> because

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
they generate MIP maps option because

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.850 
they generate MIP maps option because
you<00:01:10.799> usually<00:01:11.250> don't<00:01:11.820> want<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.780> at<00:01:13.439> least

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you usually don't want or at least

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.219 
you usually don't want or at least
you'll<00:01:14.040> try<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> land<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.880> did<00:01:15.119> yourself<00:01:15.720> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you'll try to land to did yourself and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.390 
you'll try to land to did yourself and
this<00:01:16.890> efficient<00:01:17.189> just<00:01:17.430> do<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.659> and

you have to make sure that you use the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.999 
you have to make sure that you use the
dxt<00:01:23.549> tree<00:01:23.880> format<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.439> plenty<00:01:25.710> other

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
dxt tree format you have plenty other

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.460 
dxt tree format you have plenty other
options<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:26.729> but<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.540> recommend<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.409> use

options in here but I recommend you use
the<00:01:29.040> DHT<00:01:29.400> trick<00:01:29.939> format<00:01:30.619> already<00:01:31.619> for

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the DHT trick format already for

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.200 
the DHT trick format already for
messages<00:01:32.400> how<00:01:33.210> proven<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.970> get<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> lot<00:01:36.180> of

was<00:02:32.840> random<00:02:33.410> name<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:34.460> I<00:02:34.520> have<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.910> check<00:02:35.210> this

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
was random name so I have to check this

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.060 
was random name so I have to check this
remember<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.760> uncheck<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:39.170> root<00:02:39.770> folder

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
remember to uncheck the root folder

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.430 
remember to uncheck the root folder
because<00:02:40.550> otherwise<00:02:41.270> he<00:02:41.600> will<00:02:41.780> just<00:02:42.050> import

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
because otherwise he will just import

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.280 
because otherwise he will just import
every<00:02:43.190> texture<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:43.850> have<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.150> here<00:02:44.360> so

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
every texture that you have in here so

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.910 
every texture that you have in here so
just<00:02:45.740> check<00:02:46.310> your<00:02:46.520> random<00:02:46.970> name<00:02:47.210> and<00:02:48.020> just

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
just check your random name and just

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.510 
just check your random name and just
make<00:02:49.070> sure<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.820> half<00:02:51.160> it's<00:02:52.160> something

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
make sure that the half it's something

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.340 
make sure that the half it's something
that<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:52.790> want<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.090> remember<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.110> I'll<00:02:54.200> just

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
that you want to remember so I'll just

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:04.220 
that you want to remember so I'll just
do<00:02:54.500> assets<00:02:56.770> textures<00:02:59.470> customer

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.680 

the<00:03:04.770> buttons<00:03:05.129> everything<00:03:05.520> doesn't<00:03:06.330> really

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
the buttons everything doesn't really

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.250 
the buttons everything doesn't really
matter<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.379> know<00:03:08.239> just<00:03:09.239> just<00:03:09.930> make<00:03:10.110> it

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
matter I know just just make it

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.910 
matter I know just just make it
something<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:11.069> will<00:03:11.340> remember<00:03:11.760> and

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
something that you will remember and

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.050 
something that you will remember and
something<00:03:13.920> else<00:03:14.069> that<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.459> also<00:03:14.640> have<00:03:14.910> to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
something else that you also have to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.900 
something else that you also have to
remember<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.690> say<00:03:16.319> this<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.769> very

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
remember is to say this is very

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.640 
remember is to say this is very
important<00:03:17.910> because<00:03:18.060> many<00:03:18.239> people<00:03:18.660> don't<00:03:19.230> say

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
important because many people don't say

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.479 
important because many people don't say
and<00:03:21.290> afterwards<00:03:22.290> they're<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.980> like<00:03:23.220> hey

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
and afterwards they're just like hey

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.540 
and afterwards they're just like hey
doesn't<00:03:23.790> work<00:03:24.090> well<00:03:24.480> did<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.870> say<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.980> just

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
doesn't work well did you say so just

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:34.309 
doesn't work well did you say so just
remember<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.970> say<00:03:31.970> we<00:03:32.970> wait<00:03:33.239> for<00:03:33.510> galaxy<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.170> do

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
remember to say we wait for galaxy to do

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.100 
remember to say we wait for galaxy to do
its<00:03:34.500> job<00:03:34.799> to<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.670> like<00:03:35.849> Photoshop<00:03:36.390> this

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
its job to just like Photoshop this

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.460 
its job to just like Photoshop this
takes<00:03:37.410> way<00:03:37.769> less<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:39.209> now<00:03:39.569> that's<00:03:39.840> done<00:03:40.140> we're

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
takes way less and now that's done we're

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.729 
takes way less and now that's done we're
going<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.769> go<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.430> models<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:43.260> now<00:03:43.530> we're

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
going to go to the models and now we're

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.440 
going to go to the models and now we're
going<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.069> go<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.579> data<00:03:44.940> editor<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:47.450> we're

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
going to go to the data editor and we're

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.069 
going to go to the data editor and we're
going<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.750> open<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:49.650> terrain<00:03:50.160> texture<00:03:50.819> style

going to open this terrain texture style

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.920 
going to open this terrain texture style
and<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.680> data<00:03:52.890> type<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:53.610> select<00:03:53.940> under

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
and the data type just select under

and the data type just select under
terrain<00:03:55.940> selec-terrain<00:03:56.940> textures<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.769> it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
terrain selec-terrain textures and it

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.220 
terrain selec-terrain textures and it
will<00:03:59.250> list<00:03:59.579> all<00:03:59.940> pictures<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:01.079> you<00:04:01.200> have

we're<00:04:01.829> using<00:04:02.010> seals<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:02.700> I'm<00:04:02.819> going<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.209> scroll

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
we're using seals so I'm going to scroll

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.490 
we're using seals so I'm going to scroll
down<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.290> X<00:04:05.000> later<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.329> I'm<00:04:06.870> going<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.260> be

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
down to the X later and I'm going to be

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.030 
down to the X later and I'm going to be
replacing<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.670> don't<00:04:09.000> know<00:04:09.060> silk<00:04:09.389> grass<00:04:10.040> so

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
replacing I don't know silk grass so

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.940 
replacing I don't know silk grass so
we're<00:04:11.220> going<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.549> go<00:04:11.639> to<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.940> texture<00:04:12.480> value

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
we're going to go to the texture value

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:22.870 
we're going to go to the texture value
we're<00:04:13.950> going<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.250> modify<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.940> value<00:04:20.600> gross

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
we're going to modify the value gross

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.860 
we're going to modify the value gross
and<00:04:23.880> when<00:04:24.330> tool<00:04:24.539> it<00:04:24.690> will<00:04:24.960> pop<00:04:25.260> up<00:04:25.289> a<00:04:25.650> screen

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
and when tool it will pop up a screen

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.779 
and when tool it will pop up a screen
with<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.080> texture<00:04:28.710> collection<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.610> you

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
with the texture collection that you

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.250 
with the texture collection that you
have<00:04:29.970> in<00:04:30.120> galaxy<00:04:31.190> remember<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.660> my<00:04:33.660> texture

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
have in galaxy remember that my texture

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.700 
have in galaxy remember that my texture
personally<00:04:35.160> was<00:04:35.400> in<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.760> asset<00:04:36.510> texture<00:04:37.440> and

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
personally was in the asset texture and

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.080 
personally was in the asset texture and
then<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:39.060> wasn't<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.650> custom<00:04:41.840> so<00:04:42.840> folder<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:45.030> I

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
then it wasn't a custom so folder so I

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:58.170 
then it wasn't a custom so folder so I
just<00:04:45.300> have<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:45.780> find<00:04:46.110> my<00:04:46.350> folder<00:04:46.650> really

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.120 

correctly<00:04:59.169> I'll<00:04:59.259> just<00:04:59.470> use<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.830> search

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
correctly I'll just use the search

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:11.100 
correctly I'll just use the search
feature<00:05:00.539> West<00:05:01.539> random<00:05:09.060> random<00:05:10.060> texture<00:05:10.690> and

here isn't constant random name and you

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.560 
here isn't constant random name and you
can<00:05:17.380> see<00:05:17.590> that<00:05:17.740> my<00:05:18.340> texture<00:05:18.759> is<00:05:18.880> right<00:05:19.180> here

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
can see that my texture is right here

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.600 
can see that my texture is right here
loaded<00:05:19.930> up<00:05:20.139> ready<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:21.190> be<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:22.810> brush<00:05:23.139> okay<00:05:23.610> for

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
some reason didn't maximize that so I'm

paint with my texture so I just made

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.990 
paint with my texture so I just made
sure<00:05:35.949> to<00:05:36.520> use<00:05:37.180> the<00:05:37.780> grass<00:05:38.320> I<00:05:38.889> replace<00:05:39.880> it<00:05:40.710> and
