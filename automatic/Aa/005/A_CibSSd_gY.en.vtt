00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
so we have to remedy that an adult Drake

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.440 
so we have to remedy that an adult Drake
can't<00:01:57.950> maintain<00:01:58.310> his<00:01:58.430> balance<00:01:58.730> either<00:01:58.909> do

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
can't maintain his balance either do

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.840 
can't maintain his balance either do
people<00:01:59.780> actually<00:02:00.020> walk<00:02:00.560> like<00:02:00.830> this<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.730> to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
people actually walk like this I have to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.310 
people actually walk like this I have to
check<00:02:02.000> my<00:02:02.150> footage<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.630> last<00:02:02.810> Uncharted
