consoles of 500 gigabytes of space so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.109 
consoles of 500 gigabytes of space so
it's<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.520> problem<00:01:08.880> in<00:01:09.090> terms

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it's not going to be a problem in terms

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.490 
it's not going to be a problem in terms
of<00:01:09.450> space<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:09.900> you've<00:01:10.020> got<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.229> do<00:01:10.350> that

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
of space but you've got to do that

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.350 
of space but you've got to do that
install<00:01:10.890> first<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.000> boot<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
install first then you can boot up the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.270 
install first then you can boot up the
games<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.290> start<00:01:13.560> playing<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.250> now

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
games then you can start playing but now

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.490 
games then you can start playing but now
I<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.150> copies<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.750> games<00:01:16.140> apart

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
from the Wii U version actually I should

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.950

probably<00:01:17.909> pick<00:01:18.060> up<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.270> Wii<00:01:18.360> U<00:01:18.509> version<00:01:18.720> at

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
probably pick up the Wii U version at

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
probably pick up the Wii U version at

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
so maybe I'll do that any near future as

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
so maybe I'll do that any near future as
