the kind of film that I think India has
always<00:01:02.590> wanted<00:01:02.950> to<00:01:03.100> kind<00:01:04.030> of<00:01:04.150> prove<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.570> the

a big milestone for India because I

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.300 
a big milestone for India because I

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
don't think anything like this has ever

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.480 
don't think anything like this has ever
been<00:01:15.430> done<00:01:15.580> before<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.590> for<00:01:17.590> us<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:18.010> be<00:01:18.160> part

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
been done before and for us to be part

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.330 
been done before and for us to be part
and<00:01:18.670> work<00:01:19.030> in<00:01:19.300> in<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:20.230> cohesive<00:01:20.530> team<00:01:20.740> effort

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.970 
and work in in a cohesive team effort
was<00:01:21.550> very<00:01:21.760> important<00:01:22.210> so<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.360> think<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:23.080> think

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
was very important so I think I think

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.000 
was very important so I think I think
we'll<00:01:24.370> just<00:01:24.580> shut<00:01:24.730> off<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.030> rumors<00:01:25.330> for<00:01:25.510> now
