fit for the instrument and it's a very
natural<00:00:56.910> fit<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.130> really<00:00:59.310> get<00:00:59.520> a

I've<00:01:07.890> prepared<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.520> piece<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.060> I

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
I've prepared a little piece that I

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.450 
I've prepared a little piece that I
normally<00:01:09.180> play<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:09.810> my<00:01:10.170> strat<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:11.160> I'd<00:01:11.340> like

to play on this telly showing you how
the<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.960> Maverick<00:01:16.440> can<00:01:17.040> kind<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.430> give<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the the Maverick can kind of give you a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.000 
the the Maverick can kind of give you a
little<00:01:18.540> bit<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.930> chorusing<00:01:19.500> effect<00:01:19.590> that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
little bit of that chorusing effect that

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.640 
little bit of that chorusing effect that
you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.550> can<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.820> with<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> trim<00:01:21.360> bar<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you can you can get with a trim bar and

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.640 
you can you can get with a trim bar and
and<00:01:23.460> also<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.180> show<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.650> enhanced

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and also just show you the enhanced

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.530 
and also just show you the enhanced
sustain<00:01:26.010> that<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.030> maverick

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
sustain that I think that a maverick

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.990 
sustain that I think that a maverick
provides<00:01:28.410> for<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:29.100> instrument<00:01:29.580> because<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
provides for an instrument because of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:02:40.420 
provides for an instrument because of
the<00:01:30.530> patented<00:01:31.530> blade<00:01:31.830> technology

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.680 

listen<00:02:41.430> sustained<00:02:41.819> for<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.209> I<00:02:44.510> like<00:02:45.510> to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
listen sustained for you I like to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.960 
listen sustained for you I like to
sometimes<00:02:46.140> try<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.500> emulate<00:02:46.799> pedal<00:02:47.760> steel

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
sometimes try to emulate pedal steel

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.380 
sometimes try to emulate pedal steel
riffs<00:02:48.329> and<00:02:49.310> seems<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.459> really<00:02:50.609> work<00:02:50.909> well<00:02:51.150> with

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
riffs and seems to really work well with

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.589 
riffs and seems to really work well with
my<00:02:51.569> Madrick<00:02:52.260> on<00:02:52.500> my<00:02:52.709> tally<00:02:52.950> here<00:02:53.220> so<00:02:53.599> there's

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
my Madrick on my tally here so there's

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:18.190 
my Madrick on my tally here so there's
an<00:02:54.720> example<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:55.230> that<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.099> an<00:03:17.220> example<00:03:17.340> of

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
an example of that this is an example of

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.599 
an example of that this is an example of
sort<00:03:19.200> of<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.700> trim<00:03:21.769> sound<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.129> can<00:03:23.280> get<00:03:23.459> out

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
sort of a trim sound that I can get out

00:03:23.609 --> 00:04:03.050 
sort of a trim sound that I can get out
of<00:03:23.639> this<00:03:23.849> without<00:03:24.000> having

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.250 

another<00:04:04.060> thing<00:04:04.300> that<00:04:04.450> really<00:04:04.480> sets<00:04:05.080> the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
another thing that really sets the

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.970 
another thing that really sets the
Maverick<00:04:05.710> apart<00:04:06.130> is<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:07.450> they<00:04:07.630> have

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
Maverick apart is that they have

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.400 
Maverick apart is that they have
engineered<00:04:08.980> saddle<00:04:09.460> pieces<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:10.140> V<00:04:11.140> tone

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
engineered saddle pieces the V tone

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.010 
engineered saddle pieces the V tone
saddle<00:04:11.950> pieces<00:04:12.340> and<00:04:12.730> it's<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.540> very<00:04:13.720> unique

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
saddle pieces and it's a very unique

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.410 
saddle pieces and it's a very unique
design<00:04:14.050> and<00:04:14.770> it<00:04:15.160> allows<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:15.670> to<00:04:15.820> Internet

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
design and it allows you to Internet

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.010 
design and it allows you to Internet
your<00:04:16.600> instrument<00:04:17.140> better<00:04:17.920> because<00:04:19.020> each

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
your instrument better because each

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.470 
your instrument better because each
saddle<00:04:20.950> piece<00:04:21.160> is<00:04:21.610> specifically<00:04:22.210> engineered

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
saddle piece is specifically engineered

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.000 
saddle piece is specifically engineered
for<00:04:23.140> a<00:04:23.380> set<00:04:24.010> of<00:04:24.130> two<00:04:24.310> strings<00:04:24.730> and<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:26.680> allows

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
for a set of two strings and it allows

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.560 
for a set of two strings and it allows
you<00:04:27.280> again<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.670> really<00:04:28.180> intimate<00:04:28.540> things

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
you again to really intimate things

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.680 
you again to really intimate things
probably<00:04:29.320> because<00:04:29.650> they're<00:04:29.830> graduated<00:04:30.660> yep

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
probably because they're graduated yep

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.910 
probably because they're graduated yep
Ian's<00:04:32.080> a<00:04:32.290> have<00:04:33.160> their<00:04:33.400> own<00:04:33.550> saddle<00:04:34.120> piece<00:04:34.920> just

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
Ian's a have their own saddle piece just

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.040 
Ian's a have their own saddle piece just
like<00:04:36.040> D<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.520> G<00:04:36.730> and<00:04:37.000> their<00:04:37.360> graduated

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
like D and G and their graduated

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.220 
like D and G and their graduated
specifically<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.600> needs<00:04:40.600> of<00:04:40.840> those<00:04:41.020> two

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
specifically to the needs of those two

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.430 
specifically to the needs of those two
strings<00:04:42.040> from<00:04:42.970> an<00:04:43.090> intonation<00:04:43.440> perspective

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
strings from an intonation perspective

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.030 
strings from an intonation perspective
and<00:04:44.680> also<00:04:45.310> the<00:04:45.820> E<00:04:45.970> and<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.540> B<00:04:46.570> are<00:04:47.230> graduated

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
and also the E and the B are graduated

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.280 
and also the E and the B are graduated
in<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.490> specific<00:04:48.700> way<00:04:49.180> so<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.200> you<00:04:50.260> can

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
in a specific way so that you can

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.180 
in a specific way so that you can
intimate<00:04:50.860> those<00:04:51.160> two<00:04:51.370> strings<00:04:51.670> properly
