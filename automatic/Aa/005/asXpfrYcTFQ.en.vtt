middle<00:00:53.320> circle<00:00:53.559> like<00:00:54.100> what<00:00:54.280> you<00:00:54.370> just<00:00:54.399> saw<00:00:54.789> a

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
middle circle like what you just saw a

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.299 
middle circle like what you just saw a
guide<00:00:55.120> you<00:00:55.300> there<00:00:55.510> so<00:00:56.469> we<00:00:56.620> need<00:00:56.769> to<00:00:56.859> do<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.129> here

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
guide you there so we need to do is here

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.130 
guide you there so we need to do is here
just<00:00:57.579> kill<00:00:57.760> his<00:00:57.879> first<00:00:58.090> waves<00:00:58.390> of<00:00:58.570> enemies<00:00:58.960> and

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
just kill his first waves of enemies and

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.930 
just kill his first waves of enemies and
then<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.410> triggers<00:00:59.620> this<00:00:59.920> two<00:01:00.160> spires<00:01:00.550> and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
then it triggers this two spires and

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.029 
then it triggers this two spires and
they're<00:01:01.629> on<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.870> both<00:01:02.019> left<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.469> right<00:01:02.590> side

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
they're on the both left and right side

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.820 
they're on the both left and right side
so<00:01:03.460> it<00:01:04.059> might<00:01:04.300> be<00:01:04.330> handy<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.899> split<00:01:05.470> up<00:01:05.619> into

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
so it might be handy to split up into

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.070 
so it might be handy to split up into
three<00:01:06.009> groups<00:01:06.399> of<00:01:06.850> two<00:01:07.119> have<00:01:07.420> two<00:01:07.660> people<00:01:07.899> on

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
three groups of two have two people on

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.260 
three groups of two have two people on
the<00:01:08.229> left<00:01:08.470> two<00:01:08.710> people<00:01:08.890> on<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.310> right<00:01:09.490> and<00:01:09.789> two

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
the left two people on the right and two

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.570 
the left two people on the right and two
people<00:01:10.509> watching<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.140> mid<00:01:11.380> and<00:01:11.560> you're<00:01:12.459> the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
same rule applies if you get marked by

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.940 
same rule applies if you get marked by
any<00:01:16.599> of<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.810> green<00:01:17.140> stuff<00:01:17.440> just<00:01:17.740> head

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950

might not be yet it might be after the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.870 
might not be yet it might be after the
Oracle<00:01:43.360> sorry<00:01:43.660> yeah<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.739> is<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.580> next<00:01:45.610> part

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
Oracle sorry yeah it is so the next part

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.510 
Oracle sorry yeah it is so the next part
is<00:01:46.179> the<00:01:46.390> Oracles<00:01:46.989> and<00:01:47.319> basically<00:01:47.770> what<00:01:48.399> they

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
is the Oracles and basically what they

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.370 
is the Oracles and basically what they
do<00:01:48.580> is<00:01:48.940> at<00:01:49.209> the<00:01:49.390> start<00:01:49.690> it<00:01:49.780> shows<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.200> where

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
do is at the start it shows you where

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.740 
do is at the start it shows you where
they<00:01:50.530> are<00:01:50.739> and<00:01:51.009> I<00:01:51.849> think<00:01:52.390> there's<00:01:52.569> eight

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
they are and I think there's eight

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.809

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
might start off with three articles but

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.720 
might start off with three articles but
then<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:37.470> kill<00:03:37.709> them<00:03:37.920> kill<00:03:38.190> wave<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.610> enemies

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
then you kill them kill wave of enemies

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.180 
then you kill them kill wave of enemies
then<00:03:39.180> it'll<00:03:39.390> be<00:03:39.510> for<00:03:39.750> Oracle's<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.040> goes

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
then it'll be for Oracle's and it goes

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.160 
then it'll be for Oracle's and it goes
up<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.610> about<00:03:41.640> nine<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.239> think<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:42.840> yeah<00:03:43.049> and

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
up to about nine I think so yeah and

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.740 
up to about nine I think so yeah and
then<00:03:43.410> there<00:03:43.739> i<00:03:43.769> get<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.190> loop<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.360> was

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
then there i get the loop so that was

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.150 
then there i get the loop so that was
pretty<00:03:45.900> good<00:03:46.019> now<00:03:46.320> what<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.769> need<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:47.010> do

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
pretty good now what you need to do

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.039 
pretty good now what you need to do
after<00:03:47.489> this<00:03:47.640> stage<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.120> everyone<00:03:48.510> just<00:03:48.780> jump

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049

after this stage is everyone just jump
off<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.440> edge<00:03:49.590> now<00:03:50.519> obviously<00:03:51.829> this<00:03:52.829> isn't

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
off the edge now obviously this isn't

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.289 
off the edge now obviously this isn't
going<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.340> work<00:03:53.400> if<00:03:53.670> you're<00:03:53.790> going<00:03:53.970> for<00:03:54.239> the

until<00:05:10.780> he's<00:05:11.139> dead<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:11.729> yeah<00:05:12.729> like<00:05:13.300> I<00:05:13.360> said

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
until he's dead and yeah like I said

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.890 
until he's dead and yeah like I said
before<00:05:13.930> it<00:05:14.290> takes<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.770> while<00:05:15.010> but<00:05:15.900> you're

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
before it takes a while but you're

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.050 
before it takes a while but you're
definitely<00:05:17.260> not<00:05:17.530> going<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.889> have<00:05:18.070> anyone<00:05:18.669> die

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
definitely not going to have anyone die

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.390 
definitely not going to have anyone die
as<00:05:19.450> as<00:05:20.050> much<00:05:20.380> as<00:05:20.560> you<00:05:20.710> would<00:05:20.889> if<00:05:21.070> you're<00:05:21.220> just

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
as as much as you would if you're just

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.490 
as as much as you would if you're just
running<00:05:21.669> around<00:05:21.910> trying<00:05:22.270> to<00:05:22.450> do<00:05:22.630> it<00:05:22.810> but<00:05:23.050> if

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
running around trying to do it but if

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.950 
running around trying to do it but if
you<00:05:23.860> have<00:05:24.100> a<00:05:24.130> fireteam<00:05:24.790> of<00:05:25.090> all<00:05:25.360> people<00:05:25.810> that
