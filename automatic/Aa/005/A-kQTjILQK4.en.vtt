00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.830
 I'm not in a game room but in the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.259
 seat of the challenge of a company 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.989
 which provides educational material for the 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.030
 There are driving schools among this material 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.640
 a very innovative one and they are the simulators 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.879
 driving which we see one this is for 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.890
 motorcycles but there are some simulators 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.650
 for all vehicle categories that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.329
 they teach to drive both to those who must 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.190
 still to start has never taken the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.720
 steering wheel in hand and you know who should 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.360
 continue his training 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.390
 professional vehicle development 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.369
 how heavy these work 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.799
 simulators let us explain it from 

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:00.799
 president of the oasis by daniele filippi 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.799
 then filippi we are here before one 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.770
 this is simulator monsters 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.430
 evidently simulates a car 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.869
 just what are its characteristics 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.939
 then the characteristic of this 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.400
 simulator now in use in driving schools 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.679
 in a good number it is to be 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.289
 particularly enveloping then 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.170
 the candidate is immersive for the candidates 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.969
 just the feeling of being in place 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.319
 driving a car 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:39.479
 the graphics are very, very advanced and 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.569
 very let's say nice for 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.179
 the user and the simulator has the 

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.429
 feature to prepare the candidate 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.319
 from the first steps to the 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.270
 complete preparation the young lady in 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.270
 this case is obviously making a 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.729
 exercise we say already advanced because it has 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.889
 made a number of hours his 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.679
 simulator and is already able to do a 

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:04.590
 city ​​journey in a certain in a 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.450
 certainly in a way we say precise and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.350
 respectful of the highway code 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.540
 well here we have another one instead 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.700
 that I also have this obviously a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.800
 car simulator what 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.690
 distinguishes from the previous one 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.600
 the feature of this is a model 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.480
 is that it is completely removable e 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.210
 so we call it transportable there 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.190
 they are needs in driving schools 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.810
 where they have the peculiarity of having to 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.180
 move the simulator from a room 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.880
 from one location to another, this one 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.460
 lends itself to this situation yes 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.810
 lends in a very congenial way 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.500
 he also has the same characteristics 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.860
 of immersiveness and graphics has one 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.510
 particularity compared to the Senate 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.790
 we have seen this before 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.160
 also driving with blood alcohol levels that 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.160
 it is a particularity required also 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.200
 we go beyond desert schools though 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.110
 perhaps to the apparatus that will ever be there 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.900
 more like truckers that is that 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.110
 dedicated to industrial vehicles 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.140
 heavy and actually we see that 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.630
 its dimensions are the most impressive and 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.150
 of those we have seen with i 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.770
 previous simulators then what they are 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.710
 the features of this simulator 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:22.490
 what can you do here is this simulator 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.550
 is reproduces the driving position without 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.040
 have a full cabin in the seat e 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.290
 mobile tire or was seen true in 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.310
 all its features but the thing 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.980
 more important is that the subject is it 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.530
 tool the simulator plays all 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.500
 the tools of use the guide 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.210
 so on the steering wheel we have 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.310
 all devices 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.820
 then three stall turns and lights on 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.110
 arrows the king will delay the horn e 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.690
 whatever 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.220
 and in addition to this we have the 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.040
 8-speed gearbox with splitter for one use 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.390
 let's say about all the necessary brands and 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.850
 the so-called auxiliary brakes 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:11.170
 hydraulic retarders the feature 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.480
 then it is to bring the candidate 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.650
 down 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.350
 down let's say a primary use of the guide 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.130
 and therefore the management of the masses of the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.889
 vehicle volume until arriving at 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.850
 so-called inverse kinematics that more 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:34.250
 precisely it is called reverse 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.850
 up to much more advanced exercises and 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.590
 important for the driver 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.740
 professional who are those of the 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.440
 management of destabilizing forces that 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.900
 can create problems in the conduct 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.449
 driving until you lose control e 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.620
 having incidents I am referring to 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.889
 galloping to the yaw below 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.690
 sex on the same and all these 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:01.199
 danger situations than on 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.110
 simulator we can well realize 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.919
 so learn to control things that 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.750
 we can't do it on a public road 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:12.449
 where the dangers we can imagine 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.580
 which I am sure you would risk both 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.770
 of trucks that saw us well 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.419
 we will return naturally to tell you about the 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.060
 driving simulators for vehicles 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.380
 heavy that will become more and more 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.910
 important in the formation of 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.430
 drivers both of basic training 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.680
 so for those who never have 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.389
 picked up the steering wheel of a truck e 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.820
 both for advanced training such as 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:35.479
 that of the cqc in the meantime I wish you 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.479
 good road
