know if like he's going to be adding
that<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.110> zero<00:00:37.440> point<00:00:37.710> 4.0<00:00:39.320> be<00:00:40.320> cut<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.770> because

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
that in zero point 4.0 be cut or because

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400 
that in zero point 4.0 be cut or because
like<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.120> keeps<00:00:42.750> happening<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.230> other

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
like this keeps happening to other

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
like this keeps happening to other
people<00:00:43.500> too<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:45.350> maybe<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.039> been

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
people too and maybe it's just like been

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.420 
people too and maybe it's just like been
like<00:00:47.640> leapt<00:00:48.390> into<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:48.930> game<00:00:49.039> like<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> files

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
like leapt into my game like the files

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.369 
like leapt into my game like the files
are<00:00:50.640> probably<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.059> there<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.629> they're<00:00:52.350> not

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
are probably in there just they're not

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.350 
are probably in there just they're not
active<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> probably<00:00:53.579> activated<00:00:54.180> them

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
active and I probably activated them

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.069 
active and I probably activated them
somehow<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.590> been<00:00:55.829> switching<00:00:56.399> from

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
somehow I have been switching from

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.860 
somehow I have been switching from
survival<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.109> creative<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.859> lot<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.629> map

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
survival to creative a lot on this map

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.319 
survival to creative a lot on this map
just<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.100> get<00:01:02.399> most<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.850> materials

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
just so I can get most of the materials

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.109 
just so I can get most of the materials
I<00:01:03.480> don't<00:01:03.629> need<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:04.019> water<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.589> crap<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
I don't need like water and crap and the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.469 
I don't need like water and crap and the
snow<00:01:06.360> blocks<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> yeah<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.030> might<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.450> been

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
snow blocks so yeah that might have been

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.230 
snow blocks so yeah that might have been
the<00:01:09.750> thing<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.340> caused<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.549> happen<00:01:12.060> I

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the thing that caused this happen I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.499 
the thing that caused this happen I
don't<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:14.189> there's<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.700> zombie<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.210> there

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
don't know but there's a zombie in there

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.609 
don't know but there's a zombie in there
to<00:01:15.689> prove<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:17.299> yeah<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:19.140> pretty<00:01:19.380> cool

to prove it and yeah so it's pretty cool

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.649 
to prove it and yeah so it's pretty cool
I<00:01:20.750> wonder<00:01:21.750> how<00:01:21.869> long<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.409> last<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.850> my

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
I wonder how long this will last and my
