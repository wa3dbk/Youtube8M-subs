00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.940
 how many people then today I 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.840
 come back with a little tutorial hairdo so 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.840
 This hairstyle here 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.200
 so if you're interested to know 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.360
 how do I realize them and stay with me 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.410
 it starts right away to realize 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.810
 this hairstyle you will need 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.460
 simply an elastic and have at 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.400
 beforehand for your hair too 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.840
 started already did go we go there 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.370
 hop first thing to do is to 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.510
 create one that on the side so me this 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.100
 that I like to do is rolled up my 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.020
 first match for queuing 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.050
 now you are like when you 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:51.610
 want but you do not have to do it 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:53.500
 so here I create a simple that here 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:59.199
 I'm doing two laps since I'm going there 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:05.049
 loosen create a small space at 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:14.979
 here it is ironed inside 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:18.729
 my cure like this you see that you 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 give this then 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.890
 usually we go up before going back up 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.920
 I just take a wick 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.310
 which is underneath plastic so 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.469
 like this and I 'm going to iron 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:40.570
 the same place where I spent there 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:45.729
 than earlier the hatch of the other 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:50.909
 side I do this around my elastic 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.909
 in fact I cover in elastic actually 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:04.289
 is to treat the behind I do it 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.289
 I do not really just do it 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:17.600
 once my lastic nose is covered 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:19.940
 I can come up all of a sudden I 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.580
 returns well the matches I spent 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.880
 at the last moment and that's it gives me 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.880
 This site 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.640
 so here is my personally I like 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.990
 much of this fact of having three 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.540
 parties that goes to the same place 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.120
 does a little bit of a kind of flower a 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.150
 kind of crying or I do not know too much 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.910
 what but I personally like 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.050
 a lot less now here are all 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.760
 tastes are in nature you are 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.770
 may not have to like the same 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.120
 thing for me personally me it's 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.420
 something that is very easy to 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.090
 make 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.360
 quick to do and has all its charm 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.800
