00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
from the United States I think this will

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.860 
from the United States I think this will

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.390 
reference that he would be wearing
nothing<00:03:18.330> but<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.989> kangaroo<00:03:19.500> compies<00:03:19.980> we<00:03:20.280> knew

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
nothing but a kangaroo compies we knew

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.100 
nothing but a kangaroo compies we knew
we<00:03:20.550> wanted<00:03:20.580> it<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> be<00:03:21.090> really<00:03:21.420> different<00:03:21.720> and

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
we wanted it to be really different and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.920 
we wanted it to be really different and
really<00:03:22.260> stylized<00:03:23.070> pretty<00:03:23.640> out<00:03:23.850> there<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.600> it

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
really stylized pretty out there and it

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.720 
really stylized pretty out there and it
just<00:03:25.080> seems<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.410> absurd<00:03:25.530> but<00:03:26.070> we<00:03:26.459> started

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
just seems so absurd but we started

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.400 
just seems so absurd but we started
pitching<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.300> way<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.510> every<00:03:28.020> pitch<00:03:28.230> we

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
pitching it that way and every pitch we

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.660 
pitching it that way and every pitch we
did<00:03:28.590> we<00:03:28.739> would<00:03:28.860> talk<00:03:28.980> about<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.280> kangaroo

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
did we would talk about the kangaroo

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.949 
did we would talk about the kangaroo
codpiece<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.360> think<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.600> was<00:03:30.690> one<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.870> the

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
codpiece and I think it was one of the

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.900 
codpiece and I think it was one of the
first<00:03:31.140> things<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.680> can<00:03:31.830> can<00:03:32.130> look<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:32.520> or<00:03:32.730> talk
