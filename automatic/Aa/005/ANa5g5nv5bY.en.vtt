00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 hello everyone today I 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.069
 you find in a new video 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.140
 to make a video crash test I'm going 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.370
 actually tell you about these products of 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.559
 this or these products so it's the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.030
 flexible curlers or curlers 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.950
 papillotes it depends on us that you 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.509
 will find in store so what is 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.400
 that's happened actually these are 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.859
 curlers precisely flexible which you 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.060
 did also six and after there is a 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.400
 iron bar inside which allows you 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.810
 actually two convicts of them actually 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.130
 curler why what I wanted you 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.019
 to talk about it because I hated this 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.640
 night and I'm pretty happy with that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.070
 does the ripples that you see there 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.530
 so that really makes the ripples and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.940
 the marilyn monroe I think it's not 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.989
 the one that I naturally have here 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.280
 I put some lacc and I got 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.899
 they must be left in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.329
 at least four hours so there the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.190
 was sleeping with so that's the result and 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.480
 I'm pretty happy so it's 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.160
 for that in fact I wanted to talk about it 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.840
 to explain how to ask them 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.129
 how to have different forms of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.270
 loops depending on how 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.980
 you put them I found his 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.449
 ababou curlers i think you can 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.579
 find a little everywhere even on 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.840
 internet or in supermarkets 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.609
 baboo is a store for those who 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.140
 do not know or there are very few 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.550
 things that are expensive so suddenly 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.640
 when you want to do good business 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.540
 or so bought some little tricks 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.010
 we do not necessarily want to pay 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.479
 too expensive and baye fall and there I have 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.400
 took two packs of curlers so he 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.409
 there were five curlers in each of you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.810
 see with different colors to 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.549
 the unit it costs a euro 15.9 so the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.009
 coup today I got for 2 euros 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.720
 81 18 in total I took the paper in 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.340
 did because I thought I was going 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 need to put it above 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.340
 debt level but 5 is enough for me 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.890
 because I wanted 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.020
 loops ended up looking like a 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.759
 poodle because I do not necessarily like 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.200
 when it's too frizzy wanted 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.909
 really nice ripples a little 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.070
 little like actually like that what's that 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.750
 I really like to put the curler in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.490
 do you have to take a wick more or 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.840
 less large depending on the form of loop 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.119
 you want if you want 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.140
 goats wide enough for me I'm going 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.030
 take big locks if you 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.860
 want little curls and that's okay 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.730
 really taken must pti 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.770
 take more than 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.000
 curlers and also my more small 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.790
 wicks so suddenly you take your 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.110
 mail of a cd lapointe around the curler 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.790
 you pay attention to what the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.500
 plant are not crushed for not 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.480
 that it gives an effect she knows to the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.550
 tip and then you twisted the rest 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.710
 your hair still inward 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.540
 and then you close the curler and you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.220
 secure normally it's not okay 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.780
 fall and do that to you with the rest of 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.550
 I tested the hair that's yesterday 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.010
 evening and to sleep actually I put a 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.490
 hat to not be embarrassed for not 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.690
 that turns 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.520
 and this morning when I woke up I had two 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.840
 pretty the cancellation so I'm 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.760
 really very happy while my 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.990
 tickets you say asking if 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.790
 I can say I inquired about 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.510
 internet and I actually saw that not bad 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.430
 people 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.650
 moisten their hair beforehand 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.540
 so some advised to take a 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.000
 shampoo and iron on hair 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.560
 wet or humidify 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.840
 dry hair personally I do not have 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.440
 did that because I did not know it 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.660
 had to do it 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.400
 and frankly I did not have any problem 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.470
 I had pretty curls 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.180
 as I wanted I also 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.830
 realized that after five minutes 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.780
 of pause of a new one said I already had 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.480
 ripples can mark but when 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.440
 even who was there it was different from 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.320
 ripples that I can have 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.270
 of course it's good 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.680
 frankly not a problem if you forget 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.180
 to moisten your hair if you do not 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.490
 do not want your hair buckle to the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.260
 root it is not necessary to mount the curler 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.820
 to the root wanted it's pretty much 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.380
 close in the middle of the ears that's what 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.120
 I did it so I did not 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.070
 of ripples at this level and its 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.120
 loop from the lengths I wanted 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.160
 also see if it works and on 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.450
 curly hair and well proof yes 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.220
 that it works because I have hair 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.620
 curly at the base and that made me 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.190
 ripples different from the one I have 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.780
 habitually 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.670
 I've also actually seen to be 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.380
 it could last about 24 hours 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.850
 so the kg gel to style my hair and 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.800
 I'm ready to spend the day 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.240
 with its pretty cancellations according to the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.290
 way you will ask yourself 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.060
 you say you will have loops 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.680
 different so must also do 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.270
 be careful that you ask all your 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.550
 curlers the same way to not 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.500
 have different curls but that 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.330
 can also be a way to 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.760
 play on the hairstyles so that's 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.220
 really a product that is not expensive and 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.510
 job practice it's going a little bit 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.130
 embarrassed to stay overnight because 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.210
 I had the cap I had curlers 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.900
 I'm not used to having 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.250
 thing on the head 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.750
 when I woke up, I felt a little bad 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.920
 if I was going to have a torticollis do you 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.570
 you do not have to spend the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.250
 night with you can just do that 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.770
 during your day then leave to ask 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.090
 minimum four hours rd do your 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.590
 loops to some people also 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.840
 to save time in fact she wants 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.850
 change their hair lay curlers 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.070
 minimum one hour and then pass the 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.690
 hair dryer and then she had the 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.010
 curls defines as she on this side 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.570
 so it can be a 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.620
 alternative for people who do not 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.239
 do not want to waste time 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.040
 it's really a short video so 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.300
 if you find these products in commerce 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.830
 and you want a little bit of people 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.240
 from time to time I'll you 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.560
 advise to buy that because it 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.240
 really cheap and then it's 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.680
 a good alternative for precisely not 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.110
 not study heat on your hair 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.600
 it does not spoil them it's foam that 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.680
 is just an iron bar frankly 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.390
 if you move to regularly 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.590
 down it will not be able to spoil the nature of 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.270
 your hair so that's why I'm you 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.920
 advises this I hope the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.750
 video will have you more than that you will have 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.310
 made you want to crack on this product 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.320
 because there it is really cheap 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.490
 so suddenly alesi and then I had 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.690
 full of kisses while waiting for a 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.690
 next video lease 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.370
 we 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.490
 and
