ever<00:00:05.400> since<00:00:05.640> I<00:00:05.759> started<00:00:05.970> flying<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.629> have

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
ever since I started flying I have

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.230 
ever since I started flying I have
always<00:00:07.109> wanted<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.649> fly<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:07.859> tail<00:00:08.220> dragger<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
always wanted to fly a tail dragger the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.780 
always wanted to fly a tail dragger the
true<00:00:09.599> test<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.110> stick<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.530> rudder<00:00:10.650> flying<00:00:10.980> you

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
true test is stick and rudder flying you

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.390 
true test is stick and rudder flying you
can<00:00:11.820> fly<00:00:12.059> this<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.900> can<00:00:13.049> fly<00:00:13.200> anything<00:00:13.559> this

flying<00:00:26.640> easier<00:00:27.320> this<00:00:28.320> plane<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.800> from<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
flying easier this plane is from the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.250 
flying easier this plane is from the
Golden<00:00:29.490> Age<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.760> aviation<00:00:29.880> when<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> pilot

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
Golden Age of aviation when the pilot

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.990 
Golden Age of aviation when the pilot
really<00:00:31.500> needed<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> be<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.430> with<00:00:32.610> his<00:00:32.730> plane

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
really needed to be one with his plane

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.940 
really needed to be one with his plane
so<00:00:33.780> after<00:00:33.989> 15<00:00:34.200> years<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.710> flying

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
so after 15 years of flying

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
draggers I flew gliders back when I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.180 
draggers I flew gliders back when I
started<00:00:49.020> so<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.260> pretty<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.739> top<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.100> my

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
rudder technique but I know this plane

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.729 
rudder technique but I know this plane
will<00:00:52.649> test<00:00:52.920> me<00:00:53.360> but<00:00:54.360> I'm<00:00:54.420> ready<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.260> I'm
