00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.719

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.280
 Do not look so funny 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.170
 not so violent for a guy several times 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.120
 hey welcome to please channel me 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.450
 hot hanna how actually is I think 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.740
 times 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.330
 Today I'll do it again 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.650
 short tutorial for you i have like 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.600
 We said a lot of boredom 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.550
 and i think i can come full dose 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.180
 Do you make my video because the animal else 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.130
 Nothing to do 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 Today I wanted to show you how you are 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.949
 yours lives a bit full of make-up 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.480
 if you belong to the people 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.969
 who like me by nature not the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.570
 all folk groups are then you are 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.250
 right here 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.989
 I just wanted to say if you are 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.670
 as said brothers do not live fully 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.320
 then you can do that though 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.030
 always a bit fuller and one 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.219
 let's look a bit voluminous but 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.230
 you can not do it ten times as full 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.149
 make-up so that does not go out unfortunately 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.829
 So there already but this looks just 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.329
 not good anymore so it does not matter 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.010
 However, so far as make-up wearing 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.199
 and that's why I can only show you 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.460
 I mean, I make it a bit fuller 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.969
 Personally think that makes already 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.250
 difference 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.390
 and that works best with dark ones too 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.020
 colors that's why I also so today 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.030
 a dark song on it and I would 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.170
 say let's go, I have currently a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.090
 weakness for all possible functions 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.159
 which are a bit darker than mine 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.470
 original lift and pink 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.790
 reach and / or 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.320
 accordingly so today 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.299
 a shade and only by that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.530
 you just bring a dark vehicle 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.180
 Be the lips methods and such 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.799
 at the same time in the focus of the face and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.509
 I'm wearing for action 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.700
 First of all, on my normal lips 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.790
 shape up and everyone over a bit over 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.720
 my actual lips line 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.579
 besides , I was on my lips 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.110
 margins or we are always at it 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.729
 Hot, I do not really know if that one 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.470
 has names and that is a step of 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.490
 but also pretty much forget that 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.540
 even so lives a bit fuller 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.159
 look is 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.960
 and to define my lips one 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.310
 to create a clear line to edge i 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.320
 all my guys once with one 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.909
 concealer with the help of a cut quickly and 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.270
 This step gives you exactly one 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.619
 defined lips line is important but 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.000
 that you should fade out well 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.500
 After all, really not be seen 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500
 that you have traced back 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.350
 then a dark shade 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.880
 and that's a little trick by being 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.290
 namely the outer areas dark 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.819
 Dyed see the lips licks full 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:25.310
 I know exactly why that is 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:26.690
 but it is definitely too good 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.670
 Lastly, I highlight my lips heart 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.500
 and that too is a step in pretty 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.890
 many poor people do not appreciate or b at all 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.360
 knowledge 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.830
 by knowing a bit 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.569
 eyeshadow also this year lips heart 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.040
 be applying your lips highlight 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.980
 and the last lip really full 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.090
 look and then I ask something 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.860
 and then we would be already at the end 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.330
 the tutorial 's against really fast 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.600
 but today I still hope for something 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.600
 learned
