00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.290
 a better attitude would be good if we're 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.120
 here in minecraft and this is going to be the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.770
 first episode of a series where I'm going to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.310
 make a television that works in 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.769
 minecraft driver and how is it and in the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.269
 second episode you go that is the next 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.310
 we're not going to do anything so we're going to 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.830
 think like any good series 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.400
 wood catching and grabbing you 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.660
 true 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.660
 very good, very funny 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:46.010
 and it's not once thanks to a peak because 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.420
 we do not have to go for a walk when 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.250
 let's be in a line let's have that 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.170
 chop a lot but a lot of stone so 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.000
 prepare your peak because they will be 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.740
 several hours 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.290
 well now that we have many is 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.630
 created here let's go for rest 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.720
 coal and iron that I think out there like that 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.220
 let's put some stones and 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.320
 let's snap with our kind of 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.350
 diamond that we get in creative 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.350
 who decide by looking and punishing 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.960
 now that we have many subtract 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.660
 graceful is not a block of remains 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.810
 because we are going to see a quantity so 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.810
 do not 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.330
 now let's make a structure 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.490
 we end up having this structure there 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.320
 to put the screen and for that 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.890
 we need long good remember the 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.510
 iron 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.560
 we do not need to make these scissors 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.860
 because we're going to have to go look 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.920
 black wool so let's look for 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.920
 where 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.450
 a black bee 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:20.340
 we have one and what we lack is 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.980
 complete this television screen 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.620
 for we are the sofas and the seats 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.820
 to watch television and good for 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.640
 just shofar we're going to make a 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.350
 structure late so and then we're going to 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.860
 place 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.680
 more wood 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.640
 and well let's put two days we're going to 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.640
 put a cart 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.200
 for another cart and both 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.030
 let's break this 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:02.920
 and he was two arrested by sra 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:08.700
 and we are going to place two slabs there we have 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:12.739
 a motor looking towards the light 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.739
 It's the mecca moto 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.180
 there 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.310
 and well now we can sit down and 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.530
 we can observe from our seat 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.510
 the tradition or very well now we 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.770
 let's concentrate on making this 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.530
 television functions because it's more 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.790
 important now to believe the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.890
 television works that put an antenna 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.870
 so to optimize the time we're going to 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.069
 put them in creative and let's leave 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.069
 our outdoor antenna 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.769
 this song 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.349
 views and we're going to place our scope 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.930
 I can place it at the height I want 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:53.959
 that everything is going to be the signal 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.680
 so let's put it up to the maximum 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.680
 height of baikal 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.470
 and good until here we are going to go down 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.660
 as you can see this television is going to 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.870
 have a very tall lady and at 20 she's going to 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.870
 be of the downloads 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.750
 Y 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.470
 very well now yes this mechanism is going to 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.510
 be the one that will detect the signal 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.310
 of the remote control that will be here 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.310
 let's do the remote control 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.889
 and good to control the volume 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.960
 could work to finish it let's go 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.460
 to have to sit down to dig press the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.460
 button and enjoy life 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.300
 good if he's 97 and see you in the 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.300
