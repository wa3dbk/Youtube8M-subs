00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and that's great, this video on 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.879
 The truth is to answer a question that 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.700
 a lot of people have been doing to me lately 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.750
 It's how it was our trip here from the playtv 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.860
 until japan 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.110
 many people who follow the schedule 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.219
 of the playtv who accompanied moc knows a lot 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.560
 well, we went to Japan. 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.210
 will accompany the tokyo game show this mega 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 videogames event that takes place in the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.150
 land of the rising sun 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 but of course since we were in the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.109
 Japan, we took the trip to 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.849
 document some things 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.619
 different and unusual that we 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.850
 meet there on the other side of the world 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.360
 playtv in japan our destiny to 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.309
 land of the rising sun 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.350
 our mission to find and find out what 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.500
 there is more curious on the other side of the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.500
 world 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.640
 the bank is talking then gum gave 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.020
 but that's what earns you something really cool that 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.030
 people checked the gain in 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.230
 first place is an anime did a lot 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.719
 success continues to be very successful 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.910
 In Japan he revolutionized the way 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.910
 what the guys were doing anime put down 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.490
 has made so much success is so successful that 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.130
 they decided to make a statue 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.470
 giant is not so common any 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.750
 It was inaugurated two years ago in the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.120
 Japan in Tokyo, but then she 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.220

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.230
 definitely to the city touch her 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.150
 It is in front of a shopping center and is 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.030
 sensational because she is 18 meters 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.130
 height it weighs 85 tons 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.260
 it is a statue that stays there static 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.690
 no way what time of time in 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.070
 Times the guys put this statue 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.930
 to run that great for 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.870

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.990

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.850
 underneath the Ugandan statue has a 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.410
 bar for the galley to buy 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.479
 some toys but the most special 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.880
 even stay inside that mall that is 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.830
