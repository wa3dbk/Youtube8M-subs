00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
then when you move her arm it's just a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.529 
then when you move her arm it's just a
bit<00:00:47.309> weird<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.969> how<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.829> done<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.579> it

bit weird of how it's done and then it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.310 
bit weird of how it's done and then it
pulls<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> velcro<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> that
