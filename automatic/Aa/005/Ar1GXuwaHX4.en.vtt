00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
Twitter I did not know this but

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.330 
Twitter I did not know this but
apparently<00:01:16.500> some<00:01:16.710> people<00:01:16.740> knew<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.250> I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
apparently some people knew this and I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.499 
apparently some people knew this and I
guess<00:01:17.460> maybe<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.759> was<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.119> some<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
guess maybe this was in some of the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.390 
guess maybe this was in some of the
books<00:01:18.780> or<00:01:19.320> something<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:19.799> maybe<00:01:19.890> some<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
books or something or maybe some of the

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.179 
books or something or maybe some of the
offshoot<00:01:20.880> shows<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.869> they've<00:01:21.990> done<00:01:22.229> but

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
offshoot shows that they've done but

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.580 
offshoot shows that they've done but
that<00:01:23.400> apparently<00:01:23.700> after<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.390> Clone<00:01:24.659> Wars<00:01:24.689> so

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
racial these days and the idea that you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.910 
racial these days and the idea that you
would<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.720> upset<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> black

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
would be upset if there was a black

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.590 
would be upset if there was a black
stormtrooper<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.640> not<00:01:47.759> even<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.119> good<00:01:48.270> excuse

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
stormtrooper and not even a good excuse

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.010 
stormtrooper and not even a good excuse
for<00:01:48.750> it

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
for it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.210 
for it
it's<00:01:49.200> still<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.710> worth<00:01:49.920> getting

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
it's still not really worth getting

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's still not really worth getting
upset<00:01:50.369> about<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.790> right<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.720> fact<00:01:51.930> that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990

some<00:01:52.200> people<00:01:52.229> were<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> legitimate

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
some people were there is a legitimate

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.179
