subscription thing and I believe I have

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.040 
subscription thing and I believe I have
a<00:05:52.280> code<00:05:52.520> for<00:05:52.820> you<00:05:52.910> guys<00:05:53.120> so<00:05:53.360> you<00:05:53.390> guys<00:05:53.570> can<00:05:53.900> go

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
a code for you guys so you guys can go

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.350 
a code for you guys so you guys can go
check<00:05:54.290> it<00:05:54.440> out<00:05:54.530> right<00:05:54.800> here<00:05:55.100> and<00:05:55.330> if<00:05:56.330> you

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
check it out right here and if you

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.030 
check it out right here and if you
actually<00:05:56.630> use<00:05:56.930> the<00:05:57.050> code<00:05:57.230> pone<00:05:57.530> star<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:57.980> I

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
actually use the code pone star and I

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.500 
actually use the code pone star and I
think<00:05:58.250> it's<00:05:58.400> in<00:05:58.520> lower<00:05:58.669> case<00:05:58.940> you<00:05:59.090> get<00:05:59.210> you<00:05:59.330> ten

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
think it's in lower case you get you ten

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.020 
think it's in lower case you get you ten
percent<00:05:59.600> off<00:05:59.870> so<00:06:00.020> you<00:06:00.080> save<00:06:00.230> an<00:06:00.350> extra<00:06:00.470> dollar

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
percent off so you save an extra dollar

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.460 
percent off so you save an extra dollar
