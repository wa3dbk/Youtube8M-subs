00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.910 
little bit getting used to but we'll see
how<00:04:55.100> it<00:04:55.310> goes<00:04:55.780> you<00:04:56.780> can<00:04:56.930> see<00:04:57.170> that<00:04:57.200> that<00:04:57.590> like

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
how it goes you can see that that like

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.860 
how it goes you can see that that like
it's<00:04:58.130> a<00:04:58.250> lot<00:04:58.490> bigger<00:05:01.000> like<00:05:02.000> a<00:05:02.030> lot<00:05:02.270> more<00:05:02.480> room

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
it's a lot bigger like a lot more room

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.410 
it's a lot bigger like a lot more room
the<00:05:03.260> numbers<00:05:03.590> are<00:05:03.740> a<00:05:03.770> lot<00:05:04.040> larger<00:05:04.310> on<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.180> a

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
the numbers are a lot larger on and a

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.990 
the numbers are a lot larger on and a
lot<00:05:05.630> easier<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:06.050> see<00:05:06.380> it<00:05:06.500> quick<00:05:06.800> glance<00:05:07.070> this

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
lot easier to see it quick glance this

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.370 
lot easier to see it quick glance this
is<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.300> dark<00:05:08.510> theme<00:05:08.690> so<00:05:08.870> it's<00:05:09.020> a<00:05:09.080> little<00:05:09.230> bit

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
is the dark theme so it's a little bit

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.940 
is the dark theme so it's a little bit
different<00:05:09.830> to<00:05:09.980> compare<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:11.510> then<00:05:11.950> really

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
different to compare and then really

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:20.620 
different to compare and then really
quick<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:14.980> go<00:05:15.980> to<00:05:18.190> app<00:05:19.190> manager<00:05:19.880> and<00:05:20.090> then

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
quick the go to app manager and then

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.150 
quick the go to app manager and then
device<00:05:21.380> monitor<00:05:22.210> this<00:05:23.210> nicely<00:05:23.720> has<00:05:24.110> all<00:05:24.440> Seven

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
device monitor this nicely has all Seven

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.730 
device monitor this nicely has all Seven
tabs<00:05:25.610> right<00:05:26.180> on<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.450> bottom<00:05:26.600> it<00:05:27.020> worked<00:05:27.620> out

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
tabs right on the bottom it worked out

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.650 
tabs right on the bottom it worked out
like<00:05:27.800> perfectly<00:05:28.460> with<00:05:28.700> that<00:05:28.910> so<00:05:29.420> you<00:05:29.510> don't

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
like perfectly with that so you don't

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.420 
like perfectly with that so you don't
have<00:05:29.750> to<00:05:29.900> do<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.170> overflow<00:05:30.620> tab<00:05:30.920> menu<00:05:31.100> on<00:05:31.370> the

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
have to do the overflow tab menu on the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.640 
have to do the overflow tab menu on the
left<00:05:31.700> side<00:05:33.910> and<00:05:34.910> then<00:05:35.090> of<00:05:35.240> course<00:05:35.270> blend<00:05:35.840> the

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
left side and then of course blend the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.490 
left side and then of course blend the
actual<00:05:37.100> blend<00:05:37.610> app<00:05:37.940> doesn't<00:05:38.300> really<00:05:38.720> you<00:05:39.470> know

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
actual blend app doesn't really you know

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.870 
actual blend app doesn't really you know
show<00:05:39.800> too<00:05:39.860> much

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
show too much

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.670 
show too much
but<00:05:41.480> obviously<00:05:41.810> on<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:41.990> computer<00:05:42.380> it<00:05:42.500> will

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
but obviously on the computer it will

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.200 
but obviously on the computer it will
work<00:05:42.920> and<00:05:43.220> it's<00:05:43.490> nice<00:05:43.640> and<00:05:43.850> then<00:05:43.970> you<00:05:44.060> can

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
click and hold down to move these around

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.370 
click and hold down to move these around
you<00:05:46.730> see<00:05:46.910> that<00:05:47.060> it<00:05:47.210> switches<00:05:47.900> over<00:05:48.050> to<00:05:48.260> the

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
you see that it switches over to the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.140 
you see that it switches over to the
larger<00:05:48.770> one<00:05:48.950> I<00:05:50.920> mean<00:05:51.920> it's<00:05:52.070> 10<00:05:52.400> 23<00:05:52.790> that<00:05:52.970> we've

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
rubber feel to it I think the bottom

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.800 
rubber feel to it I think the bottom
here<00:06:51.350> it<00:06:51.590> is<00:06:51.800> for<00:06:52.640> the<00:06:53.350> charger<00:06:54.350> and<00:06:54.590> then<00:06:54.680> also

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
here it is for the charger and then also

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.220 
here it is for the charger and then also
i'm<00:06:56.810> not<00:06:57.050> mistaking<00:06:57.260> it<00:06:57.830> has<00:06:57.980> a<00:06:58.010> dual<00:06:58.670> purpose

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
i'm not mistaking it has a dual purpose

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.750 
i'm not mistaking it has a dual purpose
but<00:07:00.230> i'm<00:07:00.350> not<00:07:00.530> entirely<00:07:00.920> sure<00:07:01.130> so<00:07:01.460> there's<00:07:01.640> the

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:01.760 
but i'm not entirely sure so there's the

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.670 
but i'm not entirely sure so there's the
bottom<00:07:02.030> kind<00:07:02.390> of<00:07:02.420> tough<00:07:02.570> to<00:07:02.630> focus<00:07:05.680> there's

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 
bottom kind of tough to focus there's

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.550 
bottom kind of tough to focus there's
the<00:07:06.830> side<00:07:07.720> yeah<00:07:08.720> so<00:07:08.870> it<00:07:08.960> takes<00:07:09.110> definitely

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:09.560 
the side yeah so it takes definitely

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.540 
the side yeah so it takes definitely
going<00:07:09.680> to<00:07:09.740> take<00:07:09.860> a<00:07:09.890> little<00:07:10.070> bit<00:07:10.220> getting<00:07:10.430> used

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
going to take a little bit getting used

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.210 
going to take a little bit getting used
to<00:07:10.880> but<00:07:11.120> it<00:07:11.420> feels<00:07:11.840> nice<00:07:12.140> navigating<00:07:12.830> the<00:07:12.920> OS

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:13.220 
to but it feels nice navigating the OS
