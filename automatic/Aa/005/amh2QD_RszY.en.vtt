the<00:00:27.510> description<00:00:28.130> installers<00:00:29.130> has<00:00:29.400> well<00:00:30.090> heck

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the description installers has well heck

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.659 
the description installers has well heck
Ulis<00:00:30.630> has<00:00:30.900> shut<00:00:31.140> down<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.710> installs<00:00:32.219> doesn't

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
Ulis has shut down and installs doesn't

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.840 
Ulis has shut down and installs doesn't
work<00:00:32.790> anymore<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.710> you<00:00:34.710> should<00:00:35.190> probably<00:00:35.489> just

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
work anymore so you should probably just

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.590 
work anymore so you should probably just
uninstall<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.230> install<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.600> because

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
uninstall that and install this because

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.119 
uninstall that and install this because
25<00:00:40.350> PP<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.280> awesome<00:00:41.850> like<00:00:42.980> exactly<00:00:43.980> like

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
25 PP is just awesome like exactly like

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.779 
25 PP is just awesome like exactly like
installers<00:00:44.640> from<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> even<00:00:45.300> better<00:00:45.480> thing

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
installers from the even better thing

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.670 
installers from the even better thing
and<00:00:47.789> there's<00:00:48.000> no<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.360> API<00:00:48.809> errors<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> stuff

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and there's no like API errors and stuff

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.100 
and there's no like API errors and stuff
well<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.610> think<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.690> first<00:00:51.840> thing<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.989> want

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
well I think so the first thing I want

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.880 
well I think so the first thing I want
to<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> manage<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.280> go<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.489> sources

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
to do is go to manage and go to sources

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.590 
to do is go to manage and go to sources
so<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.070> would<00:00:56.160> look<00:00:56.250> like<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:57.120> anyways

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
