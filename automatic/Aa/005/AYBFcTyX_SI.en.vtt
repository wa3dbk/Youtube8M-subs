00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.880
 At the time when I came to the square, 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.520
 FC St. Gallen had already equalized. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.180
 I was calm and felt that I would still score one hundred percent. 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.880
 I got into the game pretty well 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.200
 and then came that one moment. 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.900
 Nobody touched me, 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.120
 I simply injured myself. 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.020
 That was the cruciate ligament tear. 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.700
 And in an incredibly shameful way. 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 At first I thought it would be all right, 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.580
 also the meniscus, everything. 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.640
 That was a pretty ugly moment in my career. 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.100
 Yes, I noticed then that something worse had happened inside the knee. 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.200
 But my will and passion have led me to 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.254
 to ignore the whole thing first. 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.820
 So it came to that, that I played on for another eight minutes. 

00:02:05.913 --> 00:02:08.613
 I played on for another eight minutes, 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.960
 and that with my cruciate ligament tear. 

00:02:11.854 --> 00:02:14.654
 And that's just because I wanted it that way 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.400
 to do something for the team 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.580
 Yes, it is true. I cried at that time, all night long, 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.620
 until the day before the ultrasound examination. 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.940
 I already knew 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.140
 that something more serious had happened in the knee. 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.240
 I am honest here: 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.200
 Two weeks after the operation 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.060
 I still could not believe that I had hurt myself. 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.000
 And that I have to pause for so long. 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.100
 But gradually I got used to the situation. 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.660
 And I started physiotherapy: 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.860
 Massages, sauna, swimming. 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.020
 All this twice a day. 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.020
 That's how I regained my confidence and my will, 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.100
 getting fit again as I was before the injury. 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.540
 To be honest, 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.080
 I do not have much patience. 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.934
 I have never been very patient 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.180
 I always wanted to have everything the same. 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.340
 For example, if the coach asked me today: 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.060
 "Armando, you have to play this week!" 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.660
 Then I would be absolutely ready. 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.400
 I just have this will to play again. 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.480
 To give the team my best. 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.560
 And with maximum commitment. 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.620
 I have always had this hunger. 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.120
 This hunger for football. 

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.080
 Because that's my dream I live. 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.360
 And that's why I want to recover as quickly as possible. 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.800
 The last three months have been very successful. 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.980
 I'm fine, very good.
