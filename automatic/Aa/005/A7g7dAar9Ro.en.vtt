month<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.910> man<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:30.470> problem<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.340> ran<00:02:31.880> into<00:02:34.270> you

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
month to man the problem I ran into you

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.880 
month to man the problem I ran into you
probably<00:02:35.570> might<00:02:35.780> run<00:02:35.959> into<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.530> because

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
probably might run into this is because

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.340 
probably might run into this is because
my<00:02:37.070> hair<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.370> my<00:02:38.030> natural<00:02:38.450> hair<00:02:38.660> is<00:02:38.870> about

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
my hair is my natural hair is about

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.830 
my hair is my natural hair is about
shoulder<00:02:39.860> length<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.090> main<00:02:41.240> problem<00:02:41.420> was

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
shoulder length so the main problem was

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.190 
shoulder length so the main problem was
attaching<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.180> basically<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.390> braided<00:02:44.840> it

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
attaching it and basically I braided it

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.070 
attaching it and basically I braided it
down<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.709> here<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.400> then<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:47.150> twisted<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.720> down

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
down to here and then I twisted it down

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.320 
down to here and then I twisted it down
to<00:02:48.470> here<00:02:49.070> which<00:02:49.310> is<00:02:49.459> where<00:02:49.610> my<00:02:49.790> real<00:02:50.090> hair

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
to here which is where my real hair

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.440 
to here which is where my real hair
starts<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.020> then<00:02:51.140> I<00:02:51.170> just<00:02:51.440> let<00:02:51.709> it<00:02:51.740> go<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.580> I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
starts and then I just let it go and I

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.080 
starts and then I just let it go and I
would<00:02:54.230> actually<00:02:54.650> advise<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.340> hairstyle<00:02:55.760> to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
would actually advise this hairstyle to

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.910 
would actually advise this hairstyle to
be<00:02:56.180> used<00:02:56.360> for<00:02:56.630> people<00:02:56.990> by<00:02:57.350> people<00:02:57.410> with

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
be used for people by people with

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.400 
be used for people by people with
shorter<00:02:58.400> hair<00:02:58.510> just<00:02:59.510> because<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.810> feel<00:03:00.140> as<00:03:00.260> if

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
shorter hair just because I feel as if

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.140 
shorter hair just because I feel as if
it<00:03:00.560> looks<00:03:00.770> better<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.459> looks<00:03:01.670> more<00:03:01.910> it

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
it looks better and it looks more it

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.580 
it looks better and it looks more it
looks<00:03:02.330> more<00:03:02.510> natural<00:03:02.570> with<00:03:03.200> people<00:03:03.500> with

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
looks more natural with people with

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.080 
looks more natural with people with
shorter<00:03:03.860> hair<00:03:03.890> because<00:03:04.340> they<00:03:04.490> don't<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.910> to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
shorter hair because they don't have to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.600 
shorter hair because they don't have to
create<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.570> down<00:03:05.720> as<00:03:06.050> far<00:03:06.380> or<00:03:06.800> squeeze<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.489> down

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
create it down as far or squeeze it down

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.660 
create it down as far or squeeze it down
as<00:03:07.910> far<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:08.840> as<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.110> can<00:03:09.260> see<00:03:09.560> this<00:03:10.130> side<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.519> my

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
as far so as you can see this side of my

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.490 
as far so as you can see this side of my
hair<00:03:10.850> has<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:11.480> looks<00:03:11.810> unnatural<00:03:11.989> so<00:03:12.410> I'm

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
hair has it looks unnatural so I'm

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.440 
hair has it looks unnatural so I'm
waiting<00:03:12.800> for<00:03:12.830> my<00:03:12.980> hair<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.280> grow<00:03:13.370> someone<00:03:13.790> you

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
know fill up the places that make it

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.750 
know fill up the places that make it
more<00:03:16.489> visual<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:18.170> really<00:03:19.040> don't<00:03:19.220> like<00:03:19.489> this

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
more visual so I really don't like this

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.820 
more visual so I really don't like this
part<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.269> this<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:20.750> how<00:03:20.930> far<00:03:21.200> my<00:03:21.350> hair<00:03:21.590> goes

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
part and this is how far my hair goes

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.620 
part and this is how far my hair goes
and<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.100> is<00:03:22.250> how<00:03:22.459> far<00:03:22.700> down<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:22.910> had<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.390> create

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
and this is how far down I had to create

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.890 
and this is how far down I had to create
a<00:03:23.690> twist<00:03:24.400> but<00:03:25.400> apart<00:03:25.790> from<00:03:25.880> that<00:03:26.030> so<00:03:26.450> far<00:03:26.720> this

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
a twist but apart from that so far this

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.790 
a twist but apart from that so far this
is<00:03:26.959> my<00:03:28.300> second<00:03:29.300> day<00:03:29.480> or<00:03:29.750> thought<00:03:30.080> they<00:03:30.320> have<00:03:30.650> in

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.700 

but<00:03:53.420> this<00:03:53.570> length<00:03:53.840> basically<00:03:54.410> what<00:03:54.530> they<00:03:54.650> did

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
but this length basically what they did

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.400 
but this length basically what they did
is<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:55.520> is<00:03:55.790> one<00:03:56.270> strand<00:03:56.780> of<00:03:56.990> hair<00:03:57.170> and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
is that this is one strand of hair and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.410 
is that this is one strand of hair and
usually<00:03:57.650> this<00:03:58.250> is<00:03:58.310> one<00:03:58.640> strand<00:03:58.940> of<00:03:59.030> hair<00:03:59.270> and

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
usually this is one strand of hair and

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.200 
usually this is one strand of hair and
for<00:03:59.720> this<00:03:59.810> length<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.500> actually<00:04:01.280> most<00:04:01.910> people

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
for this length I actually most people

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.450 
for this length I actually most people
will<00:04:02.300> fold<00:04:02.600> it<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:02.960> half<00:04:02.990> like<00:04:03.560> this<00:04:03.590> and<00:04:03.920> do

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
will fold it in half like this and do

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.190 
will fold it in half like this and do
the<00:04:04.610> attachments<00:04:05.300> which<00:04:05.450> gives<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.840> a<00:04:05.870> hair

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
the attachments which gives you a hair

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.110 
the attachments which gives you a hair
down<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.680> here<00:04:06.860> which<00:04:07.580> isn't<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:07.970> much

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
down to here which isn't that much

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.300 
down to here which isn't that much
difference<00:04:08.540> in<00:04:08.690> length<00:04:08.900> but<00:04:09.560> for<00:04:09.890> me<00:04:10.040> I

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
difference in length but for me I

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.900 
difference in length but for me I
actually<00:04:11.090> did<00:04:11.660> mine<00:04:11.900> like<00:04:12.140> this<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:13.730> went

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
actually did mine like this and I went

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.180 
actually did mine like this and I went
ahead<00:04:14.060> upgraded<00:04:14.420> it<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.230> lot<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:15.650> this<00:04:15.950> hair

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
ahead upgraded it so a lot of this hair

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.160 
ahead upgraded it so a lot of this hair
is<00:04:16.609> going<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.030> have<00:04:17.239> little<00:04:17.450> parts<00:04:17.870> like<00:04:18.019> this

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
is going to have little parts like this

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.070 
is going to have little parts like this
which<00:04:18.769> I<00:04:19.010> which<00:04:19.940> I<00:04:20.120> like<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.570> I<00:04:20.660> appreciate

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
which I which I like and I appreciate

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.010 
which I which I like and I appreciate
because<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.680> gives<00:04:21.859> that<00:04:21.920> more<00:04:22.670> natural<00:04:23.330> feel

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
because it gives that more natural feel

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.870 
because it gives that more natural feel
to<00:04:24.050> it<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.920> look<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.310> it<00:04:25.400> because<00:04:25.700> not

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
to it and look to it because not

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.730 
to it and look to it because not
everything<00:04:26.210> is<00:04:26.570> exactly<00:04:26.810> even<00:04:28.420> so<00:04:29.740> that's

how long did it take me to do I started
I<00:04:52.910> started<00:04:53.440> unusually<00:04:54.440> late<00:04:54.590> or<00:04:54.830> so<00:04:54.950> on<00:04:55.070> once

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
I started unusually late or so on once

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.570 
I started unusually late or so on once
pretty<00:04:55.670> hair<00:04:55.970> I<00:04:56.270> started<00:04:56.930> at<00:04:57.080> 3<00:04:57.380> p.m.<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:58.310> I

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
pretty hair I started at 3 p.m. and I

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.920 
pretty hair I started at 3 p.m. and I
didn't<00:04:58.850> get<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.210> didn't<00:04:59.540> stop<00:04:59.810> until<00:05:01.660> 5<00:05:02.660> a.m.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
didn't get I didn't stop until 5 a.m.

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.250 
didn't get I didn't stop until 5 a.m.
and<00:05:03.560> to<00:05:04.310> me<00:05:04.490> that<00:05:05.000> that<00:05:05.390> is<00:05:05.630> completely<00:05:05.990> worth

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
and to me that that is completely worth

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.140 
and to me that that is completely worth
it<00:05:06.290> because<00:05:06.560> when<00:05:06.830> I<00:05:06.860> do<00:05:07.010> yarn<00:05:07.460> braids<00:05:07.790> which

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
it because when I do yarn braids which

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.310 
it because when I do yarn braids which
actually<00:05:08.810> is<00:05:09.560> bigger<00:05:10.190> like<00:05:10.730> when<00:05:11.210> I<00:05:11.300> am<00:05:11.810> part

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
actually is bigger like when I am part

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.510 
actually is bigger like when I am part
of<00:05:12.410> my<00:05:12.530> hair<00:05:12.770> it's<00:05:13.040> bigger

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
of my hair it's bigger

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.850 
of my hair it's bigger
it<00:05:14.060> takes<00:05:14.390> just<00:05:14.480> amount<00:05:15.020> the<00:05:15.169> same<00:05:15.380> time<00:05:15.650> but

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
it takes just amount the same time but

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.290 
it takes just amount the same time but
the<00:05:15.950> only<00:05:16.100> difference<00:05:16.280> is<00:05:16.640> that<00:05:16.669> with<00:05:17.030> yam

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
the only difference is that with yam

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.690 
the only difference is that with yam
braids<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.840> have<00:05:18.380> to<00:05:18.530> create<00:05:18.830> all<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.280> way<00:05:19.430> down

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
and this one I do depends a lot lot

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.360 
and this one I do depends a lot lot
smaller<00:05:23.540> but<00:05:24.440> because<00:05:24.800> I<00:05:24.830> don't<00:05:25.160> have<00:05:25.250> to

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
smaller but because I don't have to

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.950 
smaller but because I don't have to
create<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.700> braid<00:05:25.910> all<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.330> way<00:05:26.510> down<00:05:26.780> it

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
create the braid all the way down it

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.870 
create the braid all the way down it
does<00:05:27.140> save<00:05:27.350> me<00:05:27.530> time<00:05:27.770> so<00:05:27.800> once<00:05:28.400> again<00:05:28.669> if<00:05:28.820> you
