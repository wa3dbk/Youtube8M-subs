00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
make so many adjustments to our patterns

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.910 
make so many adjustments to our patterns
because<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.670> pattern<00:02:24.570> companies<00:02:25.080> make

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
because the pattern companies make

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.160 
because the pattern companies make
patterns<00:02:26.930> for<00:02:27.930> average<00:02:28.730> measurements<00:02:29.730> and

that's<00:03:42.510> very<00:03:42.930> important<00:03:43.440> next<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.580> want<00:03:44.730> to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
that's very important next you want to

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.050 
that's very important next you want to
measure<00:03:45.030> your<00:03:45.959> side<00:03:46.290> seam<00:03:46.709> between<00:03:47.700> your

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
waist line and your hip line this will

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.170 
waist line and your hip line this will
tell<00:03:51.600> you<00:03:51.810> how<00:03:51.840> many<00:03:52.080> inches<00:03:52.470> your<00:03:53.459> hip<00:03:53.820> depth

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
tell you how many inches your hip depth

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.530 
tell you how many inches your hip depth
is<00:03:54.360> at<00:03:54.930> your<00:03:55.590> side<00:03:55.860> seam<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.970> reason<00:03:57.300> why<00:03:57.420> I'm

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
is at your side seam the reason why I'm

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.180 
is at your side seam the reason why I'm
not<00:03:57.600> telling<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.260> do<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.440> from<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.890> center

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
not telling you to do it from the center

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.860 
not telling you to do it from the center
front<00:03:59.459> is<00:03:59.670> because<00:04:00.239> some<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.840> us<00:04:01.769> have<00:04:02.870> waist

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
front is because some of us have waist

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.920 
front is because some of us have waist
lines<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.440> slope<00:04:04.800> in<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.160> front<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.930> so

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
lines that slope in the front and so

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.060 
lines that slope in the front and so
that's<00:04:07.170> not<00:04:07.440> going<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.709> be<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:07.830> good

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
that's not going to be a good

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.479 
that's not going to be a good
