00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.010
 They seem to be of every vehicle 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.559
 of course, over the time of losing 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.460
 years on 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.460
 but the troupe 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.400
 beautiful she is then gone again what 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.880
 means that openness and 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.750
 probably that the preparation of the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.910
 Headlight is a pretty simple one 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.640
 professional cheap type one 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.449
 yellowed suspected spotlight 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.449
 over the years due to environmental influences 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.949
 uv radiation suffers again 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.890
 recycle 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.799
 the preparation is a pretty simple one 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:54.040
 procedure with our headlights clear 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:59.110
 Everything is contained in this set 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.110
 starting from the plastic cleaner 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.269
 via appropriate over a 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.930
 appropriate sponge sanding 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:12.880
 materials right through to plastic 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.200
 Prosecutor and when I setup this 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.240
 I have everything you need for a long time 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.729
 decide again in a new gloss 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.280
 you can shine with this set 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.820
 start immediately and within 30 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.630
 Turn the headlight back into one 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.610
 condition as he was in the origin 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.740
 to compare with a new one 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.530
 for which lighting systems and you me that 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.200
 It works for all headlights 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.079
 species 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.270
 So the plastic discs have everything 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:48.030
 modern chandler betrayed by the normal 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.030
 to the xenon but also for taillights 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.659
 the handling is basically whole 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:02.500
 easy for anyone for easy 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.829
 handling and documentation 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.229
 we put a cd in each set with the 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.860
 corresponding application film attached 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.299
 but also a paper description for 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.500
 The people who like to read like 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.500
 let's see what looks like 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.989
 we have this headlight here 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.549
 is not uncommon to happen 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.260
 Such headlights also in the 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.319
 Road traffic looks like this 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.599
 of course, the headlight effect around 70 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.360
 up to 70 percent and they decreased 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.640
 have no chance 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.709
 to get a tÃ¼v plaque with 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.700
 We see this in our treatment here 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.859
 Result 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.590
 it is clear again and has full 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:50.350
 luminosity and what's the most important thing 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.170
 the headlight has one again 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.480
 uv-protection film as he also from 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.660
 manufacturer on a new acquisition 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.780
 guaranteed is from here to small 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.430
 are 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.470
 30 minutes without removal of the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.850
 Headlight will be in the installed state 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.850
 worked on the vehicle
