but the pink one it only needed one coat

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 
but the pink one it only needed one coat
and<00:01:07.560> you'll<00:01:07.710> see<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.369> use<00:01:08.580> your<00:01:08.820> polish

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
actually happens is just that the layer

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.480 
actually happens is just that the layer
just<00:04:42.990> needs<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.350> be<00:04:43.470> wiped<00:04:43.680> off<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.160> I<00:04:44.220> used
