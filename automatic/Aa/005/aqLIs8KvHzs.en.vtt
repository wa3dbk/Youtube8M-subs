00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.529
 you would like to make your own spheres in 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.809
 this time we will make some spheres 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.880
 Christmas to decorate our tree 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.250
 Christmas 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.550
 for this we need these 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.550
 materials 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.490
 cotton thread 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.120
 a balloon 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.539
 white or glue adhesive 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.780
 some water 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.310
 scissors 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.780
 the brush 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.770
 and to decorate we can use 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770
 diamond 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.210
 and acrylic paint 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.290
 first we inflate our balloon to the size 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.910
 that we want our spheres what 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.050
 we tie very well so that you do not 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.050
 deflate in the process 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.990
 we put it aside and we take our 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.880
 cotton thread we will take the quantity 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.090
 desired to be able to wrap our 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.090
 balloon 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.259
 later we cut it 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.050
 and now we will take our resistor 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.840
 and a little water what we will do is 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.780
 Mix both so they have less 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.410
 consistency and at the time of drying not 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.410
 stay white 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.320
 once ready what we will do is to soak 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.320
 our cotton yarn in the resistol 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.030
 since it is well soaked what we will do 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.030
 is to start wrapping our globe 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.139
 if there are still spaces left to cover what 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:08.569
 What we will do is put this point in 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:11.569
 any of the threads and soak more 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.200
 thread with resistol preferably leave it 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.200
 dry one day 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.079
 since it is dry what we will do will be 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.079
 break our globe 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:45.739
 and we are left like this now we can decorate myself 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.739
 I will paint and cover with diamond 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.170
 in this way 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.510
 and we are thus decorated 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.500
 to hang it we can use the same 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.500
 cotton thread 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.400
 and ready to hang as you see was very 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.630
 easy to perform I hope you liked it 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.640

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.430
