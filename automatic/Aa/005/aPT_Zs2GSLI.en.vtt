00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
key that looks like this if you see this

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.219 
key that looks like this if you see this
in<00:01:16.130> your<00:01:16.219> drawer<00:01:16.430> don't<00:01:16.670> throw<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:16.969> away<00:01:17.229> and

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
that all doesn't work and you probably

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.959

those projects that you can do yourself

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.450 
those projects that you can do yourself

there's a tear to save energy and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.709 
there's a tear to save energy and
basically<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.340> just<00:01:34.670> pulls<00:01:35.119> out<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.509> groove

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719
