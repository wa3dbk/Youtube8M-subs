00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.750
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.400
 recently I have promised that I 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.400
 show you how to get out of a boxwood 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.680
 such a bonsai can attract 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.820
 I have now searched my system and 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.150
 nothing found 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.320
 there is amazement for such a bonsai 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.670
 have to zoom to pull you really 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.260
 a plant for the pick 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.460
 Of course it is suitable and there I am 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.080
 I have not found anything yet 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.690
 drive a friend because he has quite 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.910
 lots of trees and there we will 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.390
 I think with safety I go down 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.390
 Let's go now 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.760
 somehow there are already boxwood 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.700
 meets 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.340
 magix work out 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.330
 happiness is 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.330
 klitschko 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.880
 m 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.530
 he came 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.530
 look there 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.590
 Much grown in recent years 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.590
 lieberman 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:59.850
 the roof looks as has arrived 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.860
 we'll go through the whole thing now 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.900
 walk through the trees and see if 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.490
 Candidates could find the right one 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.619
 so that you can show yourself as we do 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.090
 from a shrub one but make 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.880
 can and I will now first 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.680
 The whole system is slow because 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.920
 is probably a bit longer 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.920
 last 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.790
 As you can see, the search is not like that 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.459
 easy but very laboriously complete the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.420
 head and arms 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.420
 but found it a few times 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.359
 this is a candidate 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:47.439
 the ugly trunk and that is one 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:49.780
 dwarf formula 1 can look really pure 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.209
 you will not be there in any case 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.079
 the not so thick branches have and 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:59.310
 so it will certainly be one 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.310
 be a candidate 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.079
 then here we have a 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.079
 candidates 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.890
 is the little voice that something 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.320
 but inside it is beautiful 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:26.540
 Branched decide sorry for blade 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:29.330
 but for the one that is the normal 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.840
 boxwood to taste boris kren have 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.840
 then found here 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.219
 he has a nice little town in the bottom 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.180
 and inside maybe too 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.480
 interesting but you can still do that now 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.209
 not a few say that also a poor 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.190
 boris kunz interesting others 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:00.019
 Book trees so really huge 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.970
 selection and I do not have one yet 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.209
 at least I found no one 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.400
 Definitely for you to be able to shape it 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.720
 stand some beautiful but the roma now 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.010
 really do not cut small 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.010
 that would be too bad 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.710
 I would say the workers are looking for that 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.860
 I decided on one of these 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:34.300
 stands to take the pot and that 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:39.080
 got this bugs ladies team getting one 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.840
 interesting in bari and is very dense 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.160
 and grown compact 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:48.740
 relatively small and I guess from the 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.130
 Candidates if we together a bonsai 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.130
 do 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.910
 we did it , we have one 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.669
 backpack found 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.289
 He has a nice town in it 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.250
 and of that we will work together 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.900
 make a roundel 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.030
 but I would do that in one 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.710
 show another movie how it works 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.030
 otherwise that would be too long for mounted 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.250
 I just wanted to show that one 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.800
 So a wall of a boxwood bonsai 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.660
 I would like to bring some time 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.229
 and the search has to go because the 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.419
 you do not just find it that way looking for it 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:33.650
 you your grew from good order for the 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:36.169
 farm what is reasonable yes I am 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.490
 happy with this candidate and me 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.780
 I hope I like the movie and we 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.580
 See you at the next movies times 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.650
 again in this sense your detlef roman 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.650
 be and have fun with on board 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.390
