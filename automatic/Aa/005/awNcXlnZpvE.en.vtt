00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.360
 until about 350 years ago 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.209
 at Waldrapp native to us 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.049
 since then he has died out in Central Europe 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.590
 he only survived in some zoos 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.359
 but unfortunately he does not let himself be easily recovered 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.409
 the problem is Waldkappel are migratory birds 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.729
 They must show the way south over the Alps from their parents 

00:00:24.729 --> 00:00:25.720
 to get 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.720
 This does not pacify them in the winter agonizing 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.159
 behavioral biologist Johannes Fritz from the University of Vienna 

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:40.450
 the storks sign finite the previous ones especially 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.560
 and he had a vision 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.690
 here many movie scenes flow the wild geese do not want to constantly with 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.960
 Help one will thereby shows the way of the least has shown the way 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.520
 the family may know this but misses the opportunity 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.520
 to show them the way in the toes 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.930
 First, you must feel that Fritzl is to find bird friends 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.680
 who are ready to take on the role of Waltrop World and indeed of that 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.720
 Currently 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.720
 by the chicks hatching 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.860
 Mark our goal for the second time on this model 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.840
 Through constant caressing here in the Salzburg Zoo an intimate relationship 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.859
 The little ones will follow them even later 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.859
 because he comes and reaches. "Aviator sits 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.290
 twice has such a rearing with subsequent flight training in 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.070
 Bavarian Burghausen already occurred 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.470
 Twice we tried for ten cent team the ball kicked the route 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.570
 to show to Italy 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.780
 the first attempt in 2007 went awry 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.840
 we wanted something for the over the Alps south between us though 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.740
 the old and 1 not anymore 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.910
 followed 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.950
 We have clouded over the Alps for the then again less vehicles 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.170
 yet they have to transport the aircraft neither nor flew though 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.700
 the problem is that this is a piece of the old missing and that's why 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.190
 questionable UBS I see again the way back to find per box 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.129
 become 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.739
 Evaluations of the second attempt last year with the Waldrappen in 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.120
 to fly Tuscany 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.980
 with the ornithologist Franz Bairlein from Wilhelmshaven and two animals 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.199
 Medical students of the University of Vienna 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.809
 they had accompanied the Waldrappe during the several-week tour and 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:41.049
 medically examined, always immediately before and after each flight 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.259
 The special thing was that we first of all once had it unique 

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:48.279
 Possibility had met due to familiarity 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.039
 to investigate what power the air traffic in the zib2 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.889
 Psychology to understand how all its predecessors location is long distance too 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:56.479
 pull 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:58.109
 AP 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:03.289
 with the help of video footage Johannes Fuchs analyzes at the airports 

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.579
 When and how long are they active? 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.199
 the long time in gliding 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.249
 really use your power optimally 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.319
 According to his observations, Waltrop fly most effectively when they are her 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.619
 Ideal weight while traveling 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:26.309
 for the birds were also beneficial that the researchers in 2008 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:29.469
 chose a different route than 2007 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.749
 it is also not when about the Alps about it is not before but remembered 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.229
 he from the old one 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.529
 knock over it 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.819
 Bauer Oh that has the much cheaper meadows we also new world 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.799
 Basic data with which you can fly 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.230
 beginning of September 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.949
 we meet that two joined him in Slovenia 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.879
 in many small jumps they have from Burghausen around the Alps 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.219
 It's still going on all the way to the finish in Tuscany 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.489
 today is another expert 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.259
 it is early morning Heidfeld 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.189
 the camp is located on the edge of an airfield 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.319
 the previous balance of the team leader is positive 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.369
 in terms of Tauss has been 

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:14.939
 big cup still to be expected from the new mediation mission 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.099
 come 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.589
 to fit well with if not so strong 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.609
 especially affected by the kilometer of information 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.900
 while persons 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.229
 added on his side optimistic that there is a must go on yes 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.030
 in front of them are another 800 kilometers 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:40.459
 On the trip to Italy, the team is now traveling with two aircraft 

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:43.459
 Johannes works as a kind of standing 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.400
 solve by a seventh place 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.419
 destined to his song 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:50.509
 but that's not the point 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.740
 John flies ahead which and how strong the fog in the neighboring children 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.400
 is Markus and the second pilot Biker HolzmÃ¼ller wait so long with the 

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.279
 Offered chicks 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:07.319
 8 percent of everything is going on 8% already became the summit Orc 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.170
 nor is the fog too close underneath it has reported that also for bicycles 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.360
 can pass after an hour 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.360
 precious time lost on the way to the south 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.339
 I want the consequences since today that's not enough 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.719
 At about 45 kilometers per hour they fly over the beautiful landscape 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:37.930
 Slovenia 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.059
 after 66 kilometers but the final is the one that increased 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:45.499
 do not want to pursue the testimony anymore 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:48.589
 after all, they are back to their winter quarters in Tuscany 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:50.680
 finally the desired success 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.159
 ten researchers from a total of 15 Waldrappen arrive in Italy 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.930
 but how often in nature there were sacrifices 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.180
 in poultry had to cancel the flight because of exhaustion 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.419
 Tragically, a fourth device enters the propeller of the microlight 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.119
 until their sexual maturity the Waldrappe remain in Tuscany 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.639
 Only then will they try to return to Germany in their breeding grounds 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.939
 to fly 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:18.400
 Johannes Fritz and his team will know next year at the earliest 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.970
 if Lee needs long-term experiment 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.780
 and pop their dream fulfilled that election day after 350 years with us again 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.200
 finds a home
