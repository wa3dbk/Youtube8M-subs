00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.950
 good people will show here how 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.860
 to perform the diagnosis of the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.369
 airbag and pre-tensioner system 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.550
 of the seat belt 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:28.619
 so we have a present 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.980
 let's turn on the ignition where you have the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.930
 to the left of the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.710
 seatbelt and right this raises 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.660
 pilot light she should ascend and then 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.880
 payable after ignition on and we 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.829
 note here flashes 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.220
 so there is some problem in the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.220
 car 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.950
 good staff this kind of indication is a 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.450
 indication to the user, ie the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.910
 system only indicates that it has a 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.110
 but it does not identify which fault is 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.570
 occurring 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.040
 we have the certainty that is fÃ¡bio 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.440
 happening we have to go into 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.660
 airbag diagnosis 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.820
 I'll show good to 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.500
 to go into diagnostic mode we will go 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.400
 having to perform a procedure only 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.630
 with the ignition of the car so I'll call the 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.930
 ignition 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.979
 so to pay 2 of the airbag we get 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.070
 with the ignition off and on I arrived 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.070
 nobody 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.340
 I hung up nobody 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.020
 I hung up, nobody, so now he's 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.860
 in diagnostic mode and release the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.860
 fault code 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:34.390
 is a long-stay two fiscal cost of 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:37.900
 Basque then only has a code of 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.840
 stored fault and we will be 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.790
 looking in the service manual is also 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.220
 making available in the video 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.760
 all faults is already identifying the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.760
 What's wrong? 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.070
 good folks to go back pro mode 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.500
 user is just repeating the same 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.430
 procedure 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.430
 nobody the ignition 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.970
 I know who 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.840
 I thought nobody 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:46.390
 I hung up, you may notice that it will show 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.390
 indication of failure as mode user 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.390
 the indicator flashes continuously 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.820
 now we will perform the repair and a reset 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.820
 of the system 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.760
 good after repair 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.260
 the system still has a failure indication 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.260
 so let's turn the ignition on 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.720
 we are on the way the user is the failure 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:45.849
 It is still indicating so let's make 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:49.389
 now q7 of the system is turned off the 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.340
 issue and perform the same procedure 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:58.199
 to enter diagnostic mode but 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.199
 four times and departure and the decrease 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.260
 I hung up 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.189
 I know that no one 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.280
 I know that no one 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.729
 I know that no one 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.729
 of the match 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.740
 leave in the light of the air bag erased from the system 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.740
 is respected 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.830
 Let's check the car's power off only. 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.280
 the ignition 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.870
 light should turn on for 17 seconds and the 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.870
 pay and keep erased 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.600
 attract staff the whole procedure
