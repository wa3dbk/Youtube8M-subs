activation it's important for a number

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.459 
activation it's important for a number
of<00:00:08.940> different<00:00:09.000> reasons<00:00:09.269> your<00:00:09.960> glutes<00:00:10.349> are

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
of different reasons your glutes are

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.350 
of different reasons your glutes are
part<00:00:10.740> of<00:00:10.800> your<00:00:10.920> core<00:00:11.219> therefore<00:00:11.820> every

having strong glutes means that our

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.320 
having strong glutes means that our
other<00:00:29.039> muscles<00:00:29.490> surrounding<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.090> glutes

other muscles surrounding the glutes
usually<00:00:30.869> our<00:00:30.990> hamstrings<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.650> our<00:00:31.769> lower

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
usually our hamstrings and our lower

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.340 
usually our hamstrings and our lower
back<00:00:32.279> they<00:00:33.090> don't<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.570> work<00:00:33.750> as<00:00:33.960> hard<00:00:33.989> or

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
back they don't have to work as hard or

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.290 
back they don't have to work as hard or
compensate<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.399> weakness<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.940> our<00:00:36.000> glutes

compensate for weakness in our glutes
here's<00:00:36.989> an<00:00:37.140> exercise<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.010> recommend<00:00:38.460> for

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
here's an exercise that I recommend for

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.130 
here's an exercise that I recommend for
strengthening<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.570> glutes<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.960> i'm<00:00:40.050> going

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
strengthening your glutes and i'm going

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.229 
strengthening your glutes and i'm going
to<00:00:40.230> show<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.410> two<00:00:41.219> important<00:00:41.700> set<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.000> pieces

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
to show you two important set up pieces

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.090 
to show you two important set up pieces
we're<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> be<00:00:42.780> doing<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.079> hip<00:00:43.290> thrust<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
we're going to be doing a hip thrust and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.540 
we're going to be doing a hip thrust and
this<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.539> pretty<00:00:46.140> standard<00:00:46.590> movement<00:00:47.010> looks

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
this is a pretty standard movement looks

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610 
this is a pretty standard movement looks
something<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.000> palms<00:00:48.510> down<00:00:48.809> feet<00:00:49.350> flat

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
something like this palms down feet flat

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.799 
something like this palms down feet flat
on<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.770> floor<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.309> our<00:00:50.850> hips<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.270> up<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> hips

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
on the floor and our hips go up and hips

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
on the floor and our hips go up and hips
come<00:00:52.020> down<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.500> lot<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.100> people<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.399> this

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
come down a lot of people do this

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.189 
come down a lot of people do this
exercise<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.239> there's<00:00:54.390> two<00:00:54.629> pieces<00:00:54.840> that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
exercise but there's two pieces that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.500 
exercise but there's two pieces that
make<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.379> huge<00:00:55.890> difference<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.489> terms<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.969> how

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
make a huge difference in terms of how

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.420 
make a huge difference in terms of how
much<00:00:57.719> recruitment<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.070> our<00:00:59.190> glutes

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
much recruitment we have in our glutes

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.459 
much recruitment we have in our glutes
take<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> look<00:01:00.090> number<00:01:00.719> one<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.079> want<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
take a look number one is we want to

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.189 
take a look number one is we want to
tuck<00:01:01.770> our<00:01:02.039> heels<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.550> towards<00:01:02.820> our<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.359> notice

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
tuck our heels in towards our but notice

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.679 
tuck our heels in towards our but notice
that<00:01:04.350> my<00:01:04.470> shins<00:01:04.860> are<00:01:05.070> almost<00:01:05.760> perpendicular

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
that my shins are almost perpendicular

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.750 
that my shins are almost perpendicular
to<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.960> floor<00:01:07.110> sometimes<00:01:07.950> people<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> hip

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
to the floor sometimes people do a hip

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.120 
to the floor sometimes people do a hip
thrust<00:01:09.090> way<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.350> further<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.920> move

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
thrust way out here the further we move

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
thrust way out here the further we move
our<00:01:11.340> feet<00:01:11.549> away<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:12.030> our<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.659> more

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
our feet away from our but the more

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.359 
our feet away from our but the more
we're<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.170> recruit<00:01:13.530> our<00:01:13.560> hamstrings

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
we're going to recruit our hamstrings

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.460 
we're going to recruit our hamstrings
which<00:01:15.000> are<00:01:15.180> traditionally<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> stronger

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
which are traditionally a stronger

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.469 
which are traditionally a stronger
muscle<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.040> we'll<00:01:17.220> quite<00:01:17.430> easily<00:01:17.759> take<00:01:18.180> over

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
muscle and we'll quite easily take over

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.840 
muscle and we'll quite easily take over
for<00:01:18.689> our<00:01:18.810> glutes<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.979> second<00:01:20.400> piece<00:01:20.580> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
for our glutes the second piece and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
for our glutes the second piece and
maybe<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.420> important<00:01:21.869> ones<00:01:21.900> if<00:01:22.229> you

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
maybe the more important ones if you

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.870 
maybe the more important ones if you
take<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> look<00:01:22.680> at<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:22.920> feet<00:01:23.189> I'm<00:01:23.670> actually

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
take a look at my feet I'm actually

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.120 
take a look at my feet I'm actually
going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.270> bring<00:01:24.450> my<00:01:24.630> toes<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.590> off<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.950> floor

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
going to bring my toes up off the floor

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.550 
going to bring my toes up off the floor
really<00:01:27.090> pushing<00:01:27.479> my<00:01:27.600> heels<00:01:27.930> into<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.439> floor

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
really pushing my heels into the floor

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.100 
really pushing my heels into the floor
the<00:01:29.520> more<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.790> push<00:01:30.119> my<00:01:30.329> heels<00:01:30.750> into<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.020> floor

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the more I push my heels into the floor

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.140 
the more I push my heels into the floor
again<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.009> more<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.340> track<00:01:32.759> through<00:01:33.030> my

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
again the more I can track through my

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.270 
again the more I can track through my
glutes<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.990> initiate<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.710> movement<00:01:35.009> as

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
glutes to initiate this movement as

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.760 
glutes to initiate this movement as
opposed<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.119> hamstrings<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
opposed to just hamstrings so the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.319 
opposed to just hamstrings so the
finished<00:01:38.159> finished<00:01:38.610> piece<00:01:39.000> will<00:01:39.180> look

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
finished finished piece will look

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.719
