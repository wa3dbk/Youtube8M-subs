00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.620
 in the main roles in the German 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.580
 Cinemas and the constellation you can 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.290
 can already ask yourself there 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.440
 still go a lot wrong and that 's it 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.289
 now get away with what it has 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.490
 crazy big eyes looking through 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.020
 I can feel my eyes to the eyes 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.380
 expressing the eyes is that 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.150
 windows to the soul what I have today 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.330
 does and lives how see the eyes so 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.039
 big eyes are the window to see 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.840
 that's why I like them so great was the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.079
 I've always done it like you say 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.460
 are you before how much we have fun 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.460
 it's also about calling it public 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.420
 17 million dollars the art world is in 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.640
 revolt 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.660

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.960
 postcards from the print of 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.420
 afterwards lord god it's a movement 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:08.180
 this is the purest kit yes exactly I love 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:10.040
 that's where you're wrong, that's what I have 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.170
 maybe i could like it myself 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.240
 if you say that to anybody breaks 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.240
 this imperium together i will talk 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.290
 every beginner stood by me all those 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.290
 big on 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.240
 how should that explain please at home 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.080
 are you a dead end somehow? 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.580
 made picture everything 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.940
 it has come that far 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.140
 Coming soon in the cinema bks goes today and 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.490
 seven minutes is from 0 years 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.400
 Released and starts in Germany 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.930
 from 23 april 2015 in german 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.480
 cinemas and tells the true story 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.210
 from margaret and wanted key margrit 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.650
 played by amy adams this late 1950s 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.120
 He is leaving his husband for years 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.560
 badly treated and together with the daughter 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.630
 tried and san francisco over the 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.340
 to come round but in the 50s 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.690
 is the image of women yet another another 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.640
 getting a job as a woman is very 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.720
 Unusually , she can only do more 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.310
 bad as right about the rounds 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.630
 but at some point that should also beat that 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.979
 be disputed 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.840
 parallel while on one 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.460
 art market she herself has studied art 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.290
 and there is particular because children with 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.180
 big eyes if you have a man there 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.490
 knows name wanted a romantic because 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.350
 Paris has studied one of these art 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.610
 wants to live and can at least after 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.500
 his own words but very fast 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.120
 becomes clear between leg jumps one 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.590
 more than just a spark over the wedding 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.390
 is not particularly the problem 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.020
 but how could magath do her art 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.580
 Selling 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.560
 because as a woman to publish 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.180
 pretty much no converter is interested 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.709
 a little bit on the idea 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.270
 behind this art under his 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.040
 to publish the names after and 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.840
 according to very good marketing strategy 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.610
 to one worldwide will follow 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.560
 together boss both millions but that 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.269
 whole based on a big scam 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.980
 and how long can this scam still be 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.510
 endure because someday this is also 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.250
 before even that is in question 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.900
 asked and it crashes violently but 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.760
 with amy adams and christoph waltz im 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.739
 two counterparts with many scenes 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.450
 They found it really funny and funny 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.950
 some are so sad 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.300
 that's where the moments come in, especially when it's up 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.070
 The trial is easy 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.570
 incredibly awesome by christoph waltz 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.590
 are shown and that is such a 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.580
 history just as well 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.290
 probably most people 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.450
 Not at all know what this art 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.400
 deceiver pair actually existed 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.989
 and she still lives today and that is 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.610
 very nice to look at because it's easy 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.560
 thrilling whose mainly of 107 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.550
 minutes quite entertaining because 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.630
 just both figures so one 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.430
 incredible power in front of the camera 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.830
 radiate and still exist 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.600
 this slightly different factor 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.280
 a typical tim burton movie 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.140
 not in the animation area Stadtfeld like 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.239
 they roam the like big eyes can not so 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.799
 slightly fairy-tale slightly different though 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.420
 especially when it really crashes 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.100
 then also really angry and advice 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.840
 and there you have to say that enthusiasm 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.610
 strip is the one who dances out of the series 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.810
 Christa watt as well as should see 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.720
 look at him because he is back 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.260
 his typical zwiegespalten 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.940
 characteristic of him in front of the camera 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.100
 deliver and should mean that is 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.990
 definitely worth seeing 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.190
 if you do not have to see it in the cinema is one 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.330
 a bit questionable because he has no 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.920
 special now or or explosions 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.570
 or action you had on the 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.910
 Camera seen on the big screen 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.680
 must have and not very brilliant 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.880
 score you absolutely in dolby atmos 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.950
 one can have witnessed on blu 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.330
 ray and dvd then look later but like that 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.800
 or so the strip is worth seeing 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.450
 gets from me in his genre as 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.580
 biographical drama as well as overall 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.530
 seven and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.810
 and that makes me through my revier too big 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.310
 eyes from 23 april then in the 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.930
 German cinemas like to be a permanent one 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.760
 if you made this video leave it 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.440
 Stay light otherwise you know that 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.750
 there are still a few left and tomorrow 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.850
 15 clock, of course, at the latest, a new one 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.610
 video and until then I hope since 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.610
 tomorrow, of course, again on the 3rd
