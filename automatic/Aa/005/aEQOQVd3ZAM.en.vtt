on offense now the next spot has to do
with<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.580> ledge<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.150> there<00:01:12.630> are<00:01:12.689> two<00:01:12.780> ways

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900

it<00:01:14.400> from<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.610> plane<00:01:14.970> min<00:01:15.240> map<00:01:15.479> which<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.869> don't

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
it from the plane min map which I don't

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
it from the plane min map which I don't
really<00:01:16.170> suggest<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.710> know<00:01:16.799> you're<00:01:16.979> open<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
really suggest you know you're open to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.010 
really suggest you know you're open to
pretty<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:17.700> every<00:01:17.970> direction<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> do

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
pretty much every direction what I do

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.539 
pretty much every direction what I do
suggest<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.770> breaking<00:01:20.130> through<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> glass

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
suggest is breaking through the glass

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.340 
suggest is breaking through the glass
and<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:20.970> safely<00:01:21.270> running<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> now

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and just safely running to it now

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.899 
and just safely running to it now
everyone<00:01:22.680> knows<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> spot<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.790> what

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
everyone knows about the spot but what

people don't know is that there's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.719
