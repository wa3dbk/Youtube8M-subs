00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:14.960
 hello youtuber are hypercubes welcome 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.810
 in this new faq time Sunday 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.970
 the series where randomly some 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.610
 Sunday I ask you a question about 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.220
 fan page you can ask me questions you can 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.720
 tell me to do those stupid things you can do 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.190
 a little what you want to select 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.199
 a mix of fun and interesting things 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.480
 to talk about and I make this video 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.970
 Sunday show a little different than usual 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.940
 to vary the first question or better 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.309
 the first jet asks us that ruggiero that 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:46.030
 he tells me he calls alloys the hats of 90 and tell him 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.030
 that you are millions of him you can do 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.190
 not just from a station 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.960
 she did not used to see if 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.810
 really the best if the unsurpassed 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.090
 then matteo takes over with his second 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.120
 Manda tells us why we go up the stairs 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.370
 and we don't get past the elevators 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.050
 well matteo with this I show you that you have 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.170
 injustice 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.300
 ok matteo from now I'll show you how much 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.300
 you are wrong 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.360
 now giacomo said to come back a little 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.130
 in ignorance he asks us the same 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.409
 question he asked the other time 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.960
 this time I hadn't fished the 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.020
 let us catch who tells me if you touch your ear 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.610
 right hand with the right hand doing the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.610
 arm around the head 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:04.569
 I touched the dear Matthew asks us 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.479
 if you unlock on 24 second put some 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.970
 too fast and matteo definitely not 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.430
 everyone is yes and I agree with you 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.940
 example the attack boat worked 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.560
 fit that I will think unlocked all in 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.870
 an hour of pure boat play then 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.329
 this really too fast too 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.130
 certainly due to the fact that there are 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:26.079
 still balancing things to play 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.730
 it is not yet completely balanced 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.290
 and therefore for this reason there are some 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.000
 things in crisis advances a little too much 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.799
 quickly but don't worry between 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.049
 a few weeks will be obvious mail six 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.540
 already a market almost everything is now 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.400
 unlocked and so is the dear one 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.170
 friend Syria about a very question 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.480
 important in environmental terms because 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.420
 has seen videos on second assault e 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.140
 tells us what you think of the grass 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.990
 in 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.319
 in battlefield 4 because as you know there 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.370
 it is these fires that then widen 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.890
 we can set fire to operation 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.890
 meter is to create provincial ones that me 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.650
 do what you think of all the grass that goes 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.870
 burned nicolas I seriously think 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.550
 that for the dealers you have a nice one 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.290
 problem 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.209
 now our friend vincenzo asks me 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.920
 how come I decided to start the videos 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:18.430
 with youtube only rai for the team 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.290
 well vincenza there is no reason in reality 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.540
 you first start my youtube channel is 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.160
 broken I thought a lot better maybe one 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.000
 once we had even talked about one 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.440
 month was pure planning 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.450
 sense of what i wanted to do with that 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.400
 the imprint I wanted to give obviously 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.620
 taken to visit it to be the same as 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.080
 This is the tell us all her 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.870
 crying used 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.269
 ok but fine but I wanted to give a 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.890
 harness a little different style and me 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.290
 To be honest the military aid 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.330
 I follow very little followed in the states and 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.739
 am convinced that judo and banks 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.260
 be a bit like a show then 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.480
 have your own motives to have your own 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.739
 style a way of saying certain sentences words 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.590
 you lined up every now and then is 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.829
 fundamental the first ass impact from e 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.040
 with the greeting the initial second greeting 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.260
 me is a bit of a charm for myself 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.970
 I'm not one who registers so many 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.060
 commentaries broken apart a few 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.320
 tutorial in which I have to stop the technical figure 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.810
 break but at the end of the fair 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.880
 my initial greeting a bit of a charge 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.650
 to myself and then of course this 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.350
 it is transmitted in a charge towards you 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:30.180
 to keep watching the whole video 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.670
 so just think a little a 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.340
 kind due that he could do mine 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.260
 person has other people for 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.640
 gassing wins do not know why 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.260
 hunt for what the beginning of the videos is 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.900
 tommaso then the cad is really in the 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.210
 more absolute sadness and wonder but to 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.420
 for if a person is Mongolian it also goes 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.330
 fair is a hot air balloon today 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.040

 also a question of Marco telling me the 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.570
 my question, testing the wall
