warehouses<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.059> eventually<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.140> got<00:00:49.199> rid<00:00:49.559> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
warehouses and eventually I got rid of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.979 
warehouses and eventually I got rid of
the<00:00:49.769> screen<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.820> started<00:00:51.269> projecting<00:00:51.449> onto

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
the screen and I started projecting onto

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.889 
the screen and I started projecting onto
the<00:00:52.230> space<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:52.920> things<00:00:53.160> started<00:00:53.489> really

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
the space and then things started really

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.630 
the space and then things started really
evolving<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.109> I<00:00:55.350> realized<00:00:55.769> that<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.489> lot

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
evolving and I realized that it's a lot

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.479 
evolving and I realized that it's a lot
cooler<00:00:56.820> projecting<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.539> space<00:00:57.839> and<00:00:58.109> change<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
cooler projecting a space and change the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.610 
cooler projecting a space and change the
vibe<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> whole<00:01:00.120> space<00:01:00.420> versus<00:01:01.289> like<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
vibe of the whole space versus like a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.009 
vibe of the whole space versus like a
big<00:01:01.800> TV<00:01:02.120> you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.539> not<00:01:03.749> just

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
big TV you know it's a it's not just

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.299 
big TV you know it's a it's not just
what<00:01:04.199> we're<00:01:04.350> projecting<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.220> we're

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
what we're projecting is what we're

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.590 
what we're projecting is what we're
projecting<00:01:05.460> upon<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.360> relationship

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
projecting upon and that relationship

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.230 
projecting upon and that relationship
between<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.259> two<00:01:07.380> take<00:01:07.979> these<00:01:08.159> objects<00:01:09.090> or

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
between the two take these objects or

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.690 
between the two take these objects or
spaces<00:01:09.630> into<00:01:09.780> account<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> then<00:01:10.920> create

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
spaces into account and then create

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.960 
spaces into account and then create
something<00:01:11.970> based<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.750> object<00:01:13.340> today<00:01:14.340> i'm

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
school let's say the 60s we kind of

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.500 
school let's say the 60s we kind of
embrace<00:02:01.830> you<00:02:02.830> know<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.370> inconsistency<00:02:04.330> of

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
embrace you know the inconsistency of

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.530 
embrace you know the inconsistency of
handmade<00:02:05.440> but<00:02:06.400> within<00:02:06.610> a<00:02:06.820> certain<00:02:07.210> tolerance

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
handmade but within a certain tolerance

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.499 
handmade but within a certain tolerance
of<00:02:08.020> course<00:02:08.259> so<00:02:09.100> it<00:02:09.220> seems<00:02:09.460> like<00:02:09.729> Ricardo<00:02:10.119> deals

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
of course so it seems like Ricardo deals

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.240 
of course so it seems like Ricardo deals
more<00:02:10.810> with<00:02:10.869> form<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.680> deal<00:02:11.890> more<00:02:12.190> with

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
more with form and I deal more with

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.040 
more with form and I deal more with
function<00:02:12.910> so<00:02:13.210> it's<00:02:13.540> going<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.690> be<00:02:13.780> interesting

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
function so it's going to be interesting

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.320 
function so it's going to be interesting
to<00:02:14.350> see<00:02:14.530> what<00:02:14.740> we<00:02:14.890> can<00:02:15.160> kind<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.610> whip<00:02:15.820> up<00:02:16.060> and

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
to see what we can kind of whip up and

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.780 
to see what we can kind of whip up and
and<00:02:17.260> make<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.530> product<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.070> he<00:02:18.250> can<00:02:18.430> actually

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
and make a product that he can actually

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.330 
and make a product that he can actually
then<00:02:18.820> take<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.480> use<00:02:22.830> we're<00:02:23.830> going<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.010> do<00:02:24.160> some

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
then take and use we're going to do some

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.130 
then take and use we're going to do some
measurements<00:02:24.670> let's<00:02:25.510> say<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.110> a

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
measurements let's say this is a

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.250 
measurements let's say this is a
bird's-eye<00:02:26.770> view<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.310> your<00:02:27.700> bag<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.930> we<00:02:28.959> put

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
bird's-eye view of your bag so we put

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.560 
bird's-eye view of your bag so we put
the<00:02:29.410> laptop<00:02:29.650> here<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:30.670> maybe<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.330> MIDI

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
the laptop here and maybe the MIDI

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.530 
the laptop here and maybe the MIDI
should<00:02:31.870> go<00:02:32.050> here<00:02:32.410> so<00:02:33.220> what<00:02:33.370> am<00:02:33.459> I<00:02:33.580> in<00:02:34.120> cutting

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
should go here so what am I in cutting

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.640 
should go here so what am I in cutting
his<00:02:34.630> paper<00:02:34.840> we're<00:02:35.020> going<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> use<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.440> as<00:02:35.620> a

his paper we're going to use this as a

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.290 
his paper we're going to use this as a
template<00:02:36.070> we're<00:02:36.370> going<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.610> use<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:36.940> is<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
template we're going to use this is the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.910 
template we're going to use this is the
template<00:02:37.720> for<00:02:38.080> our<00:02:38.610> fabric<00:02:40.530> take<00:02:41.530> this<00:02:41.680> deal

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
template for our fabric take this deal

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.740
