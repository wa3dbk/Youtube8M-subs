more<00:01:42.119> specifically<00:01:42.689> it's<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.259> river<00:01:43.439> surfing

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040

oftentimes<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.210> surf<00:01:45.420> these<00:01:45.630> very<00:01:45.930> steep

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
oftentimes we surf these very steep

waves<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> river<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.820> bow<00:01:48.000> of

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
waves on the river and the bow of

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.359 
waves on the river and the bow of
typical<00:01:48.720> stand<00:01:48.960> up<00:01:49.110> board<00:01:49.259> was<00:01:49.770> kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.130> flat

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
typical stand up board was kind of flat

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.399 
typical stand up board was kind of flat
but<00:01:50.579> not<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> lot<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> rocker<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.990> it

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
but not a lot of rocker so with this it

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.289 
but not a lot of rocker so with this it
kicks<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> bow<00:01:53.009> up<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.759> bow<00:01:53.939> doesn't

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

like<00:01:56.950> with<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.280> board<00:01:57.549> and<00:01:58.030> you'll<00:01:58.149> see<00:01:58.359> this

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
like with the board and you'll see this

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.419 
like with the board and you'll see this
channel<00:01:59.259> all<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.710> way<00:01:59.799> down<00:02:00.009> almost<00:02:00.159> like<00:02:00.399> a

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
channel all the way down almost like a

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.310 
channel all the way down almost like a
spine<00:02:00.850> this<00:02:01.509> does<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.780> couple<00:02:02.049> of<00:02:02.140> things

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
spine this does a couple of things

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.630 
spine this does a couple of things
number<00:02:02.409> one<00:02:02.679> it<00:02:02.799> makes<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.070> look<00:02:03.189> pretty<00:02:03.219> cool

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
number one it makes it look pretty cool

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.819 
number one it makes it look pretty cool
but<00:02:03.789> also<00:02:03.969> it<00:02:04.600> gives<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.899> lot<00:02:05.079> of<00:02:05.259> structural<00:02:05.679> of

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
but also it gives a lot of structural of

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.460 
but also it gives a lot of structural of
integrity<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.670> rigidity<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.990> board<00:02:08.229> all

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
integrity and rigidity to the board all

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.169 
integrity and rigidity to the board all
the<00:02:08.649> way<00:02:08.739> throughout<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.069> length<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:10.030> has<00:02:10.149> a

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
the way throughout the length it has a

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.479 
the way throughout the length it has a
traditional<00:02:10.840> surfboard<00:02:11.440> shape<00:02:11.800> to<00:02:12.040> it<00:02:12.069> so<00:02:12.370> it

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
traditional surfboard shape to it so it

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.970 
traditional surfboard shape to it so it
looks<00:02:12.730> like<00:02:12.910> an<00:02:13.060> SUV<00:02:13.239> as<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.290> move<00:02:14.470> back

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
looks like an SUV as you move back

middle<00:02:59.560> handle<00:02:59.769> then<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.310> far<00:03:00.519> handle<00:03:00.910> and

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
middle handle then the far handle and

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.360 
middle handle then the far handle and
pull<00:03:01.540> yourself<00:03:01.660> up<00:03:02.139> on<00:03:02.290> top<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.769> this<00:03:02.889> almost

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
pull yourself up on top of this almost

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.340 
pull yourself up on top of this almost
like<00:03:03.639> you're<00:03:03.790> climbing<00:03:03.970> up<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.389> ladder<00:03:04.420> as

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
like you're climbing up the ladder as

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.800 
like you're climbing up the ladder as
you<00:03:05.500> move<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.859> the<00:03:05.950> back<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.730> tail<00:03:07.120> gets<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.600> lot

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
you move to the back the tail gets a lot

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.960 
you move to the back the tail gets a lot
narrower<00:03:08.079> your<00:03:08.950> reason<00:03:09.250> for<00:03:09.430> that<00:03:09.549> because<00:03:09.790> it

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
narrower your reason for that because it

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.640 
narrower your reason for that because it
makes<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.269> great<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:10.750> surfing<00:03:10.959> those<00:03:11.319> waves

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
makes it great for surfing those waves

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.860 
makes it great for surfing those waves
that<00:03:12.190> volume<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.940> see<00:03:13.180> up<00:03:13.299> on<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.510> front

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
that volume that you see up on the front

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.199 
that volume that you see up on the front
is<00:03:14.260> ideal<00:03:14.859> for<00:03:14.889> punching<00:03:15.519> through<00:03:15.700> waves<00:03:15.910> and

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
is ideal for punching through waves and

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.240 
is ideal for punching through waves and
holes<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.660> carrying<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.410> momentum

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
holes and carrying the momentum

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.460 
holes and carrying the momentum
downriver<00:03:18.700> but<00:03:19.269> from<00:03:19.480> here<00:03:19.690> back<00:03:19.959> it<00:03:20.200> narrows

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
downriver but from here back it narrows

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.800 
downriver but from here back it narrows
up<00:03:20.680> so<00:03:21.160> when<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.370> stand<00:03:21.730> on<00:03:21.880> the<00:03:22.030> stern<00:03:22.299> you

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
up so when you stand on the stern you

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.080 
up so when you stand on the stern you
can<00:03:22.989> surf<00:03:23.260> very<00:03:23.650> easily<00:03:23.920> you'll<00:03:24.519> also<00:03:24.670> notice

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
can surf very easily you'll also notice

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.240 
can surf very easily you'll also notice
a<00:03:25.329> lot<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.569> rocker<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.200> back<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.620> this<00:03:26.739> so

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
a lot of rocker in the back of this so

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.650 
a lot of rocker in the back of this so
that<00:03:27.430> when<00:03:27.549> you're<00:03:27.700> surfing<00:03:27.910> those<00:03:28.180> waves<00:03:28.450> you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
that when you're surfing those waves you

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.809 
that when you're surfing those waves you
can<00:03:28.750> stand<00:03:29.079> on<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.349> back<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.859> really<00:03:30.280> get<00:03:30.430> the

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
can stand on the back and really get the

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.970 
can stand on the back and really get the
bat<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.269> board<00:03:31.630> up<00:03:31.930> also<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.829> back

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
bat on the board up also in the back

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.069 
bat on the board up also in the back
another<00:03:33.459> additional<00:03:33.910> grab<00:03:34.090> handle<00:03:34.540> there's

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
another additional grab handle there's

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.710 
another additional grab handle there's
four<00:03:35.470> throughout<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.400> outer<00:03:36.880> radius<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:37.630> the

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
four throughout the outer radius of the

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.300 
four throughout the outer radius of the
board<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.139> then<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.319> one<00:03:38.530> in<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.709> middle<00:03:38.859> so

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
board and then the one in the middle so

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.550 
board and then the one in the middle so
there's<00:03:39.549> plenty<00:03:39.669> of<00:03:39.849> places<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.750> grab<00:03:40.959> on<00:03:41.230> in

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
there's plenty of places to grab on in

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.610 
there's plenty of places to grab on in
the<00:03:42.280> back<00:03:42.519> these<00:03:43.060> little<00:03:43.299> wings<00:03:43.599> here<00:03:43.989> allow

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
the back these little wings here allow

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.890 
the back these little wings here allow
painting<00:03:45.040> water<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.970> might<00:03:46.180> gather<00:03:46.450> here<00:03:46.870> on

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
painting water that might gather here on

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.569 
painting water that might gather here on
the<00:03:47.079> deck<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.950> run<00:03:48.160> off<00:03:48.310> easily

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
the deck of this to run off easily

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.460 
the deck of this to run off easily
because<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.090> don't<00:03:49.239> want<00:03:49.480> water<00:03:49.750> gathering

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
because you don't want water gathering

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.839 
because you don't want water gathering
as<00:03:50.919> you<00:03:51.069> look<00:03:51.280> at<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.669> bottom<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.239> board

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
as you look at the bottom of the board

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.699 
as you look at the bottom of the board
the<00:03:54.849> channel<00:03:55.299> bottom<00:03:55.630> which<00:03:56.049> gives<00:03:56.319> it<00:03:56.440> again

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
the channel bottom which gives it again

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.000 
the channel bottom which gives it again
more<00:03:57.280> structural<00:03:57.910> integrity<00:03:58.540> also<00:03:59.530> helps<00:03:59.859> in

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
more structural integrity also helps in

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.430 
more structural integrity also helps in
track<00:04:00.280> them<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.639> scupper<00:04:00.880> plugs<00:04:01.269> help<00:04:02.049> it<00:04:02.260> and

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
track them to scupper plugs help it and

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.080 
track them to scupper plugs help it and
that<00:04:02.650> gives<00:04:02.919> it<00:04:03.099> a<00:04:03.190> ton<00:04:03.489> of<00:04:03.730> structural<00:04:04.389> and

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
that gives it a ton of structural and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.119 
that gives it a ton of structural and
so<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.450> there's<00:04:05.659> really<00:04:05.959> no<00:04:06.290> flex<00:04:06.709> in<00:04:06.950> this

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
so that there's really no flex in this

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.649 
so that there's really no flex in this
I'm<00:04:07.580> going<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:07.760> show<00:04:07.819> you<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.150> in<00:04:08.390> just<00:04:08.420> a

with two pins pins themselves did you
take<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.350> post<00:04:18.590> look<00:04:18.859> a<00:04:19.130> rubber<00:04:19.729> kind<00:04:20.570> of

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
take the post look a rubber kind of

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.629 
take the post look a rubber kind of
flexible<00:04:21.260> so<00:04:21.440> that<00:04:21.560> you<00:04:21.680> can<00:04:21.859> bend<00:04:22.400> them<00:04:22.520> if

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
flexible so that you can bend them if

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.040 
flexible so that you can bend them if
they<00:04:22.760> take<00:04:22.970> hits<00:04:23.210> from<00:04:23.389> rocks<00:04:23.660> they're<00:04:23.900> not

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
they take hits from rocks they're not

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.219 
they take hits from rocks they're not
going<00:04:24.199> to<00:04:24.260> break<00:04:24.440> off<00:04:24.650> easily<00:04:25.150> go<00:04:26.150> in<00:04:26.479> two

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
going to break off easily go in two

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:28.930 
going to break off easily go in two
screws<00:04:27.590> into<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.979> recess<00:04:28.310> screw<00:04:28.550> fittings

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
screws into the recess screw fittings

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.300 
screws into the recess screw fittings
and<00:04:29.330> also<00:04:29.600> easily<00:04:30.020> come<00:04:30.229> out<00:04:30.410> if<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:30.949> paddle

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
and also easily come out if you paddle

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.370 
and also easily come out if you paddle
really<00:04:31.639> shallow<00:04:31.940> rivers<00:04:32.449> you<00:04:32.780> can<00:04:32.810> trim<00:04:33.229> these

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
really shallow rivers you can trim these

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.680 
really shallow rivers you can trim these
down<00:04:33.440> and<00:04:33.919> they're<00:04:34.370> quickly<00:04:34.669> replaceable<00:04:35.479> and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
down and they're quickly replaceable and

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.090 
down and they're quickly replaceable and
they're<00:04:36.050> ideal<00:04:36.410> for<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.680> river<00:04:36.889> environment

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
they're ideal for the river environment

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.520 
they're ideal for the river environment
and<00:04:37.910> now<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.270> are<00:04:38.510> going<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:38.750> hit<00:04:38.960> rocks<00:04:39.199> and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
and now you are going to hit rocks and

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.529
