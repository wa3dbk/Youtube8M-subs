00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:28.430
 hello, the regulator has the function 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.739
 adjust the pressure from the pump 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.840
 fuel to the injector nozzles 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.940
 it consists of a diaphragm and a 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.670
 spring that opens and closes in accordance with the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.660
 pressure in the fuel line 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.660
 depending on the injection system 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.629
 regulator may be located in the body 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:52.699
 butterfly on council ii module or 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:56.000
 the regulator of the consecration of the 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.859
 code and pressure to check with the 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.829
 engine running 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.210
 remove the hose from the wako notice that the 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.020
 pressure should be around 4.2 goes 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.020
 in this case the sloop 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.990
 still with the engine idling 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.659
 install the wako hose into the regulator 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:25.710
 note that the pressure is 0.5 ba at 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.710
 less that is around 3.7 bar 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.830
 replace the wako hose with a 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.659
 transparent hose with motor 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.909
 working idle 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.140
 check that the fuel passage 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.270
 by the way 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.030
 if this happens replace the regulator 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.550
 because the regulator in perfect condition does not 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.590
 allows this passage 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:54.429
 after the test reinstall the hose 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:57.280
 close the registration of one in the 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.380
 shoulder and disconnects the motor from falling 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.350
 pressure should be slow 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.390
 Failure to do so may be a 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.750
 pressure regulator seal and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.539
 protect nozzle nozzle increase 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.220
 the lack or lack of retention in the 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.100
 own fuel pump 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.200
 in this case we can do another test 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.200
 to identify where the problem is 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.250
 In this test we will install the 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.820
 pressure in the hose of the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.520
 gauge by turning the engine off and 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:37.330
 the record we noted that not the fall 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.970
 sudden pressure like this test 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.810
 we can say that the loss of pressure 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.550
 is in the fuel pump before 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.920
 purchase or install a power 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.160
 pressure of one foot
