00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.330
 Welcome to a university 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.980
 Circular I am one of 12,000 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.210
 student displays a lot but still 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.210
 for every club 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.680
 the uni circle field offers about 50 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.720
 different courses but the uni 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.410
 pay attention to this variety as well 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.990
 quality 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.520
 that means many of the fan tailors 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.520
 university rankings really good 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.940
 Actually I am still a student 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.110
 humboldt-gymnasium but still a student 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.430
 junior student I come from Yemen 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.800
 and improve my German language skills 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.010
 at the study college as preparation for 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.019
 my medicine the diversity of the people 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.940
 at the university greifswald is also 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.010
 the variety of international experiences 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.600
 the university promotes the worldwide 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.280
 exchange of students and 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.980
 for example, with scientists 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.910
 international study program 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.769
 university partnerships and projects 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.990
 Kreisweit is a small town but has 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.460
 for a great university and therefore you can 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.789
 here the students are strong in everyday life 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.789
 bring 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.980
 I study in Greifswald and work 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.920
 volunteer in the crate, the bed is 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.840
 one in five students in weisweil 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.470
 regular partys concerts in the cinema 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.360
 organize evenings I'm always very 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.770
 Impressed to experience how professors 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.690
 teachers and students together 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.280
 cultural highlights here in the city 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.560
 organize and belong to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.570
 for example, the bach week of the Nordic 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.950
 sound and the polish culture festival 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.660
 poland market and that are natural 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.790
 right signage meanwhile 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.990
 here in the region for art for the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.300
 manages the art treasures of 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.630
 this university has always been this university 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.850
 an aura was originally the room 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.850
 Furnished in 1750 as a baroque library 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.830
 the university library is one of 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.990
 oldest institutions of the country but 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.610
 one of the most modern of the stock comprises 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.610
 today about three million volumes 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.340
 I think it's good that the university 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.500
 circular on one side old 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.329
 private tradition and on the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.019
 other side your view into the future 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.019
 directed 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.290
 we have a brand new one recently 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.050
 get a building 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.360
 that means we have flexible laboratories for 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.310
 the experimental physicists and we in the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.720
 theory a high-quality technical 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.160
 equipment and by the many 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.990
 research funds our institute 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.300
 it is also for students 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:54.150
 relatively easy a doctoral position 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:57.270
 then I have one 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.440
 atmosphere that strengthens my studies 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.450
 and through that I also personally 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.700
 very green to red 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.050
 Studying a university Greifswald 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.570
 should also contribute to the development of 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.430
 personalities contribute to themselves 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.710
 acting responsibly and creatively 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.600
 in the old buildings of this rooney 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.790
 Of course, it is sometimes set back 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.160
 in a time in the student 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.670
 maybe it will become even today 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.670
 to see
