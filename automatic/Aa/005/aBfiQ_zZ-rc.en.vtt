00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
as you know this map it is fuel one of

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.760 
as you know this map it is fuel one of
the<00:01:24.180> five<00:01:24.600> maps<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.080> came<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the five maps that came with the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.399 
the five maps that came with the
resurgence<00:01:26.130> pack<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.780> resurgence<00:01:28.170> map<00:01:28.380> pack

resurgence pack the resurgence map pack

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.359 
resurgence pack the resurgence map pack
and<00:01:29.570> my<00:01:30.570> opinion<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.229> i<00:01:31.290> like<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> maps<00:01:32.070> I

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and my opinion on that i like the maps I

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
and my opinion on that i like the maps I
think<00:01:32.640> they're<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:32.970> fun<00:01:33.150> to<00:01:33.240> play<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.659> but

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
think they're really fun to play it but

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.780 
think they're really fun to play it but
I<00:01:34.950> think<00:01:35.100> they<00:01:35.310> could<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.549> used<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.759> little

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
I think they could have used a little

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
I think they could have used a little
more<00:01:36.030> thought<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> spawns<00:01:37.229> and

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
more thought in the spawns and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.760 
more thought in the spawns and
everything<00:01:38.720> because<00:01:39.720> i<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.500> playing<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
everything because i was playing a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.950 
everything because i was playing a
sanitized<00:01:41.400> match<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.329> was<00:01:42.450> spawn<00:01:42.689> killing

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
sanitized match and I was spawn killing

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.530 
sanitized match and I was spawn killing
them<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.350> spaz<00:01:43.710> 12<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.310> want<00:01:44.540> 7130

came out there's three new ones this one

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.410 
came out there's three new ones this one
fuel<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.650> largest<00:02:08.100> map<00:02:08.490> i'll<00:02:09.000> review

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
fuel this is the largest map i'll review

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.060 
fuel this is the largest map i'll review
your<00:02:09.570> surgeons<00:02:09.990> map<00:02:10.170> pack<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.710> pretty<00:02:10.950> much

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
your surgeons map pack it's pretty much

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.970 
your surgeons map pack it's pretty much
an<00:02:11.280> older<00:02:12.120> coiler<00:02:12.600> refinery<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.320> desert<00:02:13.740> oil

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
an older coiler refinery a desert oil

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.070 
an older coiler refinery a desert oil
refinery<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.060> guess<00:02:15.660> there's<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> war

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
refinery that I guess there's a war

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.630 
refinery that I guess there's a war
going<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.730> yeah<00:02:17.970> um<00:02:19.400> another<00:02:20.400> map
