like to talk about the next map in the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.389 
like to talk about the next map in the
setting<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.720> actually<00:00:31.199> advanced<00:00:31.710> warfare<00:00:31.859> or

sledgehammer games actually release the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.160 
sledgehammer games actually release the
names<00:00:35.070> for<00:00:35.430> every<00:00:35.640> single<00:00:36.090> deal<00:00:36.329> see<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.989> this

next<00:00:37.440> one<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> be<00:00:38.370> ascendance<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
next one is going to be ascendance so

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.389 
next one is going to be ascendance so
I'm<00:00:39.960> going<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.379> referring<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.980> map<00:00:41.219> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
I'm going to be referring this map to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.540 
I'm going to be referring this map to
the<00:00:41.489> ascendance<00:00:42.030> DLC<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> next<00:00:44.160> map

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the ascendance DLC so in the next map

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.090 
the ascendance DLC so in the next map
where<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.690> only<00:00:45.780> speculate<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.680> only<00:00:46.890> make

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
where we can only speculate we only make

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.490 
where we can only speculate we only make
theories<00:00:47.550> basically<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.780> i'm<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.260> going<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
theories basically but i'm just going to

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.049 
theories basically but i'm just going to
show<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.800> guys<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> clip<00:00:50.460> really<00:00:50.850> quick<00:00:51.030> then

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
show you guys a clip really quick then

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.420 
show you guys a clip really quick then
i'll<00:00:51.360> talk<00:00:51.570> about<00:00:51.600> my<00:00:52.350> theory<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> next

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
i'll talk about my theory for the next

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.540 
i'll talk about my theory for the next
map<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.969> what<00:00:54.149> we're<00:00:54.270> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.539> do

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.000 

so<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.880> was<00:01:03.060> a<00:01:03.090> clip<00:01:03.480> from<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> bonus<00:01:04.680> mode

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
so that was a clip from the bonus mode

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.560 
so that was a clip from the bonus mode
for<00:01:05.400> EXO<00:01:05.760> zombies<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.480> EXO<00:01:07.080> survival<00:01:08.300> my<00:01:09.300> voice

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
for EXO zombies in EXO survival my voice

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.170 
for EXO zombies in EXO survival my voice
got<00:01:09.900> I'll<00:01:10.050> crack<00:01:10.380> yo<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.680> sudden<00:01:11.160> but<00:01:11.760> basically

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
got I'll crack yo a sudden but basically

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.940 
got I'll crack yo a sudden but basically
if<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.420> were<00:01:12.510> paying<00:01:12.750> attention<00:01:12.900> enough<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
if you were paying attention enough and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800 
if you were paying attention enough and
you<00:01:14.040> saw<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.340> I'll<00:01:14.850> show<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.480> on<00:01:15.540> screen

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you saw that I'll show it on screen

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.920 
you saw that I'll show it on screen
again<00:01:16.820> that's<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.420> could<00:01:18.690> actually

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
again that's right so you could actually

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.890 
again that's right so you could actually
see<00:01:19.250> crosshairs<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.610> when<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> turns<00:01:21.570> black

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
see crosshairs on when it turns black

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.200 
see crosshairs on when it turns black
you<00:01:22.260> can<00:01:22.380> see<00:01:22.590> crosshairs<00:01:23.100> pop<00:01:23.310> up<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.670> if<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
you can see crosshairs pop up as if you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.600 
you can see crosshairs pop up as if you
were<00:01:24.300> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> play<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.890> next<00:01:26.070> mission<00:01:26.340> or

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
were going to play the next mission or

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.910 
were going to play the next mission or
you're<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.240> spawning<00:01:27.780> into<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> map<00:01:28.470> your

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you're like spawning into a map your

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.250 
you're like spawning into a map your
crosshairs<00:01:29.490> appear<00:01:29.910> so<00:01:30.300> this<00:01:30.540> leaves<00:01:30.840> me<00:01:31.020> to

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
crosshairs appear so this leaves me to

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.230 
crosshairs appear so this leaves me to
believe<00:01:31.410> that<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:32.100> were<00:01:32.160> going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.090> into

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
believe that they were going to go into

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.680 
believe that they were going to go into
the<00:01:33.450> direction<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:34.400> going<00:01:35.400> off<00:01:35.580> of<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
the direction of going off of what just

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.380 
the direction of going off of what just
ended<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.320> basically<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.460> starts<00:01:38.729> off<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
ended so basically it starts off the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
ended so basically it starts off the
next<00:01:39.630> map<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.979> helicopter<00:01:41.190> but<00:01:41.850> they

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
next map in a helicopter but they

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.000 
next map in a helicopter but they
changed<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.780> put<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.560> map<00:01:43.800> in

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
changed it up they put it on this map in

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.460 
changed it up they put it on this map in
the<00:01:44.040> facility<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:45.180> these<00:01:45.420> key<00:01:46.110> main

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
the facility with these key main

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.280 
the facility with these key main
characters<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.550> know<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.750> better

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
characters that we know like it better

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.820 
characters that we know like it better
famous<00:01:49.860> basically<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.470> assume<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.710> they

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
famous basically and I assume that they

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.760 
famous basically and I assume that they
did<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.220> for<00:01:53.670> one<00:01:54.270> reason<00:01:54.510> is<00:01:54.900> for<00:01:54.930> hype<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
did this for one reason is for hype and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.000 
did this for one reason is for hype and

what I believe might be in the future

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.180 
what I believe might be in the future
deals<00:02:51.750> he's<00:02:51.990> ahead<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.319> us<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.800> if<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.130> happens

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
