inches on top of the keel she's got a
she's<00:00:37.920> got<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> jig<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.290> help

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
she's got a jig that is going to help

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.560 
she's got a jig that is going to help
align<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.250> drill<00:00:41.520> bed<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:41.970> she<00:00:42.180> starts

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
align the drill bed as she starts

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.110 
align the drill bed as she starts
drilling<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.230> she'll<00:00:44.220> be<00:00:44.250> working<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.910> down

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
drilling it she'll be working it down

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.380 
drilling it she'll be working it down
through<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.720> dig<00:00:46.110> through<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.800> keel<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
through this dig through the keel and

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.630 
through this dig through the keel and
working<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> drill<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:49.020> up<00:00:49.470> and<00:00:49.770> down<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.460> it

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
working the drill bit up and down so it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.680 
working the drill bit up and down so it
releases<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.570> chips<00:00:52.760> going<00:00:53.760> very<00:00:54.090> slowly

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
releases the chips going very slowly

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.229 
releases the chips going very slowly
with<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.200> so<00:00:55.829> she<00:00:55.860> takes<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.760> bit<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
with it so she takes a little bit of a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.060 
with it so she takes a little bit of a
bite<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.930> feel<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.350> digging<00:00:58.559> into<00:00:58.860> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
bite you can feel it digging into the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.970 
bite you can feel it digging into the
wood<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.760> then<00:00:59.879> backs<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:00.629> out<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.770> there

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
wood and then backs it out so there

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.939 
wood and then backs it out so there
releases<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.850> excess<00:01:03.300> tips<00:01:03.709> so<00:01:04.709> she's

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
releases the excess tips so she's

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.949 
releases the excess tips so she's
working<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.429> up<00:01:05.759> and<00:01:05.969> down<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> if<00:01:06.539> she<00:01:06.719> feels

00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:06.959 
working it up and down and if she feels

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:09.859 
working it up and down and if she feels
resistance<00:01:07.920> there<00:01:08.189> she<00:01:08.520> works<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.149> back<00:01:09.569> out

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
resistance there she works it back out

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.879 
resistance there she works it back out
of<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.139> hole<00:01:10.350> clear<00:01:11.069> out<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.579> excess<00:01:12.030> chips

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:12.889 
of the hole clear out the excess chips

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:17.629 
of the hole clear out the excess chips
she<00:01:13.889> has<00:01:14.329> this<00:01:15.329> drill<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.200> she's<00:01:16.469> using<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.189> an

same ideas the little short bits just a

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.930 
same ideas the little short bits just a
lot<00:01:30.910> more<00:01:31.120> wood<00:01:31.360> to<00:01:31.390> go<00:01:31.630> through<00:01:31.960> in<00:01:32.110> this<00:01:32.260> case

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
lot more wood to go through in this case

lot more wood to go through in this case
hopefully<00:01:33.940> with<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.270> dig<00:01:34.810> she's<00:01:35.170> gonna<00:01:35.440> come

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
hopefully with that dig she's gonna come

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.740 
hopefully with that dig she's gonna come
out<00:01:35.890> right<00:01:36.130> dead<00:01:36.400> center<00:01:36.430> in<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.060> piece<00:01:37.420> that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
out right dead center in the piece that

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.780 
out right dead center in the piece that
she's<00:01:38.020> trying<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.740> drill<00:01:39.100> through<00:01:39.340> down<00:01:39.610> at

she's trying to drill through down at
the<00:01:39.880> bottom<00:01:40.270> would<00:01:40.540> be<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:40.780> real<00:01:41.020> shame<00:01:41.050> if<00:01:41.560> it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
the bottom would be a real shame if it

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.050 
the bottom would be a real shame if it
comes<00:01:41.920> through<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.340> side<00:01:42.580> of<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:42.850> floor

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.910 
counter bore on the bottom of that drill
bit<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:59.080> set<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.560> drill<00:01:59.800> into<00:02:00.310> reverse<00:02:00.700> and

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
bit and set the drill into reverse and

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.630 
bit and set the drill into reverse and
she'll<00:02:02.920> be<00:02:03.070> pulling<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:03.820> upwards<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:06.369> cut<00:02:06.610> a

countersink in the floor timber down
underneath<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.760> keel<00:02:10.650> and<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:11.980> think<00:02:12.220> they're

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
underneath the keel and I think they're

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.300 
underneath the keel and I think they're
done<00:02:13.180> drilling<00:02:13.570> that<00:02:13.900> hole<00:02:14.170> so<00:02:14.470> she's<00:02:15.130> gonna

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
done drilling that hole so she's gonna

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.000 
done drilling that hole so she's gonna
get<00:02:15.580> set<00:02:15.850> up<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:16.180> put<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.540> counterbore<00:02:17.080> on<00:02:17.380> for

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
from up above that's the reason we

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.900 
from up above that's the reason we
didn't<00:02:35.260> drill<00:02:35.560> from<00:02:35.769> below<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.220> begin<00:02:36.519> with

didn't drill from below to begin with
that<00:02:36.940> it's<00:02:37.390> very<00:02:37.600> hard<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:38.019> get<00:02:38.200> inside<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
that it's very hard to get inside of the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
inside of the set up to do the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.560 
inside of the set up to do the
countersink<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:42.250> now<00:02:42.519> she's<00:02:42.790> gonna<00:02:43.030> set<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.420> in

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
countersink so now she's gonna set it in

countersink so now she's gonna set it in
reverse<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.530> up<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.010> working<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.700> slowly

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
reverse it up and working it slowly

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.810 
reverse it up and working it slowly
again<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.050> clear<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.470> chips<00:02:47.739> until<00:02:48.400> she<00:02:48.700> gets

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
again to clear the chips until she gets

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.880 
again to clear the chips until she gets
to<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.150> proper<00:02:49.930> depth<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.440> Tim<00:02:50.739> will
