00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.549

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.820
 You can hear that maybe I could 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.670
 also express a hus for it 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.900

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.330
 I just wanted to stay here now 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.980
 on a simple way thank you for a 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.539
 Half a million subscribers really blatant 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.609
 when I am healthy 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.910

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.070

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.989
 very personal video is if you 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.160

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 short cut the only thing me 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.460
 personally disturbing is this 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.110
 rauscher in between these 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.130
 the cats are sometimes a bit loud 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.760
 just as a small warning but otherwise 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.380
 have fun with it 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.689

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.770
