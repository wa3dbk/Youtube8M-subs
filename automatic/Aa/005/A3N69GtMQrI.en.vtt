00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.279
 I am now at the company Hama and Deir remain on the subject 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.319
 I welcome digital receivers by my side 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.119
 charming but creates hello 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.630
 the company Hama stands for what is what they have to say today 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.029
 which does not unfold in the Monday round spectrum of 18 00 of me stop over 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.050
 the highlights from the field of consumer electronics mainly 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.000
 controlled from 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.400
 from here on the counter he wants it something at home in the living room in the house 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.540
 injured 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.670
 could be with the end user 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.140
 I've got a couple of times to have an ISE here 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.740
 Technician of the singer Klein from but mostly not what in the box 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.200
 that's the girls tables clinking 45 that in the end 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.480
 For netbooks where they can build a hard disk they can if the injured 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.140
 Pepe has Verdi Lahn 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.240
 dvb-t receivers are built they can show Andermatt 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.800
 can practically access the computer and then hurt her 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.340
 Videos Photos Play music at home wirelessly as 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.140
 the normal continue 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.370
 In front of Schrankl, I've been throwing insights onto the very small devices 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.190
 allowed and yes what a great deal namely the different good that BP 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.300
 and drove sp2 maybe you can just say what's the big one 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.030
 Difference is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.640
 yes with 4 2 doping stations in May the comparison and the USB 2 0 docking 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.090
 Station for hard drives 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.790
 and here in the USB 3 0 yes and now he could show the customer percent 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.040
 Again speed difference is when I have such a hard drive in the EMC today 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.990
 Demand integrated Class Chart and it on USB 2 0 when I'm so Biermann 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.720
 from the relatively narrow but eventually ProDictate threat situation 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.200
 today is so low 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.830
 So far the bike is going down in the cellar 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.900
 and the USB 2 0 it remains constant at about 200 megabytes per second 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.750
 this usb-3 0-standard it is still relatively new 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.840
 That's good for 5 Gigabit per second, that is of course still today 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.490
 Not to be maxed out if you have a new standard yet 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.020
 is exhausted but it is just Pechstein much faster than USB 2 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.340
 0 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.250
 very good and now I come to my personal highlight here 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.810
 If you would like to take a quick look at the camera with her, she has it 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.630
 very special with a tandem model attached to me 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.889
 betrayed before 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:17.680
 So what I have here are those barely giants of the seas Wheeler Knigge was the chamber 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.149
 on the outside of this so waterproof 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:22.609
 In the end it can be too 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.790
 if you configure it accordingly worldwide from any Amanda computer 

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:28.119
 access it 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.059
 and they already know sometimes we have a model though 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.949
 but what turns 63 degrees there is an app by Armor for free 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.799
 since they can even let the chamber turn remote controlled of the iPhone 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.149
 that is a tongue at the disaster camera at home a 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.169
 but I have not even considered home 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.010
 I see myself that the colleague van Ham Schabert 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.299
 In fact, this app on the iPhone who likes it 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.289
 they are therefore 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.289
 Beijing that it is true at his home what I right at your home 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.819
 I can swing her animal 360 degrees 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.339
 who knows what's happening on my doorstep and will be later 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:06.829
 reach back 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.969
 and if all of that is fine, that's it in a year's time 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.179
 taken as it were the current time important 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.179
 the White sensational Pala sound many thanks 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.839
 then let's go on, Mr. Schaber 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:21.879
 now 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.730
 maybe the electric bikes has to the picture frames to the digital ones 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.730
 about who have spoken at the very beginning 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.649
 Of course Miller wants to have a picture frame that's interesting 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:36.369
 certain reasons because these pictures here can not only digital 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:40.059
 Play pictures No you can see them here also directly after 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:44.239
 watching tv movies way is that right that would be more correct to me 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.789
 different models 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:49.629
 Body of the mother will lie what has to see so they can videos and music 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.459
 and track photos 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.859
 That is equipped with lithium ion battery finds operating time of 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.209
 three hours on a single charge 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.979
 and the bigger one will be amended ten point bankruptcy 16 to 9 format now 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:06.219
 even a dvb-t receiver not only disconnects the test device fits in one end 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.519
 So as a television receiver is suitable and they can because the device synonymous 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.009
 to connect to the TV 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.849
 Dawson cable carries on there it is quasi by dvb-t-receiver or the 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.049
 many players from Zimbo always like us 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.749
 combines several functions in one device 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:24.799
 this is the case, even so small device that is then do with it if you 

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:26.210
 in front of the picture frame 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.159
 Sangay Ganspe interesting story for me 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:32.339
 Euro if you give away Little Dream I should have my dad 

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:33.840
 Ask for a gift, for example 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.810
 then they get used to it someday and there comes the question one could 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.340
 also thinks the old photos from Malta and there on groups very practical 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.240
 that makes it because they work a lot with the normal scanner namely unfortunately 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.590
 like this 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.860
 BioMers wants to think about the foreship so many people are doing it 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.600
 Device to us was from the small photos connoisseurs of the measuring devices and 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.469
 digital picture frame can connect 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:57.009
 is stuck in one of the Bakom picture frame 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.870
 Knowing condoms in picture 1 and that connoisseurs keep track it is stupid 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.690
 in digital form in the language of the picture frame and then I can do that 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.789
 whole likes and takes five seconds to set a picture 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.469
 We do not do TerreStar 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.620
 30 o'clock are pictures of a crucial scanner first London 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.029
 if I put the carport man times reward computers 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.710
 i think i have more on this usb socket here 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.710
 great pictures come in the PC Modersohn 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:24.520
 from my now 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.379
 Photo at hand 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.240
 it's going to be this way 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.270
 so that moved in 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.080
 digitized 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.839
 and then transfer the data 

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:38.379
 and as soon as it's cool Lammchen puts on his data transfer for 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.309
 this next one would be decided 

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:43.169
 March is finished Schallenberger man out 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.009
 because the connection 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.689
 Holger Dahmen again put an un-report under me 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.029
 the photos have the year-old kid off 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.089
 Funkel was therefore in any case because we have to learn because I have nothing 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:55.559
 Computer can connect 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:58.999
 You have to look over the years of the SD card and give us the opportunity 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:01.999
 Hertha I can see here on the back of the Kemmers test 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.300
 the cartel hunters that then just put us there on the stick or 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.439
 the card with the two pictures 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.309
 That's the way we are 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:13.199
 that's what they talked about their father is because the target audience generally only on 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.779
 Cuts old people that is for young and old sat 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.779
 So I will and will not say so only for old people 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.909
 Sam saw that GC Rumpel Marder 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.590
 Although you can get a superhuman may be different as well 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:27.939
 if you think about what makes it work but you see that their number 

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:29.960
 One thing they cut out theirs 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.750
 and then maybe have to turn 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.330
 and here Tadic's 5 second work group the man is done the filou 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.699
 to complicate 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.029
 and at what price is that this product in general so the target is the 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:42.050
 Close you can leave out but before 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.919
 this baths office just then then television 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.169
 Böhler can market this model with dvb-t receiving laurel 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:52.460
 grab many of 179 euros 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.630
 that the guy there I want to say that in general is pretty good 79 what is 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:57.749
 thanks only here 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:01.279
 the Wars of Hama I thank you again in the thanks of Mr. Scharbert 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.579
 none
