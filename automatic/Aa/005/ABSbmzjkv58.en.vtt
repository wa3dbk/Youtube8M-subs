00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.660
 well these come to a new video 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.220
 good one and 33 x of jesule with 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.960
 favorites is a good bunch we have 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.330
 had enough news shortage not 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.490
 nothing interesting has come out nothing but 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.320
 if in the morro 3 earthquake rodeos we could 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.650
 say and little else that was not worth even the 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.300
 worth doing logically I have not left no 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.919
 I will leave the news logically and 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.720
 You know, it's not a topic that I'm passionate about 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.980
 and I like to always be in the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.659
 present and I like that the people who 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.939
 Follow me then I'm also at la la 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:29.079
 last we could say and I do not already 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.880
 I will not leave it far from it 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.460
 saying marketplace because because I know 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.020
 what do you like and how am I playing 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.670
 a lot and I'm recording a lot because 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.680
 because I'm having a good time these 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.050
 last days and one since after the 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.050
 e3 what is the storm because the 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.430
 calm down so that's what there is tomorrow 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.620
 your poor so there will be some 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.060
 news are very relative usually leave or 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.740
 do not usually leave according to how the 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.810
 today he has had a pretty 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.000
 interesting and interesting about 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.850
 battlefield heart lane and good 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.590
 basically since you already know all the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.540
 controversial with the game I go long 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.360
 long and hard on about all this 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.300
 because I know that a lot of people are interested 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.350
 the topic and good basically can be 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.880
 visceral games you know the 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.340
 developer of this new battlefield 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.290
 Well, he said that when this 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.300
 game then he will not have problems of 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.850
 vital stability as it happened with 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.500
 battlefield 4 basically because the base to 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.760
 they have it we could say and it's not going to 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.770
 spend this kind of thing 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.750
 that I suppose to cheer up people in 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.520
 some sense recently yesterday 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.870
 specifically I made a video I made a 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.880
 news about that battlefield hard line 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.270
 it was asked to be a battlefield dlc 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.540
 4 a petition was asking for it and I saw that 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.340
 we got to a point he saw it in 90 95 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.740
 percent of the people because he thought that 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.680
 yes it should be a butterfield dlc 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.780
 4 and do not spend 60 euros in this game 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.430
 because really, he does not have the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.010
 enough changes for it to be 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.170
 usually spend it just watch with many games 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.790
 continuistas not the best then with fifa 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.320
 they could also get a dlc 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.080
 directly instead of taking the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.490
 next delivery and all this we were 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.380
 talking a bit about all that too 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.630
 you were quite in agreement with the eyes 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.640
 continuists that really fuck 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.620
 with less budget because really what 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.290
 can I do that I know 20 30 euros then 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.480
 is looking to get a new edition 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.280
 we could say and that he does not leave you 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.620
 for 60 turkeys that may not be worth it 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.730
 and they have spent that fortune as 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.190
 to do so 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.900
 well there is a problem with this new 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.790
 battlefield toilet set there is no 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.519
 pretty big problem and it's abuse 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.940
 of the franchise perhaps one of the things 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:40.390
 that criticize people who usually follow 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.709
 battlefield because it was perhaps the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.080
 over-exploitation that the saga has 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.200
 of duty to leave one every year 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.550
 and many of them are now seeing that 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.140
 his favorite saga is also doing 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.750
 the same taking it out every year and over 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.520
 they are not satisfied with what 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.160
 is going out not with battlefield 4 then 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.390
 you have seen many people who have not 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.800
 enjoyed as battlefield 3 yo 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.120
 indeed I remember when he left matters 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.470
 filters when it was announced in fact that 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.170
 there was a lot of hype in fact many 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.450
 news 15 about battlefield 3 as the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.220
 people the pea a lot we're going 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.800
 centralism then combat the feel 4 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.540
 everything changed a lot or even the 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.150
 news you see good people in the 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.990
 city is the people went a little bit all 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.330
 then turning off and that was not known that 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.459
 it must be hard for the people who follow the 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.890
 saga battlefield or really you already know 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.410
 very little lately since the shooter is 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.640
 in fact the first person shooters 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.500
 I think that or they start to play games 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.410
 good in the first person that is going to go 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.140
 Fuck the fuck because we're 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.240
 we have lived an over flotation 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.280
 the last generation that in this I do not believe 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.410
 that happens exactly the same I see it very 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.990
 difficult and the most cutting-edge games do not 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.120
 I think they're going to be shooters in fact 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.380
 we are already seeing that the sandboxes are 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.550
 dominating to say it one way 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.900
 made the end of the generation the 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.220
 dominated grand theft auto 5 and 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.050
 surely games next time 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.360
 generation we may also see 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.470
 if there is a fairly large domain of 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.950
 done we've seen until mario kart or 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.569
 shock 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.879
 and that has a fairly large domain 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.680
 between the public and other ufc others 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.900
 many games that are not shooters in 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.800
 first person and they attract a lot to the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.180
 public 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.069
 as I say there is an over exploitation 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.180
 maybe from the name visceral games no 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.590
 I should have taken the name of 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.150
 battlefield perhaps should have done 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.040
 a new ip with different things 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.049
 really and do not take base of 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.060
 battlefield 4 does not quite notice that he 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.500
 has taken base although the subject is 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.330
 of policemen and thieves as there is no 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.400
 excessively large change and that's the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.590
 people are noticing it and they are 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.580
 commenting that I do not say that 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.990
 only watching the comments of the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.910
 videos that are uploaded about battle post 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.710
 line is the one that I am commenting on 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.200
 that I saw myself because of what the 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.440
 people and so on and I see videos from 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.630
 game and others and I do not know good opined almost 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.860
 almost like I did not say then that you 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.409
 he liked telf and logically that game 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.229
 I can like it, there's no doubt 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:55.229
 it's not that it's more content we could 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:58.199
 say many weapons like that yes but I 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:00.060
 that I know then one more game and have there 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.919
 to have fun and such do not have to 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.330
 wait several years to play but 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.159
 maybe what people expect is that if 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.930
 They are 34 years old, developing a 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:09.259
 good title that is worth it to be 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.000
 very different from the previous one and that 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:14.819
 they revolutionize as did battlefield 3 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.229
 at the time and now I do not know what 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:19.590
 will happen I do not know what's going on with these 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:21.960
 franchises and if little by little they leave 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.180
 loading or what will happen if 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.159
 they should take a big break or what 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.689
 it's going to happen I really do not know and it gives me 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.669
 quite a shame because one of the 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.860
 direct competitors of call of duty 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.550
 that really is a good competition 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.349
 between two sagas it is very good and 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:41.099
 we will see also here warfare fights 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:43.349
 yes yes the public sees that it does not 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.610
 convinces then we can have maybe two 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.800
 outputs of both battlefield and 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.029
 Decalogue is pretty disastrous we see 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.979
 to see what happens that can also 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:52.319
 be pretty flippant and with the third 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.490
 company or games and bring the whole part 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.720
 of the cake not someone 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.759
 suddenly I put the games on the 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.190
 table and deliver the shooter at first 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:04.819
 definitive person caught me and nothing else 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.819
 in the next video
