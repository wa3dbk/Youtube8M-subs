lay it where it covers all of it and
then<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:47.970> where<00:02:48.299> your<00:02:48.480> scotch<00:02:48.810> tape

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
then this is where your scotch tape

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.470

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
little bit of scotch tape and I'm going

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.940

just pull that off so simple and if
there's<00:03:52.510> any<00:03:52.690> threads<00:03:53.080> just<00:03:53.290> hanging<00:03:53.860> hanging

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
there's any threads just hanging hanging

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.670 
there's any threads just hanging hanging
out<00:03:54.610> just<00:03:54.910> go<00:03:55.060> ahead<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.420> clip<00:03:55.600> them<00:03:55.750> now<00:03:56.620> you

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
out just go ahead and clip them now you

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.990 
out just go ahead and clip them now you
can<00:03:56.950> see<00:03:58.710> that<00:03:59.710> one's<00:03:59.920> a<00:03:59.980> little<00:04:00.010> stubborn<00:04:00.490> you
