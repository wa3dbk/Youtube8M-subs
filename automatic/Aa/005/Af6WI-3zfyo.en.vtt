00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.490
 the cell 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.289
 here is a cell, come on, let's go 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.539
 observe it as if it were a city 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.039
 It has a membrane that protects it and 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.039
 forums that work like customs 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.010
 some enter as pedro for his house 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.110
 and others have to pay to enter 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.490
 because they carry products that are produced 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.490
 in the interior of the city 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.019
 also pay those that are very large and 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.019
 the membrane includes them 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.930
 Intruders also enter as 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.930
 bacteria 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.570
 but the cell has prepared a 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.869
 enzyme army so that 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.869
 destroy 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.140
 when the sun rises Mr. chloroplast 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.530
 begins to join water and carbon dioxide 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.170
 to produce glucose by joining the form 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.790
 starch or potatoes that lead to the central 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.790
 of supplies or vacuoles 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.790
 ah 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.680
 It also produces the oxygen that reaches the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.680
 cellular bank 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.990
 in the central of supplies are stored 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.900
 large protein molecules like the 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.500
 meat liquids like oil 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.120
 and carbohydrates like starch 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.670
 some of the large molecules are 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.110
 banalizÃ³ soma or municipal dining room and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.750
 others are processed in the cytoplasm 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.090
 but most will reach the bank or 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.090
 mitochondria to become smaller 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.760
 in the bank the molecules are transformed 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.760
 in water and carbon dioxide 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.209
 with the energy that comes off and with the 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.670
 presence of oxygen form coins 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.709
 cellular or atp and they are quickly 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.840
 distributed to all secretariats 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.520
 poking at cell phones so that 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.800
 perform their functions except the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.020
 chloroplast remembers that in the cell 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.010
 nobody works if they do not pay and the only 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.010
 currency is the atp 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.390
 in the nucleus and the DNA if they pay you can 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.450
 produce three types of children or father does not 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.320
 the messenger the transfer and the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.320
 ribosome theme 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.050
 transfer air collects 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.290
 amino acid cytoplasm and leads 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.290
 to the ribosome 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.200
 Y 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.040
 the ribosome unites them and the order in which 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.040
 they must join 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.080
 when the three hostages arrive at ribosome or 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.670
 Livestock secretariat form proteins 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.670
 and within some of them 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:55.730
 and above I am the said in the order of 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.050
 metabolic pathways responsible for the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.050
 function of each secretariat 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.880
 the soma is the place where the molecules 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.920
 larger ones are made medium so that 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.300
 can be distributed the meat is 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.300
 transforms into amino acids 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.780
 the oils in alcohols and fatty acids 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.229
 and the carbohydrates in monosaccharides 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:40.139
 we observe how some enzymes remove 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.139
 the excess of oxidants 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:51.819
 each city is distinguished from the others 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:54.069
 for what they produce in this one occurs 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:57.629
 oil for example red blood cells 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.629
 produce hemoglobin 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.939
 when the city has grown what 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:05.289
 enough reproduce first the 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:05.289
 core is divided in two 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.400
 and the trainings are responsible for distributing 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.810
 equitably the legs and that's how 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.810
 life generates more days 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.990
