that's<00:02:45.900> one<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.770> benefits<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.400> being

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
that's one of the benefits of it being

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.020 
that's one of the benefits of it being
like<00:02:48.890> lightly<00:02:49.890> smoked<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.490> that<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.850> get<00:02:51.000> a

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
like lightly smoked is that you get a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.450 
like lightly smoked is that you get a
chance<00:02:51.300> for<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.630> hops<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.590> very<00:02:52.830> flavors

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
chance for the hops and the very flavors

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.770 
chance for the hops and the very flavors
they're<00:02:53.640> coming<00:02:53.880> from<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.300> come<00:02:54.510> through

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
they're coming from that to come through

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.470 
they're coming from that to come through
it's<00:02:55.560> going<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.860> be<00:02:55.920> interesting<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.280> see<00:02:56.480> how

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
it's going to be interesting to see how

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.450 
it's going to be interesting to see how
the<00:02:57.990> commercial<00:02:58.440> batches<00:02:58.710> of<00:02:58.770> this<00:02:58.920> develop

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
the commercial batches of this develop

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.580 
the commercial batches of this develop
because<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.820> think<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.060> smokers<00:03:00.420> will<00:03:00.870> will

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
because I think the smokers will will

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.170 
because I think the smokers will will
raise<00:03:01.800> as<00:03:02.070> it<00:03:02.190> becomes<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.550> more<00:03:02.700> rounded<00:03:03.120> and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
raise as it becomes a more rounded and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.080 
raise as it becomes a more rounded and
bounce<00:03:03.420> beer<00:03:03.870> but<00:03:04.580> certainly<00:03:05.580> very<00:03:05.640> happy

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
bounce beer but certainly very happy

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.000 
bounce beer but certainly very happy
with<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:06.630> sort<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:06.870> breeze<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.470> maybe

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
with the this sort of breeze so maybe

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.710 
with the this sort of breeze so maybe
you<00:03:08.220> get<00:03:08.370> going<00:03:08.940> back<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.420> kind<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.660> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
you get going back to the kind of the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.330 
you get going back to the kind of the
historical<00:03:10.350> roots<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.740> beer<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.250> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
historical roots of this beer and the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.070 
historical roots of this beer and the
time<00:03:11.550> that<00:03:11.580> all<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.970> moat<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.720> molt<00:03:12.959> would

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
time that all the moat the molt would

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.480 
time that all the moat the molt would
have<00:03:13.170> been<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.410> smokes<00:03:13.680> they<00:03:14.280> would<00:03:14.400> have

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
have been the smokes they would have

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.340 
have been the smokes they would have
been<00:03:14.580> stored<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:14.850> oak<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.780> were<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.020> agent

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
been stored in oak so you were so agent

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.500 
been stored in oak so you were so agent
on<00:03:16.470> ok<00:03:17.300> get<00:03:18.300> that<00:03:18.410> again<00:03:19.430> without<00:03:20.430> as<00:03:21.090> we<00:03:21.270> smoke

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
on ok get that again without as we smoke

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.199 
on ok get that again without as we smoke
it<00:03:21.750> can<00:03:21.959> be<00:03:22.050> such<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.260> big<00:03:22.530> dominant<00:03:23.010> flavor<00:03:23.820> and

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
it can be such a big dominant flavor and

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.600 
it can be such a big dominant flavor and
aromas<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:24.959> really<00:03:25.440> tempered<00:03:25.950> they<00:03:26.400> just

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
aromas so it's really tempered they just

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.990 
aromas so it's really tempered they just
add<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> little<00:03:27.060> bit<00:03:28.070> like<00:03:29.070> vanilla<00:03:29.550> nation

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
maybe that's those are the chips that we

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.060 
maybe that's those are the chips that we
see<00:03:35.940> here<00:03:37.850> hope<00:03:38.850> chips<00:03:39.209> go<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.570> with<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.750> hot<00:03:40.070> pad
