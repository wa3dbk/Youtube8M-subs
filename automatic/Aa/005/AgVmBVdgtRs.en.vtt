hello<00:00:15.780> everybody<00:00:18.080> check<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.200> my<00:00:19.290> Stirling

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
hello everybody check out my Stirling

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.500 
hello everybody check out my Stirling
engine<00:00:19.920> here<00:00:20.130> what<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
engine here what this is this is a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.600 
engine here what this is this is a
little<00:00:21.990> kit<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.439> i<00:00:22.500> bought<00:00:22.650> from<00:00:22.860> contacts

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
little kit that i bought from contacts

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.050 
little kit that i bought from contacts
out<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.849> England<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.420> few<00:00:24.689> months<00:00:24.779> back<00:00:25.020> and<00:00:26.060> I'm

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
out in England a few months back and I'm

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.240 
out in England a few months back and I'm
very<00:00:27.810> very<00:00:28.110> intrigued<00:00:28.500> by<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.920> thing<00:00:29.130> is

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
very very intrigued by it this thing is

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.550 
very very intrigued by it this thing is
so<00:00:29.400> efficient<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.029> very<00:00:30.300> very<00:00:30.599> cool<00:00:30.810> what<00:00:31.439> this

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
so efficient is very very cool what this

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.680 
so efficient is very very cool what this
is<00:00:31.739> is<00:00:31.770> technically<00:00:32.369> an<00:00:32.640> external<00:00:33.239> combustion

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
is is technically an external combustion

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.630 
is is technically an external combustion
engine<00:00:34.079> because<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> heat<00:00:34.560> source<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
engine because the heat source is on the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.220 
engine because the heat source is on the
outside<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.360> engine<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.690> can<00:00:36.809> see<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> put

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
outside of the engine you can see I put

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410 
outside of the engine you can see I put
the<00:00:37.320> hot<00:00:37.470> water<00:00:37.680> into<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> cup<00:00:38.220> and<00:00:38.940> this

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the hot water into the cup and this

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.950 
the hot water into the cup and this
consists<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.730> two<00:00:41.730> Pistons<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.930> see

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
consists of two Pistons one you can see

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.660 
consists of two Pistons one you can see
the<00:00:43.140> big<00:00:43.290> styrofoam<00:00:43.800> piston<00:00:44.130> on<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> inside

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the big styrofoam piston on the inside

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.360 
the big styrofoam piston on the inside
and<00:00:44.910> then<00:00:45.540> you<00:00:45.630> can<00:00:45.780> see<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> little<00:00:46.370> heavy

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and then you can see a little heavy

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.690 
and then you can see a little heavy
metal<00:00:48.120> piston<00:00:48.330> in<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.530> little<00:00:49.770> chamber<00:00:49.980> now

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
metal piston in this little chamber now

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.160 
metal piston in this little chamber now
I'm<00:00:50.850> sure<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.270> those<00:00:51.390> two<00:00:51.600> are<00:00:51.630> balanced

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
I'm sure that those two are balanced

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.960 
I'm sure that those two are balanced
about<00:00:52.380> the<00:00:52.860> same<00:00:53.070> weight<00:00:53.310> as<00:00:53.580> suppose<00:00:53.790> when<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
about the same weight as suppose when I

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.460 
about the same weight as suppose when I
took<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.240> apart<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.600> could<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.900> could<00:00:54.990> tell<00:00:55.350> that

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
took it apart I could I could tell that

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.110 
took it apart I could I could tell that
for<00:00:55.650> sure<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.980> then<00:00:56.400> you'll<00:00:56.550> also<00:00:56.730> notice<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
for sure and then you'll also notice the

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.380 
for sure and then you'll also notice the
flywheel<00:00:57.630> now<00:00:58.460> this<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.520> technically<00:01:00.030> engine

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
flywheel now this is technically engine

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.450 
flywheel now this is technically engine
which<00:01:00.540> literally<00:01:00.840> has<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> warm<00:01:01.470> up<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.860> you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
which literally has to warm up as you

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.100 
which literally has to warm up as you
can<00:01:02.579> see<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.420> hasn't<00:01:03.720> actually<00:01:03.840> started

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
can see it hasn't actually started

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.749 
can see it hasn't actually started
moving<00:01:04.619> yet<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.829> put<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.100> hot<00:01:05.250> water<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.640> there

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
moving yet I put the hot water in there

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.910 
moving yet I put the hot water in there
and<00:01:05.909> I've<00:01:05.970> waited<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:07.320> we're<00:01:07.439> waiting<00:01:07.740> we're

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
and I've waited and we're waiting we're

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.109 
and I've waited and we're waiting we're
waiting<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.520> turn<00:01:08.670> over<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.970> little

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
waiting for this to turn over a little

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.690 
waiting for this to turn over a little
bit<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:10.320> let's<00:01:10.860> wait<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.040> little<00:01:11.100> bit<00:01:11.340> more<00:01:11.549> if

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
bit and let's wait a little bit more if

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.389 
bit and let's wait a little bit more if
I<00:01:11.880> may<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.270> give<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.509> little<00:01:12.630> touch<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.979> get

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
I may just give it a little touch to get

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.569 
I may just give it a little touch to get
it<00:01:14.490> started<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:17.100> know<00:01:17.189> we<00:01:17.340> start

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
it started if if you know we start

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:20.120 
it started if if you know we start
waiting<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.180> little<00:01:18.300> bit<00:01:18.420> too<00:01:18.600> long<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.130> but

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
waiting a little bit too long here but

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.710 
waiting a little bit too long here but
I've<00:01:20.250> actually<00:01:20.280> let's<00:01:21.030> try<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:23.720> maybe

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
I've actually let's try that here maybe

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.920 
I've actually let's try that here maybe
now<00:01:25.070> just<00:01:26.070> give<00:01:26.190> a<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.310> touch<00:01:26.760> once<00:01:27.030> again

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.140 

not<00:01:30.920> even<00:01:31.040> doing<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.370> full<00:01:31.550> revolution<00:01:31.700> on<00:01:32.120> the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
not even doing a full revolution on the

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:41.080 
not even doing a full revolution on the
flywheel<00:01:32.420> yet<00:01:36.910> there<00:01:37.910> we<00:01:38.090> go<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.970> I've

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
flywheel yet there we go so I've

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.830 
flywheel yet there we go so I've
actually<00:01:42.790> put<00:01:43.790> hot<00:01:43.940> water<00:01:43.970> in<00:01:44.240> here<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.570> I've

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
actually put hot water in here and I've

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.870 
actually put hot water in here and I've
put<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.590> in<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.800> cup<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.190> I<00:01:46.220> put<00:01:46.250> this<00:01:46.490> on<00:01:46.640> top

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
put it in the cup and I put this on top

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.200 
put it in the cup and I put this on top
and<00:01:47.090> it's<00:01:47.720> actually<00:01:48.520> has<00:01:49.520> gone<00:01:49.729> I<00:01:49.760> kid<00:01:50.090> you<00:01:50.119> not

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
and it's actually has gone I kid you not

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.900 
and it's actually has gone I kid you not
for<00:01:50.930> about<00:01:51.080> three<00:01:51.350> hours<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.830> I<00:01:52.520> thought<00:01:52.700> wow

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
for about three hours and I thought wow

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.620 
for about three hours and I thought wow
that's<00:01:53.600> really<00:01:53.810> good<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:55.220> then<00:01:55.670> after<00:01:55.970> I<00:01:56.000> did

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
that's really good and then after I did

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.810 
that's really good and then after I did
that<00:01:56.660> what<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:57.050> did<00:01:57.170> was<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:58.100> I<00:01:58.130> poured<00:01:58.700> out

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
that what I did was that I poured out

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.889 
that what I did was that I poured out
the<00:01:58.940> hot<00:01:59.090> water<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.570> then<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.560> took<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:01.040> cup<00:02:01.430> of

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
the hot water and then I took a cup of

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.310 
the hot water and then I took a cup of
ice<00:02:02.899> water<00:02:03.170> like<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.860> can<00:02:04.040> see<00:02:04.220> here<00:02:04.610> i<00:02:05.320> put

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
ice water like you can see here i put

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.080 
ice water like you can see here i put
the<00:02:06.500> Stirling<00:02:07.280> engine<00:02:07.340> on<00:02:07.580> top<00:02:07.790> of<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:07.970> ice

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
the Stirling engine on top of the ice

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.270 
the Stirling engine on top of the ice
water<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.570> then<00:02:09.320> what<00:02:09.470> happened<00:02:09.860> was<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.040> in

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
water and then what happened was that in

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.590 
water and then what happened was that in
fact<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:12.610> engine<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.760> then<00:02:14.180> went<00:02:14.390> again

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
fact the the engine and then went again

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.020 
fact the the engine and then went again
as<00:02:14.810> well<00:02:15.470> for<00:02:15.830> about<00:02:16.070> another<00:02:16.160> three<00:02:16.610> hours<00:02:16.880> so

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
as well for about another three hours so

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.000 
as well for about another three hours so
it's<00:02:17.180> amazing<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:18.110> amount<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.470> energy<00:02:18.560> that's

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
it's amazing the amount of energy that's

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.610 
it's amazing the amount of energy that's
actually<00:02:19.459> in<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:20.330> cup<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.540> water<00:02:20.690> when<00:02:21.560> you

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
actually in just a cup of water when you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.680 
actually in just a cup of water when you
think<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.040> now<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.330> little<00:02:23.570> too

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
think of it now this is a little too

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.300 
think of it now this is a little too
weak<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.020> do<00:02:24.110> any<00:02:24.260> real<00:02:24.470> work<00:02:24.500> although<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.220> is

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
weak to do any real work although it is

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.880 
weak to do any real work although it is
certainly<00:02:25.580> turning<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.970> flywheel<00:02:26.330> rum<00:02:26.890> but

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
certainly turning the flywheel rum but

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.010 
certainly turning the flywheel rum but
what<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.220> have<00:02:28.459> heard<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.880> Dean<00:02:29.090> come<00:02:29.330> in<00:02:29.480> who

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
is the same guy who has made the this

is the same guy who has made the this
segue<00:02:35.180> has<00:02:35.570> actually<00:02:35.989> no<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.380> now<00:02:36.530> working<00:02:36.739> on

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
segue has actually no is now working on

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.060 
segue has actually no is now working on
a<00:02:36.980> Stirling<00:02:37.400> engine<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:38.269> will<00:02:38.680> be<00:02:39.680> used<00:02:39.890> in

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
a Stirling engine that will be used in

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.150 
a Stirling engine that will be used in
in<00:02:40.340> hybrid<00:02:40.820> cars<00:02:41.110> so<00:02:42.110> very<00:02:42.500> very<00:02:42.620> cool<00:02:42.950> look

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
in hybrid cars so very very cool look

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.440 
in hybrid cars so very very cool look
how<00:02:43.250> fast<00:02:43.459> that's<00:02:43.670> going<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:44.150> going<00:02:44.360> at

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
how fast that's going it's going at

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.080 
how fast that's going it's going at
about<00:02:45.100> 120<00:02:46.100> or<00:02:46.220> PMI<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.700> expect<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:48.850> do<00:02:49.850> take<00:02:50.060> a

about 120 or PMI I expect and do take a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
somewhere between 80 and a hundred

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.979 
somewhere between 80 and a hundred
dollars<00:02:59.620> for<00:02:59.890> it<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.209> it's<00:03:01.209> very<00:03:01.569> very<00:03:01.780> cool
