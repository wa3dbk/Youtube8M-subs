00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.620
 8 This is a new type of puerta 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.669
 I know both .5 grams of rice and 4 grams of thanks. 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:15.799
 Inexorably 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.599
 Before tickling 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.890
 I say my career 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.789
 Like the petals of 8 cherry blossoms 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.279
 I got out and got out 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.660
 Aston is a masterpiece, of course this is bright but silent 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.349
 Even if 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.349
 I'm planning that 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.800
 eh 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.690
 Always in the process with one 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.040
 Northern Europe 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.480
 It was a crime but English 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.980
 PASMO intention 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.819
 Even in Japan 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.819
 I can see the competition 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.280
 In front of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.180
 On the contrary 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.930
 Well saga7 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.610
 Another exciting set of thickness is coming again 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.900
 It happens 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.910
 As for how to use that already 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.110
 Ordinary slow 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.440
 It's too early to get 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.670
 It's too big 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.790
 f 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.680
 Curtains more slowly than ordinary people 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.380
 It is full of things 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.620
 It is this speed so close to Shomei Osamu to the right 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.420
 At a private airport 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.760
 that 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.120
 I think it will take about a group a day if you see it 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.690
 but 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.130
 Eco After all, it is Kyoto newspaper of the way lol 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.340
 At that time this 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.080
 The painter of the artificial hand after being smashed 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.080
 Very strong 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.610
 I can see the destination ahead of Konan 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.380
 It's so fun 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.890
 As for how to use Rena, it is a good screen of Masakura 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.250
 In some cases, I'll try to get there until I wintered once 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.090
 It may be an opportunity like coming from there 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 I think 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.049
 Even when I eat that Anaheim 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.859
 I saw it 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.609
 Like this 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.509
 Please try using it by all means
