00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.000
 goal of young orange is clear 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.740
 placement for the ek in 2015 with a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.389
 very fast victory over georgia put the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.370
 plow a clear step 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.020
 Head Rome were for Luc Castaignos and 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.060
 goalkeeper when to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.980
 Monday or the young orange in Deventer 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.869
 say to Austria already won 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.060
 it sounds like a very simple about 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.480
 union button with it was not this time 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.040
 yes it is very good and very difficult 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.360
 especially the first half and actually 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.770
 for the score by still 2 0 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.540
 one drawback is that it would be for even 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.710
 harder is there still bank as he was 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.629
 actually from the red card that they 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.309
 it was own fit and played 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.510
 game but it was very economical to push 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.980
 again the team slept with a lot 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.989
 through 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.300
 soon a job comes deep and not 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.980
 in order to come in one must say something 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.870
 mike mike van loon also just good 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.149
 with that value duo make only one side 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.340
 on luck went i caught him and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.229
 therefore it remained a 0 and actually 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.090
 five minutes thereafter 1 minute before rest 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.860
 neither Michael nor the second one have it 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.409
 at least we had a safe wash for you 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 The residue was now just a question you 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.799
 ice hockey name you say what draw legs 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.920
 have to make what some make for a competition 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.820
 against Austria was just a critical one 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.240
 driven from Tony 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.909
 So 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.920
 an earlier tone not a hard knee yes 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.229
 he has a hard cut just by the 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.979
 domain actually to the 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.750
 he is small already quite strong you may 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.729
 three goals against junior orgies 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.670
 seems great for the rush yes they 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.390
 I was always good for rush hour and me 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.250
 was important for the team and that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.420
 gives a good feeling 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.759
 some images have appeared on youtube 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.460
 of a certain goal point tells of 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:52.360
 its place there were a roll of 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.149
 visually and with exterior 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.319
 facade but I am not so good at it 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.490
 Which 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.350
 yes i'm my side then he goes again 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.209
 out 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.000
 you can also say because purse washing yes 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.500
 can also say we then lie on it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.850
 none in the four games 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.440
 tiles on the hooves 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.019
 be the goalkeeper hope against austria 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.430
 maintain quincy 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.980
 the striker does it because goal and me 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.200
 I do it to prevent us from being there 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.120
 now against that is yes see service of 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.769
 mine but also from the whole team 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.269
 but yes there I was I was happy with it 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.510
 we actually need that for as long as possible 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.510
 or so
