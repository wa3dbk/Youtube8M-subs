00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.349 
hundred percent pure cherry puree and
second<00:02:15.260> for<00:02:15.350> midday<00:02:15.620> in<00:02:16.359> secondary

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
second for midday in secondary

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.120 
second for midday in secondary
fermentation<00:02:17.720> and<00:02:18.200> then<00:02:18.380> aged<00:02:18.590> in<00:02:18.799> red<00:02:18.950> wine

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
fermentation and then aged in red wine

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.729 
fermentation and then aged in red wine
barrels<00:02:19.519> with<00:02:20.000> champagne<00:02:20.630> yeast<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.560> that's

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
barrels with champagne yeast and that's

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.550 
barrels with champagne yeast and that's
why<00:02:22.070> it<00:02:22.280> gets<00:02:22.430> up<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.850> 10.7<00:02:23.630> percent<00:02:23.989> so

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
why it gets up to that 10.7 percent so

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.309 
why it gets up to that 10.7 percent so
how<00:02:25.190> r<00:02:25.610> ments<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.330> sugar<00:02:26.599> out<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.019> chair

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
how r ments the sugar out of the chair

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.110 
how r ments the sugar out of the chair
right<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.280> hops<00:02:28.489> in<00:02:28.760> there<00:02:28.940> are

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
right so the hops in there are

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.120 
right so the hops in there are
preeminence

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
preeminence

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.480 
preeminence
set<00:02:30.610> nang<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.150> saws<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.930> 10.7<00:02:32.860> percent<00:02:33.190> so

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
set nang and saws and 10.7 percent so

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.630 
set nang and saws and 10.7 percent so
that's<00:02:34.330> about<00:02:34.720> as<00:02:34.930> much<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.230> get<00:02:35.920> into<00:02:36.190> on<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.460> so

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
that's about as much I get into on it so

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.270 
that's about as much I get into on it so
adding<00:02:37.060> fruit<00:02:37.390> like<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.900> really<00:02:38.710> ramped<00:02:39.160> up

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
adding fruit like that really ramped up

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.880 
adding fruit like that really ramped up
the<00:02:39.660> ABV<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:41.080> very<00:02:41.260> interesting<00:02:41.770> to

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
the ABV and it's very interesting to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.400 
the ABV and it's very interesting to
note<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.370> they<00:02:43.360> added<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.750> fruit<00:02:43.930> yeah<00:02:44.140> it's

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
note that they added the fruit yeah it's

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.200 
note that they added the fruit yeah it's
going<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.590> ramp<00:02:44.740> up<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.010> APB<00:02:45.400> abv<00:02:45.970> a<00:02:46.000> little

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
going to ramp up the APB abv a little

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.850 
going to ramp up the APB abv a little
bit<00:02:46.300> but<00:02:46.360> it's<00:02:46.510> also<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.810> champagne<00:02:47.230> yeast<00:02:47.440> so

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
bit but it's also the champagne yeast so

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.490 
bit but it's also the champagne yeast so
any<00:02:48.190> residual<00:02:48.850> sugars<00:02:49.210> that<00:02:49.360> are<00:02:49.390> left<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:50.020> the

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
any residual sugars that are left in the

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.220 
any residual sugars that are left in the
beer<00:02:51.100> itself<00:02:51.280> going<00:02:51.940> into<00:02:52.240> after<00:02:52.990> primary

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
beer itself going into after primary

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.230 
beer itself going into after primary
fermentation<00:02:53.700> champagne<00:02:54.700> yeast<00:02:54.880> is<00:02:55.120> an

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
fermentation champagne yeast is an

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.090 
fermentation champagne yeast is an
extremely<00:02:56.170> high<00:02:56.970> attenuating<00:02:57.970> ease<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:59.100> one

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
extremely high attenuating ease and one

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.040 
extremely high attenuating ease and one
that<00:03:00.310> out<00:03:00.490> one<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.150> cool<00:03:01.420> things<00:03:01.450> about<00:03:01.840> it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
that out one of the cool things about it

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.080 
that out one of the cool things about it
since<00:03:02.170> are<00:03:02.320> using<00:03:02.560> fruit<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.160> they're<00:03:03.850> using

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
since are using fruit and they're using

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.760 
since are using fruit and they're using
wine<00:03:04.300> barrels<00:03:04.720> they<00:03:04.960> actually<00:03:05.290> use<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.530> wine

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
wine barrels they actually use the wine

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.690 
wine barrels they actually use the wine
yeast<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.430> finish<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.820> off<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.600> that's<00:03:08.080> really

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
yeast to finish it off so that's really

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.860 
yeast to finish it off so that's really
going<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.760> add<00:03:09.910> some<00:03:09.940> interesting<00:03:10.390> quality<00:03:10.720> so

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
going to add some interesting quality so

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.920 
going to add some interesting quality so
