00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hi all 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:09.680
 how do I prepare the vegetable soup and 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.730
 vegetable first of all I will use 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.730
 this mix of legumes 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:22.119
 legumes mix here there are peas 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.320
 by other blacks by others colored by 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.420
 other white rice 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.060
 what else 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.360
 Texas 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.060
 flax seeds 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.440
 well I will use this mix base of 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:43.240
 250 milliliters and use say 200 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.300
 milliliters and you can say that mix 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.060
 of legumes 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:54.090
 and I left it to soak all night 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:58.170
 then you have to rinse it under water 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 increases its almost double size 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.619
 here I have two liters of boiling water 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.140
 then the water if we need more water 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.540
 we're going to water it and first of all what 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.190
 what you have to do is add 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:18.480
 the legumes to the water 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:22.140
 once it boils we lower the fire and 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.080
 we let it cook for about 40 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.080
 minutes there you also have to add salt 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.080
 now I pretty much use sea salt 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.700
 meanwhile on a pan oil 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.700
 olive 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.869
 pretty oil 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.590
 and first of all I'm going to try one 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.979
 onion cut into cubes and a half 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.979
 morrón 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.860
 that we see each other so that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.360
 the onion and the morrón are not people 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.040
 now that the onion is a little golden 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.810
 we add carrot here I have 2 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.650
 medium carrots 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.650
 strokes 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.270
 and let it cook for 34 minutes 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.270
 more and we turn off the floor 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.740
 they spent 40 minutes or 45 or so 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.180
 notice that the beans have to be 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.349
 cooked 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.540
 they are already cooked so at this moment 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:57.689
 you can 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.689
 add the carrot onion and morrón 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.200
 a large potato cut into cubes 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.590
 to 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.010
 Then I have a pumpkin and a couple of leaves 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.010
 of laurel 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.670
 black pepper in grains 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.420
 we mix 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.209
 you can add more liquid if you want 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:50.380
 that the soup is more liquid or leave it 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:53.470
 so that 's at ease and now we're going to leave 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.040
 that the potato cook more than anything and the 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.040
 pumpkin 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:05.100
 well the potato and the pumpkin are already 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.790
 cooked finally I will add 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.870
 let's dry parsley and garlic forget me to 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.870
 buy parsley today 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.100
 cool so good let's use 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.900
 dry parsley 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:25.350
 and in two or three minutes I'm going to turn off the 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.500
 fire the soup will be ready 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:33.240
 this soup is very nutritious very aromatic 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.520
 Vegetarian easy to perform as you see 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.470
 so 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.080
 I hope you like the recipe that 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.390

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.670
