00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.589
 the third mission room level in the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.480
 the success of premature evacuations 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.189
 Then when we get all the buildings 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.780
 destroy a league before a current one 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.940
 Arrives is the first one 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.549
 more demanding task in the campaign 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.929
 The first thing that should be done on your brutstÃ¤tte 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.270
 Income and defense vote 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.500
 The league is constantly attacking and that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.449
 even if you have the production buildings 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.279
 he had long since destroyed it 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.050
 first the two sting and spurs 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.300
 crawl out and plant them tightly 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.460
 Your brutality should be more crawlers 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.960
 necessarily follow so far about eight 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 season crawler and two to three 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.340
 Traces crawlers have the 15 minutes in the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.590
 game time should be enough around 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.940
 to create a big army while 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.559
 you do that, you have to 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.180
 should you ever been with the kerrigan 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.309
 tear down the surrounding bunker and yours 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.629
 defend base shoots one 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.980
 kinetic wave on a terraner 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.309
 bunker and leave this just left 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.620
 lie 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.629
 now for the armed forces construction too early 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.940
 cozy westin gas and builds 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.710
 a second breeding place 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.239
 why should one ask now there is 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.910
 neither bertling in this mission nor 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.350
 need blade westin gas the 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.610
 But the main reasons for this mission are 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.830
 nothing sound but the brut 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.100
 you need her queen if possible 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.560
 many of the advantages are obvious 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.540
 The league has many heroes 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.040
 Area damage causes the best 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.940
 friend of the area damage are many 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.759
 small units 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.350
 who once sounded 60 c within 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.780
 Ten seconds has understood the meaning 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.250
 what I mean and hold the queen 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.690
 not only more out of them, you also have one 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.580
 can attack air units fan 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.259
 attack and what maybe that 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.420
 Most important is you can cure 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.429
 once you have 10 queen you will 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.990
 Enough energy in this 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.090
 hardly a single entity except the 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.440
 zerg die away longer 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.330
 prerequisite for this is that they are the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.070
 army always with a and left clicks through 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.660
 the area otherwise sends the heal 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.789
 Queen only when she stops 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.410
 Therefore, start immediately with the 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.750
 production of the queen and that 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.189
 Constant from two breeding sites you have 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.140
 you can do superfluous minerals 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.020
 parallel larvae have been sounded 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.119
 I recommend about 6 for the beginning 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.130
 until 10 c sound but do not forget 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.810
 The crawlers have so much time 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.369
 lost if you are a front side and 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.560
 running back need the basis of the 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.729
 to save attacks 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.619
 you can deal with the attack time 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.200
 leave until about nine to ten 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.450
 minutes are left whether you are in the north or 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.010
 in the beginning, it does not matter what matters 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.019
 before the bunker with kerrigan cracked 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.970
 also the hidden in the south as in the 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.410
 Do not forget to watch video and see her 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.660
 produces and quit industriously 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.450
 fades after sets the waypoint of 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.040
 best spawned directly on kerrigan 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.510
 beware, but the units are on it 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.549
 set to follow kerrigan 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.170
 you have to arrive new units 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.660
 therefore manually in the group take 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.430
 f2 he is not yet in the mission and 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.200
 issue the attack command again 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.000
 otherwise they form a beautiful grape 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.969
 and look apathetically like yours 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.950
 army, the gain goes to the 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.599
 heights 1 against which is not necessary 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.920
 but a good unit pushed for it 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.939
 that we only barely half a minute 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.829
 need to plan more 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.959
 the cave in the south I would quite 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.459
 omit the middle cave on the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.250
 map takes you almost automatically 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.590
 if you destroy the base if you 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.870
 the rush on a basis too impossible 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.250
 appears small tip goes with kerrigan 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.260
 or another unit 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.790
 shoot the units and lure them 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.780
 back there you do not have to with the 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.430
 bunkering fights or with the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.430
 forces were still in the base 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.150
 once you destroy the base in the north 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.500
 i would go back and do the rest 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.419
 to do out from the south 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.370
 you're walking eastward to the north 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.169
 continue to come your new units 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.379
 Although after running but fine by all 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.639
 associations which can be very annoying 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.980
 with this procedure it should be 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.389
 easy to succeed 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.829
 it needs no further words and 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.250
 the video shows you the conclusion of the 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.849
 mission 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.849
 good luck
