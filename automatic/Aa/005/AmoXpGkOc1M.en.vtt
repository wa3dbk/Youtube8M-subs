colony has a transportation unit to the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.289 
colony has a transportation unit to the
spaceport

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
spaceport

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.599 
spaceport
they've<00:03:34.019> set<00:03:34.319> several<00:03:34.620> explosive<00:03:35.280> devices

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
they've set several explosive devices

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.410 
they've set several explosive devices
there<00:03:36.349> if<00:03:37.349> they<00:03:37.680> explode<00:03:38.129> the<00:03:38.790> colony<00:03:39.269> will

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
there if they explode the colony will

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.929 
there if they explode the colony will
falter<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:39.989> its<00:03:40.140> orbital<00:03:40.620> rotation<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.430> fall

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
falter in its orbital rotation and fall

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.640 
falter in its orbital rotation and fall
into<00:03:42.209> Jupiter<00:03:42.690> no<00:03:44.989> that's<00:03:45.989> how<00:03:46.139> important

into Jupiter no that's how important

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.849 
into Jupiter no that's how important
that<00:03:46.680> orbital<00:03:47.190> frame<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.849> them<00:03:48.709> so<00:03:49.709> I'd

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
that orbital frame is to them so I'd

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.440 
that orbital frame is to them so I'd
like<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.340> work<00:03:50.489> for<00:03:50.760> us<00:03:50.909> one<00:03:51.180> more<00:03:51.389> time
