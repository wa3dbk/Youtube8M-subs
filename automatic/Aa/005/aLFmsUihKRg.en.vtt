00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.180 
one of the reasons what I like to watch
it<00:03:36.780> because<00:03:36.989> even<00:03:37.140> when<00:03:37.350> slapstick<00:03:37.829> is<00:03:37.980> bad

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
it because even when slapstick is bad

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.979 
it because even when slapstick is bad
it's<00:03:38.430> still<00:03:38.519> entertaining<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.329> me<00:03:39.420> not<00:03:39.690> saying

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
it's still entertaining to me not saying

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.390 
it's still entertaining to me not saying
it's<00:03:40.170> going<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.440> be<00:03:40.530> bad<00:03:40.739> I'm<00:03:40.950> saying<00:03:41.190> that

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
it's going to be bad I'm saying that

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.210 
it's going to be bad I'm saying that
like<00:03:41.640> even<00:03:42.269> if<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.540> happens<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.230> be<00:03:43.260> bad<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.950> will

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
like even if it happens to be bad I will

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.440 
like even if it happens to be bad I will
probably<00:03:44.400> still<00:03:44.700> enjoy<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.359> other

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
probably still enjoy that and the other

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.750 
probably still enjoy that and the other
thing<00:03:45.510> too<00:03:45.780> it<00:03:45.959> could<00:03:46.170> be<00:03:46.350> really<00:03:46.620> badass<00:03:47.040> you

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
thing too it could be really badass you

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.430 
thing too it could be really badass you
know<00:03:47.790> like<00:03:48.030> there's<00:03:48.239> glimpses<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:49.049> action

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
know like there's glimpses of action

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.720 
know like there's glimpses of action
sequences<00:03:49.920> in<00:03:50.070> here<00:03:50.190> they<00:03:50.310> look<00:03:50.430> like<00:03:50.519> they're

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
sequences in here they look like they're

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.460 
sequences in here they look like they're
shot<00:03:50.910> pretty<00:03:51.150> cool<00:03:51.420> for<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.690> most<00:03:51.900> part<00:03:52.200> so

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
shot pretty cool for the most part so

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.930 
shot pretty cool for the most part so
while<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.739> doesn't<00:03:52.890> look<00:03:53.070> like<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.340> funniest

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
while it doesn't look like the funniest

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.490 
while it doesn't look like the funniest
thing<00:03:54.150> on<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.390> planet<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.870> me<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:55.230> looks<00:03:55.380> like

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
thing on the planet to me it looks like

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.530 
thing on the planet to me it looks like
it'll<00:03:55.650> be<00:03:55.739> fast<00:03:56.040> paced<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.880> entertaining

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
it'll be fast paced of the entertaining

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.180 
it'll be fast paced of the entertaining
enough<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.170> if<00:03:58.380> there's<00:03:58.530> some<00:03:58.680> cool<00:03:58.859> action

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
enough and if there's some cool action

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.460 
enough and if there's some cool action
that<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.180> will<00:04:00.420> probably<00:04:00.600> make<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.989> even<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.320> lot

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
that it will probably make it even a lot

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.830 
that it will probably make it even a lot
better<00:04:01.709> I<00:04:01.920> like<00:04:02.100> sci-fi<00:04:02.310> comedies<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.570> have

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
better I like sci-fi comedies that have

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.050 
better I like sci-fi comedies that have
a<00:04:03.870> little<00:04:04.200> bit<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.440> horror<00:04:04.680> in<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.100> and<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.760> feel

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
a little bit of horror in it and I feel

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.640 
a little bit of horror in it and I feel
like<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.299> film<00:04:06.540> could<00:04:06.810> have<00:04:06.840> some<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.470> that

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
like this film could have some of that

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.020 
like this film could have some of that
like<00:04:07.799> that's<00:04:07.950> why<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.160> really<00:04:08.340> like<00:04:08.519> attack<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
like that's why I really like attack the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.270 
like that's why I really like attack the
block<00:04:09.329> because<00:04:09.870> there's<00:04:10.230> like<00:04:10.410> actual<00:04:10.829> fear

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
block because there's like actual fear

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.340 
block because there's like actual fear
injected<00:04:11.820> in<00:04:11.940> it<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.329> at<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.690> same<00:04:12.840> time<00:04:13.109> it's

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
injected in it but at the same time it's

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.229 
injected in it but at the same time it's
a<00:04:13.470> hilarious<00:04:14.220> film<00:04:14.430> not<00:04:14.730> saying<00:04:14.880> this<00:04:14.970> has<00:04:15.120> to

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239
