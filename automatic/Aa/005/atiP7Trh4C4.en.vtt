00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
suspension systems can get to be very

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.990 
suspension systems can get to be very
costly<00:00:15.210> if<00:00:16.049> you're<00:00:16.710> trying<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> do<00:00:17.190> any<00:00:17.490> fancy

shaft so can go in and out we'll discuss

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.380 
shaft so can go in and out we'll discuss
that<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> minute<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:54.030> you're<00:00:54.239> going

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that in a minute and then you're going

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.439 
that in a minute and then you're going
to<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:54.989> some<00:00:55.350> sort<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.620> bearing

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
to have to have some sort of bearing

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.049 
to have to have some sort of bearing
that<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.039> suspension<00:00:59.039> system<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
that the suspension system is going to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.020 
that the suspension system is going to
mount<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> then<00:01:02.010> off<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.640> will<00:01:02.879> be

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
mount on to and then off of that will be

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.219 
mount on to and then off of that will be
a<00:01:03.059> hub<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.769> wheel<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.040> mounted<00:01:05.400> onto<00:01:05.729> and

a hub that the wheel is mounted onto and

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
a hub that the wheel is mounted onto and
not<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.409> forget<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.890> all<00:01:08.010> we<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> brake

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
not to forget it all we have a brake

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
not to forget it all we have a brake
system<00:01:09.540> mounted<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.350> well<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
system mounted in here as well so you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.500 
system mounted in here as well so you
can<00:01:11.490> see<00:01:11.700> there's<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> whole<00:01:12.150> bunch<00:01:12.390> of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
can see there's a whole bunch of

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.310 
can see there's a whole bunch of
components<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:14.420> are<00:01:15.420> adding<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.200> are

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
components that are adding up that are

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.520 
components that are adding up that are
expensive<00:01:16.950> pricey<00:01:17.930> u-joints<00:01:18.930> by<00:01:19.049> themselves

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
expensive pricey u-joints by themselves

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.160 
expensive pricey u-joints by themselves
for<00:01:19.860> example<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.640> go<00:01:21.630> up<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.960> about

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
for example can go up to about

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.429 
for example can go up to about
twenty-five<00:01:22.979> dollars<00:01:23.509> they're<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.720> cheap<00:01:25.140> so

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
twenty-five dollars they're not cheap so

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.530 
twenty-five dollars they're not cheap so
the<00:01:26.369> alternative<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:27.119> you're<00:01:27.270> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.450> be

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the alternative that you're going to be

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.120 
the alternative that you're going to be
looking<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:28.080> especially<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.740> you're<00:01:28.860> making

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
looking for especially if you're making

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.179 
looking for especially if you're making
your<00:01:29.250> own<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.579> kart<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.409> would<00:01:31.409> strongly

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
your own go kart is I would strongly

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
your own go kart is I would strongly
suggest<00:01:32.390> how<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> world<00:01:33.750> are<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.350> to

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
suggest how in the world are we going to

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.640 
suggest how in the world are we going to
get<00:01:34.530> away<00:01:34.680> from<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.850> cost<00:01:36.350> that's<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
get away from all this cost that's the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.899 
get away from all this cost that's the
question<00:01:40.159> okay<00:01:41.159> we're<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> take<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.640> look

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
question okay we're going to take a look

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.870 
question okay we're going to take a look
at<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.570> typical<00:01:43.079> rear<00:01:43.680> suspension<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:45.540> a

time<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:19.220> shaft<00:02:19.549> has<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.000> slide<00:02:20.269> into<00:02:20.480> another

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
time the shaft has to slide into another

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.839 
time the shaft has to slide into another
shaft<00:02:21.319> in<00:02:22.099> other<00:02:22.190> words<00:02:22.459> it's<00:02:22.670> adjustable<00:02:23.180> and

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
shaft in other words it's adjustable and

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.949 
shaft in other words it's adjustable and
another<00:02:25.849> you<00:02:26.060> joint<00:02:26.390> up<00:02:26.599> here<00:02:28.810> then<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:29.930> have

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
another you joint up here then you have

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.500 
another you joint up here then you have
your<00:02:30.140> bearing<00:02:30.799> which<00:02:31.069> is<00:02:31.250> mounted<00:02:31.430> here<00:02:31.849> and

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
your bearing which is mounted here and

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.140 
your bearing which is mounted here and
the<00:02:32.569> framework<00:02:33.019> somehow<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.849> then<00:02:34.849> it<00:02:35.000> goes

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
the framework somehow and then it goes

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.130 
the framework somehow and then it goes
over<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.720> your<00:02:36.430> regular<00:02:37.430> shafting<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.900> would

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
over to your regular shafting this would

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.069 
over to your regular shafting this would
be<00:02:39.260> your<00:02:39.290> drive<00:02:39.739> sprocket<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:41.110> even<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.319> brake

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
be your drive sprocket and even a brake

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.470 
be your drive sprocket and even a brake
disc<00:02:45.079> would<00:02:45.349> be<00:02:45.470> mounted<00:02:45.799> there<00:02:46.480> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
disc would be mounted there the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.780 
disc would be mounted there the
suspension<00:02:48.440> that's<00:02:48.799> basically<00:02:49.220> how<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
suspension that's basically how the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.059 
suspension that's basically how the
suspension<00:02:50.450> would<00:02:50.690> be<00:02:50.840> set<00:02:51.079> up<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.560> then

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
suspension would be set up and then

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.559 
suspension would be set up and then
you'd<00:02:52.250> have<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.430> hub<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.940> would<00:02:53.090> be<00:02:53.209> mounted

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
you'd have a hub that would be mounted

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.960 
you'd have a hub that would be mounted
on<00:02:53.660> here<00:02:54.140> typically<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.280> hub<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.579> mounted<00:02:55.879> on

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
on here typically the hub is mounted on

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.720 
on here typically the hub is mounted on
with<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.150> bolt<00:02:56.510> or<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.810> nut<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.500> then<00:02:58.220> pinned<00:02:58.519> in

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
with a bolt or a nut and then pinned in

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.539 
with a bolt or a nut and then pinned in
place<00:02:58.909> and<00:02:59.440> then<00:03:00.440> there's<00:03:00.709> studs<00:03:01.069> that<00:03:01.190> stick

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
place and then there's studs that stick

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.960 
place and then there's studs that stick
out<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.000> hub<00:03:02.720> which<00:03:03.530> mount<00:03:03.859> on<00:03:04.159> to<00:03:04.549> the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
out of the hub which mount on to the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.599 
out of the hub which mount on to the
wheel<00:03:06.519> now<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:08.840> can<00:03:09.019> discuss<00:03:09.440> later<00:03:09.549> how<00:03:10.549> the

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
wheel now we can discuss later how the

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.110 
wheel now we can discuss later how the
dynamics<00:03:11.540> of<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.900> suspension<00:03:12.620> work<00:03:12.980> so<00:03:13.909> that

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
dynamics of the suspension work so that

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.949 
dynamics of the suspension work so that
you<00:03:14.150> actually<00:03:14.420> get<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.760> best<00:03:16.760> benefit<00:03:17.450> from

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
you actually get the best benefit from

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.610 
you actually get the best benefit from
how<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.260> suspension<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.280> designed<00:03:20.620> this

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
how the suspension is designed this

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.589 
how the suspension is designed this
particular<00:03:22.190> video<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.669> going<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:22.910> discuss<00:03:23.359> the

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
particular video is going to discuss the

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.229 
particular video is going to discuss the
pitfalls<00:03:24.109> of<00:03:25.090> trailing<00:03:26.090> arm<00:03:26.980> suspensions

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
pitfalls of trailing arm suspensions

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.479 
pitfalls of trailing arm suspensions
trailing<00:03:29.239> arm<00:03:29.389> suspension<00:03:29.629> can<00:03:30.500> there's<00:03:31.280> two

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
trailing arm suspension can there's two

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.640 
trailing arm suspension can there's two
different<00:03:31.669> ways<00:03:31.849> here's<00:03:32.510> a<00:03:32.569> go-kart<00:03:33.109> frame

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
different ways here's a go-kart frame

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.460 
different ways here's a go-kart frame
for<00:03:34.430> example<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:35.090> trailing<00:03:35.930> arm<00:03:36.230> suspension

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
for example a trailing arm suspension

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.740 
for example a trailing arm suspension
would<00:03:37.069> be<00:03:37.250> one<00:03:37.459> where<00:03:37.669> it<00:03:37.819> comes<00:03:38.060> forward<00:03:38.450> like

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
would be one where it comes forward like

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.020 
would be one where it comes forward like
that<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.290> say<00:03:39.470> your<00:03:39.680> your<00:03:40.370> wheel<00:03:40.669> is<00:03:40.849> mounted

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
that and say your your wheel is mounted

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.869 
that and say your your wheel is mounted
on<00:03:41.419> this<00:03:41.629> trailing<00:03:42.019> arm<00:03:42.349> another<00:03:43.340> trailing

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
on this trailing arm another trailing

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.330 
on this trailing arm another trailing
arm<00:03:44.060> would<00:03:44.239> be<00:03:44.590> here's<00:03:45.590> another<00:03:45.769> go<00:03:46.069> curve

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
arm would be here's another go curve

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.710 
arm would be here's another go curve
frame<00:03:46.699> and<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:49.250> trailing<00:03:49.910> arm<00:03:50.060> comes<00:03:50.359> off<00:03:50.540> the

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
frame and the trailing arm comes off the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.960 
frame and the trailing arm comes off the
center<00:03:51.199> of<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.590> go-kart<00:03:52.069> in<00:03:52.250> bounces<00:03:52.699> up<00:03:52.730> and

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
center of the go-kart in bounces up and

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.930 
center of the go-kart in bounces up and
down<00:03:53.230> that<00:03:54.230> way<00:03:54.470> we<00:03:54.980> move<00:03:55.250> up<00:03:55.430> and<00:03:55.579> down<00:03:55.639> this

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
down that way we move up and down this

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.289 
down that way we move up and down this
way<00:03:56.120> this<00:03:56.329> one<00:03:56.540> moves<00:03:56.720> up<00:03:56.959> and<00:03:57.109> down<00:03:58.299> parallel

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
way this one moves up and down parallel

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.080 
way this one moves up and down parallel
to<00:03:59.569> the<00:03:59.690> frame<00:04:00.160> we're<00:04:01.160> going<00:04:01.280> to<00:04:01.400> discuss<00:04:01.730> this

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
to the frame we're going to discuss this

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.020 
to the frame we're going to discuss this
version<00:04:02.660> first

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.100 

basically<00:04:07.030> if<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.209> take<00:04:07.360> a<00:04:07.390> look<00:04:07.660> at<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.900> side

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
basically if you take a look at the side

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.930 
basically if you take a look at the side
of<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.319> frame<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.800> this<00:04:08.920> is<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.340> frame<00:04:09.790> of

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
of the frame and this is the frame of

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.090 
of the frame and this is the frame of
the<00:04:09.970> go-cart<00:04:10.420> you<00:04:10.930> have<00:04:11.110> your<00:04:11.350> suspension

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
the go-cart you have your suspension

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.340 
the go-cart you have your suspension
which<00:04:12.340> moves<00:04:12.670> up<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.270> down<00:04:13.360> and<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:14.020> moves

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
which moves up and down and it moves

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.729 
which moves up and down and it moves
parallel<00:04:15.209> with<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.239> go-cart<00:04:16.780> straight<00:04:17.620> up

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
parallel with the go-cart straight up

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.340 
parallel with the go-cart straight up
and<00:04:17.889> down<00:04:17.919> this<00:04:18.400> way<00:04:18.669> now<00:04:19.180> from<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:20.109> surface

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
and down this way now from the surface

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.379 
and down this way now from the surface
that<00:04:20.739> appears<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.310> be<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.459> very<00:04:21.700> good<00:04:21.820> design

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
that appears to be a very good design

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.710 
that appears to be a very good design
however<00:04:23.230> when<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.220> go<00:04:24.340> car<00:04:24.610> does<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.910> roll<00:04:25.210> like

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
however when to go car does a roll like

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.310 
however when to go car does a roll like
this<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:27.310> outside<00:04:28.090> wheel<00:04:28.450> tends<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.410> drop<00:04:30.160> up

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
this the outside wheel tends to drop up

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.140 
this the outside wheel tends to drop up
and<00:04:32.320> stay<00:04:32.770> obviously<00:04:33.400> parallel<00:04:33.940> with<00:04:34.120> the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
frame of the go-cart well you can see

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.460 
frame of the go-cart well you can see
that<00:04:36.480> what's<00:04:37.480> going<00:04:37.750> to<00:04:37.840> occur<00:04:37.930> is<00:04:38.290> that

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
that what's going to occur is that

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.230 
that what's going to occur is that
you're<00:04:38.620> going<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.890> have<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.280> wrong<00:04:39.820> side<00:04:40.150> of

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
you're going to have the wrong side of

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.400 
you're going to have the wrong side of
the<00:04:40.300> tire<00:04:40.480> you're<00:04:40.630> going<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.810> have<00:04:40.930> here's<00:04:41.290> an

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
the tire you're going to have here's an

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.500 
the tire you're going to have here's an
exaggerated<00:04:42.040> version<00:04:42.180> you're<00:04:43.180> going<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.390> be

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
exaggerated version you're going to be

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.870 
exaggerated version you're going to be
wanted<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:43.990> all<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.530> forces<00:04:44.890> of<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.220> turning

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
wanted you all the forces of the turning

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.280 
wanted you all the forces of the turning
or<00:04:45.970> going<00:04:46.210> this<00:04:46.360> way<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.600> you're<00:04:46.960> going<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.169> be

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
or going this way and you're going to be

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.130 
or going this way and you're going to be
grabbing<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:48.580> wrong<00:04:49.330> side<00:04:49.600> of<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.720> tire<00:04:49.960> and

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
grabbing the wrong side of the tire and

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.990 
grabbing the wrong side of the tire and
this<00:04:50.230> hybrid<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.650> actually<00:04:50.800> scrub<00:04:51.520> under

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
this hybrid I actually scrub under

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.440 
this hybrid I actually scrub under
you'll<00:04:52.630> actually<00:04:52.780> Bend<00:04:53.350> under<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:55.060> how<00:04:55.240> do<00:04:55.300> you

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
you'll actually Bend under so how do you

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.170 
you'll actually Bend under so how do you
get<00:04:55.600> that<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:56.020> not<00:04:56.169> happen<00:04:56.760> well<00:04:57.760> with<00:04:58.030> this

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
get that to not happen well with this

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.440 
get that to not happen well with this
particular<00:04:58.560> go-kart<00:05:00.060> suspension<00:05:01.060> system

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
particular go-kart suspension system

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.440 
particular go-kart suspension system
that<00:05:01.600> you<00:05:01.690> can't<00:05:01.900> really<00:05:01.960> escape<00:05:02.410> that<00:05:03.450> the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
that you can't really escape that the

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.360 
that you can't really escape that the
best<00:05:04.690> way<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:04.930> can<00:05:05.020> escape<00:05:05.229> that<00:05:05.770> is<00:05:06.040> to

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
best way you can escape that is to

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.250 
best way you can escape that is to
design<00:05:06.550> it<00:05:07.000> so<00:05:07.030> that<00:05:07.210> when<00:05:07.450> your<00:05:07.630> suspension

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
design it so that when your suspension

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.510 
design it so that when your suspension
goes<00:05:08.410> up<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:09.700> actually<00:05:10.120> flexes<00:05:10.660> a<00:05:10.930> tire<00:05:11.290> in<00:05:11.620> a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
goes up it actually flexes a tire in a

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.420 
goes up it actually flexes a tire in a
canted<00:05:13.150> position<00:05:14.110> so<00:05:14.770> that<00:05:14.800> when<00:05:15.100> the<00:05:15.190> body

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
canted position so that when the body

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.990 
canted position so that when the body
rolls<00:05:16.140> that<00:05:17.140> you<00:05:17.500> actually<00:05:17.740> grab<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.760> best

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
rolls that you actually grab the best

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.060 
rolls that you actually grab the best
part<00:05:19.330> of<00:05:19.390> the<00:05:19.510> tire<00:05:19.780> so<00:05:20.169> that<00:05:20.350> what<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:20.650> force

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
part of the tire so that what the force

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.880 
part of the tire so that what the force
vectors<00:05:21.580> are<00:05:22.240> working<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:22.870> best<00:05:23.080> position

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
vectors are working the best position

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.000 
vectors are working the best position
best<00:05:24.340> way<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.580> say<00:05:24.880> this<00:05:24.910> is<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.770> it's<00:05:26.770> kind

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
best way to say this is that it's kind

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.920 
best way to say this is that it's kind
of<00:05:27.039> like<00:05:27.130> a<00:05:27.190> one<00:05:27.400> of<00:05:27.490> motorcycles<00:05:28.180> leaning<00:05:28.690> you

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
of like a one of motorcycles leaning you

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.969 
of like a one of motorcycles leaning you
want<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.410> have<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:30.720> forces<00:05:31.720> not<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:32.229> scrub<00:05:32.740> the

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
want to have the forces not to scrub the

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.640 
want to have the forces not to scrub the
tire<00:05:33.220> under<00:05:33.700> or<00:05:33.880> bend<00:05:34.419> it<00:05:34.660> it's<00:05:35.200> best<00:05:35.470> way<00:05:35.590> to

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
tire under or bend it it's best way to

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.830 
tire under or bend it it's best way to
look<00:05:35.830> at<00:05:36.010> the<00:05:36.250> tire<00:05:36.460> would<00:05:36.640> tends<00:05:37.210> to<00:05:37.479> bend<00:05:37.660> if

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
look at the tire would tends to bend if

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.380 
look at the tire would tends to bend if
you<00:05:37.930> take<00:05:38.110> a<00:05:38.140> look<00:05:38.410> at<00:05:38.560> it<00:05:38.590> if<00:05:38.800> you<00:05:39.430> notice<00:05:40.270> that

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
you take a look at it if you notice that

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.029 
you take a look at it if you notice that
the<00:05:40.510> tire<00:05:40.720> tends<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.260> bend<00:05:41.590> here's<00:05:41.890> an

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 
the tire tends the bend here's an

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:44.670 
the tire tends the bend here's an
exaggerated<00:05:42.640> version<00:05:42.870> then<00:05:43.870> you<00:05:44.110> make<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.500> so

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
exaggerated version then you make it so

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.060 
exaggerated version then you make it so
that<00:05:44.800> it<00:05:44.950> bends<00:05:45.160> in<00:05:45.400> your<00:05:45.550> favor<00:05:45.880> and<00:05:47.070> that's

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
that it bends in your favor and that's

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.010 
that it bends in your favor and that's
typically<00:05:48.460> how<00:05:48.580> you<00:05:48.729> design<00:05:49.270> your<00:05:49.300> suspension

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
typically how you design your suspension

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.990 
typically how you design your suspension
system<00:05:50.440> so<00:05:50.620> that<00:05:50.650> one<00:05:50.979> day<00:05:51.130> it<00:05:51.160> goes<00:05:51.430> up<00:05:51.760> and

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
system so that one day it goes up and

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.510 
system so that one day it goes up and
the<00:05:52.210> body<00:05:52.360> is<00:05:52.600> doing<00:05:52.720> a<00:05:52.930> role<00:05:53.200> that<00:05:54.190> the

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
the body is doing a role that the

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.880 
the body is doing a role that the
suspension<00:05:55.110> tends<00:05:56.110> to<00:05:56.320> be<00:05:56.440> this<00:05:56.680> an

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
suspension tends to be this an

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.450 
suspension tends to be this an
exaggerated<00:05:57.610> view<00:05:58.450> dig<00:05:59.350> in<00:05:59.560> better<00:05:59.890> so<00:06:00.250> your

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
exaggerated view dig in better so your

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.490 
exaggerated view dig in better so your
resultant<00:06:01.060> load<00:06:01.690> or<00:06:02.350> your<00:06:02.530> resultant<00:06:03.070> forces

in<00:06:05.500> this<00:06:05.830> video<00:06:06.160> we're<00:06:06.400> going<00:06:06.550> to<00:06:06.669> be

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
in this video we're going to be

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.420 
in this video we're going to be
discussing<00:06:07.180> the<00:06:07.479> pitfalls<00:06:07.990> of<00:06:07.990> a<00:06:08.470> front<00:06:08.830> front

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
discussing the pitfalls of a front front

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.050 
discussing the pitfalls of a front front
suspension<00:06:10.180> system<00:06:11.010> which<00:06:12.010> is<00:06:12.190> parallelogram

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
suspension system which is parallelogram

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.360 
suspension system which is parallelogram
and<00:06:13.950> how<00:06:14.950> the<00:06:15.810> the<00:06:16.810> wheels<00:06:17.140> will<00:06:17.919> end<00:06:18.220> up

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
and how the the wheels will end up

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.430 
and how the the wheels will end up
having<00:06:18.789> issue

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
having issue

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.500 
having issue
when<00:06:19.920> the<00:06:20.070> suspension<00:06:20.730> is<00:06:20.820> bounced<00:06:21.210> up<00:06:21.360> and

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
when the suspension is bounced up and

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.670 
when the suspension is bounced up and
down<00:06:21.650> now<00:06:22.650> if<00:06:22.830> you<00:06:22.950> don't<00:06:23.100> have<00:06:23.250> this<00:06:24.170> the<00:06:25.170> ride

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
down now if you don't have this the ride

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.230 
down now if you don't have this the ride
which<00:06:26.100> moves<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:27.950> suspension<00:06:28.950> in<00:06:29.190> line<00:06:29.910> with

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
which moves the suspension in line with

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.390 
which moves the suspension in line with
this<00:06:31.940> center<00:06:32.940> line<00:06:33.120> of<00:06:33.330> this<00:06:33.540> actuate<00:06:34.280> line<00:06:35.280> of

this center line of this actuate line of
action<00:06:35.760> for<00:06:35.940> the<00:06:36.540> suspension<00:06:37.230> what<00:06:38.040> will<00:06:38.370> end

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
action for the suspension what will end

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.160 
action for the suspension what will end
up<00:06:38.700> happening<00:06:38.760> and<00:06:39.420> you<00:06:39.510> can't<00:06:39.720> really<00:06:39.930> see<00:06:40.140> it

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:40.170 
up happening and you can't really see it

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.070 
up happening and you can't really see it
in<00:06:40.350> this<00:06:40.470> view<00:06:40.830> but<00:06:40.890> well<00:06:41.730> one<00:06:42.000> will<00:06:42.540> end<00:06:42.810> up

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
in this view but well one will end up

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.000 
in this view but well one will end up
happening<00:06:43.110> is<00:06:43.740> that<00:06:43.800> when<00:06:44.730> this<00:06:44.940> flexes<00:06:45.600> up

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
happening is that when this flexes up

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.340 
happening is that when this flexes up
the<00:06:47.010> distance<00:06:47.550> for<00:06:47.880> this<00:06:48.060> rod<00:06:48.420> as<00:06:48.780> you<00:06:48.930> can<00:06:49.080> see

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:49.350 
the distance for this rod as you can see

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.430 
the distance for this rod as you can see
will<00:06:49.620> become<00:06:49.980> longer<00:06:50.690> being<00:06:51.690> longer<00:06:52.050> it<00:06:52.350> will

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
will become longer being longer it will

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.310 
will become longer being longer it will
cause<00:06:52.680> a<00:06:52.710> tire<00:06:53.100> here's<00:06:53.460> a<00:06:53.520> top<00:06:53.790> view<00:06:54.200> it<00:06:55.200> will

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
cause a tire here's a top view it will

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.860 
cause a tire here's a top view it will
cause<00:06:55.530> the<00:06:55.740> tire<00:06:55.770> to<00:06:57.230> rotate<00:06:58.230> that<00:06:58.740> way<00:06:59.040> around

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
cause the tire to rotate that way around

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.600 
cause the tire to rotate that way around
so<00:07:00.870> in<00:07:01.170> other<00:07:01.350> words<00:07:01.650> when<00:07:01.920> the<00:07:01.950> suspension

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
so in other words when the suspension

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.150 
so in other words when the suspension
goes<00:07:02.760> up<00:07:03.000> the<00:07:03.510> tires<00:07:03.840> will<00:07:04.050> tend<00:07:04.350> to<00:07:04.470> rotate<00:07:04.680> in

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 
goes up the tires will tend to rotate in

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.310 
goes up the tires will tend to rotate in
that<00:07:05.370> direction<00:07:05.730> when<00:07:06.570> the<00:07:06.690> suspension<00:07:07.200> goes

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:07.320 
that direction when the suspension goes

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.220 
that direction when the suspension goes
down<00:07:07.650> they'll<00:07:08.040> tend<00:07:08.250> to<00:07:08.340> rotate<00:07:08.810> under<00:07:09.810> pivot

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
down they'll tend to rotate under pivot

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.200 
down they'll tend to rotate under pivot
axes<00:07:10.860> it<00:07:10.980> that<00:07:11.190> way<00:07:11.340> now<00:07:11.610> the<00:07:11.670> way<00:07:11.970> to<00:07:12.030> get

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.210 
axes it that way now the way to get

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.350 
axes it that way now the way to get
around<00:07:12.300> that<00:07:12.630> obviously<00:07:13.110> is<00:07:13.380> to<00:07:14.280> use<00:07:14.520> the

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
around that obviously is to use the

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.330 
around that obviously is to use the
center<00:07:15.900> line<00:07:16.140> you<00:07:16.380> have<00:07:16.530> to<00:07:16.650> Kate<00:07:16.830> stay<00:07:17.100> in<00:07:17.160> the

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 
center line you have to Kate stay in the

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.040 
center line you have to Kate stay in the
center<00:07:17.520> line<00:07:17.850> and<00:07:18.150> you<00:07:18.300> have<00:07:18.450> to<00:07:18.600> understand

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
center line and you have to understand

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.800 
center line and you have to understand
where<00:07:19.260> all<00:07:19.320> this<00:07:19.470> linkage<00:07:20.100> lines<00:07:20.400> up<00:07:20.700> so<00:07:21.540> that

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
where all this linkage lines up so that

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.800 
where all this linkage lines up so that
when<00:07:22.140> this<00:07:22.830> parallelogram<00:07:23.550> system<00:07:24.390> moves<00:07:24.630> up

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:24.810 
when this parallelogram system moves up

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.730 
when this parallelogram system moves up
and<00:07:24.930> down<00:07:25.020> this<00:07:25.860> length<00:07:26.340> doesn't<00:07:26.880> change<00:07:27.740> you

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
and down this length doesn't change you

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.590 
and down this length doesn't change you
have<00:07:28.860> to<00:07:28.980> keep<00:07:29.100> a<00:07:29.280> particular<00:07:29.910> eye<00:07:29.940> on<00:07:30.360> that

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:30.600 
have to keep a particular eye on that

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.420 
have to keep a particular eye on that
now<00:07:31.580> that<00:07:32.580> may<00:07:32.820> take<00:07:33.060> some<00:07:33.360> doing<00:07:34.200> also<00:07:35.160> with

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
now that may take some doing also with

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.659 
now that may take some doing also with
the<00:07:35.850> way<00:07:36.030> to<00:07:36.090> actuate<00:07:36.720> your<00:07:37.020> steering<00:07:37.460> this<00:07:38.460> is

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:38.669 
the way to actuate your steering this is

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:40.670 
the way to actuate your steering this is
going<00:07:38.820> to<00:07:38.880> have<00:07:39.000> to<00:07:39.150> be<00:07:39.240> adjusted<00:07:39.360> so<00:07:40.169> when<00:07:40.560> it

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 
going to have to be adjusted so when it

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.590 
going to have to be adjusted so when it
moves<00:07:40.919> in<00:07:41.100> and<00:07:41.250> out<00:07:41.400> there's<00:07:42.180> going<00:07:42.390> to<00:07:42.570> be

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600 
moves in and out there's going to be

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:57.600 
moves in and out there's going to be
some<00:07:42.930> variance<00:07:43.530> in<00:07:43.770> how<00:07:43.830> this<00:07:44.640> actually<00:07:44.910> works

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:57.610
