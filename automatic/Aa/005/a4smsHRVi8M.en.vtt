00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.330
 but I was training three days with 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.879
 us with the ball and I did it super 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.740
 well and it felt good so he decided it 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.740
 he and the coaching staff said yes 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.609
 and now you just have to move 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:30.449
 We will physically work it in 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:34.629
 Brazil but do not believe that with little rhythm 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.399
 so fast to see if in the end I think that 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:40.210
 there is no better doctor oneself I 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.160
 I think it 's super good and it takes a lot 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.940
 time in football knows that the risk 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.239
 it is but if he felt good 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.940
 decision of the pods and you finished me 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.960
 annoyed this also had the first 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.739
 time I have a blow on the twin 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.809
 left but only as a precaution 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.280
 I asked for change and only good strength 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.750
 This selection exam returns to 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.699
 win and in the second time they managed 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 correct what it imposes 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.710
 results not resolved because so much 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.659
 gave after a while also only that 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.000
 is to open the goal opportunity and the 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.920
 we take advantage but being a great match 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.650
 we handled the whole game he created 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.299
 several times so wait 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.840
 only when we really need 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.840
 make canaries 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.960
 many differences but for us 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.000
 for the selection that are well and that 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.470
 are with the goal on top so you have to 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.470
 continue like that I hope that match 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.250
 why 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.710
 for the trip
