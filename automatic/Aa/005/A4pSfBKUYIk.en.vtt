thirty-five<00:00:28.190> is<00:00:28.370> a<00:00:28.400> fantastic<00:00:28.970> number<00:00:29.060> if

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
thirty-five is a fantastic number if

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.490 
thirty-five is a fantastic number if
you're<00:00:29.270> not<00:00:29.420> met<00:00:29.600> it<00:00:29.720> before<00:00:29.990> you<00:00:30.140> you're<00:00:30.410> in

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
you're not met it before you you're in

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.560 
you're not met it before you you're in
for<00:00:30.650> a<00:00:30.680> treat<00:00:30.710> here<00:00:31.250> because<00:00:31.789> if<00:00:31.940> you<00:00:31.970> take<00:00:32.300> all

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
for a treat here because if you take all

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.979 
for a treat here because if you take all
the<00:00:32.719> digits<00:00:33.110> of<00:00:33.879> 3435<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.210> then<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:35.570> proceed

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
the digits of 3435 and then you proceed

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.380 
the digits of 3435 and then you proceed
to<00:00:36.020> raise<00:00:36.469> each<00:00:36.890> digit<00:00:37.489> to<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:37.820> power<00:00:38.120> of

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
to raise each digit to the power of

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.560 
to raise each digit to the power of
itself<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:39.650> then<00:00:40.370> you<00:00:40.489> add<00:00:40.790> those<00:00:41.510> numbers

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
itself and then you add those numbers

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.850 
itself and then you add those numbers
together<00:00:42.640> the<00:00:43.640> total<00:00:44.270> is<00:00:44.510> three<00:00:45.380> thousand

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
together the total is three thousand

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.600 
together the total is three thousand
four<00:00:46.040> hundred<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:46.430> thirty-five<00:00:48.460> I'm<00:00:49.460> gonna

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
four hundred and thirty-five I'm gonna

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.799 
four hundred and thirty-five I'm gonna
be<00:00:49.790> honest<00:00:50.090> I<00:00:50.210> thought<00:00:50.390> you'd<00:00:50.540> be<00:00:50.630> more

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
be honest I thought you'd be more

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.860 
be honest I thought you'd be more
impressed<00:00:51.910> that<00:00:52.910> is<00:00:53.030> a<00:00:53.059> vet<00:00:53.329> because<00:00:53.420> that<00:00:53.750> is

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
impressed that is a vet because that is

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.020 
impressed that is a vet because that is
a<00:00:53.899> very<00:00:54.260> unusual<00:00:54.500> property<00:00:55.190> that<00:00:55.309> is<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.489> only

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
a very unusual property that is the only

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.170 
a very unusual property that is the only
number<00:00:56.840> that<00:00:57.620> does<00:00:57.950> that<00:00:58.219> there<00:00:58.399> is<00:00:58.520> no<00:00:58.910> other

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
number that does that there is no other

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.950 
number that does that there is no other
number<00:00:59.840> with<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.260> same<00:01:00.469> property<00:01:01.070> so<00:01:01.750> 3435<00:01:02.750> is

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
number with the same property so 3435 is

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.170 
number with the same property so 3435 is
a<00:01:02.989> very<00:01:03.290> unique<00:01:03.829> number<00:01:04.489> in<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.820> regard

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
a very unique number in that regard

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.870 
a very unique number in that regard
there<00:01:05.689> are<00:01:05.840> similar<00:01:06.229> numbers<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.250> for<00:01:07.490> example

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
there are similar numbers so for example

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.279 
there are similar numbers so for example
over<00:01:08.090> here<00:01:08.289> 48,000<00:01:09.490> 625<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.880> similar<00:01:11.659> in<00:01:11.869> that

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
over here 48,000 625 is similar in that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.440 
over here 48,000 625 is similar in that
if<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.709> take<00:01:12.889> all<00:01:13.219> the<00:01:13.490> digits<00:01:13.909> of<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.420> number

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
if you take all the digits of the number

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.679 
if you take all the digits of the number
you<00:01:15.170> raise<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.560> more<00:01:15.770> ^<00:01:16.280> themselves<00:01:17.119> you<00:01:17.509> add

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
you raise the more ^ themselves you add

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.929 
you raise the more ^ themselves you add
them<00:01:17.929> together<00:01:18.109> they<00:01:19.039> don't<00:01:19.459> equal<00:01:20.649> 48,000

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
them together they don't equal 48,000

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.219 
them together they don't equal 48,000
625<00:01:23.259> except<00:01:24.259> it's<00:01:25.069> alright<00:01:25.340> if<00:01:25.909> you<00:01:25.969> take<00:01:26.539> the

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
625 except it's alright if you take the

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.559 
625 except it's alright if you take the
powers<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.399> put<00:01:28.639> them<00:01:28.789> in<00:01:28.999> the<00:01:29.389> reverse

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
powers and you put them in the reverse

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:35.859 
powers and you put them in the reverse
order<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:31.520> now<00:01:32.119> equals<00:01:32.799> 48,000<00:01:34.450> 625<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:35.749> the

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
order it now equals 48,000 625 so the

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.749 
order it now equals 48,000 625 so the
digits<00:01:36.229> go<00:01:36.349> forward<00:01:36.920> down<00:01:37.249> the<00:01:37.399> bottom<00:01:37.700> and

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
digits go forward down the bottom and

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.309 
digits go forward down the bottom and
then<00:01:37.939> they<00:01:38.090> come<00:01:38.359> back<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.020> opposite

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
then they come back in the opposite

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:40.300 
then they come back in the opposite
direction<00:01:39.590> in<00:01:39.770> fact<00:01:39.950> there<00:01:40.069> are<00:01:40.099> other

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
direction in fact there are other

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.399 
direction in fact there are other
numbers<00:01:40.609> that<00:01:41.270> do<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.630> same<00:01:41.659> thing<00:01:41.899> where<00:01:42.319> you

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
numbers that do the same thing where you

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.620 
numbers that do the same thing where you
reverse<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.310> order<00:01:43.549> of<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:43.849> digits<00:01:44.299> before

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
reverse the order of the digits before

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.330 
reverse the order of the digits before
you<00:01:44.749> turn<00:01:44.929> them<00:01:45.109> into<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.380> powers<00:01:45.740> however

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
you turn them into the powers however

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.989 
you turn them into the powers however
those<00:01:46.819> don't<00:01:47.119> count<00:01:48.369> 3435<00:01:49.369> is<00:01:49.669> the<00:01:49.819> only

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999 
those don't count 3435 is the only

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:51.550 
those don't count 3435 is the only
number<00:01:50.359> where<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.599> don't<00:01:50.869> have<00:01:51.079> to<00:01:51.259> change

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
number where you don't have to change

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.279 
number where you don't have to change
the<00:01:51.740> order<00:01:52.069> now<00:01:52.909> occasionally<00:01:53.209> when<00:01:53.929> I<00:01:53.959> talk
