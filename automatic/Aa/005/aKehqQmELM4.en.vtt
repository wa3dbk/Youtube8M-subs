00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.059
 as a good you can see the title I'm going to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.090
 talk two of a game that says ma jin 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.510
 coins that if some do not know me is 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.640
 the Chinese page that sells products of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.580
 imitation of other products to super 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.740
 good price 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.330
 tell you also that at the end in the video 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.250
 I will announce a story that I think you 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.810
 It will be so much interest 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.040
 Interested in the video that a 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.620
 know it 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.320
 First of all, show them how good the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.870
 packets I got all the envelopes 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.519
 like these with their respective papers 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:47.270
 of bubbles and their prostitutes so 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.040
 question of packaging and other good 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.260
 with respect to the first product is my 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.390
 star product that I had a desire 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.330
 to have it awesome is that wearing 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.750
 waiting for this request a month has been the 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.750
 nit 2 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.659
 what to tell you about this palette that 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.880
 You will have seen already in other videos 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.020
 that for my taste, it has not 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.249
 delighted I am now wearing a 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.009
 makeup made with this palette that you 

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:20.709
 I will leave my video if I can on the side and if 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.709
 not so here you see the result 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.090
 say that the shadows is not that 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.490
 they are super pigmented and not 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.780
 pigment as much as people say I do not know 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.200
 if it has gone wrong or has not 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.450
 I left that I know 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.380
 this is the palette to me it does not cost me 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.439
 open it or here you have the mirror that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.710
 he still wears his plastic and shadows 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.380
 and the pincelito 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.270
 of the brush tell you that this is the part 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.920
 to apply shadow and this is the part 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.119
 to blur the part to blur 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.000
 personally I do not love it because it has 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.430
 the hairs super mega hyper loose thing 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 who likes to blur because I do not think 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.960
 I even have ronald makeup more 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.459
 still I have used to blur me a 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.989
 side and the truth is that even I 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.360
 I spread no better with my finger but good 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.220
 finally in the makeup and right now 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.480
 I have this shadow to mark to mark 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.629
 a little more eye illumination 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.790
 I take this shadow from here also to 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.909
 make it a little darker as a 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.879
 small smoky and finally this black 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:33.330
 that has calmed down I think as you can see 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.420
 here in the saw on the screen is the one 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.220
 has intensified me a little more the 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.700
 under that one above the eyelid 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.239
 mobile 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.040
 the other shadows I've only used this 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.379
 as well 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.730
 tell you that the black and those who 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.989
 they wear glitter yes it is true that 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.989
 pigment more 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.150
 but those that do not have glitter do not 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.590
 they pigment nothing except stakes been 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.520
 used makeup and neither is that 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.280
 be little 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.530
 so well I'm not super delighted 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.960
 with the palette but I'm going to use it 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.520
 because tell us that the price I think that 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.560
 is around 4 euros with something or 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.340
 that of 42 euros that it is true to 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.260
 this I think it's worth seeing it are not 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.850
 the same shadows then leave a little picture 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.220
 of the true shades of the naked 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.460
 true then the same shadow but 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.460
 good 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.830
 in the second place I ordered two skewers one 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.230
 of them I do not have it here I will leave the photo 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.480
 here is once to blur also 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.130
 the shadow that I do not like either because 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.490
 has the most loose hairs yet 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.500
 these so I did not even ask for this 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.060
 blusher brush that I've used 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.220
 right now he also carries the hairs 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.350
 loose but good does not lose any hair 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.050
 It is also a copy of the true 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.810
 As you will see, it has an aesthetic 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.880
 pretty cute I like pretty with 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.000
 was around two euros even less than 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.250
 that and good 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.990
 is also in black color that is more 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.180
 great that is and is so it's true 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.620
 than in videos that people have 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.230
 brought the hairs 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.860
 in third place that I arrived already in another 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.860
 package and only that I live in this one facilitated 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.860
 single 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.520
 I was coming to the beauty blender that is this 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:26.190
 from here with your dot to get well 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.840
 to the orifices of the face is to say that 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.699
 She's super dirty because the 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.060
 Most makeup for her is super 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:35.280
 greedy and leaves you for good thing 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.050
 ok if it does not leave you so much martin generate 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.750
 the face that is what we try each 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.419
 woman that does not stay there pitch 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.560
 in the face but it stays super mega and 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:49.080
 Peru gives me after using it and I do not know 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.840
 it cost me I think between 90 cents a 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.250
 euro I think you see that it has the form of the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.090
 curve and is to be able to catch the best 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.090
 with the fingers 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.900
 the real one costs a tad more than 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.550
 that is twelve euros but what I have 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.470
 heard about the people is great 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.150
 wench I think that even better is worth 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.650
 worth to buy the real one that 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.520
 buy 12 of these 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:14.729
 On the other hand, the famous sang el 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.400
 teaser 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.729
 is this but the movie in black and is 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.879
 well 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.319
 I did not like anything zero 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.089
 first because I have super hair 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.750
 fine and you need a comb that starts 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:31.540
 the hairs and this one 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.750
 It has ripped me out like a gazillion 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.370
 hairs 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.400
 this is the assumption this brush is 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.350
 designed for hair for 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.690
 fine hair for when combing 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.450
 they try to tear me at least 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.300
 possible hair and break it least 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:52.680
 possible and me because this one has 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:56.040
 ripped off and you know hovered around the euro and 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.780
 little too I black skin and this one 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.740
 has all the hairs to it 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.199
 height 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.990
 thing that the real one has as the 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:08.590
 center sunk in 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.960
 Last but not least, these 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.580
 bracelets in the first place is 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.190
 key skulls very wearable for the 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.910
 summer in second place is spiked 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:23.160
 colored bronze plastic and this one that 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.160
 it's my favorite that is this one of skulls 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.320
 that is a very finite to the doll and 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.890
 it is very funny 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:35.730
 all were also around 75 6 cents 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:38.150
 one euro one euro and 50 as much so 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:41.210
 I do not know I like them enough 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.920
 finally and already to finish with the 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.860
