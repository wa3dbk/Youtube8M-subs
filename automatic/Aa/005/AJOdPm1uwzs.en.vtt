00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that looks pretty badass but we had a

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.120 
that looks pretty badass but we had a
quick<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.049> didn't<00:01:19.380> win<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.979> know<00:01:20.100> I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
quick little one I didn't win you know I

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.010 
quick little one I didn't win you know I
tried<00:01:20.460> my<00:01:20.670> best<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.030> everybody<00:01:21.509> had<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> good

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
tried my best but everybody had the good

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
tried my best but everybody had the good
style<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.590> kind<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.070> same<00:01:23.340> generic

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
style going kind of that same generic

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.490 
style going kind of that same generic
style<00:01:24.060> where<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.479> starts<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.320> little

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
style where it starts with a little

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.320 
style where it starts with a little
water<00:01:25.680> here<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.729> guess<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.030> didn't

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
water here so you can I guess I didn't

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.910 
water here so you can I guess I didn't
have<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.659> make<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.350> cobblestone<00:01:28.890> generator

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
have to make that cobblestone generator

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.580 
have to make that cobblestone generator
the<00:01:29.490> way<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.640> did<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.840> had<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> few<00:01:31.259> different

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the way I did but we had a few different

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.499 
the way I did but we had a few different
strategies<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.310> involved<00:01:32.790> kind<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> mining

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
strategies that involved kind of mining

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
strategies that involved kind of mining
back<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.409> course<00:01:34.439> there's<00:01:35.100> always<00:01:35.340> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670

little<00:01:36.150> bit<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.509> trick<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.960> technique<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.590> it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
little bit of trick and technique to it

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.010

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.580 
with my friends we really loved
it<00:02:13.159> really<00:02:13.430> got<00:02:13.970> kind<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.599> good<00:02:15.290> attention

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
it really got kind of a good attention

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.170 
it really got kind of a good attention
and<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:15.920> wasn't<00:02:16.220> really<00:02:16.370> well-known<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:16.879> mean

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
and it wasn't really well-known I mean

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.009 
and it wasn't really well-known I mean
at<00:02:17.689> the<00:02:17.870> end<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.200> what's<00:02:18.409> this<00:02:18.530> mob<00:02:19.400> swatter

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
at the end of it what's this mob swatter

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.569 
at the end of it what's this mob swatter
where's<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.530> others<00:02:21.799> mobs<00:02:22.069> in<00:02:22.220> here<00:02:22.430> probably

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
where's the others mobs in here probably

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.699 
where's the others mobs in here probably
I<00:02:23.090> guess<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.750> could<00:02:23.780> just<00:02:24.110> create<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.439> mob

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
I guess you could just create a mob

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.020 
I guess you could just create a mob
spawner<00:02:24.890> there<00:02:25.310> if<00:02:25.430> you<00:02:25.579> brought<00:02:25.879> your

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
spawner there if you brought your

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.119 
spawner there if you brought your
Skyblock<00:02:26.629> world<00:02:26.900> we<00:02:27.439> had<00:02:27.620> kind<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.980> the

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
Skyblock world we had kind of the

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.309 
Skyblock world we had kind of the
shorter<00:02:28.549> version<00:02:29.030> with<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> smaller<00:02:29.599> time<00:02:30.019> but

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
shorter version with a smaller time but

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.319 
shorter version with a smaller time but
you<00:02:30.860> know<00:02:30.980> you<00:02:31.250> could<00:02:31.400> ultimately<00:02:31.610> do<00:02:32.180> this

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
you know you could ultimately do this

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.119 
you know you could ultimately do this
with<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.569> lot<00:02:33.049> of<00:02:33.110> your<00:02:33.290> friends<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.709> have<00:02:33.829> more
