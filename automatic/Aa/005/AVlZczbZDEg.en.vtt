convicts they seem to do very well there
tetra<00:00:35.010> population<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:39.290> definitely<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.440> some

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
tetra population so definitely have some

tetra population so definitely have some
breeding<00:00:41.010> pairs<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.550> here

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.920 

the<00:01:04.930> back<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.379> tank<00:01:05.619> I've<00:01:05.829> got<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:07.240> Bell

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
the back of the tank I've got the Bell

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.020 
the back of the tank I've got the Bell
earth<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.380> bottom<00:01:08.740> I<00:01:09.040> like<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.640> keep<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:09.850> lot<00:01:09.970> of

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
earth the bottom I like to keep a lot of

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.600 
earth the bottom I like to keep a lot of
oxygen<00:01:10.659> in<00:01:10.780> my<00:01:10.810> water<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.770> circulation<00:01:12.310> I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
oxygen in my water so the circulation I

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.490 
oxygen in my water so the circulation I
think<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:13.079> definitely<00:01:14.079> does<00:01:14.409> ah<00:01:16.200> does<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.229> lot

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
think it definitely does ah does a lot

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.319 
think it definitely does ah does a lot
to<00:01:17.560> enhance<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.220> color<00:01:18.340> in<00:01:18.579> the<00:01:18.670> fish<00:01:18.880> as<00:01:19.149> well

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
to enhance the color in the fish as well

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.359 
to enhance the color in the fish as well
as<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.539> health<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.560> overall<00:01:20.860> stress<00:01:21.159> holes

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
as the health the overall stress holes

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.100 
as the health the overall stress holes
of<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.640> fish<00:01:21.820> are<00:01:21.939> also<00:01:22.090> lower<00:01:22.479> I've<00:01:22.720> noticed

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
of the fish are also lower I've noticed

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.840 
of the fish are also lower I've noticed
with<00:01:23.259> one<00:01:23.530> more<00:01:23.740> oxygen<00:01:24.220> in<00:01:24.369> the<00:01:24.429> water<00:01:24.640> for

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
with one more oxygen in the water for

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.219 
with one more oxygen in the water for
them<00:01:27.149> these<00:01:28.149> particular<00:01:28.479> fish<00:01:28.780> I<00:01:28.990> like<00:01:29.140> to

over a year now the rest of the plants
there<00:02:00.369> are<00:02:00.490> fake<00:02:01.299> so<00:02:01.599> the<00:02:02.110> fish<00:02:02.319> don't<00:02:02.560> destroy

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
there are fake so the fish don't destroy
