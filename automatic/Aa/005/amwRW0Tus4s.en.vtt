00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
deeper brown but just to lighten it a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.119 
deeper brown but just to lighten it a
little<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.780> more<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.080> decided<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.799> go<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
little bit more I decided to go for the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.850 
little bit more I decided to go for the
box<00:01:05.400> color<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.060> then<00:01:06.479> add<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.560> little<00:01:07.590> bit

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
box color and then add just a little bit

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.060 
box color and then add just a little bit
of<00:01:08.159> bleaching<00:01:09.119> powder<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.110> some<00:01:10.560> developer

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
of bleaching powder and some developer

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.039 
of bleaching powder and some developer
in<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.280> end<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> make<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.510> process<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
in the end just to make that process a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.469 
in the end just to make that process a
little<00:01:13.170> bit<00:01:13.320> faster<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.220> these<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.000> final

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
little bit faster so these are the final

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.950 
little bit faster so these are the final
results<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:16.229> my<00:01:16.470> very<00:01:17.369> blond<00:01:17.759> tips<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.420> medium

show you guys how I did it so I'm
starting<00:01:45.659> off<00:01:45.899> by<00:01:46.079> using<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.590> Clairol<00:01:47.100> color

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
starting off by using this Clairol color

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.340 
starting off by using this Clairol color
and<00:01:47.820> texture<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.509> tones<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> number

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
and texture and tones in the number

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.370 
and texture and tones in the number
seven<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.820> get<00:01:51.299> started<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.990> asked<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
seven so to get started I asked a

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.050 
seven so to get started I asked a
section<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.890> my<00:01:53.100> hair<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.520> three<00:01:53.729> major

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
section of my hair in three major

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.980 
section of my hair in three major
sections<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:55.409> size<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.130> then<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.640> back<00:01:56.990> now

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
sections this size and then the back now

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.230 
sections this size and then the back now
I<00:01:58.290> start<00:01:58.680> off<00:01:58.770> by<00:01:59.040> actually<00:01:59.490> applying<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
I start off by actually applying the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.330 
I start off by actually applying the
color<00:02:00.450> closest<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.380> my<00:02:01.500> neck<00:02:01.710> area<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.219> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
color closest to my neck area in the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.700 
color closest to my neck area in the
back

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
back

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.560 
back
because<00:02:03.340> that's<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.670> area<00:02:03.820> that<00:02:03.970> I<00:02:04.150> typically

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
because that's the area that I typically

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.450 
because that's the area that I typically
like<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.869> bring<00:02:05.200> forward<00:02:05.619> and<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.040> part<00:02:06.280> that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
like to bring forward and the part that

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.490 
like to bring forward and the part that
kind<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.729> shines<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.299> most<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:08.229> I'm<00:02:08.319> just

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
kind of shines the most so I'm just

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.320 
kind of shines the most so I'm just
bringing<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:08.979> down<00:02:09.340> all<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:10.000> way<00:02:10.090> down<00:02:10.300> to

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
bringing that down all the way down to

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.540 
bringing that down all the way down to
the<00:02:10.539> previously<00:02:11.140> highlighted<00:02:11.380> area<00:02:12.069> like<00:02:12.280> so

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
the previously highlighted area like so

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.370 
the previously highlighted area like so
and<00:02:13.090> allowing<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.600> process<00:02:14.020> for<00:02:14.230> about

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
and allowing that the process for about

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.330 
and allowing that the process for about
45<00:02:14.920> minutes<00:02:15.990> next<00:02:16.990> after<00:02:17.350> I've<00:02:17.440> done<00:02:17.680> that<00:02:17.920> I'm

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
45 minutes next after I've done that I'm

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.640 
45 minutes next after I've done that I'm
basically<00:02:18.850> taking<00:02:19.239> more<00:02:19.450> hair<00:02:19.750> closest<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.530> my

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
basically taking more hair closest to my

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.190 
basically taking more hair closest to my
neck<00:02:20.860> in<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.130> back<00:02:21.310> area<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.120> section<00:02:23.050> off

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
neck in the back area and section off

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.630 
neck in the back area and section off
the<00:02:23.319> top<00:02:23.530> part<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:23.950> I<00:02:23.980> layered<00:02:24.310> and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
the top part that I layered and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.430 
the top part that I layered and
basically<00:02:24.910> just<00:02:25.120> begin<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.450> color<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.230> all

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
basically just begin to color that all

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.770 
basically just begin to color that all
the<00:02:26.770> way<00:02:26.920> down<00:02:27.220> but<00:02:27.819> I'm<00:02:27.970> not<00:02:28.209> going<00:02:28.420> all<00:02:28.660> the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
the way down but I'm not going all the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.360 
the way down but I'm not going all the
way<00:02:28.900> up<00:02:29.080> because<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.410> almost<00:02:29.860> making<00:02:30.100> like<00:02:30.340> a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
and saturated and line back to process

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.780 
and saturated and line back to process
another<00:02:37.870> about<00:02:38.110> 45<00:02:38.620> minutes

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
safe is pretty much the last for two

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.350 
safe is pretty much the last for two
reasons<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.680> first<00:03:10.069> is<00:03:10.459> because<00:03:10.670> this<00:03:11.090> Court

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
reasons the first is because this Court

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.240 
reasons the first is because this Court
should<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.659> had<00:03:11.780> already<00:03:12.049> lightened<00:03:12.829> a<00:03:12.980> good

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.699 
should I had already lightened a good
amount<00:03:13.519> so<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.790> figure<00:03:14.180> 12<00:03:14.540> /<00:03:14.780> process<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.440> too

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
amount so I figure 12 / process that too

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.160 
amount so I figure 12 / process that too
much<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.340> then<00:03:16.640> also<00:03:16.940> I<00:03:17.209> don't<00:03:17.569> want<00:03:17.810> all<00:03:18.019> the
