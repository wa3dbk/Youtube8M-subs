00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
this morning I tried a soft compound

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.980 
this morning I tried a soft compound
seven<00:01:14.890> medium<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.299> haven't<00:01:16.570> really<00:01:16.720> done

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
seven medium so I haven't really done

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.500 
seven medium so I haven't really done
too<00:01:17.229> much<00:01:17.380> I<00:01:17.619> wanted<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:18.040> not<00:01:18.220> have<00:01:19.000> that<00:01:19.030> be<00:01:19.479> a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
too much I wanted to not have that be a

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.929 
too much I wanted to not have that be a
wild<00:01:20.049> option<00:01:20.530> and<00:01:20.740> just<00:01:21.250> try<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.549> keep<00:01:21.760> it

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
wild option and just try to keep it

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.330 
wild option and just try to keep it
simple<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:23.080> now<00:01:23.439> we<00:01:23.619> saw<00:01:23.799> a<00:01:23.830> lot<00:01:23.920> of<00:01:24.040> drivers

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
simple and now we saw a lot of drivers

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.550 
simple and now we saw a lot of drivers
just<00:01:24.640> like<00:01:24.820> at<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:24.970> Nationals<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:26.350> know<00:01:26.439> just

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
just like at the Nationals you know just

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.990 
just like at the Nationals you know just
because<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.890> track<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:27.280> fast<00:01:27.520> or<00:01:27.729> so<00:01:27.850> much

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
because the track so fast or so much

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.090 
because the track so fast or so much
grip<00:01:28.270> it's<00:01:28.930> kind<00:01:29.290> of<00:01:29.350> tough<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.650> put<00:01:29.830> together

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
grip it's kind of tough to put together

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.070 
grip it's kind of tough to put together
you<00:01:30.340> know<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.580> full<00:01:30.909> run<00:01:31.150> without<00:01:31.390> crashing

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
you know a full run without crashing

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.350 
you know a full run without crashing
yeah<00:01:32.920> it's<00:01:33.130> really<00:01:33.460> tough<00:01:33.729> you<00:01:34.090> know<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
yeah it's really tough you know the

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.730 
yeah it's really tough you know the
Nationals<00:01:34.900> there<00:01:35.110> was<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.259> lot<00:01:35.380> more<00:01:35.409> off

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
Nationals there was a lot more off

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.740 
Nationals there was a lot more off
cameras<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:36.490> stuff<00:01:36.580> that<00:01:37.210> made<00:01:37.420> you<00:01:37.540> want<00:01:37.570> to

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
cameras and stuff that made you want to

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.130 
cameras and stuff that made you want to
flip<00:01:37.900> over<00:01:38.020> by<00:01:38.290> this<00:01:38.350> track<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:39.009> so<00:01:39.400> fast

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
flip over by this track it's so fast

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.929 
flip over by this track it's so fast
there's<00:01:41.140> a<00:01:41.229> couple<00:01:41.439> really<00:01:41.890> fast<00:01:42.430> sections

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
there's a couple really fast sections

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.560 
there's a couple really fast sections
like<00:01:43.030> into<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.450> 180s<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:46.030> know<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.360> grip

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
like into the 180s and you know the grip

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.410 
like into the 180s and you know the grip
level<00:01:46.900> is<00:01:47.020> high<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.979> speeds<00:01:48.759> are<00:01:48.939> high<00:01:49.090> so

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
level is high and the speeds are high so

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.800 
level is high and the speeds are high so
yeah<00:01:49.630> it's<00:01:50.079> key<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.460> get<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.490> clean<00:01:51.759> run<00:01:51.970> in<00:01:52.180> how

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
yeah it's key to get a clean run in how

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.840

for<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:42.580> first<00:02:42.760> minute<00:02:42.940> then<00:02:43.240> once<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.660> tires

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
for the first minute then once the tires

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.170 
for the first minute then once the tires
came<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.740> more<00:02:45.280> comfortable<00:02:45.550> my<00:02:45.880> car<00:02:46.090> is

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
came in and more comfortable my car is

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.490 
came in and more comfortable my car is
really<00:02:46.330> good<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.660> picked<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:46.990> up<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.200> lot<00:02:47.350> at

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
really good and picked it up a lot at

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.110 
really good and picked it up a lot at
the<00:02:47.620> end<00:02:47.800> if<00:02:48.459> I<00:02:48.580> could<00:02:48.730> just<00:02:48.760> start<00:02:49.000> out<00:02:49.060> a

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the end if I could just start out a

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.670 
the end if I could just start out a
little<00:02:49.330> bit<00:02:49.510> quicker<00:02:49.780> at<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.020> beginning<00:02:50.320> and

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
little bit quicker at the beginning and

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.020 
little bit quicker at the beginning and
yeah<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:50.860> would<00:02:51.160> would<00:02:51.430> have<00:02:51.520> been<00:02:51.610> able<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.910> do

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
yeah I would would have been able to do

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.640

how<00:03:17.560> much<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.910> know<00:03:19.000> our<00:03:19.150> equipment<00:03:19.570> concerns

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
how much you know our equipment concerns

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.150 
how much you know our equipment concerns
like<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.470> making<00:03:20.590> sure<00:03:20.800> everything<00:03:21.130> is

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
like that and making sure everything is

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.680 
like that and making sure everything is
ready<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.430> go<00:03:21.520> before<00:03:22.150> we<00:03:22.300> head<00:03:22.420> out<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.660> the

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
ready to go before we head out to the

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.910 
ready to go before we head out to the
track<00:03:22.959> how<00:03:23.110> important<00:03:23.500> is<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.620> at<00:03:23.830> this

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
track how important is that at this

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.800 
track how important is that at this
level<00:03:23.980> yeah<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:24.880> mean<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.180> very<00:03:25.450> important

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
level yeah I mean it's very important

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.170 
level yeah I mean it's very important
and<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:26.019> think<00:03:26.049> this<00:03:26.709> track<00:03:27.040> is<00:03:27.280> very<00:03:27.700> hard<00:03:27.970> on

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
and I think this track is very hard on

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.210 
and I think this track is very hard on
equipment<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:28.959> electronics<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:29.739> stuff<00:03:29.830> I

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
equipment and electronics and stuff I

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.800 
equipment and electronics and stuff I
mean<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.519> grip<00:03:30.790> definitely<00:03:31.450> gets<00:03:31.600> everything

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
mean the grip definitely gets everything

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.300 
mean the grip definitely gets everything
really<00:03:32.110> hot<00:03:32.380> it's<00:03:32.739> definitely<00:03:32.980> hard

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
really hot it's definitely hard

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.130 
really hot it's definitely hard
electronics<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.180> kind<00:03:34.390> of<00:03:34.450> jumping<00:03:34.810> into<00:03:34.989> the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
electronics and kind of jumping into the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.170 
electronics and kind of jumping into the
faces<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.650> all<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.040> big<00:03:36.190> jumps<00:03:36.640> landed<00:03:37.060> hard

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
faces and all the big jumps landed hard

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.270 
faces and all the big jumps landed hard
and<00:03:37.299> stuff<00:03:37.570> I<00:03:37.720> mean<00:03:37.750> your<00:03:38.470> equipment<00:03:38.860> takes<00:03:38.980> us

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
and stuff I mean your equipment takes us

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.470 
and stuff I mean your equipment takes us
some<00:03:39.489> pretty<00:03:39.670> good<00:03:39.790> abuse<00:03:40.090> here<00:03:40.239> so

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
some pretty good abuse here so

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.210 
some pretty good abuse here so
definitely<00:03:40.930> looking<00:03:41.200> over<00:03:41.440> every<00:03:41.769> run<00:03:41.950> but

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
definitely looking over every run but

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.800 
definitely looking over every run but
yeah<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.700> mean<00:03:42.760> everything<00:03:43.239> everything<00:03:43.720> is

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
yeah I mean everything everything is

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.539 
yeah I mean everything everything is
critical<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:45.010> like<00:03:45.130> we<00:03:45.220> thought<00:03:45.250> the

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
critical just like we thought the

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:46.890 
critical just like we thought the
Nationals<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:46.239> know<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.420> lot<00:03:46.600> of<00:03:46.630> traffic

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
Nationals I you know a lot of traffic

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.600 
Nationals I you know a lot of traffic
attraction<00:03:47.680> big<00:03:47.890> jumps<00:03:48.160> everything<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.580> looks

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
attraction big jumps everything it looks

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.789 
attraction big jumps everything it looks
like<00:03:48.880> it's<00:03:49.000> hard<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.870> really<00:03:50.049> you<00:03:50.380> know<00:03:50.410> drive

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
like it's hard to really you know drive

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.830 
like it's hard to really you know drive
hard<00:03:51.130> for<00:03:51.519> good<00:03:51.820> 5-6<00:03:52.030> minutes<00:03:52.420> on<00:03:52.540> the<00:03:52.630> track

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
hard for good 5-6 minutes on the track

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.330 
hard for good 5-6 minutes on the track
yeah<00:03:53.380> I<00:03:53.410> mean<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.680> think<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.950> biggest<00:03:54.160> problem

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
yeah I mean I think the biggest problem

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.310 
yeah I mean I think the biggest problem
today<00:03:54.700> or<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.150> hardest<00:03:55.450> part<00:03:55.600> is<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.810> table

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
today or the hardest part is the table

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.569 
today or the hardest part is the table
triple<00:03:56.709> at<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.860> end<00:03:56.980> of<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.100> straightaway

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
triple at the end of the straightaway

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.060 
triple at the end of the straightaway
it's<00:03:57.820> into<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.239> wind<00:03:58.450> so<00:03:58.989> you're<00:03:59.769> kind<00:03:59.980> of

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
it's into the wind so you're kind of

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.500 
it's into the wind so you're kind of
getting<00:04:00.220> off<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:00.910> though<00:04:01.000> tailings

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
getting off of it and though tailings

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.729 
getting off of it and though tailings
won<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.810> scene<00:04:01.989> can<00:04:02.170> get<00:04:02.290> all<00:04:02.410> kind<00:04:02.620> of

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
won the scene can get all kind of

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.530 
won the scene can get all kind of
squirrelly<00:04:02.950> so<00:04:03.310> that's<00:04:03.579> definitely<00:04:03.820> thrown<00:04:04.510> a

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
squirrelly so that's definitely thrown a

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.970 
squirrelly so that's definitely thrown a
kicker<00:04:04.840> in<00:04:05.049> I<00:04:05.230> heard<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.440> suppose<00:04:05.620> we<00:04:05.739> really

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
kicker in I heard I suppose we really

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.190 
kicker in I heard I suppose we really
windy<00:04:06.220> tomorrow<00:04:06.400> so<00:04:06.910> that's<00:04:07.690> definitely<00:04:07.930> the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
windy tomorrow so that's definitely the

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.780 
windy tomorrow so that's definitely the
most<00:04:08.320> challenging<00:04:08.890> part<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.250> track<00:04:09.489> for<00:04:09.760> I

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
most challenging part of the track for I

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.240 
most challenging part of the track for I
think<00:04:10.090> everyone<00:04:10.480> right<00:04:10.630> now<00:04:13.890> just<00:04:14.890> finished

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
think everyone right now just finished

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.890 
think everyone right now just finished
out<00:04:15.370> with<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.549> first<00:04:15.760> round<00:04:15.970> qualifying<00:04:16.750> here

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
out with the first round qualifying here

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.969 
out with the first round qualifying here
and<00:04:17.019> lee<00:04:17.140> martin<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.500> had<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.650> pretty<00:04:17.799> good<00:04:17.859> run

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
and lee martin you had a pretty good run

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.009 
and lee martin you had a pretty good run
didn't<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.430> yeah<00:04:19.120> it<00:04:19.269> wasn't<00:04:19.419> too<00:04:19.570> bad<00:04:19.660> it

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
didn't you yeah it wasn't too bad it

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.569 
didn't you yeah it wasn't too bad it
started<00:04:20.380> pretty<00:04:20.500> good<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:20.919> faded<00:04:21.430> off<00:04:21.489> a

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
started pretty good and faded off a

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.670 
started pretty good and faded off a
little<00:04:21.729> towards<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.180> end<00:04:22.300> it<00:04:22.810> was<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.410> pretty

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
little towards the end it was a pretty

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.740 
little towards the end it was a pretty
good<00:04:23.740> run<00:04:23.860> we<00:04:24.400> saw<00:04:24.610> three<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.390> top<00:04:25.570> five

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
good run we saw three the top five

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.590 
good run we saw three the top five
drivers<00:04:26.020> came<00:04:26.320> from<00:04:26.470> the<00:04:26.590> top<00:04:26.770> heat

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
drivers came from the top heat

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.000 
drivers came from the top heat
lion<00:04:27.780> Kevlar<00:04:28.140> sneaking<00:04:28.530> in<00:04:28.620> there<00:04:28.710> in<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.890> top

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
lion Kevlar sneaking in there in the top

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.370 
lion Kevlar sneaking in there in the top
three<00:04:29.340> but<00:04:29.570> from<00:04:30.570> i<00:04:30.690> believe<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.050> b<00:04:31.200> or<00:04:31.350> c

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
three but from i believe the b or c

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.650 
three but from i believe the b or c
qualifier<00:04:32.040> and<00:04:32.310> do<00:04:33.180> you<00:04:33.270> think<00:04:33.300> it's<00:04:33.570> an

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
qualifier and do you think it's an

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.910 
qualifier and do you think it's an
advantage<00:04:34.020> when<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.260> run<00:04:34.380> against<00:04:34.650> people

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
advantage when you run against people

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.200 
advantage when you run against people
that<00:04:34.950> are<00:04:35.100> all<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.250> same<00:04:35.400> speed<00:04:35.670> like<00:04:35.850> that<00:04:36.030> or

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
that are all the same speed like that or

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.400 
that are all the same speed like that or
is<00:04:36.300> it<00:04:36.450> kind<00:04:36.600> of<00:04:36.690> nice<00:04:36.840> being<00:04:37.050> one<00:04:37.260> of<00:04:37.290> the

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
is it kind of nice being one of the

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.230 
is it kind of nice being one of the
faster<00:04:37.710> drivers<00:04:38.010> in<00:04:38.100> the<00:04:38.130> heat<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.940> you're

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
faster drivers in the heat so you're

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.550 
faster drivers in the heat so you're
more<00:04:39.360> worried<00:04:39.690> about<00:04:39.750> just<00:04:40.200> catching<00:04:40.530> the

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
more worried about just catching the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.530 
more worried about just catching the
drivers<00:04:40.890> ahead<00:04:41.100> of<00:04:41.190> you<00:04:41.310> instead<00:04:41.670> of<00:04:41.820> trying

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
drivers ahead of you instead of trying

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.640 
drivers ahead of you instead of trying
to<00:04:42.630> see<00:04:42.780> where<00:04:42.900> everyone<00:04:43.170> else<00:04:43.230> is<00:04:43.440> on<00:04:43.590> the

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
to see where everyone else is on the

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.560 
to see where everyone else is on the
track<00:04:43.860> yeah<00:04:44.400> it<00:04:44.670> depends<00:04:44.970> how<00:04:45.090> you<00:04:45.210> like<00:04:45.450> to

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
drive I mean like for me then I self

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.700 
drive I mean like for me then I self
behind<00:04:47.820> Dustin<00:04:48.270> and<00:04:48.450> you<00:04:48.720> know<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:48.870> could<00:04:49.170> gauge

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
behind Dustin and you know I could gauge

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.560 
behind Dustin and you know I could gauge
myself<00:04:50.100> with<00:04:50.220> him<00:04:50.370> when<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:50.610> forever<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.330> know

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
we should be going fast enough and then

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.740 
we should be going fast enough and then
you<00:04:53.610> hear<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:53.880> someone's<00:04:54.240> leading<00:04:54.420> from<00:04:54.690> the

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
you hear that someone's leading from the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.330 
you hear that someone's leading from the
back<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.170> you're<00:04:55.290> like<00:04:55.440> oh<00:04:55.620> maybe<00:04:55.980> I<00:04:56.130> need<00:04:56.220> to

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
back and you're like oh maybe I need to

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.680 
back and you're like oh maybe I need to
go<00:04:56.490> faster<00:04:56.700> or<00:04:57.000> maybe<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.330> need<00:04:57.480> to<00:04:57.570> do

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
go faster or maybe I need to do

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.840 
go faster or maybe I need to do
something<00:04:58.050> or<00:04:58.110> try<00:04:58.320> harder<00:04:58.710> but<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.760> is

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
something or try harder but so that is

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.790 
something or try harder but so that is
it's<00:05:00.210> very<00:05:00.270> strange<00:05:00.690> and<00:05:00.960> when<00:05:01.170> I<00:05:01.380> think<00:05:01.710> if

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
it's very strange and when I think if

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.590 
it's very strange and when I think if
you're<00:05:01.920> in<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.070> heat<00:05:02.280> without<00:05:02.850> guys<00:05:03.240> do<00:05:03.420> as<00:05:03.510> as

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
you're in a heat without guys do as as

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.780 
you're in a heat without guys do as as
fast<00:05:03.840> as<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.140> you<00:05:04.170> can<00:05:04.410> just<00:05:04.530> lead<00:05:04.770> out<00:05:04.980> maybe

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
fast as you you can just lead out maybe

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.370 
fast as you you can just lead out maybe
that's<00:05:06.030> good<00:05:06.180> as<00:05:06.330> well<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.510> mean<00:05:06.810> it<00:05:07.050> depends

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
that's good as well I mean it depends

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.050 
that's good as well I mean it depends
what<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:07.680> like<00:05:07.710> but<00:05:08.130> either<00:05:08.340> way<00:05:08.580> we<00:05:08.790> gotta<00:05:08.970> go

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
what you like but either way we gotta go

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.340 
what you like but either way we gotta go
around<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.300> same<00:05:09.480> track<00:05:09.720> for<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:09.960> same<00:05:10.140> time

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
around the same track for the same time

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.140 
around the same track for the same time
and<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.740> fastest<00:05:11.100> guy<00:05:11.250> will<00:05:11.490> do<00:05:11.670> the<00:05:11.790> fastest

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
and the fastest guy will do the fastest

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.510 
and the fastest guy will do the fastest
time<00:05:12.330> so<00:05:12.590> now<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:14.010> know<00:05:14.100> we've<00:05:14.190> got<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.340> lot<00:05:14.490> of

like 10 seconds for to start everyone's
like<00:05:43.290> can<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:43.440> move<00:05:43.590> it<00:05:43.800> so<00:05:43.950> I<00:05:44.010> can<00:05:44.220> you<00:05:44.280> move

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400

that way and it's kind of screaming head
a<00:05:46.050> little<00:05:46.200> bit<00:05:46.320> it's<00:05:46.620> nicer<00:05:46.830> when<00:05:47.220> you<00:05:47.730> gonna

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
a little bit it's nicer when you gonna

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.550 
a little bit it's nicer when you gonna
go<00:05:48.330> up<00:05:48.420> in<00:05:48.540> order<00:05:48.720> or<00:05:48.870> something<00:05:49.350> and<00:05:49.440> we're

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
go up in order or something and we're

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.900 
go up in order or something and we're
about<00:05:49.680> having<00:05:49.920> to<00:05:50.040> go<00:05:50.160> out<00:05:50.250> there<00:05:50.400> like<00:05:50.550> half

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
about having to go out there like half

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.250 
about having to go out there like half
an<00:05:51.060> hour<00:05:51.180> early<00:05:51.540> just<00:05:51.720> because<00:05:51.780> you<00:05:52.050> want<00:05:52.230> to

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
an hour early just because you want to

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.410 
an hour early just because you want to
get<00:05:52.410> the<00:05:52.500> right<00:05:52.620> spot<00:05:52.920> so<00:05:53.160> maybe<00:05:53.940> Santa<00:05:54.300> lat

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
get the right spot so maybe Santa lat

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.480 
get the right spot so maybe Santa lat
needs<00:05:54.720> to<00:05:54.840> change<00:05:55.140> them<00:05:55.440> but<00:05:55.650> hopefully<00:05:56.370> it's

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
needs to change them but hopefully it's
