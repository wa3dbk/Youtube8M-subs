there's obviously tons of controversy
and<00:00:27.630> I'm<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:28.019> afraid<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.920> controversial

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
and I'm not afraid to be controversial

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.120 
and I'm not afraid to be controversial
and<00:00:29.730> what<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.910> say<00:00:30.240> or<00:00:30.390> what<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.570> think<00:00:31.070> but<00:00:32.070> I

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and what I say or what I think but I

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.069 
and what I say or what I think but I
really<00:00:32.369> do<00:00:32.489> believe<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.759> my<00:00:33.540> approach<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
really do believe that my approach is

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.350 
really do believe that my approach is
most<00:00:34.530> optimal<00:00:35.130> I'm<00:00:35.730> sure<00:00:36.030> there's<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
most optimal I'm sure there's going to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.700 
most optimal I'm sure there's going to
be<00:00:36.420> something<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.930> discover<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> couple

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
be something that I discover in a couple

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380 
be something that I discover in a couple
years<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:37.950> maybe<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.280> little<00:00:38.489> bit<00:00:38.579> better<00:00:38.730> but

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
years that maybe a little bit better but

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.819 
years that maybe a little bit better but
I've<00:00:39.540> been<00:00:39.690> searching<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.200> about<00:00:40.350> 17<00:00:40.800> years

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
I've been searching for about 17 years

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.560 
I've been searching for about 17 years
on<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.670> should<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:41.940> for<00:00:42.120> every<00:00:42.329> meal<00:00:42.480> of

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
on what I should be for every meal of

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
on what I should be for every meal of
the<00:00:42.629> day<00:00:42.680> especially<00:00:43.680> breakfast<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.410> this<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the day especially breakfast and this is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.950 
the day especially breakfast and this is
the<00:00:46.710> conclusion<00:00:47.190> I've<00:00:47.280> come<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> obviously

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the conclusion I've come to so obviously

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.420 
the conclusion I've come to so obviously
when<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> started<00:00:49.590> working<00:00:49.770> out<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.370> doing

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
when I started working out I was doing

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.310 
when I started working out I was doing
what<00:00:50.610> everybody<00:00:50.789> else<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.149> doing<00:00:51.329> egg<00:00:52.110> whites

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
what everybody else was doing egg whites

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.369 
what everybody else was doing egg whites
and<00:00:52.440> oatmeal<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:53.039> always<00:00:53.820> felt<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.780> crap<00:00:55.020> my

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
and oatmeal I always felt like crap my

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.889 
and oatmeal I always felt like crap my
energy<00:00:55.710> stumped<00:00:55.980> my<00:00:56.370> energy<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.180> was<00:00:57.600> up<00:00:57.750> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
energy stumped my energy was was up and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.840 
energy stumped my energy was was up and
down<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.440> eat<00:00:58.829> my<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:59.160> meal<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.730> think

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
down I eat my first meal I want to think

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.310 
down I eat my first meal I want to think
of<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.570> mean<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.899> me<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> doesn't

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
of that so I mean to me that doesn't

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.510 
of that so I mean to me that doesn't
make<00:01:01.500> sense<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.920> thought<00:01:02.070> something<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.399> wrong

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
make sense I thought something was wrong

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.490 
make sense I thought something was wrong
with<00:01:02.820> my<00:01:02.969> body<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.510> thought<00:01:04.080> maybe<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.350> was

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
with my body I thought maybe I was

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.289 
with my body I thought maybe I was
pre-diabetic<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.460> wasn't<00:01:05.640> using<00:01:06.000> insulin

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
pre-diabetic or I wasn't using insulin

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.520 
pre-diabetic or I wasn't using insulin
efficiently<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> wasn't<00:01:07.080> eating<00:01:07.140> carbs

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
efficiently I wasn't eating carbs

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.010 
efficiently I wasn't eating carbs
efficiently<00:01:08.100> what's<00:01:08.790> wrong<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.630> ultimately

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
efficiently what's wrong but ultimately

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810 
efficiently what's wrong but ultimately
I<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.320> realized<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.920> hey<00:01:11.130> you're<00:01:11.729> not

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
