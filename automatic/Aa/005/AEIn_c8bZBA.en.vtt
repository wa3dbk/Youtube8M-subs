awesome<00:00:11.099> it's<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.580> great<00:00:11.910> idea<00:00:12.090> for<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.480> hybrid

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
awesome it's a great idea for a hybrid

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.829 
awesome it's a great idea for a hybrid
format<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> closed<00:00:14.549> gate<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.389> format

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
format this is a closed gate the format

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.590 
format this is a closed gate the format
pop-up<00:00:16.440> hybrid<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.730> -<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.330> kind<00:00:18.539> of

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
pop-up hybrid so - the kind of

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.970 
pop-up hybrid so - the kind of
equalities<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.230> two<00:00:19.350> different<00:00:19.560> formats

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
equalities of two different formats

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.189 
equalities of two different formats
combined<00:00:20.369> together<00:00:20.520> into<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.090> new<00:00:21.539> hybrid

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
combined together into one new hybrid

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.439 
combined together into one new hybrid
format<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.130> from<00:00:23.310> Finch<00:00:23.580> paper<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
format this is from Finch paper and

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.689 
format this is from Finch paper and
before<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> forget<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.070> Finch<00:00:26.369> fine

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699

and<00:00:29.789> you're<00:00:30.449> gonna<00:00:30.599> love<00:00:30.929> how<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.410> works<00:00:31.740> so

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
and you're gonna love how this works so

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.610 
and you're gonna love how this works so
it<00:00:32.550> opens<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.270> you've<00:00:34.110> got<00:00:34.260> your<00:00:34.410> V

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
it opens like this you've got your V

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.560 
it opens like this you've got your V
format<00:00:35.130> pop<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.640> right<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.300> middle

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
format pop up right here in the middle

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.770 
format pop up right here in the middle
and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.680> what<00:00:38.309> they<00:00:38.460> did<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.180> combined

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and then what they did is they combined

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.500 
and then what they did is they combined
this<00:00:40.079> format<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.129> closed<00:00:41.579> gate<00:00:41.969> format<00:00:42.390> so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this format with a closed gate format so

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.819 
this format with a closed gate format so
the<00:00:42.600> panel's<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.110> fold<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.500> toward<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
the panel's that fold in toward the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.180 
the panel's that fold in toward the
center<00:00:44.120> but<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.510> love<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:46.950> did<00:00:47.100> an

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
center but what I love is they did an

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.389 
center but what I love is they did an
angled<00:00:47.760> trim<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.200> folding<00:00:49.710> panels<00:00:50.219> to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
angled trim on the folding panels to

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.540 
angled trim on the folding panels to
accommodate<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:52.020> V<00:00:52.530> format<00:00:52.920> pop<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.430> so

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
accommodate the V format pop up so

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.790 
accommodate the V format pop up so
you've<00:00:53.640> got<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:53.879> really<00:00:54.149> cool<00:00:54.539> shape<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
you've got this really cool shape and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
you've got this really cool shape and
these<00:00:56.070> wonderful<00:00:56.579> kind<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.820> trim<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> panels

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
these wonderful kind of trim to panels

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.810 
these wonderful kind of trim to panels
and<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.289> doing<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.949> really<00:00:59.430> create<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> lot

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
and in doing so you really create a lot

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.479 
and in doing so you really create a lot
of<00:01:00.059> extra<00:01:00.270> real<00:01:00.750> estate<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.620> graphics<00:01:02.100> they

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
of extra real estate for graphics they

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.750 
of extra real estate for graphics they
also<00:01:02.879> tipped<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.840> little<00:01:04.530> eight-page

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
also tipped on a little eight-page

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.340 
also tipped on a little eight-page
broadside<00:01:05.760> piece<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.810> here<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.320> some

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
broadside piece right here with some

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.920 
broadside piece right here with some
extra<00:01:08.250> information<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> tip<00:01:09.750> on

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
extra information so this is a tip on

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.130 
extra information so this is a tip on
right<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.850> so<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:12.119> does<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.450> work<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.020> they

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
right here so how does this work so they

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.190 
right here so how does this work so they
I<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:15.240> glued<00:01:15.540> together<00:01:15.750> so

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
I do have to but it's glued together so

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.950 
I do have to but it's glued together so
well<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.009> really<00:01:17.310> just<00:01:17.729> couldn't<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.810> it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
well that I really just couldn't take it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.980 
well that I really just couldn't take it
apart<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.520> t-shape<00:01:21.270> so

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
apart but think of this as a t-shape so

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.399 
apart but think of this as a t-shape so
this<00:01:22.350> whole<00:01:22.860> panel<00:01:23.340> folds<00:01:23.790> down<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
this whole panel folds down and and

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
this whole panel folds down and and
ultimately<00:01:25.530> folds<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.700> glued<00:01:27.000> here

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
ultimately folds up and is glued here

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.960 
ultimately folds up and is glued here
and<00:01:27.509> that's<00:01:27.689> how<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.930> get<00:01:28.229> for<00:01:28.829> reinforce<00:01:29.400> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
and that's how you get for reinforce you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.700 
and that's how you get for reinforce you
know<00:01:30.090> you've<00:01:30.240> got<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.869> solid<00:01:31.140> corner

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
know you've got the the solid corner

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.950 
know you've got the the solid corner
right<00:01:31.979> because<00:01:32.400> we're<00:01:32.579> folding<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.150> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
right because we're folding up this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.200 
right because we're folding up this
center<00:01:34.770> piece<00:01:34.979> something<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.700> big<00:01:35.880> T

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
center piece something but it's a big T

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.109 
center piece something but it's a big T
shape<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:37.470> then<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:37.740> also<00:01:37.920> did<00:01:38.250> some<00:01:38.549> nice

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
shape and then they also did some nice

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.940 
shape and then they also did some nice
things<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.170> die<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.650> scored

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
things this is you know die and scored

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.230 
things this is you know die and scored
everything<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.400> also<00:01:41.549> printed<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
everything but they also printed the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.399 
everything but they also printed the
inside<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:44.100> back<00:01:44.340> area<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.689> pop-up<00:01:45.930> which

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
inside the back area of the pop-up which

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.460 
inside the back area of the pop-up which
is<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.860> very<00:01:47.100> nice<00:01:47.340> design<00:01:47.909> detail<00:01:48.720> so

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
is just a very nice design detail so

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.929 
is just a very nice design detail so
just<00:01:49.880> beautifully<00:01:50.880> done<00:01:51.380> great<00:01:52.380> idea<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.820> a
