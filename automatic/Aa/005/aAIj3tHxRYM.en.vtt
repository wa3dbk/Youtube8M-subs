00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:26.429 
okay I've got the I'm I'm late string

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.570 
okay I've got the I'm I'm late string
it's<00:00:26.580> got<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.810> pair<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.840> EMG<00:00:28.320> 708<00:00:29.070> actually<00:00:29.460> it's

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
it's got a pair of EMG 708 actually it's

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.790 
it's got a pair of EMG 708 actually it's
like<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.060> 707<00:00:30.420> series<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:36.800> we've

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
like it's like the 707 series but we've

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.670 
like it's like the 707 series but we've
got<00:00:38.010> 24<00:00:38.580> 27<00:00:39.059> inch<00:00:39.330> scale<00:00:39.600> length<00:00:39.839> okay<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.559> it's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
got 24 27 inch scale length okay so it's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.200 
got 24 27 inch scale length okay so it's
longer<00:00:40.860> than<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> average<00:00:41.250> six<00:00:41.579> string<00:00:41.820> by<00:00:42.059> an

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
longer than the average six string by an

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.430 
longer than the average six string by an
inch<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.390> half<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:42.989> make<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.410> just

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
inch and half so that just make it just

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.170 
inch and half so that just make it just
resonates<00:00:44.129> better<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.700> stage<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.059> tune

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
resonates better and stage and tune

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.790 
resonates better and stage and tune
better<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> lower<00:00:45.809> ends<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:48.800> regular

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
better for the lower ends so regular

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.580 
better for the lower ends so regular

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
think this compares to sort of other

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.889 
think this compares to sort of other
eight<00:00:55.559> strings<00:00:55.859> in<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.910> sort<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.180> price

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
eight strings in that sort of price

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.889 
eight strings in that sort of price
range<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.410> sort<00:00:58.620> design<00:00:59.809> fantastic<00:01:00.809> you

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
range in that sort design fantastic you

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.479 
range in that sort design fantastic you
get<00:01:01.019> the<00:01:01.079> quality<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.769> good<00:01:01.920> hardware<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
get the quality of the good hardware and

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.100 
get the quality of the good hardware and
the<00:01:02.550> pickups<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.030> everything<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.989> got

the pickups and everything and it's got
the<00:01:04.170> right<00:01:04.259> scale<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.800> there's<00:01:05.009> a<00:01:05.039> lot<00:01:05.160> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
the right scale in there's a lot of

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.499 
the right scale in there's a lot of
eight<00:01:05.339> strings<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.789> the<00:01:05.850> market<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.330> which

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
eight strings on the market now which

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.660 
eight strings on the market now which
I'm<00:01:07.140> right<00:01:07.530> scale<00:01:07.830> length<00:01:08.039> for<00:01:08.190> an<00:01:08.280> extended

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
I'm right scale length for an extended

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.090 
I'm right scale length for an extended
range<00:01:08.820> instrument<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.570> don't<00:01:10.039> do<00:01:11.039> you

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
range instrument so they don't do you

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.260 
range instrument so they don't do you
find<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.369> they<00:01:11.460> got<00:01:11.610> tuned<00:01:11.910> a<00:01:12.030> little<00:01:12.060> bit

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
find that they got tuned a little bit

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.149 
find that they got tuned a little bit
easier<00:01:12.539> when<00:01:12.720> they're<00:01:12.840> exactly<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:13.710> Ivan<00:01:13.979> as

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
easier when they're exactly but Ivan as

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.950 
easier when they're exactly but Ivan as
I<00:01:14.250> made<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> affordable<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> get<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> quality

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
I made it affordable to get a quality

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.670 
I made it affordable to get a quality
eight<00:01:16.290> string<00:01:16.590> which<00:01:16.799> does<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.369> job<00:01:17.490> properly

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
eight string which does the job properly

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.399 
eight string which does the job properly
it<00:01:19.680> looks<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.689> some<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.840> some<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
it looks like some of the some of the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.570 
it looks like some of the some of the
other<00:01:22.470> eight<00:01:22.680> strings<00:01:22.920> around<00:01:23.220> they<00:01:23.369> sort<00:01:23.549> of

other eight strings around they sort of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.620 
other eight strings around they sort of
price<00:01:23.759> times<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.119> kind<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> look<00:01:24.540> a
