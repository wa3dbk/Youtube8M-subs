00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.279
 the 4 9 lost they are now 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.980
 as with the "FTD" 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.119
 only good from the everything is mirrored 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.079
 if you danced them on the board and just think about it 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.079
 that they did not raise these services 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.690
 that's the way I see it 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.970
 Frederick already below 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.260
 with the white side pointing to the right 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 and that may be a piece in the right place 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.420
 instills 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.750
 and in fast 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.010
 the white at at the bottom with the white side pointing to the right 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.010
 and that may be a piece lying in the right place just upside down 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.410
 solved 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.760
 and now are fast 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.069
 keeping the nuclear power plant is below 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.389
 with the white side pointing message 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:13.429
 and that can be up to the upper level afterwards 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:16.429
 the list 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:27.869
 solved 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.869
 and the snow 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:46.569
 the EFD writes lie rounds with the white page to the right 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.569
 and that can and does exist on the upper level 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.139
 I hate 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.009
 superseded 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.129
 from the snow
