week<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.790> if<00:03:12.880> they<00:03:13.060> aren't<00:03:13.209> then<00:03:13.750> I'm<00:03:14.079> gonna

week and if they aren't then I'm gonna
ask<00:03:14.470> if<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:14.769> have<00:03:14.980> been<00:03:15.130> practicing<00:03:15.639> because

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
ask if you have been practicing because

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.710 
ask if you have been practicing because
you<00:03:16.120> probably<00:03:16.389> should<00:03:16.600> be<00:03:16.889> practice<00:03:17.889> and

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
you probably should be practice and

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.940 
you probably should be practice and
we'll<00:03:19.720> just<00:03:19.870> get<00:03:20.109> through<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.440> core<00:03:20.620> drills<00:03:20.859> a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
we'll just get through the core drills a

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.430 
we'll just get through the core drills a
week<00:03:21.100> to<00:03:21.280> go<00:03:21.459> straight<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.910> week<00:03:22.060> three<00:03:22.440> we

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
week to go straight to week three we

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.870 
week to go straight to week three we
will<00:03:23.560> start<00:03:23.799> with<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.040> waltz<00:03:24.340> strum<00:03:24.579> pattern

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
will start with the waltz strum pattern

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.000 
will start with the waltz strum pattern
last<00:03:25.209> week<00:03:25.450> we<00:03:25.569> learned<00:03:26.109> a<00:03:26.319> four-four<00:03:26.739> strum

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
last week we learned a four-four strum

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.129 
last week we learned a four-four strum
pattern<00:03:27.340> called<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.480> straight<00:03:28.720> down<00:03:28.900> strum

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
pattern called the straight down strum

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.199 
pattern called the straight down strum
pattern<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.829> then<00:03:30.609> this<00:03:30.760> week<00:03:30.970> we're<00:03:31.150> gonna

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
pattern and then this week we're gonna

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.000 
pattern and then this week we're gonna
look<00:03:31.420> at<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.720> week<00:03:31.930> three<00:03:32.260> waltz<00:03:32.739> strum

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
look at the week three waltz strum

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.099 
look at the week three waltz strum
pattern<00:03:33.340> which<00:03:34.209> means<00:03:34.450> we're<00:03:35.049> gonna

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
pattern which means we're gonna

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.930 
pattern which means we're gonna
introduce<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.650> concept<00:03:36.100> of<00:03:36.190> 3/4<00:03:36.670> time

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
introduce the concept of 3/4 time

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.300 
introduce the concept of 3/4 time
highlighting<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.989> rhythm<00:03:38.260> with<00:03:38.859> three<00:03:39.100> beats

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
highlighting a rhythm with three beats

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.160 
highlighting a rhythm with three beats
in<00:03:39.459> each<00:03:39.549> measure<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:40.569> then<00:03:40.780> you'll<00:03:40.900> see<00:03:41.139> that

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
in each measure and then you'll see that

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.460 
in each measure and then you'll see that
our<00:03:41.410> first<00:03:41.739> trend<00:03:42.069> pattern<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:43.690> written<00:03:44.139> with

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
our first trend pattern is written with

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.090 
our first trend pattern is written with
three<00:03:44.769> down<00:03:45.130> strums<00:03:45.579> per<00:03:45.970> measure<00:03:47.100> then

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
three down strums per measure then

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.370 
three down strums per measure then
there's<00:03:48.340> an<00:03:48.459> example<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:49.510> way<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:50.170> you'll

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
there's an example the way that you'll

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.550 
there's an example the way that you'll
see<00:03:50.590> it<00:03:50.709> in<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.220> core<00:03:51.459> drills<00:03:52.290> now<00:03:53.290> when<00:03:53.470> you

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
see it in the core drills now when you

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.440 
see it in the core drills now when you
count<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.920> three-four<00:03:54.340> time<00:03:54.579> you<00:03:55.269> want<00:03:55.420> to

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
count the three-four time you want to

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.970 
count the three-four time you want to
emphasize<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:56.139> first<00:03:56.380> strum<00:03:56.680> in<00:03:56.889> each

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
emphasize the first strum in each

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.759 
emphasize the first strum in each
measure<00:03:57.190> followed<00:03:58.030> by<00:03:58.150> two<00:03:58.209> softer<00:03:58.840> strums<00:03:59.139> so

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
measure followed by two softer strums so

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:00.839 
measure followed by two softer strums so
it's<00:03:59.889> going<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.069> be<00:04:00.160> similar<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.670> way<00:04:00.790> you

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
it's going to be similar to the way you

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.789 
it's going to be similar to the way you
might<00:04:01.090> count<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.599> waltz<00:04:01.989> dance<00:04:02.230> if<00:04:02.530> you're

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
might count a waltz dance if you're

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.770 
might count a waltz dance if you're
gonna<00:04:02.920> dance<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.549> waltz<00:04:03.730> you're<00:04:04.569> going<00:04:04.720> to

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
gonna dance the waltz you're going to

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.300

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
count one two three one two three one

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.670 
count one two three one two three one
two<00:04:09.340> three<00:04:10.120> and<00:04:10.600> we're<00:04:10.959> doing<00:04:11.169> the<00:04:11.259> same<00:04:11.470> way

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
two three and we're doing the same way

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.410 
two three and we're doing the same way
with<00:04:12.250> our<00:04:12.280> waltz<00:04:12.850> if<00:04:12.970> you

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
with our waltz if you

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.580 
with our waltz if you
stepping<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:13.840> waltz<00:04:14.230> here<00:04:14.319> and<00:04:14.470> have<00:04:14.560> a

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
stepping the waltz here and have a

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.170 
stepping the waltz here and have a
bigger<00:04:14.920> first<00:04:15.280> step<00:04:15.550> and<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:16.169> slower<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.440> a

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
bigger first step and a slower and a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.659 
bigger first step and a slower and a
more<00:04:19.180> smaller<00:04:19.900> second<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.769> third<00:04:20.919> step<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.370> we

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
more smaller second and third step so we

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.600 
more smaller second and third step so we
do<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:21.820> large<00:04:22.570> first<00:04:23.020> step<00:04:23.290> then<00:04:23.830> we<00:04:23.919> do<00:04:24.040> a<00:04:24.070> soft

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
do a large first step then we do a soft

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.340 
do a large first step then we do a soft
soft<00:04:25.000> so<00:04:25.389> that's<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.690> same<00:04:25.900> way<00:04:26.110> we're<00:04:26.260> gonna

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
soft so that's the same way we're gonna

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.530
