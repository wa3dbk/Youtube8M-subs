and get programming instructions so

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.959 
and get programming instructions so
anyways<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.129> pretty<00:00:44.640> common<00:00:45.590> keyless

bit of a light shine on that there is a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.410 
bit of a light shine on that there is a
section<00:00:56.430> here<00:00:56.760> where<00:00:57.260> it's<00:00:58.260> got<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> little

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
section here where it's got a little

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.639 
section here where it's got a little
impression<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.989> use<00:01:01.170> something<00:01:01.500> like

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
impression so you can use something like

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.450 
impression so you can use something like
a<00:01:01.770> screwdriver

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
a screwdriver

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.910 
a screwdriver
another<00:01:02.969> key<00:01:03.239> say<00:01:03.660> another<00:01:03.840> lexus<00:01:04.409> key<00:01:04.619> works

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
another key say another lexus key works

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.550 
another key say another lexus key works
great<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.489> got<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> flat<00:01:05.790> head<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.200> you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
great it's got a flat head on it and you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.950 
great it's got a flat head on it and you
can<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.770> basically<00:01:08.310> pry<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.820> open<00:01:09.180> use

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
can just basically pry that open use

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.980 
can just basically pry that open use
your<00:01:10.140> key<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.610> insert<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.820> twist<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
your key to insert and twist and it

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
your key to insert and twist and it
should<00:01:13.170> separate<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> two<00:01:13.890> halves<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.640> half

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
should separate the two halves and half

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.140 
should separate the two halves and half
of<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.600> particular<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.680> actually

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
of this particular one is actually

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.999 
of this particular one is actually
broken<00:01:18.150> around<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> keyring<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.619> normally

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
broken around the keyring so normally

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.170 
broken around the keyring so normally
you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.250> leave<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> keyring<00:01:21.030> they

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
you can leave it on the keyring they

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.700 
you can leave it on the keyring they
would<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.420> separate<00:01:21.810> out<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.380> can<00:01:22.530> pull

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
would just separate out and you can pull

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.070 
would just separate out and you can pull
out<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> battery<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.509> battery<00:01:24.540> type

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
out the battery and the battery type

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.780 
out the battery and the battery type
that<00:01:25.350> should<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.710> most<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.100> these<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.610> a

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
that should be on most of these is a

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.219 
that should be on most of these is a
cr2016<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:30.689> three<00:01:31.170> volt<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.780> button<00:01:34.049> cell

give it a little tap and the battery
will<00:01:45.479> start<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.899> come<00:01:46.079> loose<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.040> use

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
will start to come loose and you can use

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
will start to come loose and you can use
your<00:01:47.340> fingernail<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.509> pull<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.170> on

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
your fingernail then to pull it out on

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.300 
your fingernail then to pull it out on
the<00:01:50.159> edge<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.229> get<00:01:52.409> old<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:52.890> pull

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
the edge so you just get old of it pull

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.420 
the edge so you just get old of it pull
it<00:01:53.399> out<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.790> edge<00:01:53.939> comes<00:01:54.780> loose<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
it out from the edge comes loose and

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.800 
it out from the edge comes loose and
remember<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.579> positive<00:01:56.909> side<00:01:57.560> oops<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:59.009> up

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
remember the positive side oops is up

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.539 
remember the positive side oops is up
and<00:02:00.810> that's<00:02:01.409> what<00:02:01.530> you'll<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.219> negative

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
and that's what you'll see the negative

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
and that's what you'll see the negative
side<00:02:02.759> goes<00:02:03.000> against<00:02:03.270> these<00:02:03.479> three<00:02:03.899> prongs

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
side goes against these three prongs

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.990 
side goes against these three prongs
right<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:05.939> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
right here then you just get a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.020 
right here then you just get a
replacement<00:02:06.329> battery<00:02:06.920> stick<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.039> in<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.849> it's

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
replacement battery stick it in and it's

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.699 
replacement battery stick it in and it's
snaps<00:02:09.929> back<00:02:10.170> together

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
snaps back together

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.170 
snaps back together
you<00:02:10.890> shouldn't<00:02:11.190> have<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.400> reprogram<00:02:11.790> or

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
you shouldn't have to reprogram or

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.309 
you shouldn't have to reprogram or
anything<00:02:12.330> like<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.569> should<00:02:12.989> have

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
anything like that should have

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.229 
anything like that should have
same<00:02:13.650> frequency<00:02:14.250> your<00:02:14.400> car<00:02:14.610> should<00:02:14.790> recognize

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
same frequency your car should recognize

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.300 
same frequency your car should recognize
the<00:02:15.480> frequency<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.920> shouldn't<00:02:17.250> matter

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
the frequency and it shouldn't matter

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.949 
the frequency and it shouldn't matter
for<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.579> battery<00:02:17.879> died<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.359> replaced<00:02:18.719> it

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
for the battery died and you replaced it

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.929 
for the battery died and you replaced it
a<00:02:19.140> hundred<00:02:19.859> times<00:02:20.010> your<00:02:20.489> car<00:02:20.670> should<00:02:20.790> always

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
a hundred times your car should always

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.369 
a hundred times your car should always
recognize<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.689> frequency<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:23.659> anyways<00:02:24.659> so

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
recognize the frequency so anyways so

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.410 
recognize the frequency so anyways so
get<00:02:25.799> your<00:02:25.950> new<00:02:26.040> battery<00:02:26.269> remember<00:02:27.269> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
get your new battery remember the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.539 
get your new battery remember the
negative<00:02:27.930> side<00:02:28.400> goes<00:02:29.400> down<00:02:29.599> positive<00:02:30.599> side<00:02:30.840> up

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
negative side goes down positive side up

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.190 
negative side goes down positive side up
and<00:02:32.549> there's<00:02:32.909> the<00:02:33.090> positive<00:02:33.269> side<00:02:33.840> right

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
and there's the positive side right

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.500 
and there's the positive side right
there<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.980> again<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:36.709> cr2016<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.730> then

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
there and again it is a cr2016 and then

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.300 
there and again it is a cr2016 and then
you<00:02:39.689> just<00:02:39.989> put<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.470> two<00:02:40.650> halves<00:02:40.920> back

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
you just put the two halves back

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.129 
you just put the two halves back
together<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.939> you<00:02:42.269> are<00:02:42.299> all<00:02:42.599> set

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139
