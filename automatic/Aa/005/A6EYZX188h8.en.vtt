was supposed to be announced by Google

postponed until further notice and the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.510 
postponed until further notice and the
only<00:02:04.500> three<00:02:04.860> things<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.369> always

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
only three things that I can always

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.520 
only three things that I can always
think<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.210> could<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.450> cons<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.170> nexus

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
think of that could be cons to the nexus

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.109 
think of that could be cons to the nexus
prime<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.310> maybe<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.700> screen<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
prime is that maybe the screen is a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.270 
prime is that maybe the screen is a
little<00:02:09.179> bit<00:02:09.420> too<00:02:09.660> big<00:02:09.899> for<00:02:10.110> some<00:02:10.259> people<00:02:10.619> like

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
little bit too big for some people like

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.500 
little bit too big for some people like
I

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.449 
I
said<00:02:11.629> a<00:02:11.659> couple<00:02:11.870> videos<00:02:12.260> ago<00:02:12.409> it's<00:02:12.709> 4.5<00:02:13.129> inch

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
said a couple videos ago it's 4.5 inch

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.039 
said a couple videos ago it's 4.5 inch
too<00:02:13.700> big<00:02:13.939> this<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.239> four<00:02:14.540> point<00:02:14.659> six<00:02:14.930> five

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
too big this is four point six five

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.410 
too big this is four point six five
inches<00:02:15.739> so<00:02:16.040> maybe<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.790> just<00:02:16.849> might<00:02:17.269> be<00:02:17.299> a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
inches so maybe it just might be a

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.149 
inches so maybe it just might be a
little<00:02:17.540> bit<00:02:17.689> too<00:02:17.810> big<00:02:17.959> for<00:02:18.379> some<00:02:18.500> people<00:02:18.799> the

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
little bit too big for some people the

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.740 
little bit too big for some people the
second<00:02:19.489> thing<00:02:19.579> that<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.909> have<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.239> say<00:02:20.420> is<00:02:20.569> that

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
second thing that I have to say is that

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.050 
second thing that I have to say is that
it<00:02:21.019> is<00:02:21.290> powered<00:02:21.620> by<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.980> texas<00:02:22.370> instruments

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
it is powered by a texas instruments

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.569 
it is powered by a texas instruments
omap<00:02:23.750> processor<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.890> they<00:02:25.069> have<00:02:25.189> not<00:02:25.340> always

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
omap processor and they have not always

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.420 
omap processor and they have not always
been<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.360> most<00:02:26.569> fastest<00:02:27.170> processors<00:02:27.829> however

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
been the most fastest processors however

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.559 
been the most fastest processors however
this<00:02:28.549> is<00:02:28.730> obviously<00:02:28.909> one<00:02:29.329> their<00:02:29.450> new

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
this is obviously one their new

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.149 
this is obviously one their new
generation<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.349> I'm<00:02:30.500> not<00:02:30.620> saying<00:02:30.860> it's<00:02:30.980> not

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
generation so I'm not saying it's not

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.490 
generation so I'm not saying it's not
going<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.430> be<00:02:31.489> fast<00:02:31.730> I'm<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.150> saying<00:02:32.500> usually

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
going to be fast I'm just saying usually

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.589 
going to be fast I'm just saying usually
if<00:02:33.980> we<00:02:34.220> look<00:02:34.370> back<00:02:34.519> in<00:02:34.670> history<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.120> omap

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
if we look back in history the omap

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.780 
if we look back in history the omap
processors<00:02:36.170> have<00:02:36.200> not<00:02:36.590> been<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.069> fastest<00:02:37.609> I'm

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
processors have not been the fastest I'm

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.860 
processors have not been the fastest I'm
third<00:02:38.120> thing<00:02:38.299> that<00:02:38.329> I<00:02:38.450> could<00:02:38.629> think<00:02:38.659> of

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
third thing that I could think of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.960 
third thing that I could think of
because<00:02:39.079> this<00:02:39.319> is<00:02:39.379> a<00:02:39.500> 4g<00:02:39.950> phone<00:02:40.190> as<00:02:40.519> a<00:02:40.579> huge

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
because this is a 4g phone as a huge

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.369 
because this is a 4g phone as a huge
display<00:02:41.420> for<00:02:41.720> me<00:02:41.810> running<00:02:42.049> ice<00:02:42.170> cream

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379 
display for me running ice cream

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.170 
display for me running ice cream
sandwich<00:02:42.739> i'm<00:02:42.890> most<00:02:43.159> likely<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:43.849> is<00:02:44.030> gonna

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
sandwich i'm most likely this is gonna

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.809 
sandwich i'm most likely this is gonna
have<00:02:44.329> a<00:02:44.390> pretty<00:02:44.890> big<00:02:45.890> bill<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.459> guys<00:02:46.579> i<00:02:46.760> hope

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
have a pretty big bill so guys i hope

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.190 
have a pretty big bill so guys i hope
