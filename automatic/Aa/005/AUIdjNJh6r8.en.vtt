and<00:02:09.880> apply<00:02:10.479> it<00:02:10.539> in<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.720> completely<00:02:11.050> new<00:02:11.290> setting

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
and apply it in a completely new setting

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.309 
and apply it in a completely new setting
we<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.250> continued<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.880> focus<00:02:13.030> on<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:14.050> first

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
we have continued to focus on the first

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.260 
we have continued to focus on the first
person<00:02:14.740> action<00:02:14.860> side<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.520> things<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.970> that's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
person action side of things and that's

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.420 
person action side of things and that's
been<00:02:16.510> very<00:02:16.810> much<00:02:17.319> what<00:02:17.530> rage<00:02:17.770> still<00:02:18.069> takes

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
been very much what rage still takes

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
John Carmack was coming up with it tech

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.140 
John Carmack was coming up with it tech
5<00:02:33.560> one<00:02:34.100> of<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.280> things<00:02:34.520> we<00:02:34.670> wanted<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:34.940> make

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
5 one of the things we wanted to make

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.280 
5 one of the things we wanted to make
sure<00:02:35.180> we<00:02:35.480> did<00:02:35.870> is<00:02:36.050> give<00:02:36.380> people<00:02:36.890> something<00:02:37.310> new

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
sure we did is give people something new

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.600 
sure we did is give people something new
this<00:02:39.290> is<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.590> first<00:02:39.830> game<00:02:40.100> that<00:02:40.160> is<00:02:40.430> going<00:02:40.550> to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
this is the first game that is going to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.510 
this is the first game that is going to
use<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.150> fully<00:02:41.360> explore<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.800> capabilities

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
use and fully explore the capabilities

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.110 
use and fully explore the capabilities
of<00:02:43.550> John<00:02:44.360> Carmack<00:02:44.720> syntek<00:02:45.200> 5<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:46.640> work<00:02:46.880> that

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
of John Carmack syntek 5 the work that

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.690 
of John Carmack syntek 5 the work that
he<00:02:47.330> does<00:02:47.510> a<00:02:47.570> technology<00:02:48.260> he<00:02:48.440> creates<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.190> just

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
he does a technology he creates is just

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.190 
he does a technology he creates is just
something<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:50.060> you<00:02:50.720> wouldn't<00:02:51.020> see

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
something that you wouldn't see

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.500 
something that you wouldn't see
elsewhere<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.760> lot<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.270> was<00:02:53.360> just

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
elsewhere and so a lot of it was just

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.690 
elsewhere and so a lot of it was just
how<00:02:53.780> do<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:53.930> make<00:02:54.200> something<00:02:54.620> fun<00:02:55.190> with<00:02:55.430> this

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
how do we make something fun with this

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.760 
how do we make something fun with this
cool<00:02:56.090> tech<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.390> cornerstone<00:02:59.960> a<00:03:00.230> vid<00:03:00.560> Tech

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
cool tech so the cornerstone a vid Tech

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.300 
cool tech so the cornerstone a vid Tech
