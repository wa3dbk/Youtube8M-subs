00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.840
 friends of techno mercy subscribers 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.670
 today we bring you an application 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.760
 good in an application itself but a 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.970
 function that by default ios5 and so 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.330
 so much help 6 how good it is rather 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.980
 is this is a function that the truth 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.190
 quite pretty good since it costs 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.070
 many apple devices are us 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.489
 they work or they decomposed what their 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.470
 home button and this function this is going to 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.620
 allow us to have a button 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.720
 home without needing to download a useful 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.240
 decided an application of installed 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.290
 good gentlemen let's start with this 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.480
 the truth seems to me a 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.250
 as a pretty good enough function already 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.290
 that as I told many 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.540
 devices do not work what their 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.850
 Hop button and good to activate it 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.850
 first we are going to enter settings 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.240
 let's wait for it to load 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.060
 let's go to general 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.130
 and we're going to go down and go to 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.229
 enter accessibility 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.229
 and they are going to show us several options but 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:36.159
 we're going to go down and we're going to give 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.630
 click where it says that way step touch 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.520
 how good they come here I have it 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.929
 deactivated but let's activate it and 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.929
 let's wait for him to ride 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.840
 good gentlemen as there they see us appears 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.630
 what it is 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.329
 a small box with a circle that 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.729
 simulate what the com button is that the 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.000
 truth is very good let's see here 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.299
 we can see the button with start that 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.240
 it works quite enough they had as they see 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.980
 look 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.920
 start 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.510
 and good here also after what they are 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.010
 favorites that is like a 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.769
 personalization of 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.819
 of some gestures that we can 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:22.430
 include in what is this function where 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.879
 some gestures the few gestures 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.230
 we can how much you forgive we can 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:29.180
 use for different gestures and 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.610
 different functions as you see here 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.709
 we have five fingers two fingers with three 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.190
 fingers and four fingers this well for 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.180
 move from application to application or 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.310
 page or tab in safari when it is 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.790
 there are devices here that are 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.690
 as quick accesses as you see here 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.510
 to create screen to unlock that 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.960
 this function of being able to rotate the screen 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.260
 that can block the screen that I just 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.750
 to block 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.340
 and we also have what it is to go up and 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.870
 lower volume that the truth is quite 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.560
 pretty good 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.830
 and well, here I have this function 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.330
 that the truth works very well and what 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.170
 best of all, we do not have to 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.000
 turn off or download a sloppy tweet or something 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.269
 of this light so this comes by 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.310
 no one's fault is it seems a 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.569
 pretty pretty good and good function 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.610
 gentlemen this is all I just wanted 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.239
 show them this function since I 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:34.000
 it seemed quite interesting and good 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.959
