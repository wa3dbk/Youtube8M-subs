so we're going to have a look a bit

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.380 
so we're going to have a look a bit
closer<00:02:03.370> at<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.610> machine<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:03.970> take<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.210> for<00:02:04.360> a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
closer at the machine and take you for a

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.530 
closer at the machine and take you for a
walk<00:02:04.600> around<00:02:04.810> now<00:02:05.670> right<00:02:06.670> I'm<00:02:06.940> now<00:02:07.150> just

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
walk around now right I'm now just

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
printing 10 pages through the machine to

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:28.210

show<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.450> just<00:02:10.869> how<00:02:11.019> quick<00:02:11.469> it<00:02:11.620> is

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.860 

and<00:02:28.760> these<00:02:28.910> weren't<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.360> simple<00:02:29.840> text

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
and these weren't just simple text

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.560 
and these weren't just simple text
documents<00:02:30.710> either<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:31.460> that's<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.910> real-life

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
documents either so that's a real-life

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.720

example of how quickest is now this is

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.200 
example of how quickest is now this is
our<00:02:35.120> machine<00:02:35.450> from<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.650> main<00:02:37.070> sales<00:02:37.640> office

print to it and we're very very
impressed<00:02:43.580> with<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.880> machine<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:44.840> I'm<00:02:44.990> now

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
impressed with this machine so I'm now

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.900

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
machine so first of all you've got the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.290 
machine so first of all you've got the
power<00:02:48.860> switch<00:02:49.070> here<00:02:49.400> at<00:02:49.520> the<00:02:49.550> front<00:02:49.880> that's<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
power switch here at the front that's a

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.480 
power switch here at the front that's a
great<00:02:50.570> location<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.470> lot<00:02:51.710> of<00:02:51.860> manufacturers

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
put them at the back which is a bit more

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.650 
put them at the back which is a bit more
difficult<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.070> access<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:56.270> let<00:02:56.420> me<00:02:56.510> just

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
difficult to access so let me just

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.280 
difficult to access so let me just
unplug<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:58.300> show<00:02:59.300> you<00:02:59.360> around<00:02:59.540> the<00:03:00.080> rear<00:03:00.260> of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
unplug it show you around the rear of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.650 
unplug it show you around the rear of
the<00:03:00.440> machine<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.950> a<00:03:01.130> moment<00:03:01.580> so<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.450> first

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
the machine in a moment so the first

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.720 
the machine in a moment so the first
thing<00:03:02.900> that<00:03:03.140> I'm<00:03:03.320> going<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.590> mention<00:03:03.800> is<00:03:04.310> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
thing that I'm going to mention is the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.210 
thing that I'm going to mention is the
reason<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.270> have<00:03:05.300> two<00:03:05.870> trays<00:03:06.290> is<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:07.100> the

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
reason we have two trays is that the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.340 
reason we have two trays is that the
first<00:03:07.430> tray<00:03:07.790> don't<00:03:07.970> forget<00:03:08.210> these<00:03:08.300> are<00:03:08.360> 500g

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
first tray don't forget these are 500g

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.320 
first tray don't forget these are 500g
trays<00:03:09.620> all<00:03:09.800> take<00:03:10.010> a<00:03:10.040> full<00:03:10.280> ream<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:11.090> first

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
trays all take a full ream the first

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.680 
trays all take a full ream the first
tray<00:03:11.600> we<00:03:11.780> just<00:03:12.020> load<00:03:12.290> standard<00:03:13.160> a4<00:03:13.790> plain

there's no complication to get the trays
connected<00:03:43.520> you<00:03:44.420> just<00:03:44.660> have<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.989> line<00:03:45.200> them<00:03:45.410> up

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
connected you just have to line them up

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.260

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
which can be a little bit tricky there

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.830 
which can be a little bit tricky there

drums<00:04:20.269> they<00:04:20.419> use<00:04:20.600> a<00:04:20.630> special<00:04:20.930> ceramic<00:04:21.470> coating

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
drums they use a special ceramic coating

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.909 
drums they use a special ceramic coating
so<00:04:22.790> it<00:04:22.880> makes<00:04:23.090> them<00:04:23.300> very<00:04:23.540> long<00:04:23.810> life<00:04:24.080> and<00:04:24.410> in

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
so it makes them very long life and in

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.060 
so it makes them very long life and in
fact<00:04:24.950> they<00:04:25.700> guarantee<00:04:26.240> them<00:04:26.540> for<00:04:27.070> 500,000

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
fact they guarantee them for 500,000

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.740 
fact they guarantee them for 500,000
pages<00:04:28.250> or<00:04:28.669> three<00:04:29.210> years<00:04:29.680> but<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.830> drum<00:04:31.750> you

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
can pull out like so but it won't come

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.529 
can pull out like so but it won't come
out<00:04:36.140> completely<00:04:36.650> because<00:04:37.340> it's<00:04:37.910> not<00:04:38.150> designed

this comes out like this just so you can
access<00:04:51.910> inside<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.030> machine<00:04:53.330> if<00:04:53.510> you<00:04:53.600> do<00:04:53.720> get

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
access inside the machine if you do get

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.719 
access inside the machine if you do get
a<00:04:53.930> paper<00:04:54.320> jam<00:04:54.500> but<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:54.740> won't<00:04:54.949> actually<00:04:55.100> come

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
a paper jam but it won't actually come

a paper jam but it won't actually come
out<00:04:55.880> fully<00:04:56.240> it<00:04:56.510> just<00:04:56.720> locks<00:04:56.930> there<00:04:57.290> like<00:04:57.530> so

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
power cable connector so once you put

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.659 
power cable connector so once you put
the<00:05:54.080> power<00:05:54.320> cable<00:05:54.710> in<00:05:54.800> just<00:05:54.979> to<00:05:55.100> keep<00:05:55.250> it<00:05:55.490> nice

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
the power cable in just to keep it nice

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.390 
the power cable in just to keep it nice
and<00:05:56.000> tidy<00:05:56.270> you<00:05:56.990> then<00:05:57.289> put<00:05:57.620> this<00:05:57.830> cover<00:05:58.160> over

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
and tidy you then put this cover over

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.850 
and tidy you then put this cover over
the<00:05:58.610> top<00:05:58.700> of<00:05:59.090> it<00:05:59.210> so<00:05:59.479> the<00:05:59.960> cover<00:06:00.169> just<00:06:00.349> clips<00:06:00.680> on

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
the top of it so the cover just clips on

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.260 
the top of it so the cover just clips on
like<00:06:01.039> so<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.400> it<00:06:01.580> just<00:06:01.760> makes<00:06:01.910> it<00:06:02.030> a<00:06:02.120> little

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
like so and it just makes it a little

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.050 
like so and it just makes it a little
bit<00:06:02.419> tidier<00:06:02.720> so<00:06:03.410> from<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.830> back<00:06:03.979> you've<00:06:04.550> got<00:06:04.580> a

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
bit tidier so from the back you've got a

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.450 
bit tidier so from the back you've got a
panel<00:06:05.630> here<00:06:05.660> that<00:06:05.930> you<00:06:06.050> can<00:06:06.260> open<00:06:06.530> to<00:06:07.190> get<00:06:07.340> any

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
panel here that you can open to get any

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.060 
panel here that you can open to get any
jams<00:06:07.849> and<00:06:08.120> if<00:06:08.240> you<00:06:08.360> do<00:06:08.570> go<00:06:08.780> for<00:06:08.810> that<00:06:09.110> 250<00:06:09.889> sheet

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
jams and if you do go for that 250 sheet

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.070 
jams and if you do go for that 250 sheet
phase<00:06:10.340> output<00:06:10.639> that's<00:06:11.360> where<00:06:11.599> it<00:06:11.750> connects

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
phase output that's where it connects

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.850 
phase output that's where it connects
into<00:06:12.320> and<00:06:14.050> really<00:06:15.050> I<00:06:15.080> don't<00:06:15.320> think<00:06:15.650> there's

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
into and really I don't think there's
