agility<00:00:05.009> well<00:00:05.460> not<00:00:06.240> very<00:00:06.270> good<00:00:06.859> so<00:00:07.859> usually

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
agility well not very good so usually

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.669 
agility well not very good so usually
you'll<00:00:08.429> want<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.760> use<00:00:09.320> someone<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.349> better

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
you'll want to use someone with better

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.169 
you'll want to use someone with better
agility<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.519> all<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.570> ball<00:00:13.519> but<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:15.059> know

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
agility to all the ball but you know

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.920 
agility to all the ball but you know
it's<00:00:15.809> not<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.320> bad<00:00:16.820> they<00:00:17.820> can<00:00:18.060> still<00:00:18.510> pick<00:00:18.810> up

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
it's not that bad they can still pick up

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.550 
it's not that bad they can still pick up
the<00:00:19.410> ball<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:20.039> relative<00:00:21.080> success<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:24.560> well

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
the ball with relative success and well

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.310 
the ball with relative success and well
if<00:00:26.099> they<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> ball<00:00:27.359> then<00:00:28.109> they

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
if they do have the ball then they

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.710 
if they do have the ball then they
become<00:00:28.710> really<00:00:29.250> difficult<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.000> stop<00:00:30.269> because

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
become really difficult to stop because

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.850 
become really difficult to stop because
they're<00:00:30.900> stronger<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:32.780> finally<00:00:33.780> armor<00:00:34.290> they

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
they're stronger and finally armor they

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.930 
they're stronger and finally armor they
do<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.309> very<00:00:35.760> good<00:00:36.000> armor<00:00:37.520> now<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.579> problem

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
do have very good armor now the problem

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.660 
do have very good armor now the problem
they<00:00:39.809> have<00:00:40.050> no<00:00:40.739> skills<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:42.210> they<00:00:42.360> start<00:00:42.809> out

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
they have no skills when they start out

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.569 
they have no skills when they start out
this<00:00:44.670> makes<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.270> bit<00:00:45.719> difficult<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.579> or

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
this makes it a bit difficult for or

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.189 
this makes it a bit difficult for or
teams<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.590> level<00:00:49.590> their<00:00:49.860> black<00:00:50.430> works<00:00:51.199> since

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
teams to level their black works since

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.600 
teams to level their black works since
they<00:00:52.649> don't<00:00:53.010> come<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.219> any<00:00:53.579> skills<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:56.129> if

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
they don't come with any skills so if

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.369 
they don't come with any skills so if
they<00:00:57.059> face<00:00:57.329> someone<00:00:57.719> who<00:00:57.840> has<00:00:57.989> blocked

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
they face someone who has blocked

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.840 
they face someone who has blocked
they're<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.190> trouble<00:00:59.370> and<00:01:00.890> they<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.550> rely

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
they're in trouble and they have to rely

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.370 
they're in trouble and they have to rely
on<00:01:02.879> either<00:01:03.539> scoring<00:01:04.470> touchdowns<00:01:04.820> which<00:01:05.820> isn't

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
on either scoring touchdowns which isn't

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.039 
on either scoring touchdowns which isn't
you<00:01:07.380> know<00:01:07.439> their<00:01:07.830> strength<00:01:08.659> isn't<00:01:09.659> their

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
you know their strength isn't their

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.109 
you know their strength isn't their
forte<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:12.530> they<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.740> slow<00:01:14.189> move<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.939> and

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
forte and they have slow move so and

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.240 
forte and they have slow move so and
even<00:01:15.420> then<00:01:16.229> they're<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.590> very<00:01:16.830> good<00:01:17.070> at

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
even then they're not very good at

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.010 
even then they're not very good at
scoring<00:01:18.799> they<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:19.979> rely<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.280> MVPs<00:01:21.240> which

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
scoring they can rely on MVPs which

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.410 
scoring they can rely on MVPs which
isn't<00:01:22.729> reliable<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.650> they<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.860> rely<00:01:26.220> on

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
isn't reliable and they can rely on

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.480 
isn't reliable and they can rely on
injuries<00:01:27.420> however<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:28.740> don't<00:01:28.979> start<00:01:29.310> with

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
injuries however they don't start with

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
injuries however they don't start with
mighty<00:01:29.790> blow<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:31.259> know<00:01:32.659> injuring<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
mighty blow so you know injuring the the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.670 
mighty blow so you know injuring the the
opponent<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.280> easy<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.290> lucky

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
opponent is not easy you can be lucky

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.510 
opponent is not easy you can be lucky
this<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.790> that's<00:01:39.030> sure<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.350> know<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:41.369> a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
this so that's sure but you know it's a

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.940 
this so that's sure but you know it's a
bit<00:01:41.700> difficult<00:01:41.930> still<00:01:42.930> you're<00:01:43.649> really

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
bit difficult still you're really

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.060 
bit difficult still you're really
important<00:01:44.810> so<00:01:45.810> I'll<00:01:45.930> by<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.350> least<00:01:46.560> two<00:01:47.450> and

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
important so I'll by at least two and

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.670 
important so I'll by at least two and
take<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> look<00:01:50.280> at<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> Blitzers<00:01:51.950> ah<00:01:53.090> Blitzers

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
take a look at the Blitzers ah Blitzers

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.030 
take a look at the Blitzers ah Blitzers
good<00:01:55.680> move<00:01:56.119> for<00:01:57.119> orcs<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.780> course<00:01:58.040> strength

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
good move for orcs of course strength

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.740 
good move for orcs of course strength
and<00:01:59.219> agility<00:01:59.630> normal<00:02:00.630> at<00:02:00.840> three<00:02:02.119> armored<00:02:03.119> nine

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and agility normal at three armored nine

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.990 
and agility normal at three armored nine
no<00:02:04.619> problem<00:02:05.100> there<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:07.369> they<00:02:08.369> do<00:02:08.429> come<00:02:08.819> with

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
no problem there and they do come with

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.750 
no problem there and they do come with
the<00:02:09.119> block<00:02:09.360> skill<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.190> really<00:02:11.489> good

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
the block skill so this is really good

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.400 
the block skill so this is really good
for<00:02:11.910> them

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
for them

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.280 
for them
so<00:02:13.980> you'll<00:02:14.160> probably<00:02:14.520> use<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.600> want<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.050> have

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
so you'll probably use you want to have

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.480 
so you'll probably use you want to have
a<00:02:16.320> couple<00:02:16.830> at<00:02:17.040> least<00:02:17.310> when<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.640> start<00:02:17.970> out<00:02:19.490> so

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
a couple at least when you start out so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:28.840 
a couple at least when you start out so
let's<00:02:20.900> buy<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> couple<00:02:22.820> and<00:02:24.890> lineman<00:02:26.420> pretty

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
let's buy a couple and lineman pretty

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.390 
let's buy a couple and lineman pretty
usual<00:02:29.850> stuff<00:02:30.390> they<00:02:31.230> do<00:02:31.380> have<00:02:31.620> better<00:02:32.070> move

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
usual stuff they do have better move

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.470 
usual stuff they do have better move
than<00:02:32.840> Blackhawks<00:02:34.100> strength<00:02:35.100> same<00:02:35.520> thing<00:02:35.820> as<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
than Blackhawks strength same thing as a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.020 
than Blackhawks strength same thing as a
thrower<00:02:36.930> or<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.350> Blitzer<00:02:37.800> but<00:02:38.520> they<00:02:38.610> do<00:02:38.670> have

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
thrower or a Blitzer but they do have

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.420 
thrower or a Blitzer but they do have
good<00:02:39.240> armor<00:02:39.630> at<00:02:39.810> nine<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.890> they're<00:02:41.100> pretty

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
good armor at nine so they're pretty

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.790 
good armor at nine so they're pretty
durable<00:02:41.790> they<00:02:42.660> don't<00:02:42.960> have<00:02:43.200> any<00:02:43.380> skills

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
durable they don't have any skills

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.240 
durable they don't have any skills
though<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.700> that's<00:02:45.360> always<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.990> problem<00:02:46.320> it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
though so that's always a problem it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.850 
though so that's always a problem it
will<00:02:47.400> be<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> bit<00:02:47.820> difficult<00:02:48.410> when<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.500> start

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
will be a bit difficult when you start

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.690 
will be a bit difficult when you start
out<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.570> might<00:02:51.570> lose<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.930> few<00:02:52.260> games<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:53.520> might

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
out you might lose a few games you might

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.420 
out you might lose a few games you might

amount of money usually you'll want to

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.630 
amount of money usually you'll want to
keep<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.610> course<00:04:03.830> it's<00:04:04.830> enough<00:04:05.130> money<00:04:05.400> to

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
buy another lineman which would give you

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.900 
buy another lineman which would give you
one<00:04:08.489> player<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.720> replace<00:04:10.620> anyone<00:04:11.130> injured<00:04:11.670> and

one player to replace anyone injured and

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.409 
one player to replace anyone injured and
that's<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:13.380> very<00:04:15.680> debatable<00:04:16.680> choice<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.489> it

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
that's a very debatable choice and it

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.320 
that's a very debatable choice and it
can<00:04:18.630> be<00:04:18.780> very<00:04:18.810> good<00:04:19.549> however<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.820> can<00:04:20.850> always

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
can be very good however you can always

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.170 
can be very good however you can always
keep<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.780> money<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.350> aim<00:04:23.160> for<00:04:23.190> someone

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
keep the money and aim for someone

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.270 
keep the money and aim for someone
better<00:04:24.360> like<00:04:24.900> black<00:04:25.440> or<00:04:25.620> girl<00:04:25.800> it's<00:04:26.100> or

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
better like black or girl it's or

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.210 
better like black or girl it's or
probably<00:04:26.640> blitz

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
probably blitz

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.850 
probably blitz
since<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.610> already<00:04:27.640> have<00:04:28.330> three<00:04:29.020> black<00:04:29.470> quarks

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
since I already have three black quarks

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.380 
since I already have three black quarks
and<00:04:31.230> you<00:04:32.230> would<00:04:32.410> be<00:04:32.560> able<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:33.040> get<00:04:33.790> one<00:04:34.030> in

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
and you would be able to get one in

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
and you would be able to get one in
probably<00:04:35.110> one<00:04:35.410> or<00:04:35.440> two<00:04:35.890> games<00:04:36.810> so<00:04:37.810> it's<00:04:38.200> your

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
probably one or two games so it's your

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.220 
probably one or two games so it's your
choice<00:04:39.060> personally<00:04:40.060> I'll<00:04:40.300> just<00:04:40.660> keep<00:04:40.870> it<00:04:41.020> like

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
choice personally I'll just keep it like

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.250 
choice personally I'll just keep it like
this<00:04:42.630> this<00:04:43.630> way<00:04:43.990> we<00:04:44.980> do<00:04:45.130> end<00:04:45.400> up<00:04:45.610> with<00:04:46.540> 11

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
team a bit slow but durable probably not

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
as durable as dwarves but still very

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.990 
as durable as dwarves but still very

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
passing game you'll probably just be

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.900 
passing game you'll probably just be
running<00:05:24.640> it<00:05:25.000> with<00:05:25.030> the<00:05:25.330> ball<00:05:26.280> probably<00:05:27.280> using

running it with the ball probably using

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
players really make the difference here
