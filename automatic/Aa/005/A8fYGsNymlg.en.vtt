 soak your fish glue 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.360
 in water for 10 minutes 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.610

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.040
 pour everything 1 2 a small saucepan 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:58.670
 and melt it all 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:01:00.100
 on the side here is once the glue 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.250
 fish has melted well 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.280

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.369
 start kneading everything with your 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.369
 hands 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.899
 until you have obtained a 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.899
 ball of dough 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.780
 then take the 50 g of sugar 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.570
