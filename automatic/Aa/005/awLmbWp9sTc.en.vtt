playing but before I try to answer you
I'd<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.170> start<00:00:19.350> by<00:00:19.470> making<00:00:19.650> a

on a long series of failures let me
explain

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.389 

perhaps<00:00:44.929> the<00:00:45.109> most<00:00:45.260> defining<00:00:45.679> characteristic

perhaps the most defining characteristic
of<00:00:46.460> our<00:00:46.609> species<00:00:46.850> is<00:00:47.239> how<00:00:47.390> we<00:00:47.449> approach
