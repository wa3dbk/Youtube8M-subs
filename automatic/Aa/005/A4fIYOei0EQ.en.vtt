to be reading your movement it can now
look<00:01:24.600> at<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.900> muscle<00:01:25.350> impact<00:01:25.799> your<00:01:26.040> weight

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
look at your muscle impact your weight

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.859 
look at your muscle impact your weight
transfer<00:01:26.820> from<00:01:27.000> your<00:01:27.360> left<00:01:27.540> foot<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> your

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
transfer from your left foot to your

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.630 
transfer from your left foot to your
right<00:01:27.960> foot<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.829> even<00:01:29.100> read<00:01:29.430> your

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
right foot and if you even read your

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
right foot and if you even read your
heartbeat<00:01:30.090> i<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.509> by<00:01:30.630> looking<00:01:31.079> at<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
heartbeat i think by looking at the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.960 
heartbeat i think by looking at the
pigmentation<00:01:31.920> on<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.369> skin<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.670> things

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
pigmentation on your skin and things

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.940 
pigmentation on your skin and things
like<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.720> too<00:01:33.869> complex<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.350> me<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.680> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
like that it's too complex for me but it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.499 
like that it's too complex for me but it
can<00:01:35.130> actually<00:01:35.520> read<00:01:35.790> your<00:01:36.000> heartbeat<00:01:36.270> so

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
can actually read your heartbeat so

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.999 
can actually read your heartbeat so
that's<00:01:36.659> gonna<00:01:36.750> be<00:01:36.810> great<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.229> exercise<00:01:37.680> games

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that's gonna be great for exercise games

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.530 
that's gonna be great for exercise games
