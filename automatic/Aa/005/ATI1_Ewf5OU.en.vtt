00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
paying attention I guess and then you

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.659 
paying attention I guess and then you
can<00:04:39.080> see<00:04:39.169> like<00:04:39.350> there's<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.740> bodega<00:04:40.220> logo

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
right here on the tab the upper itself

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.780 
right here on the tab the upper itself
is<00:04:46.190> like<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.400> combination<00:04:46.790> like<00:04:47.240> nylon<00:04:47.660> and

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
is like a combination like nylon and

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.659 
is like a combination like nylon and
reflective<00:04:49.840> mesh<00:04:50.840> not<00:04:51.169> on<00:04:51.320> sat<00:04:51.560> mesh<00:04:51.740> but<00:04:52.400> like

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
reflective mesh not on sat mesh but like

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.840 
reflective mesh not on sat mesh but like
you<00:04:52.820> can<00:04:52.910> see<00:04:53.060> right<00:04:53.090> here<00:04:54.220> in<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.669> right

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
you can see right here in the right

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.640 
you can see right here in the right
light<00:04:56.060> they<00:04:56.210> are<00:04:56.240> reflective<00:04:56.930> so<00:04:57.169> these<00:04:57.380> will

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
light they are reflective so these will

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.250 
light they are reflective so these will
shine<00:04:57.950> bright<00:04:58.250> kind<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.270> like<00:04:59.450> you<00:04:59.690> know<00:04:59.720> stars

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
shine bright kind of like you know stars

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.060 
shine bright kind of like you know stars
I<00:05:00.590> guess<00:05:00.800> out<00:05:01.010> in<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.340> space<00:05:02.830> amidst<00:05:03.830> the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
I guess out in the space amidst the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.370 
I guess out in the space amidst the
black<00:05:04.580> background<00:05:05.210> which<00:05:05.870> kind<00:05:06.110> of<00:05:06.169> gets

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
black background which kind of gets

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.760 
black background which kind of gets
represents<00:05:06.800> like<00:05:06.950> the<00:05:07.100> bleak<00:05:07.850> and<00:05:08.120> hollow

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
represents like the bleak and hollow

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.550 
represents like the bleak and hollow
darkness<00:05:09.770> of<00:05:10.190> space<00:05:11.050> again<00:05:12.050> see<00:05:12.229> like<00:05:12.470> you

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
darkness of space again see like you

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.600 
darkness of space again see like you
