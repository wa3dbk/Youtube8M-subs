today is gonna be a hood where we look

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.099 
today is gonna be a hood where we look
at<00:00:23.490> sin<00:00:23.699> that's<00:00:23.850> shrouded<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:24.720> some

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
at sin that's shrouded with some

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.830 
at sin that's shrouded with some
controversy<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.130> before<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.519> begin<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.029> do<00:00:27.539> not

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
controversy so before we begin I do not

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.960 
controversy so before we begin I do not
condone<00:00:28.199> using<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.710> tactic<00:00:29.189> I'm<00:00:29.429> doing<00:00:29.849> this

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
condone using this tactic I'm doing this

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.060 
condone using this tactic I'm doing this
purely<00:00:30.359> because<00:00:30.840> I'm<00:00:30.990> curious<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> still

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
purely because I'm curious if it still

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.120 
purely because I'm curious if it still
works<00:00:32.690> and<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:34.140> you've<00:00:34.260> read<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.530> title<00:00:34.980> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
works and if you've read the title and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.350 
works and if you've read the title and
you<00:00:35.579> still<00:00:35.760> don't<00:00:35.940> know<00:00:35.969> what<00:00:36.149> I'm<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.300> about

you still don't know what I'm on about

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.060 
you still don't know what I'm on about
was<00:00:37.020> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> be<00:00:37.290> talking<00:00:37.530> about<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.829> grid

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
was going to be talking about the grid

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.760 
was going to be talking about the grid
tactic<00:00:38.550> today<00:00:38.850> which<00:00:39.629> was<00:00:39.840> an<00:00:39.960> exploit<00:00:40.500> in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
tactic today which was an exploit in

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.549 
tactic today which was an exploit in
football<00:00:41.160> manager<00:00:41.420> 2012<00:00:42.420> which<00:00:43.140> basically

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
football manager 2012 which basically

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.209 
football manager 2012 which basically
broke<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.399> match<00:00:44.579> engine<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.570> badly<00:00:46.219> it'd

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
broke the match engine really badly it'd

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
broke the match engine really badly it'd
be<00:00:47.520> used<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.879> stuff<00:00:48.090> like<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.360> corner<00:00:48.750> glitch

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
be used to stuff like the corner glitch

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.029 
be used to stuff like the corner glitch
if<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.320> don't<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> corner

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
if you don't know what the corner

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.069 
if you don't know what the corner
glitches<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:51.420> basically<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.750> way<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.870> could

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
glitches it's basically a way you could

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
glitches it's basically a way you could
help<00:00:52.320> your<00:00:52.440> corners<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.039> your<00:00:53.190> player<00:00:53.399> would

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
help your corners so your player would

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
help your corners so your player would
score<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:53.969> every<00:00:54.480> corner<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:54.960> came<00:00:55.230> in<00:00:55.469> and

going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.710> using<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.520> edited<00:01:27.330> version

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
going to be using the edited version

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
going to be using the edited version
from<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> physical<00:01:28.470> technical<00:01:28.770> test<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.369> in

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
from the physical technical test so in

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.609 
from the physical technical test so in
that<00:01:29.820> test<00:01:30.150> they<00:01:30.659> always<00:01:30.990> finish<00:01:31.290> between

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
that test they always finish between

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.230 
that test they always finish between
seventh<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.159> nine<00:01:32.430> for<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> Grimsby<00:01:33.210> Town

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
seventh and nine for the Grimsby Town

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.569 
seventh and nine for the Grimsby Town
team<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.960> it'll<00:01:34.560> give<00:01:34.710> me<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.009> idea<00:01:35.400> if

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
team so it'll give me a good idea if

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.980 
team so it'll give me a good idea if
they<00:01:35.700> finish<00:01:35.850> higher<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> league<00:01:36.570> that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
they finish higher up the league that

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.429 
they finish higher up the league that
this<00:01:37.140> tactic<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.590> doing<00:01:37.920> something<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.610> them

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
this tactic is doing something for them

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.840 
this tactic is doing something for them
so<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> said<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:40.890> tactic<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
so as I said this tactic this is the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.490 
so as I said this tactic this is the
grid<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.630> here<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.200> an

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
grid what you can see here it's an

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.370 
grid what you can see here it's an
tactic<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:44.640> very<00:01:45.000> much<00:01:45.090> broke<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.990> game<00:01:46.170> in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
tactic which very much broke the game in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.190 
tactic which very much broke the game in
football<00:01:46.710> magic<00:01:47.009> 2012<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.509> was<00:01:48.659> possible<00:01:49.140> to

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
lost on penalties so it would appear

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.800 
lost on penalties so it would appear
that<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.640> grid<00:03:11.819> tactic<00:03:12.180> doesn't<00:03:12.480> work<00:03:12.599> on

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
multiple leaks we can really test this

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.849

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
but already it's looking like it just

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.159 
know why it's not working but I was
curious<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.970> see<00:03:24.000> if<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.269> still<00:03:24.299> worked<00:03:24.690> but

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
curious to see if it still worked but

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.129 
curious to see if it still worked but
we'll<00:03:25.680> see<00:03:25.829> what<00:03:26.040> happens

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
we'll see what happens

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.569 
we'll see what happens
ok<00:03:28.139> so<00:03:28.200> we're<00:03:28.440> now<00:03:28.500> looking<00:03:28.530> at<00:03:28.859> carlile<00:03:29.310> here

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
ok so we're now looking at carlile here

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.119 
ok so we're now looking at carlile here
in<00:03:29.700> Ligue<00:03:29.879> 1<00:03:29.910> they<00:03:30.840> finish<00:03:31.169> 8th<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:31.919> year

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
in Ligue 1 they finish 8th this year

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.979 
in Ligue 1 they finish 8th this year
which<00:03:32.250> isn't<00:03:32.400> actually<00:03:32.639> too<00:03:33.090> bad<00:03:33.329> by<00:03:33.510> Carlile

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
which isn't actually too bad by Carlile

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.449 
which isn't actually too bad by Carlile
standards<00:03:34.470> you've<00:03:34.590> also<00:03:34.799> got<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.040> bear<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.310> mind

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
standards you've also got a bear in mind

standards you've also got a bear in mind
I<00:03:35.639> didn't<00:03:36.090> sign<00:03:36.359> anyone<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.109> perhaps<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:38.099> a

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
I didn't sign anyone so perhaps it a

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.759 
I didn't sign anyone so perhaps it a
hint<00:03:38.609> that<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:38.970> might<00:03:39.269> be<00:03:39.450> working<00:03:39.769> looking

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
hint that this might be working looking

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.759 
hint that this might be working looking
at<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:40.950> goal<00:03:41.129> scorers<00:03:42.260> there's<00:03:43.260> no<00:03:43.410> really

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
at the goal scorers there's no really

crazy Gold scores to tell you about but

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.030 
crazy Gold scores to tell you about but
the<00:03:45.449> free<00:03:45.660> strikers<00:03:46.169> has<00:03:46.319> certainly<00:03:46.650> grabbed

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
the free strikers has certainly grabbed

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
grabbing a few goals so looking like

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.479 
grabbing a few goals so looking like
there<00:03:52.230> were<00:03:52.290> goals<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:52.769> nothing<00:03:53.190> like<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
there were goals but nothing like the

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.089 
there were goals but nothing like the

2012 if we're honest which doesn't

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.830 
2012 if we're honest which doesn't
really<00:03:59.549> surprise<00:03:59.730> me<00:03:59.910> because<00:04:00.120> on<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.599> game

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
really surprise me because on this game

they<00:04:01.049> did<00:04:01.230> actually<00:04:01.560> change<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:02.040> match

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
they did actually change the match

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.699 
they did actually change the match
engine<00:04:02.459> so<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.389> would<00:04:03.540> quickly<00:04:03.810> explain<00:04:04.530> why

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
engine so that would quickly explain why

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.349 
engine so that would quickly explain why
it's<00:04:04.889> not<00:04:05.040> working<00:04:05.099> but<00:04:05.699> of<00:04:05.819> course<00:04:06.090> from<00:04:06.209> my

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
it's not working but of course from my

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.720 
it's not working but of course from my
own<00:04:06.480> curiosity<00:04:06.720> after<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.560> guys<00:04:07.769> I<00:04:08.069> did<00:04:08.549> want

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
own curiosity after you guys I did want

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.089 
own curiosity after you guys I did want
to<00:04:08.849> test<00:04:09.060> this<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.359> see<00:04:09.389> if<00:04:09.629> it<00:04:09.780> worked<00:04:09.989> so<00:04:10.319> here

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
to test this to see if it worked so here

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.979 
to test this to see if it worked so here
car<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:11.730> finished<00:04:12.060> 8th<00:04:12.209> which<00:04:12.540> is<00:04:12.690> above

average<00:04:13.169> which<00:04:13.650> makes<00:04:13.889> you<00:04:14.010> wonder<00:04:14.160> if<00:04:14.370> it's

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
average which makes you wonder if it's

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.250 
average which makes you wonder if it's
just<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.000> good<00:04:15.209> tactic<00:04:15.629> on<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:15.870> game<00:04:16.079> rather

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
just a good tactic on this game rather

than a PR exploit but now though this

than a PR exploit but now though this
looks<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.789> know<00:04:20.910> promising<00:04:21.449> I<00:04:21.539> suppose

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
looks you know promising I suppose

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.830 
looks you know promising I suppose
they've<00:04:22.079> played<00:04:22.320> ok<00:04:22.940> with<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.180> kind<00:04:24.780> of

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
they've played ok with this kind of

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.030 
they've played ok with this kind of
setup

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
setup

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.790 
setup
but<00:04:26.640> nothing<00:04:26.970> kind<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.300> too<00:04:27.750> game-changing<00:04:28.590> so

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
but nothing kind of too game-changing so

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.500 
but nothing kind of too game-changing so
we'll<00:04:28.980> just<00:04:29.190> check<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.700> last<00:04:29.880> one<00:04:30.210> really

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
we'll just check the last one really

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.640 
we'll just check the last one really
quickly<00:04:30.870> which<00:04:31.830> is<00:04:32.010> the<00:04:32.220> physical<00:04:32.700> team<00:04:32.970> and

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
quickly which is the physical team and

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.080 
quickly which is the physical team and
where<00:04:34.650> did<00:04:34.920> they<00:04:35.100> finish<00:04:35.550> in<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.880> league

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:47.630 

fourth<00:04:39.920> okay<00:04:40.920> um<00:04:42.890> that<00:04:43.890> makes<00:04:44.070> me<00:04:44.280> wonder<00:04:46.640> that

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
fourth okay um that makes me wonder that

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.130 
fourth okay um that makes me wonder that
shouldn't<00:04:48.150> have<00:04:48.270> happened

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
shouldn't have happened

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.530 
shouldn't have happened
well<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.310> could<00:04:50.910> have<00:04:51.000> happened<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.480> suppose

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
well it could have happened I suppose

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.270 
well it could have happened I suppose
basically<00:04:52.350> when<00:04:52.500> I<00:04:52.530> did<00:04:52.740> this<00:04:52.890> test<00:04:53.100> before

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
when I did my test before and I just

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.980 
when I did my test before and I just
went<00:05:04.890> on<00:05:04.950> holiday<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.670> left<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.300> computer

I<00:05:42.330> can<00:05:42.570> see<00:05:42.780> every<00:05:43.650> doesn't<00:05:43.950> look<00:05:44.040> like<00:05:44.160> the

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
I can see every doesn't look like the

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.920 
I can see every doesn't look like the
grid<00:05:44.490> tactic<00:05:44.850> worked<00:05:45.060> on<00:05:45.300> this<00:05:45.390> which<00:05:45.600> doesn't

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
grid tactic worked on this which doesn't

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.180 
grid tactic worked on this which doesn't
surprise<00:05:46.050> me<00:05:46.230> because<00:05:46.410> as<00:05:46.650> I<00:05:46.770> said<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.010> match

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
surprise me because as I said the match

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.570 
surprise me because as I said the match
engine<00:05:47.430> changed<00:05:48.150> but<00:05:48.960> this<00:05:49.410> does<00:05:49.680> leave<00:05:49.920> the

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
engine changed but this does leave the

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.270 
engine changed but this does leave the
question<00:05:50.940> does<00:05:51.150> the<00:05:51.360> grid<00:05:51.660> as<00:05:51.870> a<00:05:51.930> tactic<00:05:52.560> in<00:05:52.740> FM

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
question does the grid as a tactic in FM

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.150 
question does the grid as a tactic in FM
13<00:05:53.850> kind<00:05:54.810> of<00:05:54.900> present<00:05:55.320> itself<00:05:55.620> as<00:05:55.800> a<00:05:55.860> viable

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
13 kind of present itself as a viable

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.520 
13 kind of present itself as a viable
tactic<00:05:56.790> normally<00:05:57.420> because<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:58.230> amount

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
tactic normally because the amount

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.290 
tactic normally because the amount
engine<00:05:58.920> did<00:05:59.100> change<00:05:59.400> between<00:05:59.790> football<00:05:59.940> to

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
engine did change between football to

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.020 
engine did change between football to
2012<00:06:01.050> and<00:06:01.200> 2013<00:06:01.860> which<00:06:02.370> meant<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.700> stuff

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
2012 and 2013 which meant that stuff

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.570 
2012 and 2013 which meant that stuff
like<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.900> free<00:06:04.230> striker<00:06:04.650> exploits<00:06:05.310> in<00:06:05.490> the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
like the free striker exploits in the

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.580 
like the free striker exploits in the
corner<00:06:05.940> glitch<00:06:06.120> which<00:06:06.330> were<00:06:06.510> used<00:06:06.810> with<00:06:07.380> this

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590 
corner glitch which were used with this

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.120 
corner glitch which were used with this
tactic<00:06:08.630> did<00:06:09.630> don't<00:06:09.870> work<00:06:10.080> in<00:06:10.260> this<00:06:10.380> game<00:06:10.620> but

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
tactic did don't work in this game but

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.280 
tactic did don't work in this game but
to<00:06:11.370> see<00:06:11.550> them<00:06:11.700> finish<00:06:11.970> forth<00:06:12.240> leads<00:06:13.080> me<00:06:13.260> to

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
to see them finish forth leads me to

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.020 
to see them finish forth leads me to
believe<00:06:13.470> that<00:06:13.830> this<00:06:13.950> taunting<00:06:14.400> may<00:06:14.610> just<00:06:14.910> be

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
believe that this taunting may just be

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.330 
believe that this taunting may just be
viable<00:06:15.510> as<00:06:15.630> a<00:06:15.660> half-decent<00:06:16.290> tactic<00:06:16.980> in<00:06:17.130> some

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
viable as a half-decent tactic in some

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.460 
viable as a half-decent tactic in some
situations<00:06:19.820> yeah<00:06:20.820> so<00:06:21.360> I<00:06:21.570> guess<00:06:22.140> that's<00:06:22.350> the

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
situations yeah so I guess that's the

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.780 
situations yeah so I guess that's the
result<00:06:22.740> so<00:06:22.860> we<00:06:22.950> can<00:06:23.100> draw<00:06:23.280> from<00:06:23.400> this<00:06:23.520> it's

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
result so we can draw from this it's

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.060 
result so we can draw from this it's
kind<00:06:23.940> of<00:06:23.970> just<00:06:24.150> a<00:06:24.300> test<00:06:24.930> out<00:06:25.080> of<00:06:25.170> curiosity<00:06:25.860> but

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070 
kind of just a test out of curiosity but

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.650 
kind of just a test out of curiosity but
you<00:06:26.400> know<00:06:26.520> you<00:06:26.580> hear<00:06:26.850> a<00:06:26.880> lot<00:06:27.060> about<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.450> grid

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
you know you hear a lot about the grid

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.110 
you know you hear a lot about the grid
tactic<00:06:28.170> so<00:06:28.410> hopefully<00:06:29.130> this<00:06:29.310> does<00:06:29.700> kind<00:06:30.090> of

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
tactic so hopefully this does kind of

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.150 
tactic so hopefully this does kind of
just<00:06:30.300> Clary<00:06:30.570> for<00:06:30.930> kind<00:06:31.230> of<00:06:31.320> clarified<00:06:31.740> that<00:06:31.950> it

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
just Clary for kind of clarified that it

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.860 
just Clary for kind of clarified that it

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
all in all fairly standard results what

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.100 
all in all fairly standard results what
I<00:06:43.650> was<00:06:43.800> expecting<00:06:44.520> but<00:06:44.550> it's<00:06:45.300> kind<00:06:45.630> of<00:06:45.690> good<00:06:45.930> to

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
I was expecting but it's kind of good to

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.779 
I was expecting but it's kind of good to
kind<00:06:46.650> of<00:06:46.740> I<00:06:46.919> guess<00:06:48.380> denying<00:06:49.380> or<00:06:49.800> /<00:06:50.099> confirm<00:06:50.580> the

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789 
kind of I guess denying or / confirm the

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:52.100 
kind of I guess denying or / confirm the
myth<00:06:50.970> they<00:06:51.030> no<00:06:51.449> longer<00:06:51.780> works<00:06:51.960> because

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
myth they no longer works because

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.240 
myth they no longer works because
clearly<00:06:52.620> it<00:06:52.830> doesn't<00:06:53.870> yeah<00:06:54.870> I<00:06:55.080> don't<00:06:56.069> really

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
clearly it doesn't yeah I don't really

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.740 
clearly it doesn't yeah I don't really
know<00:06:56.370> what<00:06:56.520> else<00:06:56.610> to<00:06:56.729> say<00:06:57.030> this<00:06:57.210> was<00:06:57.509> just

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
know what else to say this was just

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.870 
know what else to say this was just
really<00:06:57.900> a<00:06:57.990> one-off<00:06:58.229> test<00:06:58.590> it's<00:06:59.340> proved<00:06:59.759> the

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 
really a one-off test it's proved the

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.089 
really a one-off test it's proved the
point<00:07:00.060> and<00:07:00.479> I<00:07:00.900> feel<00:07:00.930> very<00:07:01.380> content<00:07:01.800> with<00:07:01.889> these

point and I feel very content with these

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:05.330 
point and I feel very content with these

you enjoyed this video testing out the

you enjoyed this video testing out the
