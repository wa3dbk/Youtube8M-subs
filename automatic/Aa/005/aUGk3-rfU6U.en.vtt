they don't understand is that you know
these<00:00:37.260> muscle<00:00:37.680> imbalances<00:00:38.250> or<00:00:38.309> weaknesses

certified it's one of the things on the
squat<00:00:47.280> assessment<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.879> mean<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.180> may<00:00:48.300> sound

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
squat assessment I mean it may sound

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.779 
squat assessment I mean it may sound
boring<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:48.989> may<00:00:49.110> not<00:00:49.230> be<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.379> big<00:00:49.559> deal<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.430> I

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
boring you may not be a big deal and I

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.010 
boring you may not be a big deal and I
really<00:00:51.030> didn't<00:00:51.180> think<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.539> big<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.899> a

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
really didn't think it was that big of a

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.569 
really didn't think it was that big of a
deal<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.860> don't<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.399> be

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
deal but you don't really have to be

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.250 
deal but you don't really have to be
personal<00:00:53.969> trainer<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> understand<00:00:54.660> why<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
personal trainer to understand why a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
personal trainer to understand why a
symmetry<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.280> shifting<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.940> squad<00:00:57.300> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
symmetry or a shifting of the squad is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.569 
symmetry or a shifting of the squad is
really<00:00:57.719> bad<00:00:57.899> over<00:00:58.199> time<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:59.010> you're<00:00:59.219> shifting

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
really bad over time if you're shifting

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.939 
really bad over time if you're shifting
on<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> squat<00:01:00.090> let's<00:01:00.329> say<00:01:00.449> like<00:01:00.600> 185<00:01:01.230> pounds<00:01:01.829> or

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
on a squat let's say like 185 pounds or

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.619 
on a squat let's say like 185 pounds or
fairly<00:01:02.280> lightweight<00:01:02.550> well<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.449> gonna<00:01:03.539> end

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
fairly lightweight well it's gonna end

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.000 
fairly lightweight well it's gonna end
up<00:01:03.750> happening<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.559> go<00:01:04.650> up<00:01:04.680> in<00:01:04.890> weight

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
up happening is as you go up in weight

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.560 
up happening is as you go up in weight
and<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> can't<00:01:05.640> control<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.090> shift<00:01:06.360> you're

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and you can't control the shift you're

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.820 
and you can't control the shift you're
going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> load<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.170> side<00:01:07.380> more<00:01:07.650> than<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
going to load one side more than the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.010 
going to load one side more than the
other<00:01:08.100> leading<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.030> some<00:01:09.210> overuse<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.840> one

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
other leading to some overuse on one

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.560 
other leading to some overuse on one
side<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.880> kind<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.119> want<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
side so what you kind of want to do is

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090 
side so what you kind of want to do is
you<00:01:12.600> want<00:01:12.659> tribest<00:01:13.200> asymmetrical<00:01:14.010> as

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
you want tribest asymmetrical as

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.440 
you want tribest asymmetrical as
possible<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.700> what<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.850> found<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
possible and what I found with the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.120 
possible and what I found with the
Pascua<00:01:16.140> de<00:01:16.259> pascua<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.040> those

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
Pascua de pascua is one of those

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.530 
Pascua de pascua is one of those
movements<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:18.090> allow<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
movements that actually allow you to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.600 
movements that actually allow you to
really<00:01:18.720> concentrate<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.619> feeling<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
really concentrate and feeling all the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
really concentrate and feeling all the
right<00:01:20.880> muscles<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.600> right<00:01:21.780> times<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
right muscles and the right times the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.810 
right muscles and the right times the
right<00:01:22.500> spots<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.009> kind<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.220> set<00:01:23.400> yourself<00:01:23.700> up

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
right spots to kind of set yourself up

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.039 
right spots to kind of set yourself up
properly<00:01:24.270> because<00:01:24.450> that's<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:24.960> I'm

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
properly because that's kind of what I'm

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.070 
properly because that's kind of what I'm
noticing<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.369> pause<00:01:26.610> at<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> bottom<00:01:27.090> you

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
noticing so as I pause at the bottom you

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
noticing so as I pause at the bottom you
know<00:01:28.200> I'm<00:01:28.320> finding<00:01:28.740> some<00:01:28.770> weaknesses<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.549> as

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
know I'm finding some weaknesses and as

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.429 
know I'm finding some weaknesses and as
I<00:01:29.790> go<00:01:29.939> heavier<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.990> know<00:01:31.110> there's<00:01:31.320> usually

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
I go heavier you know there's usually

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.960 
I go heavier you know there's usually
going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.829> one<00:01:32.130> side<00:01:32.430> that's<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> be

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
going to be one side that's going to be

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.700 
going to be one side that's going to be
able<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.299> take<00:01:33.509> off<00:01:33.750> more<00:01:34.259> than<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> other

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
able to take off more than the other

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.740 
able to take off more than the other
essentially<00:01:35.700> when<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.880> grind<00:01:36.180> through<00:01:36.450> some

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
essentially when you grind through some

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.810 
essentially when you grind through some
reps<00:01:37.040> especially<00:01:38.040> when<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.369> especially

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
reps especially when you get especially

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.690 
reps especially when you get especially
on<00:01:38.909> my<00:01:39.000> reps<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.390> pascua<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.140> higher<00:01:40.700> it's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
on my reps on pascua to get higher it's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.280 
on my reps on pascua to get higher it's
going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.850> make<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> big<00:01:42.090> difference<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
going to make a big difference here is a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.170 
going to make a big difference here is a
side<00:01:43.619> view<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.220> decided<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.820> couldn't<00:01:45.000> side

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
side view so decided I couldn't side

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.639 
side view so decided I couldn't side
views<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.630> mixing<00:01:45.869> things<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.229> just<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> can

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
views and mixing things up just so I can

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.260 
views and mixing things up just so I can
see<00:01:46.890> my<00:01:47.040> hips<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> big<00:01:47.759> part<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:48.060> why<00:01:48.210> do

force six sets of four repetitions and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.780

it<00:02:10.379> turned<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.709> be<00:02:10.890> pretty<00:02:11.039> good<00:02:11.370> i<00:02:11.400> like

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
it turned out to be pretty good i like

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.190 
it turned out to be pretty good i like
the<00:02:11.970> weight<00:02:12.150> i<00:02:12.450> thought<00:02:12.930> was<00:02:13.050> kind<00:02:13.110> of

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the weight i thought was kind of

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.670 
the weight i thought was kind of
interesting

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
interesting

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.979 
interesting
that<00:02:13.799> I<00:02:13.829> felt<00:02:14.400> pretty<00:02:14.519> strong<00:02:14.849> today<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
that I felt pretty strong today so the

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.319 
that I felt pretty strong today so the
weight<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.200> used<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.829> today<00:02:17.549> which<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.790> Thursday

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329

my<00:02:18.739> thursday<00:02:19.739> work<00:02:19.920> out<00:02:20.069> it's<00:02:20.310> basically<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
my thursday work out it's basically the

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.179 
my thursday work out it's basically the
same<00:02:20.989> just<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.109> few<00:02:22.290> pounds<00:02:22.620> lighter<00:02:23.370> than<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
same just a few pounds lighter than the

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.250 
same just a few pounds lighter than the
than<00:02:26.189> the<00:02:26.219> way<00:02:26.400> i<00:02:26.430> did<00:02:26.549> on<00:02:26.730> Monday<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.049> think

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
than the way i did on Monday and I think

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.959 
than the way i did on Monday and I think
I<00:02:28.319> know<00:02:28.349> why<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.680> pics<00:02:29.010> repetition<00:02:29.579> schemes<00:02:29.849> the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
I know why I pics repetition schemes the

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.160 
I know why I pics repetition schemes the
way<00:02:30.060> he<00:02:30.180> does<00:02:30.329> it<00:02:30.359> so<00:02:30.629> that<00:02:30.750> that's<00:02:30.930> what

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
way he does it so that that's what

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.619 
way he does it so that that's what
happens<00:02:31.560> your<00:02:32.219> for<00:02:32.579> reps<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.000> six<00:02:33.239> reps<00:02:33.480> so

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
happens your for reps and six reps so

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.149 
happens your for reps and six reps so
whatever<00:02:34.019> you<00:02:34.139> do<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> for<00:02:34.560> rap<00:02:34.739> should<00:02:35.069> be

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
whatever you do a for rap should be

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.199 
whatever you do a for rap should be
pretty<00:02:35.310> close<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.700> what<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.879> do<00:02:35.969> with<00:02:36.060> six

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
pretty close to what you do with six

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.729 
pretty close to what you do with six
reps<00:02:36.480> at<00:02:36.629> least<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.959> beginning<00:02:37.079> for<00:02:37.409> sure

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
reps at least in the beginning for sure

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.319 
reps at least in the beginning for sure
and<00:02:38.010> then<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.639> get<00:02:38.730> stronger<00:02:39.000> those

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
and then as you get stronger those

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.300 
and then as you get stronger those
things<00:02:39.569> will<00:02:39.719> start<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.959> kind<00:02:40.139> of<00:02:40.310> divide

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
things will start to kind of divide

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.220 
things will start to kind of divide
apart<00:02:41.790> because<00:02:41.969> on<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.299> heavy<00:02:42.510> day<00:02:42.719> you<00:02:42.780> want

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
apart because on the heavy day you want

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.319 
apart because on the heavy day you want
to<00:02:43.349> explode<00:02:43.829> from<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.159> bottom<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.639> then<00:02:45.120> from

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
to explode from the bottom and then from

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.270 
to explode from the bottom and then from
here<00:02:45.359> on<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.750> positive<00:02:46.379> or<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.680> pausing<00:02:47.099> I

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
here on the positive or just pausing I

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.759 
here on the positive or just pausing I
may<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:48.239> really<00:02:48.750> feel<00:02:48.900> like<00:02:48.930> I'm<00:02:49.139> pausing<00:02:49.590> too

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
may I really feel like I'm pausing too

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.979 
may I really feel like I'm pausing too
long<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.549> I'm<00:02:50.639> all<00:02:50.970> over<00:02:51.239> critical<00:02:51.569> with

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
long but I'm all over critical with

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.899 
long but I'm all over critical with
trying<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.319> make<00:02:52.530> sure<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.829> I<00:02:52.889> stay<00:02:52.950> in<00:02:53.459> a

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
trying to make sure that I stay in a

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.520 
trying to make sure that I stay in a
good<00:02:54.090> position<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.750> then<00:02:54.840> I'm<00:02:54.930> really<00:02:55.290> trying

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
good position and then I'm really trying

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.220 
good position and then I'm really trying
to<00:02:55.709> work<00:02:56.129> on<00:02:56.340> my<00:02:56.489> weaknesses<00:02:57.419> i<00:02:57.840> think<00:02:58.109> this<00:02:58.169> is

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
to work on my weaknesses i think this is

warm-up set of paws deadlifts i'm

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.460 
warm-up set of paws deadlifts i'm
supposed<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.639> do<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.599> resection<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.109> my<00:03:19.199> first

workings<00:03:19.919> at<00:03:20.040> three<00:03:20.310> sets<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:23.299> four

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
workings at three sets of four

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.740 
workings at three sets of four
repetitions<00:03:24.629> i<00:03:25.079> think<00:03:25.290> or<00:03:26.010> 8<00:03:26.159> 12<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.389> it

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
repetitions i think or 8 12 and it

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.030 
repetitions i think or 8 12 and it
worked<00:03:27.900> out<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.079> be<00:03:28.109> pretty<00:03:28.290> cool<00:03:28.530> i<00:03:28.590> liked<00:03:28.889> it

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
worked out to be pretty cool i liked it

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.830 
worked out to be pretty cool i liked it
this<00:03:29.519> is<00:03:29.579> my<00:03:29.639> first<00:03:29.909> time<00:03:30.060> actually<00:03:30.269> doing<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
this is my first time actually doing the

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.330 
this is my first time actually doing the
movement<00:03:31.199> with<00:03:31.319> any<00:03:31.500> type<00:03:31.739> of<00:03:31.769> weight<00:03:32.069> and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
movement with any type of weight and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.550 
movement with any type of weight and
it's<00:03:33.329> interesting<00:03:33.569> because<00:03:33.930> i<00:03:34.079> found<00:03:34.500> that

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
it's interesting because i found that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.920 
it's interesting because i found that
i've<00:03:34.799> done<00:03:34.859> this<00:03:35.189> before<00:03:35.669> I<00:03:35.939> never<00:03:36.750> actually

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
i've done this before I never actually

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.849 
i've done this before I never actually
like<00:03:37.229> paws<00:03:37.500> up<00:03:37.799> at<00:03:37.979> the<00:03:38.040> top<00:03:38.220> here's<00:03:38.659> 335<00:03:39.859> and

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
like paws up at the top here's 335 and

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.759 
like paws up at the top here's 335 and
I'm<00:03:41.220> doing<00:03:41.549> double<00:03:42.030> overhand<00:03:42.900> grip<00:03:43.049> look<00:03:43.650> at

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
I'm doing double overhand grip look at

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.499 
I'm doing double overhand grip look at
that<00:03:43.949> I<00:03:44.159> have<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.519> have<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.269> say<00:03:45.449> something

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:45.509 
that I have to have to say something

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.839 
that I have to have to say something
because<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.379> is<00:03:46.590> takes<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.459> little<00:03:47.579> bit<00:03:47.699> more

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
because that is takes a little bit more

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.759 
because that is takes a little bit more
concentration<00:03:48.479> to<00:03:48.720> do<00:03:48.870> double<00:03:49.199> overhand<00:03:49.530> grip

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
concentration to do double overhand grip

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.170 
concentration to do double overhand grip
to<00:03:50.009> prevent<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.459> from<00:03:50.549> rolling<00:03:50.790> out<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.090> your

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
to prevent it from rolling out of your

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.999 
to prevent it from rolling out of your
fingers<00:03:51.569> so<00:03:51.780> I'm<00:03:52.319> actually<00:03:52.470> quite<00:03:52.709> proud<00:03:52.919> of

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
fingers so I'm actually quite proud of

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.509 
fingers so I'm actually quite proud of
that<00:03:53.569> it's<00:03:54.569> amazing<00:03:54.810> how<00:03:55.019> what<00:03:55.709> if<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.859> if<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.159> do

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
that it's amazing how what if I if I do

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.039 
that it's amazing how what if I if I do
over<00:03:56.790> if<00:03:56.909> I<00:03:57.000> do<00:03:57.060> mix<00:03:57.329> script<00:03:57.599> with<00:03:57.689> my<00:03:57.840> right

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
over if I do mix script with my right

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.689 
over if I do mix script with my right
hand<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.379> make<00:03:58.530> such<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.769> big<00:03:58.979> difference<00:03:59.159> and

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
hand and make such a big difference and

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.800 
hand and make such a big difference and
here's<00:04:00.389> my<00:04:00.540> last<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.019> final<00:04:01.169> set<00:04:01.620> with<00:04:02.489> the

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
here's my last and final set with the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.939 
here's my last and final set with the
paws<00:04:03.810> deadlift<00:04:04.379> so<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.650> looks<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.859> little

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
paws deadlift so it looks a little

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.080 
paws deadlift so it looks a little
different<00:04:05.099> because<00:04:05.340> weight<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:05.699> a<00:04:05.729> little<00:04:06.000> bit

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
different because weight is a little bit

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.670 
different because weight is a little bit
heavier<00:04:06.419> this<00:04:06.569> is<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:07.069> 355<00:04:08.069> @<00:04:08.989> 355<00:04:09.989> pounds<00:04:10.319> with

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
heavier this is a 355 @ 355 pounds with

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.140 
heavier this is a 355 @ 355 pounds with
paws<00:04:10.889> deadlift<00:04:11.459> it's<00:04:11.609> sort<00:04:11.819> of<00:04:11.909> interesting

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
paws deadlift it's sort of interesting

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.210 
paws deadlift it's sort of interesting
how<00:04:12.509> I<00:04:12.540> can't<00:04:12.959> pause<00:04:13.259> very<00:04:13.650> well<00:04:13.889> because<00:04:14.159> I

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
how I can't pause very well because I

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.129 
how I can't pause very well because I
pull<00:04:14.459> up<00:04:14.489> and<00:04:14.970> then<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.389> kind<00:04:15.689> of<00:04:15.780> see<00:04:16.049> it

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
pull up and then you kind of see it

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.170 
pull up and then you kind of see it
either<00:04:16.289> stall<00:04:16.739> or<00:04:17.009> I<00:04:17.099> hesitate<00:04:17.669> because<00:04:17.849> it's

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
either stall or I hesitate because it's

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.430 
either stall or I hesitate because it's
trying<00:04:18.509> to<00:04:18.570> pull<00:04:18.780> me<00:04:18.930> down<00:04:19.049> because<00:04:19.199> it's

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
trying to pull me down because it's

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.580 
trying to pull me down because it's
heavier<00:04:20.329> but<00:04:21.329> if<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.570> exaggerate<00:04:22.169> this<00:04:22.320> through

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
heavier but if I exaggerate this through

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.860 
heavier but if I exaggerate this through
my<00:04:22.620> normal<00:04:22.979> deadlift<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.490> kind<00:04:24.060> of<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.210> kind<00:04:24.810> of

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
my normal deadlift it kind of a kind of

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.930 
my normal deadlift it kind of a kind of
expressing<00:04:25.349> sort<00:04:25.529> of<00:04:25.620> my<00:04:25.740> faults<00:04:26.219> of

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
expressing sort of my faults of

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.180 
expressing sort of my faults of
anything<00:04:27.180> it<00:04:27.300> yanked<00:04:27.690> forward<00:04:28.050> so<00:04:28.890> I<00:04:28.920> thought

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
anything it yanked forward so I thought

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
anything it yanked forward so I thought
that<00:04:29.250> was<00:04:29.400> sort<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.670> interesting<00:04:29.790> just

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
that was sort of interesting just

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.330 
that was sort of interesting just
looking<00:04:30.450> at<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.600> just<00:04:30.960> now<00:04:31.230> be<00:04:32.040> sure<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.220> take

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
looking at that just now be sure to take

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.770 
looking at that just now be sure to take
