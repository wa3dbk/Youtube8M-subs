00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.960
 and then people who said the name of the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.849
 times a video and a warning video 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.650
 who did not want to bring in the channel but is not 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.150
 started very open in relation to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.890
 talking to you results in bringing 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.510
 this video of warnings because I do not know 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.060
 if you remember a while ago that 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.460
 some channels were sambio that being the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.349
 denounced for using boats in the channel nÃ© 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.170
 I'm doing this video rightly. 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.930
 so what I already tired of the crowd 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.140
 to hide this from you I go back to this 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.149
 video teaches you how to use the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.399
 if the boats are not because I think the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.640
 majority of the channels to which 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.289
 denounced and finally should in new 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.660
 channels should also use boat 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.320
 mainly because it is very good and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.649
 you 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.980
 using this type of tool or 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.570
 either the tool or some kind of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.030
 Can you talk some kind of something? 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.070
 thing for people who doubted 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.680
 who uses the boat I'll teach you how 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.960
 is that it does here year if the boat in the case 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.939
 At first I picked up some woods, right? 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.189
 to boot it is low but if you notice 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.650
 that ft you put matters of that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.330
 and you'll make the boat in case 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.130
 I made two goals here, I'm going to put 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.430
 here in the water that piracy showing 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.560
 how does the boat work and how does it work? 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.850
 how it works is basically the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.280
 follow moves ow aaa sds goes moving 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.920
 that way you can use the boat in the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.610
 m speaks and also in the comments if you 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.829
