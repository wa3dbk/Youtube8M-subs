than<00:03:03.170> 12<00:03:03.440> months<00:03:03.650> my<00:03:04.310> prediction<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:04.850> that

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
than 12 months my prediction is that

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.480 
than 12 months my prediction is that
savings<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:06.140> millions<00:03:06.800> of<00:03:07.070> people<00:03:07.280> is<00:03:07.340> going

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
savings of millions of people is going

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.820 
savings of millions of people is going
to<00:03:07.550> vanish<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.960> this<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.470> beginning

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
to vanish and this is just the beginning

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.100 
to vanish and this is just the beginning
so<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:11.510> would<00:03:12.230> say<00:03:12.640> be<00:03:13.640> prepared<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.360> act<00:03:14.870> now

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
so I would say be prepared and act now

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.810 
so I would say be prepared and act now
