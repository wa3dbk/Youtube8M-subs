00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
conditioners d chlorinators and so I

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.670 
conditioners d chlorinators and so I
know<00:01:16.210> everybody<00:01:16.630> out<00:01:16.810> there<00:01:16.990> uses<00:01:17.380> a<00:01:17.409> water

Quarian khorinis do Department D
chlorinators<00:01:40.119> work<00:01:40.350> excuse<00:01:41.350> me

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
chlorinators work excuse me

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.120 
chlorinators work excuse me
so<00:01:42.399> in<00:01:42.759> this<00:01:43.570> first<00:01:43.840> part<00:01:44.020> let's<00:01:44.469> look<00:01:44.979> at

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
so in this first part let's look at

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.520 
so in this first part let's look at
chlorine<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:45.700> chloramine<00:01:46.149> in<00:01:46.570> the<00:01:47.289> next

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
chlorine and chloramine in the next

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.599 
chlorine and chloramine in the next
couple<00:01:47.679> parts<00:01:48.070> I<00:01:48.130> think<00:01:48.280> I'm<00:01:48.340> going<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.520> do

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
couple parts I think I'm going to do

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.959 
couple parts I think I'm going to do
three<00:01:48.880> parts<00:01:49.240> I'm<00:01:50.049> gonna<00:01:50.259> look<00:01:50.409> at<00:01:50.969> toxicity

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
three parts I'm gonna look at toxicity

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.520 
three parts I'm gonna look at toxicity
and<00:01:52.060> safety<00:01:52.450> issues<00:01:52.689> in<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.929> next<00:01:53.170> one<00:01:53.320> and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
and safety issues in the next one and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.709 
and safety issues in the next one and
then<00:01:53.729> dechlorination<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.509> water

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
then dechlorination and water

these things we put into our tank

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.999 
these things we put into our tank
actually<00:02:00.999> work<00:02:01.600> I'm<00:02:02.469> going<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.649> try<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.799> make

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
actually work I'm going to try to make

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.370 
actually work I'm going to try to make
these<00:02:03.270> segments<00:02:04.270> pretty<00:02:04.479> brief<00:02:04.749> try<00:02:05.109> not<00:02:05.259> to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
these segments pretty brief try not to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.410 
these segments pretty brief try not to
make<00:02:05.469> them<00:02:05.590> oh<00:02:05.710> really<00:02:05.890> boring<00:02:06.189> but<00:02:06.969> today<00:02:07.270> we

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
make them oh really boring but today we

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.279 
make them oh really boring but today we
are<00:02:07.539> gonna<00:02:07.630> start<00:02:07.840> with<00:02:07.929> a<00:02:08.020> little<00:02:08.110> bit<00:02:08.229> of

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
are gonna start with a little bit of

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.410 
are gonna start with a little bit of
basic<00:02:08.590> chemistry<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.520> then<00:02:09.940> move<00:02:10.119> on<00:02:10.300> to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
basic chemistry and then move on to

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.820 
basic chemistry and then move on to
those<00:02:10.630> other<00:02:10.810> hopefully<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.380> saw<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.590> more

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
those other hopefully you saw the more

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.100 
those other hopefully you saw the more
interesting<00:02:12.220> topics<00:02:12.640> but<00:02:13.569> if<00:02:13.720> you're<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:13.960> this

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
interesting topics but if you're in this

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.350 
interesting topics but if you're in this
hobby<00:02:14.319> then<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:15.069> think<00:02:15.520> they<00:02:15.700> probably<00:02:16.000> are

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
hobby then I think they probably are

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.470 
hobby then I think they probably are
interesting<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:18.030> I'm<00:02:19.030> also<00:02:19.210> going<00:02:19.330> to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
interesting to you so I'm also going to

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.569 
interesting to you so I'm also going to
try<00:02:19.600> to<00:02:19.660> put<00:02:19.810> some<00:02:19.960> links<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.380> description

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
try to put some links in the description

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:22.970 
try to put some links in the description
so<00:02:21.909> if<00:02:21.999> you<00:02:22.090> want<00:02:22.239> to<00:02:22.299> read<00:02:22.420> more<00:02:22.599> about<00:02:22.659> it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
so if you want to read more about it

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.679 
so if you want to read more about it
you'll<00:02:23.980> have<00:02:24.159> that<00:02:24.280> option<00:02:24.489> as<00:02:24.730> well<00:02:24.879> now<00:02:25.359> a

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
you'll have that option as well now a

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.209 
you'll have that option as well now a
little<00:02:25.989> bit<00:02:26.109> of<00:02:26.200> basic<00:02:26.319> information<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:27.069> get

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:35.499 
have been switching over to chloramine

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.879 
have been switching over to chloramine
for<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.340> few<00:02:36.549> reasons<00:02:36.810> may<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:37.959> last<00:02:38.170> longer<00:02:38.560> so

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
for a few reasons may it last longer so

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.550 
for a few reasons may it last longer so
it<00:02:39.519> provides<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.329> disinfectant<00:02:41.049> action<00:02:41.409> and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
it provides a disinfectant action and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.110 
it provides a disinfectant action and
supply<00:02:42.010> pipes<00:02:42.340> where<00:02:42.609> chlorine<00:02:43.000> would

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
supply pipes where chlorine would

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.500 
supply pipes where chlorine would
typically<00:02:43.599> lose<00:02:43.840> its<00:02:44.079> capacity<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:44.799> disinfect

typically lose its capacity to disinfect

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.839 
typically lose its capacity to disinfect
it<00:02:46.510> also<00:02:46.870> does<00:02:47.169> not<00:02:47.200> react<00:02:47.950> with<00:02:48.280> organics<00:02:48.730> as

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
it also does not react with organics as

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.059 
it also does not react with organics as
readily<00:02:49.209> as<00:02:49.389> chlorine<00:02:49.689> now<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.620> benefit<00:02:51.040> of

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
readily as chlorine now the benefit of

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.979 
readily as chlorine now the benefit of
this<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.669> chlorinated<00:02:52.209> organics<00:02:52.659> can<00:02:52.840> be

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
this is that chlorinated organics can be

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.259 
this is that chlorinated organics can be
extremely<00:02:53.530> toxic<00:02:53.859> to<00:02:54.159> people<00:02:54.609> which<00:02:55.150> would

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
extremely toxic to people which would

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.879 
extremely toxic to people which would
explain<00:02:55.659> why<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.959> folks<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.469> charge<00:02:56.739> of

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
explain why the folks in charge of

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.399 
explain why the folks in charge of

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
all you have to do is let the water sit

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.559 
all you have to do is let the water sit
for<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.620> few<00:03:14.680> days<00:03:14.949> prior<00:03:15.159> to<00:03:15.280> using<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.760> but

simple steps like that you actually have

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.640 
simple steps like that you actually have
to<00:03:20.620> take<00:03:20.829> active<00:03:21.310> steps<00:03:21.689> so<00:03:22.689> all<00:03:23.230> right<00:03:23.349> before

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650

to disinfect and some water supplies and

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.059 
to disinfect and some water supplies and
it's<00:03:43.629> also<00:03:43.780> used<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.139> make<00:03:44.199> chloramine<00:03:44.889> which

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
it's also used to make chloramine which

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.219 
it's also used to make chloramine which
we'll<00:03:45.250> discuss<00:03:45.370> in<00:03:45.609> a<00:03:45.819> bit

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:46.229 
we'll discuss in a bit

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:48.599 
we'll discuss in a bit
now<00:03:47.229> when<00:03:47.439> dissolved<00:03:47.680> in<00:03:47.919> water<00:03:48.069> it<00:03:48.370> forms

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
now when dissolved in water it forms

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.420 
now when dissolved in water it forms
dissolved<00:03:49.180> co2<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:50.049> it<00:03:50.709> also<00:03:50.859> reacts<00:03:51.250> with

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
dissolved co2 and it also reacts with

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.520 
dissolved co2 and it also reacts with
water<00:03:51.609> to<00:03:51.759> form<00:03:51.879> hypochlorous<00:03:52.810> acid<00:03:52.900> and

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
water to form hypochlorous acid and

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.819 
water to form hypochlorous acid and
hydrochloric<00:03:54.159> acid<00:03:55.030> now<00:03:55.599> these<00:03:55.900> acids<00:03:56.439> also

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
hydrochloric acid now these acids also

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.670 
hydrochloric acid now these acids also
disassociate<00:03:57.729> into<00:03:58.269> hydrogen<00:03:58.750> chloride<00:03:59.500> and

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
disassociate into hydrogen chloride and

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.360 
disassociate into hydrogen chloride and
hypochlorite<00:04:00.569> with<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:01.689> extent<00:04:02.079> of<00:04:02.259> that

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
hypochlorite with the extent of that

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.520 
hypochlorite with the extent of that
disassociation<00:04:03.370> depending<00:04:03.790> on<00:04:03.939> pH<00:04:04.530> alright

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
disassociation depending on pH alright

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.099 
disassociation depending on pH alright
everybody<00:04:06.489> with<00:04:06.639> me<00:04:06.790> any<00:04:07.120> questions<00:04:07.599> no

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
everybody with me any questions no

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.330 
everybody with me any questions no
excellent<00:04:08.829> let's<00:04:09.009> go

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
excellent let's go

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.179 
excellent let's go
so<00:04:09.819> since<00:04:10.689> chlorine<00:04:11.199> and<00:04:11.439> hypochlorous<00:04:12.129> acid

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:12.189 
so since chlorine and hypochlorous acid

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:13.979 
so since chlorine and hypochlorous acid
as<00:04:12.909> well<00:04:12.939> as<00:04:13.150> hypochlorite<00:04:13.750> are<00:04:13.870> in

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
as well as hypochlorite are in

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.199 
as well as hypochlorite are in
equilibrium<00:04:14.620> with<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.859> water<00:04:15.069> it<00:04:15.729> doesn't

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
equilibrium with the water it doesn't

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.939 
equilibrium with the water it doesn't
really<00:04:16.359> matter<00:04:16.719> which<00:04:17.169> one<00:04:17.380> is<00:04:17.500> added<00:04:17.919> to

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:17.949 
really matter which one is added to

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.490 
really matter which one is added to
obtain<00:04:18.789> a<00:04:18.820> disinfectant<00:04:19.509> medium<00:04:19.810> so<00:04:20.049> for

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
obtain a disinfectant medium so for

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.439 
obtain a disinfectant medium so for
example<00:04:20.949> you<00:04:21.549> can<00:04:21.699> add<00:04:21.820> chlorine<00:04:22.210> gas

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
example you can add chlorine gas

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.719 
example you can add chlorine gas
hypochlorous<00:04:23.289> acid<00:04:23.380> order<00:04:24.159> hypochlorite

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
hypochlorous acid order hypochlorite

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:25.709 
hypochlorous acid order hypochlorite
doesn't<00:04:25.030> really<00:04:25.150> matter

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:25.719 
doesn't really matter

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.620 
doesn't really matter
you'll<00:04:25.990> get<00:04:26.169> similar<00:04:26.440> results<00:04:27.060> so<00:04:28.060> because<00:04:28.479> of

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
you'll get similar results so because of

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.540 
you'll get similar results so because of
that<00:04:28.659> many<00:04:29.080> water<00:04:29.320> supplies<00:04:29.740> actually

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
that many water supplies actually

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.030 
that many water supplies actually
to<00:04:30.790> use<00:04:30.970> sodium<00:04:31.510> hypochlorite<00:04:32.380> which<00:04:32.590> is<00:04:33.010> a

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
to use sodium hypochlorite which is a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.280 
to use sodium hypochlorite which is a
kind<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.280> bleach<00:04:33.550> in<00:04:34.300> order<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:34.690> provide<00:04:34.930> this

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
kind of bleach in order to provide this

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.700 
kind of bleach in order to provide this
same<00:04:36.090> hypochlorite<00:04:37.090> as<00:04:37.270> in<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.170> primary

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
same hypochlorite as in the primary

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.360 
same hypochlorite as in the primary
disinfectant<00:04:39.900> okay<00:04:40.980> try<00:04:41.980> not<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.220> get<00:04:42.310> too

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
disinfectant okay try not to get too

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.250 
disinfectant okay try not to get too
technical<00:04:42.490> but<00:04:43.180> hopefully<00:04:43.630> that<00:04:43.810> makes<00:04:43.990> sense

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
technical but hopefully that makes sense

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.970 
technical but hopefully that makes sense
so<00:04:44.440> far

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
so far

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.460 
so far
now<00:04:45.430> enough<00:04:45.880> on<00:04:46.030> chlorine<00:04:46.450> again<00:04:46.900> can<00:04:47.170> keep<00:04:47.350> it

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
now enough on chlorine again can keep it

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.540 
now enough on chlorine again can keep it
basic<00:04:48.240> what<00:04:49.240> is<00:04:49.360> chlorine<00:04:50.190> because<00:04:51.190> this<00:04:51.430> is

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
basic what is chlorine because this is

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.550 
basic what is chlorine because this is
probably<00:04:52.000> what<00:04:52.840> most<00:04:53.050> of<00:04:53.200> us<00:04:53.290> are<00:04:53.440> dealing

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
probably what most of us are dealing

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.440 
probably what most of us are dealing
with<00:04:53.740> in<00:04:53.920> our<00:04:54.010> waters<00:04:54.340> these<00:04:54.490> days<00:04:54.730> so

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
with in our waters these days so

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.510 
with in our waters these days so

up some figures and equations down here

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.680 
up some figures and equations down here
now<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:18.400> predominant<00:05:18.640> form<00:05:19.060> of<00:05:19.120> most<00:05:19.390> water

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
now the predominant form of most water

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.270 
now the predominant form of most water
supplies<00:05:20.080> unless<00:05:20.350> the<00:05:20.470> water<00:05:20.770> is<00:05:20.980> really

supplies unless the water is really
acidic<00:05:21.820> is<00:05:22.300> going<00:05:22.480> to<00:05:22.540> be<00:05:22.660> mono<00:05:22.930> chloramines

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
acidic is going to be mono chloramines

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.750 
acidic is going to be mono chloramines
so<00:05:23.740> that's<00:05:23.920> what<00:05:24.100> I'm<00:05:24.190> really<00:05:24.310> going<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.610> focus

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
so that's what I'm really going to focus

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.690 
so that's what I'm really going to focus
on<00:05:25.150> but<00:05:25.930> your<00:05:26.440> local<00:05:26.890> water<00:05:27.070> supply<00:05:27.430> may

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
on but your local water supply may

three of them in the exact proportion

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.780 
three of them in the exact proportion
are<00:05:32.290> going<00:05:32.440> to<00:05:32.500> depend<00:05:32.860> on<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.160> pH<00:05:33.490> and<00:05:33.730> the

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
are going to depend on the pH and the

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.880 
are going to depend on the pH and the
relative<00:05:34.180> concentrations<00:05:34.900> of<00:05:35.140> chlorine<00:05:35.710> and

chlorine being used by your water supply

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.750 
chlorine being used by your water supply
can<00:05:40.000> very<00:05:40.390> low<00:05:41.230> levels<00:05:41.590> could<00:05:41.770> be<00:05:41.830> around<00:05:42.130> 0.5

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
can very low levels could be around 0.5

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.510 
can very low levels could be around 0.5
parts<00:05:43.150> per<00:05:43.330> million<00:05:43.890> whereas<00:05:44.890> the<00:05:45.070> EPA<00:05:45.310> allows

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
parts per million whereas the EPA allows

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.700 
parts per million whereas the EPA allows
a<00:05:45.730> maximum<00:05:46.150> of<00:05:46.600> 4<00:05:46.900> parts<00:05:47.230> per<00:05:47.290> million<00:05:47.590> which

a maximum of 4 parts per million which

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.850 
a maximum of 4 parts per million which
if<00:05:47.950> you<00:05:48.010> do<00:05:48.130> the<00:05:48.250> math<00:05:48.400> is<00:05:48.670> 8<00:05:48.910> times<00:05:49.270> as<00:05:49.480> much

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
if you do the math is 8 times as much

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.750 
if you do the math is 8 times as much
and<00:05:50.860> of<00:05:51.010> course<00:05:51.190> the<00:05:51.310> amount<00:05:51.460> that<00:05:51.580> you'll

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
and of course the amount that you'll

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.670 
and of course the amount that you'll
actually<00:05:51.910> see<00:05:52.210> at<00:05:52.300> your<00:05:52.330> tap<00:05:52.720> will<00:05:53.080> vary

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
actually see at your tap will vary

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.080 
actually see at your tap will vary
depending<00:05:53.770> on<00:05:54.310> the<00:05:54.370> distance<00:05:54.790> from<00:05:54.910> the

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
depending on the distance from the

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.670 
depending on the distance from the
treatment<00:05:55.330> plant<00:05:55.690> and<00:05:55.900> how<00:05:56.140> long<00:05:56.350> the<00:05:56.470> water

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
treatment plant and how long the water

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.730 
treatment plant and how long the water
has<00:05:56.830> been<00:05:56.920> sitting<00:05:57.130> in<00:05:57.280> the<00:05:57.370> pipes<00:05:58.530> alright<00:05:59.530> so

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
has been sitting in the pipes alright so

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.010 
has been sitting in the pipes alright so
I<00:05:59.770> think<00:05:59.890> I'm<00:06:00.310> gonna<00:06:00.490> cut<00:06:00.820> this<00:06:00.970> off<00:06:01.180> for<00:06:01.780> part

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
I think I'm gonna cut this off for part

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.730 
I think I'm gonna cut this off for part
1<00:06:02.230> I<00:06:02.440> know<00:06:03.100> trying<00:06:04.030> to<00:06:04.090> keep<00:06:04.210> it<00:06:04.330> very<00:06:04.450> brief

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
and I don't want it to run longer than

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.000 
and I don't want it to run longer than
this<00:06:07.060> sort<00:06:07.380> nobody's<00:06:08.380> going<00:06:08.500> to<00:06:08.530> watch<00:06:08.710> I

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
going to talk about the toxicity of

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.220 
going to talk about the toxicity of
