00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
into the lowrider rims and you want to

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.510 
into the lowrider rims and you want to

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
find something that's like it's a solid

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.730 
find something that's like it's a solid
rim<00:01:56.029> you<00:01:56.420> could<00:01:56.569> do<00:01:56.719> like<00:01:56.929> the<00:01:57.139> lead<00:01:57.350> sled

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
rim you could do like the lead sled

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.429 
rim you could do like the lead sled
which<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.130> what<00:01:58.279> I<00:01:58.310> do<00:01:59.049> basically<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.289> ones

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
which is what I do basically the ones

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.679 
which is what I do basically the ones
below<00:02:00.649> that<00:02:01.009> one<00:02:01.219> those<00:02:01.639> those<00:02:01.969> will<00:02:02.240> all<00:02:02.270> work

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
below that one those those will all work

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.660 
below that one those those will all work
perfectly<00:02:02.990> fine<00:02:03.439> and<00:02:03.859> i<00:02:04.069> like<00:02:04.249> to<00:02:04.340> make<00:02:04.459> the

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
perfectly fine and i like to make the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.419 
perfectly fine and i like to make the
rims<00:02:04.909> black<00:02:05.359> now<00:02:06.109> you<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:06.859> make<00:02:07.039> them<00:02:07.219> any

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
rims black now you can make them any

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.309 
rims black now you can make them any
colour<00:02:07.639> you<00:02:07.759> want<00:02:07.909> but<00:02:08.360> i<00:02:08.420> prefer<00:02:08.869> black

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
colour you want but i prefer black

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.170 
colour you want but i prefer black
because<00:02:09.860> when<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.130> put<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.369> white<00:02:10.610> walls<00:02:10.880> on

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
because when you put the white walls on

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.750 
because when you put the white walls on
it<00:02:11.390> gives<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.630> that<00:02:11.660> like<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.860> super<00:02:13.400> flare

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.160 
it gives it that like that super flare
it<00:02:13.970> makes<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.270> look<00:02:14.450> like<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.780> has<00:02:14.930> like<00:02:14.960> a

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
it makes it look like it has like a

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.560 
it makes it look like it has like a
bright<00:02:15.500> outline<00:02:15.950> with<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.340> dark<00:02:16.610> center<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.540> i

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
bright outline with the dark center so i

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.050 
bright outline with the dark center so i
prefer<00:02:17.960> to<00:02:17.990> do<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.380> black<00:02:18.590> rim<00:02:19.370> with<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.730> why

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
