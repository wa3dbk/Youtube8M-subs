of testing and if it continues to go

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.659 
of testing and if it continues to go
well<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.009> could<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.460> market

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
well it could be on the market

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.549 
well it could be on the market
commercially<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.450> next<00:00:33.750> 5<00:00:33.960> years<00:00:33.989> which

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
commercially in the next 5 years which

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.680 
commercially in the next 5 years which
is<00:00:34.710> kind<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.190> crazy<00:00:35.399> soon<00:00:35.790> for<00:00:36.059> an<00:00:36.120> HIV<00:00:36.660> vaccine

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
is kind of crazy soon for an HIV vaccine

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.780 
is kind of crazy soon for an HIV vaccine
to<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> market<00:00:38.100> when<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.370> really

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
to be on the market when you really

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.190 
to be on the market when you really
think<00:00:39.030> about<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> don't<00:00:39.570> even<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:39.989> half

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
think about it don't even like half

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
think about it don't even like half
think<00:00:40.440> about<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.340> think<00:00:41.550> about<00:00:41.640> it

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
moving on to the immunity and

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.609 
moving on to the immunity and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.999 
at high risk for infection this testing
might<00:01:21.780> prove<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.290> be<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.590> most<00:01:22.770> difficult

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
might prove to be the most difficult

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.649 
might prove to be the most difficult
part<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.549> finding<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.970> volunteers<00:01:24.360> willing

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
part is finding the volunteers willing

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.630 
part is finding the volunteers willing
to<00:01:24.780> test<00:01:24.960> immunity<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.560> an<00:01:25.680> HIV<00:01:26.100> virus<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
to test immunity on an HIV virus is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.950 
to test immunity on an HIV virus is
probably<00:01:27.000> somewhat<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> difficult<00:01:27.720> thing

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
probably somewhat of a difficult thing

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.980 
probably somewhat of a difficult thing
hey<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.530> got<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.880> don't<00:01:30.000> look<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.900> don't

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
hey you got you we don't look we don't

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.880 
hey you got you we don't look we don't
want<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.790> get<00:01:32.790> HIV<00:01:33.630> per<00:01:34.200> se<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
want you to get HIV per se but if you

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.910 
want you to get HIV per se but if you
were<00:01:35.009> happening<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.939> somehow<00:01:36.720> get<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:37.650> will
