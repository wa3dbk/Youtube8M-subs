I'll<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.930> honest<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.350> say<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> haven't<00:00:58.859> had<00:00:59.160> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
ton of experience with workstations but

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.500

I<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.379> still<00:01:01.800> appreciate<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.940> Lenovo<00:01:03.359> has

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
I can still appreciate what Lenovo has

I can still appreciate what Lenovo has
done<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.199> think<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.530> makes<00:01:04.650> sense<00:01:04.769> the

as their work machine instead with the P
series<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> solidly<00:01:12.869> constructed

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170

list<00:01:16.380> components<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.610> much<00:01:17.939> more

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
list components this is much more

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.149 
list components this is much more
obvious<00:01:18.360> looking<00:01:18.900> at<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> p700<00:01:19.560> than<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> P

300<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> same<00:01:21.360> design<00:01:21.689> principles

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
300 but the same design principles

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.630 
300 but the same design principles
trickled<00:01:22.619> down<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.070> let's<00:01:23.250> look<00:01:23.430> at<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
bigger right here and keep in mind

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.170 
bigger right here and keep in mind
