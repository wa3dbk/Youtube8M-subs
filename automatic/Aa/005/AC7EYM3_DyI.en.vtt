00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.190 

okay<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.670> finished<00:00:11.759> with<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.509> save<00:00:12.840> state

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
okay so I finished with the save state

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.110 
okay so I finished with the save state
helper<00:00:13.650> method<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.580> we're<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:14.790> creating

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
helper method here we're just creating

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.990 
helper method here we're just creating
another<00:00:15.420> instance<00:00:15.929> or<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.279> reference<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
another instance or a reference to the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.570 
another instance or a reference to the
current<00:00:18.630> phone<00:00:19.320> application<00:00:19.949> service<00:00:20.340> so

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
current phone application service so

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.779 
current phone application service so
that<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.029> retrieve<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:22.350> state<00:00:22.830> value<00:00:23.550> in

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
that we can retrieve the state value in

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.160 
that we can retrieve the state value in
our<00:00:23.910> state<00:00:24.240> bag<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:25.439> I'm<00:00:25.560> creating<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.369> new

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
our state bag here I'm creating a new

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.720 
our state bag here I'm creating a new
reference<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.830> isolated<00:00:29.310> storage

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
reference to the isolated storage

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.659 
reference to the isolated storage
settings<00:00:30.210> which<00:00:30.689> gives<00:00:30.960> us<00:00:31.170> access<00:00:31.219> to<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
settings which gives us access to the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.600 
settings which gives us access to the
application<00:00:33.079> settings<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.800> are<00:00:34.829> saved<00:00:35.219> in

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
application settings that are saved in

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.729 
application settings that are saved in
isolated<00:00:36.420> storage<00:00:36.690> okay<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> new

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
isolated storage okay so this is a new

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.459 
isolated storage okay so this is a new
concept<00:00:37.950> basically<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.989> way<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
concept basically it's just a way to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.680 
concept basically it's just a way to
save<00:00:40.920> name<00:00:41.750> value<00:00:42.750> pairs<00:00:43.579> into<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:45.030> repository

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
save name value pairs into a repository

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.260 
save name value pairs into a repository
that<00:00:46.260> only<00:00:46.620> our<00:00:46.890> application<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.700> access<00:00:48.149> so

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
that only our application can access so

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.630 
that only our application can access so
we<00:00:48.360> could<00:00:48.480> save<00:00:48.690> any<00:00:48.840> kind<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.280> values<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.520> we

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
we could save any kind of values that we

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.790 
we could save any kind of values that we
wanted<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> initialize<00:00:51.719> our<00:00:51.899> application<00:00:52.620> in

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
wanted to initialize our application in

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
wanted to initialize our application in
this<00:00:53.340> case<00:00:53.579> we're<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> save<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
this case we're just going to save the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.750 
this case we're just going to save the
values<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> user<00:00:55.860> already<00:00:56.160> typed<00:00:56.550> from

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
values that the user already typed from

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.049 
values that the user already typed from
their<00:00:57.000> previous<00:00:57.239> session<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.789> I'm<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
their previous session so I'm going to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.689 
their previous session so I'm going to
retrieve<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> values<00:01:01.469> from<00:01:01.739> our<00:01:02.070> temporary

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
retrieve the values from our temporary

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.660 
retrieve the values from our temporary
state<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.650> save<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.799> into<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.010> more<00:01:05.250> long-term

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
state and save it into a more long-term

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.969 
state and save it into a more long-term
state<00:01:06.510> by<00:01:06.720> calling<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> settings<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> then

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
state by calling the settings and then

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.030 
state by calling the settings and then
passing<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.229> something<00:01:10.229> called<00:01:10.380> my<00:01:10.590> value<00:01:10.920> now

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
passing in something called my value now

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.890 
passing in something called my value now
i<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.280> happen<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.640> name<00:01:11.939> these<00:01:12.119> exactly<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
i just happen to name these exactly the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.870 
i just happen to name these exactly the
same<00:01:13.140> i<00:01:13.380> could<00:01:14.010> name<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.520> different

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
same i could name this one different

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.760 
same i could name this one different
than<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> doesn't<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
than this one it doesn't have to be the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.039 
than this one it doesn't have to be the
same<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.119> own<00:01:18.299> convention

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
same I just do that as my own convention

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.149 
same I just do that as my own convention
so<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> could<00:01:19.650> remember<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:21.409> key<00:01:22.409> value<00:01:22.979> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
so I could remember the key value that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.969 
so I could remember the key value that
I'm<00:01:23.250> using<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:23.700> both<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.000> them<00:01:24.090> okay<00:01:24.979> alright

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
I'm using for both of them okay alright

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.609 
I'm using for both of them okay alright
so<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.580> I've<00:01:26.670> saved<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.299> values<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
so now that I've saved the values the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.160 
so now that I've saved the values the
corollary<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:30.119> retrieving<00:01:31.020> those

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
corollary to that is retrieving those

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.830 
corollary to that is retrieving those
values<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.030> some<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.240> code<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
values so some of this code is going to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.179 
values so some of this code is going to
be<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> same<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:34.530> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.710> need<00:01:34.890> these

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
be the same I'm going to need these

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.240 
be the same I'm going to need these
first<00:01:35.790> two<00:01:36.000> lines<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.630> code<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.530> I'm<00:01:38.100> just

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
first two lines of code and I'm just

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.319 
first two lines of code and I'm just
going<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:38.400> kind<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.090> exact<00:01:39.420> opposite

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
going to kind of do the exact opposite

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.760 
going to kind of do the exact opposite
okay<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.390> once<00:01:42.840> again<00:01:42.960> we're<00:01:43.259> working<00:01:43.619> with

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
okay so once again we're working with

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.300 
okay so once again we're working with
the<00:01:44.490> phone<00:01:44.820> app<00:01:45.060> service<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.780> our<00:01:46.619> isolated

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the phone app service and our isolated

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.410 
the phone app service and our isolated
store<00:01:47.549> settings<00:01:47.820> just<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.210> we<00:01:48.299> did

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
store settings just like we did

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.910 
store settings just like we did
previously<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.350> time<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.829> we're

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
previously but this time what we're

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.210 
previously but this time what we're
going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.100> do<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.579> try<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.780> my<00:01:52.290> value<00:01:52.890> out

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
going to do is try to get my value out

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.109 
going to do is try to get my value out
of<00:01:53.250> our<00:01:54.119> isolated<00:01:55.110> storage<00:01:55.380> settings<00:01:55.860> if

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
of our isolated storage settings if

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.580 
of our isolated storage settings if
we're<00:01:57.119> successful<00:01:57.299> then<00:01:57.930> we'll<00:01:58.079> execute<00:01:58.380> this

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
we're successful then we'll execute this

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.709 
we're successful then we'll execute this
block<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.890> code<00:01:59.070> where<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.700> set<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.210> value

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
block of code where we set that value

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.130 
block of code where we set that value
into<00:02:01.159> our<00:02:02.159> phone<00:02:02.460> app<00:02:02.640> services<00:02:03.240> temporary

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
into our phone app services temporary

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.789 
into our phone app services temporary
state<00:02:04.560> bag<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.189> state<00:02:05.700> my<00:02:06.180> value<00:02:06.750> now<00:02:07.380> why<00:02:07.560> am<00:02:07.710> I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
state bag so state my value now why am I

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.339 
state bag so state my value now why am I
doing<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.129> why<00:02:08.550> am<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.759> reusing<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.720> because

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
doing this why am I reusing this because

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.110 
doing this why am I reusing this because
we've<00:02:10.500> already<00:02:10.739> written<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.430> code<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:11.970> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
we've already written the code on this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.080 
we've already written the code on this
page<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.420> handle

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
page to handle

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.720 
page to handle
that<00:02:13.560> situation<00:02:14.560> whatever<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:15.040> page<00:02:15.280> loads

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
that situation whatever the page loads

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.540 
that situation whatever the page loads
to<00:02:16.599> retrieve<00:02:17.200> whatever<00:02:17.769> is<00:02:18.010> in<00:02:18.160> that<00:02:18.190> phone

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
to retrieve whatever is in that phone

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.550 
to retrieve whatever is in that phone
app<00:02:18.760> service<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.420> place<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.959> in<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.080> text<00:02:20.440> box

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
app service and place it in the text box

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.350 
app service and place it in the text box
so<00:02:20.739> I'm<00:02:20.800> just<00:02:20.920> leveraging<00:02:21.550> what<00:02:21.819> already

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
so I'm just leveraging what already

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.140 
so I'm just leveraging what already
exists<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.290> my<00:02:23.440> code<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:24.040> handle<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.970> I'm

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
exists in my code to handle that I'm

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.509 
exists in my code to handle that I'm
just<00:02:25.360> handling<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:25.930> now<00:02:25.959> from<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.650> shorter<00:02:27.250> term

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
just handling it now from a shorter term

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.220 
just handling it now from a shorter term
memory<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> longer<00:02:28.989> term<00:02:29.290> memory<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:31.230> just

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
memory to a longer term memory and just

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.070 
memory to a longer term memory and just
utilizing<00:02:33.099> what<00:02:33.370> I've<00:02:33.459> already<00:02:33.730> built<00:02:34.390> to

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
utilizing what I've already built to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.610 
utilizing what I've already built to
handle<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:37.269> now<00:02:37.599> that<00:02:37.810> I've<00:02:37.930> built<00:02:38.200> save

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
handle it so now that I've built save

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.190 
handle it so now that I've built save
state<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.069> load<00:02:39.250> state<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.790> need<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.629> call<00:02:40.900> each

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
state and load state I need to call each

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.640 
state and load state I need to call each
of<00:02:41.349> these<00:02:41.440> appropriately<00:02:43.110> inside<00:02:44.110> of<00:02:44.470> these

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
of these appropriately inside of these

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
defined earlier so in this case when

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.819 
defined earlier so in this case when
launching<00:02:49.420> are<00:02:49.569> activated<00:02:50.230> i'm<00:02:50.620> going<00:02:50.769> to

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
launching are activated i'm going to

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:57.270 
launching are activated i'm going to
call<00:02:51.569> load<00:02:52.569> state<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:54.209> i'll<00:02:55.209> call<00:02:55.480> load<00:02:56.410> state

state whoops and save state now one last
thing<00:03:11.410> I<00:03:11.560> want<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.739> do<00:03:11.890> just<00:03:12.099> because<00:03:12.220> I'm<00:03:12.430> a

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
thing I want to do just because I'm a

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.400 
thing I want to do just because I'm a
little<00:03:12.700> bit<00:03:12.790> paranoid<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.900> am<00:03:14.170> going

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
little bit paranoid is that I am going

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.379 
little bit paranoid is that I am going
to<00:03:15.360> make<00:03:16.360> sure<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:17.910> we<00:03:18.910> don't<00:03:19.030> get<00:03:19.269> an

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
to make sure that we don't get an

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:20.729 
to make sure that we don't get an
exception<00:03:19.959> in<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.170> way<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:20.440> I'm<00:03:20.560> going<00:03:20.650> to

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
exception in the way that I'm going to

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.330 
exception in the way that I'm going to
do<00:03:20.889> that<00:03:21.130> is<00:03:21.700> by<00:03:22.600> making<00:03:23.109> sure<00:03:23.319> that<00:03:24.040> there's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
do that is by making sure that there's

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.559 
do that is by making sure that there's
actually<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:25.090> key<00:03:25.450> value<00:03:28.650> available<00:03:29.650> called<00:03:29.920> my

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
actually a key value available called my

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.870 
actually a key value available called my
value<00:03:31.569> first<00:03:32.079> before<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.069> actually<00:03:33.400> try<00:03:33.819> to

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
value first before I actually try to

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.870 
value first before I actually try to
retrieve<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:34.690> don't<00:03:35.680> think<00:03:36.069> the<00:03:36.489> code<00:03:36.730> would

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
retrieve it I don't think the code would

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.599 
retrieve it I don't think the code would
blow<00:03:37.120> up<00:03:37.150> if<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.540> didn't<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:38.019> but<00:03:38.609> again

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
blow up if I didn't have this but again

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.289 
blow up if I didn't have this but again
I'm<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.790> little<00:03:40.060> bit<00:03:41.340> superstitious<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:43.090> I

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
I'm a little bit superstitious and I

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.759 
I'm a little bit superstitious and I
just<00:03:43.510> want<00:03:43.660> to<00:03:43.720> do<00:03:43.870> sufficient<00:03:44.530> number<00:03:44.709> of

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
just want to do sufficient number of

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.309 
just want to do sufficient number of
checks<00:03:45.069> before<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:46.109> get<00:03:47.109> too<00:03:47.260> far<00:03:47.500> with<00:03:47.709> this<00:03:47.739> so

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
checks before I get too far with this so

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.390 
checks before I get too far with this so
put<00:03:50.249> this<00:03:50.400> inside<00:03:50.969> like<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.390> okay<00:03:52.189> so<00:03:53.189> if<00:03:53.310> I

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
put this inside like that okay so if I

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.979 
put this inside like that okay so if I
if<00:03:53.849> I've<00:03:54.060> written<00:03:54.269> everything<00:03:54.510> correctly

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
if I've written everything correctly

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.470 
if I've written everything correctly
this<00:03:55.349> should<00:03:55.409> work<00:03:55.739> will<00:03:56.189> run<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.519> once<00:03:56.760> to

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
this should work will run it once to

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.309 
this should work will run it once to
demonstrate<00:03:57.989> exactly<00:03:58.139> how<00:03:58.620> this<00:03:58.829> works<00:04:01.249> and

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
demonstrate exactly how this works and

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.809 
demonstrate exactly how this works and
then<00:04:04.319> i'll<00:04:04.469> run<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.129> second<00:04:05.459> time<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.639> said

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
then i'll run it a second time and said

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.280 
then i'll run it a second time and said
some<00:04:06.030> break<00:04:06.239> points<00:04:06.540> so<00:04:06.599> we<00:04:06.689> can<00:04:06.780> see<00:04:06.930> exactly

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
some break points so we can see exactly

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:20.460 
some break points so we can see exactly
where<00:04:07.620> things<00:04:07.889> are<00:04:08.099> firing

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.900 

ok<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:21.530> to<00:04:21.829> begin<00:04:22.070> what<00:04:22.430> I'm<00:04:22.490> going<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.640> do<00:04:22.760> is

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
ok so to begin what I'm going to do is

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.210 
ok so to begin what I'm going to do is
type<00:04:23.120> in<00:04:23.890> something<00:04:24.890> and<00:04:25.250> then<00:04:25.480> I'm<00:04:26.480> going<00:04:26.810> to

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
type in something and then I'm going to

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.590 
type in something and then I'm going to
hit<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.580> start<00:04:29.420> button<00:04:29.480> and<00:04:29.990> then<00:04:31.450> I'm<00:04:32.450> going

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
hit the start button and then I'm going

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.160 
hit the start button and then I'm going
to<00:04:32.630> come<00:04:32.840> back<00:04:33.110> into<00:04:33.440> my<00:04:33.710> application<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:38.170> the

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
to come back into my application and the

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.260 
to come back into my application and the
word<00:04:39.440> Bob<00:04:39.710> is<00:04:40.010> still<00:04:40.250> there<00:04:40.460> so<00:04:40.730> that's<00:04:40.940> great

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
word Bob is still there so that's great

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.600 
word Bob is still there so that's great
now<00:04:41.780> let<00:04:41.990> me<00:04:42.020> use<00:04:42.160> the<00:04:43.160> back<00:04:43.550> button<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:45.610> then

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
now let me use the back button and then

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.180 
now let me use the back button and then
come<00:04:46.880> back<00:04:46.910> into<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.390> application<00:04:47.540> and<00:04:48.230> it's

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
come back into the application and it's

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.580 
come back into the application and it's
still<00:04:49.400> there<00:04:49.640> ok<00:04:50.150> great<00:04:50.570> so<00:04:50.750> we<00:04:50.870> solved<00:04:51.470> the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
still there ok great so we solved the

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.590 
still there ok great so we solved the
dilemma<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:52.870> saving<00:04:53.870> our<00:04:54.140> state<00:04:55.150> while<00:04:56.150> the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
dilemma of saving our state while the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.900 
dilemma of saving our state while the
application<00:04:57.290> has<00:04:57.530> been<00:04:57.560> tombstoned<00:04:58.520> by<00:04:58.850> the

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
application has been tombstoned by the

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.930 
application has been tombstoned by the
phone<00:04:59.410> so<00:05:00.410> let's<00:05:00.980> do<00:05:01.130> this<00:05:01.310> we're<00:05:01.760> going<00:05:01.880> to

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
phone so let's do this we're going to

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.640 
phone so let's do this we're going to
run<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:02.150> one<00:05:02.300> more<00:05:02.419> time<00:05:02.690> but<00:05:02.990> this<00:05:03.260> time<00:05:03.320> what

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
run it one more time but this time what

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.500 
run it one more time but this time what
I<00:05:03.680> want<00:05:03.860> to<00:05:03.950> do<00:05:04.100> is<00:05:04.660> kind<00:05:05.660> of<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.870> drive<00:05:06.169> home

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
I want to do is kind of the drive home

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.140 
I want to do is kind of the drive home
when<00:05:08.510> each<00:05:08.780> of<00:05:08.900> these<00:05:08.990> events<00:05:09.230> fire<00:05:10.060> I'm<00:05:11.060> gonna

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
when each of these events fire I'm gonna

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.750 
when each of these events fire I'm gonna
set<00:05:11.390> a<00:05:11.419> breakpoint<00:05:11.690> on<00:05:12.169> each<00:05:12.500> call<00:05:12.800> whoops

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
set a breakpoint on each call whoops

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.659 
set a breakpoint on each call whoops
let's<00:05:14.390> pull<00:05:14.600> in<00:05:14.720> there<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.770> now<00:05:16.010> every<00:05:16.490> time

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
let's pull in there so now every time

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.340 
let's pull in there so now every time
this<00:05:16.940> fires<00:05:17.240> on<00:05:17.480> the<00:05:17.510> phone<00:05:17.780> we're<00:05:18.140> going<00:05:18.290> to

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
this fires on the phone we're going to

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.420 
this fires on the phone we're going to
be<00:05:18.440> able<00:05:18.650> to<00:05:18.740> see<00:05:19.040> it<00:05:20.290> occur<00:05:21.290> here<00:05:21.800> in<00:05:21.950> our<00:05:22.130> code

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
be able to see it occur here in our code

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.700 
be able to see it occur here in our code
now<00:05:23.330> truth<00:05:23.660> be<00:05:23.810> told<00:05:23.840> we're<00:05:24.320> not<00:05:24.440> going<00:05:24.560> to<00:05:24.620> get

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
now truth be told we're not going to get

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.409 
now truth be told we're not going to get
this<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.310> fire<00:05:25.550> on<00:05:25.729> every<00:05:26.030> one<00:05:26.210> of<00:05:26.300> them

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
this to fire on every one of them

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.290 
this to fire on every one of them
because<00:05:26.750> unfortunately<00:05:27.020> whenever<00:05:27.979> we<00:05:28.760> move

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
because unfortunately whenever we move

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.409 
because unfortunately whenever we move
away<00:05:29.600> from<00:05:29.780> the<00:05:30.940> application<00:05:31.940> running<00:05:32.180> in<00:05:32.360> the

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
away from the application running in the

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.750 
away from the application running in the
emulator<00:05:32.900> it's<00:05:33.229> going<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.770> lose<00:05:34.010> a<00:05:34.040> connection

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
emulator it's going to lose a connection

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.490 
emulator it's going to lose a connection
with<00:05:35.120> the<00:05:35.270> emulator<00:05:35.660> again<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:35.990> think<00:05:36.110> there<00:05:36.410> is

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
with the emulator again I think there is

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.980 
with the emulator again I think there is
a<00:05:36.530> technique<00:05:36.919> that<00:05:36.979> I<00:05:37.130> can<00:05:37.340> use<00:05:37.370> to<00:05:37.990> connect

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
a technique that I can use to connect

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.080 
a technique that I can use to connect
back<00:05:39.260> up<00:05:39.590> so<00:05:40.010> we'll<00:05:40.460> see<00:05:40.580> if<00:05:40.640> we<00:05:40.700> can<00:05:40.850> make<00:05:40.880> that

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
back up so we'll see if we can make that

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.780 
back up so we'll see if we can make that
happen<00:05:41.440> so<00:05:42.440> let's<00:05:42.979> start<00:05:43.190> over<00:05:43.310> again<00:05:43.490> I'm

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
happen so let's start over again I'm

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.830 
happen so let's start over again I'm
going<00:05:43.880> to<00:05:43.970> run<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:45.169> application<00:05:45.320> again<00:05:46.720> ok<00:05:47.720> if

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
going to run the application again ok if

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.680 
going to run the application again ok if
you<00:05:48.020> can<00:05:48.169> see<00:05:48.410> as<00:05:48.680> soon<00:05:48.890> as<00:05:48.979> I<00:05:49.100> start<00:05:49.370> up

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
you can see as soon as I start up

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.930 
you can see as soon as I start up
launching<00:05:50.690> fires<00:05:51.260> application<00:05:51.979> launching<00:05:52.490> so

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
launching fires application launching so

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.030 
launching fires application launching so
let's<00:05:53.120> go<00:05:53.240> ahead<00:05:53.270> and<00:05:53.390> run<00:05:53.570> it<00:05:54.820> and<00:05:56.620> now<00:05:57.620> when<00:05:58.010> I

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
let's go ahead and run it and now when I

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.670 
let's go ahead and run it and now when I
call<00:05:58.400> when<00:05:58.790> I<00:05:59.060> hit<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.419> start<00:05:59.930> button<00:06:00.140> on<00:06:00.560> the

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
call when I hit the start button on the

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.480 
call when I hit the start button on the
phone<00:06:01.600> it's<00:06:02.600> going<00:06:02.840> to<00:06:03.110> call<00:06:03.410> deactivated<00:06:04.340> so

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
phone it's going to call deactivated so

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.580 
phone it's going to call deactivated so
the<00:06:04.610> application<00:06:05.300> is<00:06:05.450> still<00:06:05.720> activated<00:06:06.290> in

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
the application is still activated in

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.950 
the application is still activated in
the<00:06:06.830> phone's<00:06:07.040> memory<00:06:10.090> but<00:06:11.090> it<00:06:11.210> has<00:06:11.419> been<00:06:11.690> for

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
the phone's memory but it has been for

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.540 
the phone's memory but it has been for
all<00:06:12.050> practical<00:06:12.470> purposes<00:06:12.590> removed<00:06:13.400> from

all practical purposes removed from

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.540 
all practical purposes removed from
memory<00:06:13.910> it's<00:06:14.270> just<00:06:14.630> again<00:06:14.870> that<00:06:15.140> nuance<00:06:15.550> now

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
memory it's just again that nuance now

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.930

hooked up to our visual studio so I'm

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:37.959 
hooked up to our visual studio so I'm
going<00:06:26.360> to<00:06:26.419> run<00:06:26.630> it<00:06:26.810> a<00:06:27.020> second<00:06:28.010> time

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:52.399 
to start it back up we're still saving

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.789 
to start it back up we're still saving
the<00:06:52.579> value<00:06:52.879> okay<00:06:53.269> so<00:06:54.079> that's<00:06:54.259> really<00:06:54.499> the<00:06:54.649> only

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:56.269 
thing that I wanted to demonstrate in

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:58.749 
thing that I wanted to demonstrate in
this<00:06:56.299> video<00:06:56.659> is<00:06:56.839> to<00:06:56.869> talk<00:06:57.110> about<00:06:57.469> what<00:06:58.309> happens

00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 
this video is to talk about what happens

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:01.689 
this video is to talk about what happens
when<00:06:58.909> the<00:06:59.749> user<00:07:00.489> switches<00:07:01.489> to<00:07:01.610> another

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:01.699 
when the user switches to another

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:05.859

settings txt where we put all those
values<00:08:00.319> in<00:08:00.559> this<00:08:01.039> is<00:08:01.249> much<00:08:01.399> more<00:08:01.610> convenient

okay<00:08:02.899> so<00:08:02.959> hopefully<00:08:03.469> that<00:08:03.619> was<00:08:03.709> helpful<00:08:03.769> we'll

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:04.459 
okay so hopefully that was helpful we'll

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:07.719 
okay so hopefully that was helpful we'll
see<00:08:04.639> in<00:08:04.729> the<00:08:04.789> next<00:08:04.849> video<00:08:05.269> thank<00:08:05.629> you
