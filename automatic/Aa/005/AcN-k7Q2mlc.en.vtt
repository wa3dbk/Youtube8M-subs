so<00:00:08.460> I'm<00:00:08.580> going<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:08.880> start<00:00:09.120> by<00:00:09.300> removing<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
so I'm going to start by removing the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:21.099 
so I'm going to start by removing the
blade<00:00:10.170> make<00:00:11.130> sure<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.460> machine<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.730> unplugged

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.410 

now<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.800> blade<00:00:23.070> is<00:00:23.100> out<00:00:23.519> I'm<00:00:23.880> going<00:00:24.300> to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
now that the blade is out I'm going to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:39.500 
now that the blade is out I'm going to
clamp<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:25.050> my<00:00:25.350> vise

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.700 

so<00:00:40.510> as<00:00:40.809> you<00:00:41.109> can<00:00:41.289> see<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.719> doesn't<00:00:44.170> take<00:00:44.440> much

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
so as you can see it doesn't take much

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.389 
so as you can see it doesn't take much
just<00:00:45.489> to<00:00:45.640> bring<00:00:45.850> back<00:00:45.909> the<00:00:46.480> edge<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:48.100> each

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
just to bring back the edge of each

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.829 
just to bring back the edge of each
tooth<00:00:49.559> few<00:00:50.559> strokes<00:00:51.420> once<00:00:52.420> you<00:00:52.539> get<00:00:52.690> the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
tooth few strokes once you get the

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.310 
tooth few strokes once you get the
rhythm<00:00:53.019> I<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:55.329> I<00:00:55.420> can<00:00:55.570> do<00:00:55.719> this<00:00:55.869> plate<00:00:56.170> in

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
rhythm I think I can do this plate in

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:04.350 
rhythm I think I can do this plate in
about<00:00:56.789> 10-15<00:00:57.789> minutes<00:01:00.359> try<00:01:01.359> to<00:01:01.420> maintain<00:01:03.360> this

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
about 10-15 minutes try to maintain this

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.460 
about 10-15 minutes try to maintain this
angle<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.830> you<00:01:05.860> don't<00:01:06.189> turning<00:01:06.880> just<00:01:07.470> removing

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
angle so you don't turning just removing

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.460 
angle so you don't turning just removing
material<00:01:09.340> just<00:01:09.490> at<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.820> tip<00:01:10.030> try<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.050> remove

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:20.070 
material just at the tip try to remove
material<00:01:11.679> evenly<00:01:12.520> across<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:17.580> come<00:01:18.580> up<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
material evenly across the to come up to

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.820
