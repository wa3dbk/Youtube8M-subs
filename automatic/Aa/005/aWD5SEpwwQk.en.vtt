wasn't<00:00:38.739> really<00:00:39.070> serious<00:00:39.370> just<00:00:39.879> so<00:00:40.120> I<00:00:40.149> didn't

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
wasn't really serious just so I didn't

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.450 
always a good junior and my family in
the<00:00:47.470> beginning<00:00:47.800> was<00:00:47.950> really<00:00:48.250> really

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
the beginning was really really

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.830 
the beginning was really really
supporting<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.560> as<00:00:50.560> a<00:00:51.190> kid<00:00:51.610> you<00:00:52.180> know<00:00:52.210> even

tennis from from morning till evening I

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.050 
tennis from from morning till evening I
was<00:01:11.140> playing<00:01:11.439> the<00:01:11.829> domestic<00:01:12.549> tournaments<00:01:12.700> in

was playing the domestic tournaments in

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.370 
was playing the domestic tournaments in
the<00:01:13.090> beginning<00:01:13.570> after<00:01:13.780> that<00:01:14.139> like

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
the beginning after that like

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.739 
the beginning after that like
tournaments<00:01:14.920> abroad<00:01:15.039> and<00:01:15.609> I<00:01:16.149> always<00:01:16.359> had

tournaments abroad and I always had
success<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.350> I<00:01:17.469> guess<00:01:17.679> that<00:01:17.889> this<00:01:18.009> kind<00:01:18.280> of

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
success and I guess that this kind of

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.399 
success and I guess that this kind of
life<00:01:18.609> lifestyle<00:01:19.299> was<00:01:19.509> good<00:01:19.719> for<00:01:19.899> me<00:01:20.049> because<00:01:20.380> I
