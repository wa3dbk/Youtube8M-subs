00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.520
 children's valley 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.660
 the doctor house 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:35.670
 You already know everything, you kidnapped them. 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.730
 Children's minds accept the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.400
 indoctrination more easily their 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.040
 bodies are more adaptable to 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:49.170
 the result was the definitive soldier and 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.090
 because of our success when the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.390
 rulers invaded we were 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:01.050
 prepared if you distort the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.730
 history know that you develop 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.740
 your cards to have the human pelÃ© king 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.939
 not to combat purchases 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.040
 when the human world after another fell 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.740
 when my spartans were all that 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.720
 I am among humanity the extinction 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.899
 no one cared about the reason 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.490
 original of its construction 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:29.439
 so I guess your choices were 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:31.830
 justified my work saved the race 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.830
 human 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:41.289
 Do you think that the lack of a unit 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:45.069
 for the spaces helped what you 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:48.700
 look for the others before you were from 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.619
 naval intelligence but you are another 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.610
 thing 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.069
 records indicate that the parties 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.659
 mild sociopathy 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.539
 in its realization and customizes 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.280
 records show the behavior 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.659
 efficient when operating in 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.299
 Danger 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.179
 I provided the tools to keep 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.429
 this efficiency 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.690
 Do you believe that you know him better? 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.190
 Tite was because he was upset 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.190
 What does John have to do with this? 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.040
 you want to replace the marketing is 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.680
 dead 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.800
 your file indicates that you have disappeared in 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.830
 combat and cats 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.770
 swords never die your mistake is 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.940
 consider spartans as equipment 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.300
 military 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:47.730
 my spartan are the next step in 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:55.500
 humanity our destiny as a species 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:58.500
 do not underestimate but most of all, never 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500
 underestimate 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.310
 the organ of the total 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:19.760
 the survival of fashion property and 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.760
 can sit in the state 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.640
 said accord 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.119
 those of you
