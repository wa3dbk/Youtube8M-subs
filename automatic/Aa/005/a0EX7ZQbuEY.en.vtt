I'm going to lay out all of my stamps
first<00:02:09.179> figure<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:09.989> where<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> want<00:02:10.470> them<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> go

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
first figure out where I want them to go

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.220 
first figure out where I want them to go
and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.430> I'll<00:02:11.879> pick<00:02:12.090> them<00:02:12.239> up<00:02:12.390> by<00:02:12.870> closing

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
and then I'll pick them up by closing

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.640 
and then I'll pick them up by closing
the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.679 
the
lid<00:02:13.769> and<00:02:14.069> then<00:02:14.099> I'll<00:02:14.640> stamp<00:02:14.909> all<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.390> them<00:02:15.540> at

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
lid and then I'll stamp all of them at

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:22.460 
lid and then I'll stamp all of them at
the<00:02:15.810> same<00:02:15.840> time<00:02:20.329> it<00:02:21.329> took<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.170> little<00:02:22.379> bit

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
the same time it took just a little bit

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.530 
the same time it took just a little bit
of<00:02:22.560> playing<00:02:22.769> to<00:02:23.069> get<00:02:23.189> them<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.489> way<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.939> wanted

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
of playing to get them the way I wanted

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.250 
of playing to get them the way I wanted
and<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:24.870> think<00:02:25.140> I'm<00:02:25.290> all<00:02:25.409> set<00:02:25.709> now<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:27.260> I'll

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and I think I'm all set now so I'll

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.160 
and I think I'm all set now so I'll
anchor<00:02:28.829> these<00:02:29.040> down<00:02:29.359> so<00:02:30.359> close<00:02:30.629> that<00:02:30.659> and<00:02:30.900> pick

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
anchor these down so close that and pick

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.849 
anchor these down so close that and pick
the<00:02:31.319> stamps<00:02:31.709> up<00:02:31.859> get<00:02:32.099> rid<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.459> hello<00:02:32.790> and

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
the stamps up get rid of this hello and

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.649 
the stamps up get rid of this hello and
very<00:02:34.859> quickly<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.310> will<00:02:35.370> stamp<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.239> of<00:02:36.480> these

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
very quickly I will stamp all of these

00:02:36.659 --> 00:03:06.460 
very quickly I will stamp all of these
at<00:02:37.530> once

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.860 

so<00:03:07.070> we<00:03:07.190> did<00:03:07.340> one<00:03:07.520> already<00:03:07.820> for<00:03:07.970> practice<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:08.660> can

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
so we did one already for practice I can

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.080 
so we did one already for practice I can
kind<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.170> just<00:03:09.230> do<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.130> remaining<00:03:11.060> three

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
kind of just do the remaining three

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.510 
kind of just do the remaining three
quickly<00:03:12.020> i'm<00:03:12.140> just<00:03:12.380> adding<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:13.130> darker

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
quickly i'm just adding the darker

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.900 
quickly i'm just adding the darker
purple<00:03:13.910> around<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.570> top<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.050> kind<00:03:15.770> of<00:03:16.190> along

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
purple around the top and kind of along

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.750 
purple around the top and kind of along
the<00:03:17.090> sides<00:03:17.300> just<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.780> little<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:19.370> I'll<00:03:19.550> do<00:03:19.730> all

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
the sides just a little and I'll do all

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:45.230 
the sides just a little and I'll do all
the<00:03:20.030> flowers<00:03:20.540> at<00:03:20.720> once

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.490 

and<00:03:46.240> then<00:03:46.510> we'll<00:03:46.630> take<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.870> lighter<00:03:47.200> purple

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
and then we'll take the lighter purple

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.559 
and then we'll take the lighter purple
and<00:03:47.800> we'll<00:03:47.980> blend<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.550> darker<00:03:48.940> color<00:03:49.150> out<00:03:49.390> i'm

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
and we'll blend the darker color out i'm

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.870 
and we'll blend the darker color out i'm
going<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.780> start<00:03:50.020> toward<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:50.950> center<00:03:51.550> of<00:03:51.580> the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
going to start toward the center of the

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.960 
going to start toward the center of the
flower<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.450> then<00:03:53.260> we'll<00:03:53.530> go<00:03:54.280> between<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.819> two

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
flower and then we'll go between the two

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.449 
flower and then we'll go between the two
colors<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.480> blend<00:03:55.690> them<00:03:56.010> now<00:03:57.010> you<00:03:57.069> might<00:03:57.280> want

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
colors and blend them now you might want

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.390 
colors and blend them now you might want
to<00:03:57.520> have<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:58.290> scratch<00:03:59.290> piece<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.680> paper<00:03:59.830> on<00:03:59.950> hand

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
to have a scratch piece of paper on hand

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.490 
to have a scratch piece of paper on hand
because<00:04:00.610> this<00:04:01.300> lighter<00:04:01.600> colored<00:04:01.959> marker<00:04:02.319> is

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
because this lighter colored marker is

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.410 
because this lighter colored marker is
going<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.739> pick<00:04:02.950> up<00:04:03.130> color<00:04:03.610> from<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:03.970> darker

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
going to pick up color from the darker

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.150 
going to pick up color from the darker
and<00:04:04.690> so<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:04.930> then<00:04:05.170> you<00:04:05.500> just<00:04:05.650> kind<00:04:05.800> of<00:04:05.890> want<00:04:05.950> to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
and so you then you just kind of want to

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.610 
and so you then you just kind of want to
run<00:04:06.340> it<00:04:06.489> out<00:04:06.610> on<00:04:06.790> scratch<00:04:07.090> paper<00:04:07.380> so<00:04:08.380> that<00:04:08.410> you

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
run it out on scratch paper so that you

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:17.940 
run it out on scratch paper so that you
can<00:04:08.769> get<00:04:08.890> that<00:04:08.950> shading<00:04:16.350> if<00:04:17.350> you've<00:04:17.530> not<00:04:17.680> seen

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
can get that shading if you've not seen

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.530 
can get that shading if you've not seen
these<00:04:18.190> Zig<00:04:18.489> markers<00:04:18.850> before<00:04:19.209> I've<00:04:19.329> done<00:04:19.359> quite

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
these Zig markers before I've done quite

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.629 
these Zig markers before I've done quite
a<00:04:19.810> few<00:04:19.870> videos<00:04:20.200> using<00:04:20.560> them<00:04:20.859> I've<00:04:21.310> used<00:04:21.489> them

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
a few videos using them I've used them

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.969 
a few videos using them I've used them
to<00:04:21.820> make<00:04:21.970> really<00:04:22.300> fun<00:04:22.540> simple<00:04:23.020> backgrounds

you can see how quick and easy these
blend<00:05:00.160> together

00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:32.129 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:35.129 

now<00:05:33.129> I<00:05:33.159> want<00:05:33.430> to<00:05:33.490> add<00:05:33.550> the<00:05:34.180> hello<00:05:34.509> die-cut<00:05:34.990> so

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
now I want to add the hello die-cut so

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:36.210 
now I want to add the hello die-cut so
I'm<00:05:35.229> just<00:05:35.349> going<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:35.560> add<00:05:35.740> a<00:05:35.770> little<00:05:36.009> bit<00:05:36.159> of

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
I'm just going to add a little bit of

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.899 
I'm just going to add a little bit of
glue<00:05:36.580> onto<00:05:37.000> my<00:05:37.270> craft<00:05:37.599> mat<00:05:38.340> I'm<00:05:39.340> gonna<00:05:39.610> get

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
glue onto my craft mat I'm gonna get

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:42.119 
glue onto my craft mat I'm gonna get
sticky<00:05:40.449> and<00:05:40.629> messy<00:05:40.689> but<00:05:41.560> I<00:05:41.590> think<00:05:41.860> this<00:05:41.979> will

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
sticky and messy but I think this will

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:43.890 
sticky and messy but I think this will
be<00:05:42.189> kind<00:05:42.669> of<00:05:42.759> the<00:05:42.819> quickest<00:05:43.180> way<00:05:43.360> to<00:05:43.419> go<00:05:43.810> about

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
be kind of the quickest way to go about

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.159 
be kind of the quickest way to go about
this<00:05:44.219> this<00:05:45.219> glue<00:05:45.550> will<00:05:45.759> dry<00:05:45.840> relatively<00:05:46.840> clear

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
this this glue will dry relatively clear

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.899 
this this glue will dry relatively clear
so<00:05:47.409> I<00:05:47.469> want<00:05:47.710> really<00:05:48.219> worried<00:05:48.490> about<00:05:48.699> that

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
so I want really worried about that

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.499 
so I want really worried about that
showing<00:05:50.550> but<00:05:51.550> I<00:05:51.580> might<00:05:51.789> want<00:05:51.939> to<00:05:52.030> go<00:05:52.120> a<00:05:52.150> little

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
showing but I might want to go a little

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.779 
showing but I might want to go a little
bit<00:05:52.870> lighter<00:05:53.050> hand<00:05:53.319> on<00:05:53.860> the<00:05:54.099> rest<00:05:54.370> I<00:05:54.550> kind<00:05:54.759> of

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
bit lighter hand on the rest I kind of

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:01.140 
bit lighter hand on the rest I kind of
got<00:05:54.939> a<00:05:54.969> lot<00:05:55.180> on<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:55.419> first<00:05:55.659> one<00:06:00.030> and<00:06:01.030> you

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
got a lot on that first one and you

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.610 
got a lot on that first one and you
might<00:06:01.300> want<00:06:01.479> to<00:06:01.569> turn<00:06:01.719> it<00:06:01.900> over<00:06:02.020> and<00:06:02.199> just<00:06:02.439> give

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
might want to turn it over and just give

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.559 
might want to turn it over and just give
it<00:06:02.740> a<00:06:02.800> rub<00:06:03.009> and<00:06:03.310> this<00:06:03.729> will<00:06:03.909> make<00:06:04.030> sure<00:06:04.240> that<00:06:04.449> it

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
it a rub and this will make sure that it

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.059 
it a rub and this will make sure that it
dries<00:06:04.870> flat<00:06:05.289> everything<00:06:05.800> gets<00:06:05.979> stuck<00:06:06.129> on<00:06:06.430> I

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:08.069 
dries flat everything gets stuck on I

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.680 
dries flat everything gets stuck on I
think<00:06:09.069> the<00:06:09.190> quickest<00:06:09.550> way<00:06:09.729> to<00:06:09.789> adhere<00:06:10.539> these

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
think the quickest way to adhere these

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.689 
think the quickest way to adhere these
on<00:06:10.900> would<00:06:11.110> just<00:06:11.289> be<00:06:11.440> to<00:06:11.710> add<00:06:12.009> a<00:06:12.039> little<00:06:12.400> liquid

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:12.699 
on would just be to add a little liquid

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.050 
on would just be to add a little liquid
glue<00:06:13.000> around<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.389> edges<00:06:13.949> do<00:06:14.949> all<00:06:15.310> four<00:06:15.669> at<00:06:15.909> the

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
glue around the edges do all four at the

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.959 
glue around the edges do all four at the
same<00:06:16.240> time<00:06:16.479> this<00:06:16.780> will<00:06:17.400> maximize<00:06:18.400> your<00:06:18.699> time

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
same time this will maximize your time

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:21.330 
same time this will maximize your time
it's<00:06:19.300> much<00:06:19.479> quicker<00:06:19.690> to<00:06:20.080> do<00:06:20.229> it<00:06:20.409> you<00:06:20.979> know<00:06:21.099> each

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
it's much quicker to do it you know each

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.140 
it's much quicker to do it you know each
step<00:06:21.699> one<00:06:21.969> by<00:06:22.150> one<00:06:22.830> and<00:06:23.830> then<00:06:24.430> there's<00:06:24.639> lots<00:06:25.000> of

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
step one by one and then there's lots of

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.459 
step one by one and then there's lots of
different<00:06:25.210> ways<00:06:25.449> you<00:06:25.569> can<00:06:25.750> business<00:06:26.139> in<00:06:26.319> this

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469
