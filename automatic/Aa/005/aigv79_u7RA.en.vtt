 add today we are going to make a 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:43.160
 math class visit the farm 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.160
 with these sums of these multiply 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:54.280
 how many females are next big and

 no clothes and a clubbing smudges 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.550
 you do not very well you like to add and subtract 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:12.010
 yes you like the Marist school

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:23.990
 we look for the easiest mechanism so that 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:28.100
 the child learn math playing as 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.770
 we use the seeds that is 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.260
