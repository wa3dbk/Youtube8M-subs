00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
arm now we're going to stretch and Bend

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.690 
arm now we're going to stretch and Bend
just<00:02:19.910> using<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.030> arms<00:02:21.360> stretch<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:22.200> Bend<00:02:23.100> now

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
just using the arms stretch and Bend now

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.330 
just using the arms stretch and Bend now
stretch<00:02:24.270> up<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:25.020> your<00:02:25.200> right<00:02:25.380> arm<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.860> bend

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
stretch up with your right arm and bend

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.000 
stretch up with your right arm and bend
your<00:02:26.610> right<00:02:26.940> arm<00:02:27.180> stretch<00:02:28.020> up<00:02:28.260> with<00:02:28.620> your<00:02:28.770> left

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
your right arm stretch up with your left

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.880 
your right arm stretch up with your left
and<00:02:29.250> Bend<00:02:29.880> let's<00:02:30.840> see<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.320> can<00:02:31.470> put<00:02:31.650> all

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
and Bend let's see if we can put all

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.480 
and Bend let's see if we can put all
that<00:02:32.190> together<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.540> would<00:02:33.720> look<00:02:33.900> like<00:02:33.960> this

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
that together so it would look like this

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.660 
that together so it would look like this
you're<00:02:35.630> bending<00:02:36.630> your<00:02:37.260> arm<00:02:37.770> stretching<00:02:38.550> and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
you're bending your arm stretching and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.080 
you're bending your arm stretching and
bending<00:02:38.880> you're<00:02:39.780> twisting<00:02:40.680> your<00:02:40.710> body<00:02:41.090> this

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
bending you're twisting your body this

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.240 
bending you're twisting your body this
is<00:02:42.270> primarily<00:02:42.750> obviously<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.950> rhythm

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
is primarily obviously for the rhythm

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.300 
is primarily obviously for the rhythm
the<00:02:44.400> Latin<00:02:44.760> dances<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.680> do<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:47.070> in

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the Latin dances and you can do this in

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.870 
the Latin dances and you can do this in
all<00:02:47.580> different<00:02:47.610> rhythms<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.540> could<00:02:48.810> go<00:02:48.990> slow

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
all different rhythms you could go slow

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.330 
all different rhythms you could go slow
quick<00:02:50.880> quick<00:02:51.150> slow<00:02:51.900> quick<00:02:52.850> quick<00:02:53.850> or<00:02:54.690> one<00:02:55.530> two

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
quick quick slow quick quick or one two

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.730 
quick quick slow quick quick or one two
three<00:02:57.230> cha-cha-cha<00:02:58.490> two<00:02:59.490> three<00:02:59.960> four<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.260> one

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
three cha-cha-cha two three four and one

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.710 
three cha-cha-cha two three four and one
two<00:03:02.390> three<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:03.870> we<00:03:04.560> talk<00:03:04.800> about<00:03:04.830> expression

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
two three if we talk about expression

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.560 
two three if we talk about expression
expression<00:03:06.720> would<00:03:07.170> start<00:03:07.730> again<00:03:08.730> physically

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
expression would start again physically

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.770 
expression would start again physically
how<00:03:10.140> we<00:03:10.200> express<00:03:10.860> our<00:03:11.190> body<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:12.240> whom<00:03:12.510> we

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
how we express our body to whom we

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.490 
how we express our body to whom we
express<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:14.100> also<00:03:15.000> our<00:03:15.570> thoughts<00:03:16.020> so

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
express it to and also our thoughts so

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.720 
express it to and also our thoughts so
if<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.820> thought<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:19.489> I'm<00:03:20.489> going<00:03:20.700> to

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
if I have the thought and I'm going to

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.610 
if I have the thought and I'm going to
think<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.150> kitty<00:03:21.540> cat

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.040 

so<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.920> thought<00:03:26.180> transfers<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.480> eyes<00:03:27.630> you

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
so the thought transfers to the eyes you

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.530 
so the thought transfers to the eyes you
think<00:03:28.350> about<00:03:28.590> something<00:03:28.890> you<00:03:29.550> send<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.120> message

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
think about something you send a message

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.830 
think about something you send a message
to<00:03:30.780> someone<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:31.739> you<00:03:32.489> could<00:03:32.940> think<00:03:33.150> as<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.480> lady

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
to someone and you could think as a lady

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.890 
to someone and you could think as a lady
like<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.200> kitty<00:03:34.560> cat<00:03:34.650> if<00:03:35.100> you're<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.280> man<00:03:35.900> the

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
like a kitty cat if you're a man the

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.170 
like a kitty cat if you're a man the
gentleman<00:03:37.380> might<00:03:37.560> think<00:03:37.860> like<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.070> lion<00:03:38.459> a

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.940 

predator<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.360> example<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.410> would<00:03:43.739> have

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
predator for example so that would have

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.400 
predator for example so that would have
a<00:03:43.980> little<00:03:44.340> bit<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.610> do<00:03:44.760> with<00:03:44.910> expression<00:03:45.410> not

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
a little bit to do with expression not

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.759 
a little bit to do with expression not
necessarily<00:03:47.250> facial<00:03:47.790> expression<00:03:48.330> like<00:03:48.769> this

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
necessarily facial expression like this

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.380 
necessarily facial expression like this
but<00:03:50.760> just<00:03:50.790> simple<00:03:51.660> thought
