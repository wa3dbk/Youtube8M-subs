00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.970
 good morning to all boys therefore a 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.710
 short video to show you a little one 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.420
 purchase I made not long ago 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.070
 in which he addressed me today but before 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.980
 I wanted to thank all the people who 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.510
 yesterday they greeted it recognized 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.760
 took photos with me at turin comics 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.320
 you were very many indeed 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.410
 because it seemed to me they were almost all 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.110
 females it is nothing if you have been a lot 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:45.500
 sweet and thank you 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:48.890
 then the purchase and here is therefore not a 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.980
 invoices the site and this is called returns 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.440
 nobs section of obsession I hope to 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.469
 having spoken it well and was looking 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.350
 this thing for a long time 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.180
 then they are sitting and shooting from the outside 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.190
 they are very simple they are glued 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.610
 they are very thin heart-shaped molds like 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.899
 you see long ago I bought this 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.820
 which, however, is very thin, let's say it's ok 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.950
 center should not become overly 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.340
 big though i do facts once i did 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.520
 very difficult to cover the shape of the well 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.560
 heart precisely because if I put one 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.240
 transparent resin base and no 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.550
 I fill up completely and then behind I have to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.979
 put the colored base on the part 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.410
 colored which exterior since not 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.119
 I could fill it too much you could see this 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.340
 instead it is the mold I was looking for 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.619
 if I fill it right up to here 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.599
 transparent resin and then this for us 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.060
 I put colored resin, yes 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:47.780
 will notice and not equip the difference of 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.759
 two layers is precisely why I liked 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.250
 a lot however part that among other things not 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.899
 it was very convenient because it was never 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.759
 said and to let the resin dry 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.959
 it was a problem sometimes you do a little 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:04.819
 twisted so I found these I have 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:07.039
 paid or are eight from both 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.060
 so 4 dollars each is roughly 3 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.759
 euro and 50 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.890
 I think and shipping is considered 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.380
 enough 12 dollars though oh well I have 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.410
 long wanted I was looking for so does it 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.810
 same and I bought just 22 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.230
 molds that are very comfortable are beautiful 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.470
 grandini are profound in fact the 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.730
 problem that oppresses us 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.650
 it is also not exaggerated and therefore can 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.060
 come some pendants and so on and they are 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.010
 very comfortable because having this shape 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.260
 know already supported without need 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.900
 find a particular plan on which 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.100
 put them none of the little ones 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.110
 purchase I made I wanted to do it for you 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.940
 see why if you like them 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.220
 Resin creations I'm sure there 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.970
 you will also like these molds and I will 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.970
 greeting hello
