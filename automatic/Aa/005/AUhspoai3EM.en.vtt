00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:03.617
In order to make best possible smash

00:00:03.617 --> 00:00:06.265
how the elbow should be set

00:00:06.265 --> 00:00:09.314
how the elbow should be used

00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:10.848
ok now watch this please

00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:14.807
set, shuttle is coming from there to here

00:00:14.807 --> 00:00:17.903
I am hitting shuttle from here to the other side

00:00:17.903 --> 00:00:23.338
there fore my elbow should be pointing straight backward

00:00:23.338 --> 00:00:24.619
to the shuttle cock

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.302
so my elbow line, shuttle should be opposite to each other

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:34.441
that's the way to create maximum power to the shuttle cock

00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:35.577
watch this

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:37.558
so shuttle is coming from there

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:39.644
elbow straight back

00:00:39.644 --> 00:00:42.541
shuttle comes and bang

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.759
many players they turn the body

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:50.016
so elbow goes that way when shuttle is coming from that way

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:57.334
so my elbow is ready to hit it that way

00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:58.469
watch

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.484
when players turn elbow that way

00:01:03.052 --> 00:01:05.118
when shuttle is coming from that way

00:01:05.118 --> 00:01:06.351
so look

00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:07.437
that way

00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:10.736
they go they have to turn that way

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:11.667
so look

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:12.450
like this

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:14.220
like this

00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:20.569
instead of like that and then straight forward

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.985
if I do that way elbow back straight

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:31.569
back straight and then elbow goes straight forward

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.084
elbow back straight

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:37.119
and then stretch forward

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.185
because elbow is straight back

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:42.723
all my power will go to the shuttle cock

00:01:42.723 --> 00:01:45.534
in straight line

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:47.867
but if my elbow goes that way

00:01:49.268 --> 00:01:57.569
so I set my posture, I set my elbow to use power that way

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.152
when elbow goes that way

00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:02.601
this is really good to hit over there

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.083
because I am hitting there not there

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:10.687
and elbow is there, there fore he has to do like this

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.850
like this

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.570
so, it looks like set

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:25.402
to throw the dart that way and then throw dart like this

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:30.483
but if elbow goes there, it goes straight

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.734
watch my elbow

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:34.800
elbow should be straight back

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.517
here

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.583
straight back

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:40.951
straight back and then bang

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:43.066
set

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.632
wrong way

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:58.534
so there is turning

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:04.616
right way again, elbow don't move, don't move

00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:07.316
elbow goes straight back

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.151
so

00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:16.632
this is my racket this is shuttle cock

00:03:16.632 --> 00:03:22.317
shuttle fly this way, racket should come from that way bang

00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:27.049
opposite hit, that is the maximum power you can use

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.916
but many players because they turn their elbow backwards

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:37.184
shuttle fly this way, their (players) racket come from that way

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:38.866
like this

00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:42.284
like that, no

00:03:42.284 --> 00:03:46.684
it should be shuttle come this way, your elbow

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:50.864
your racket should come from opposite way to hit

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:55.768
that is the maximum way to hit it, clean accurate way to hit it

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:56.867
have a look again

00:03:58.315 --> 00:03:59.784
focus on my elbow

00:04:01.065 --> 00:04:01.716
there

00:04:03.253 --> 00:04:04.454
rather than there

00:04:06.668 --> 00:04:07.370
that way

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:12.906
watch elbow, look wait, elbow don't turn

00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:18.789
this one go straight, straight, straight

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.772
not turning, because straight and then you can come straight forward

00:04:23.772 --> 00:04:25.507
if you turn, you turn

00:04:27.572 --> 00:04:28.155
back

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.621
back

00:04:34.056 --> 00:04:34.489
back

00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:36.474
not

00:04:37.507 --> 00:04:38.090
turn

00:04:39.905 --> 00:04:41.060
turn, turn
