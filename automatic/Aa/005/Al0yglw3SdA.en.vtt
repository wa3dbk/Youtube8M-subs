 Thank you because I understood that if I 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.429

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:44.730
 already puts the church still see me like this 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.309
 he biblical basis of points to repudiate 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.500
 Your wife marries another woman. 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.960
 adultery and that case with the woman 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.070
 repudiated by her husband as well 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.629
 commits adultery and also quotes 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.180
 his wife not being because of 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.690
 fornication marry 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.760
 another the word of your voice is 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.799
 especially when viewed from the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.960
 perspective of a society that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:25.080
 value the pleasure and feelings above 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:27.780
 commitments and duties and god hates that 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:38.869
 a man and a woman do not continue 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:47.360
 together do not forgive is god the god who 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:47.360
 forgive sends me to forgive is worse than 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.819
 [Music] 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:03.149
 man with the certainty that everything that 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.479
 are making it happen the way they 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.869
 they dreamed and wanted and because I 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.930
 I know that human nature is relative 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.230
 sic voca here i accept that jesus me 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.629
 told me to forgive everyone forgive 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.530
 always especially because I want to be 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.569
 always forgiven but the god of these 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.379
 people do not forgive 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.629
 he is a hypocrite and a Pharisee god who 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.420
 says we have to forgive seventy 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.230
 times seven but he does not forgive anything 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.200
 he tells us to forgive the enemy 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.750
 that has done worse to us than ours. 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.480
 but he did not forgive a woman who 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.049
 Could not stand to be married at the wedding. 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.879
 unhappy broke up if she liked 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.489
 someone a year later two years later 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.310
 five years after getting married she goes 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.980
 be called an adulteress for this life and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.989
 today while she does not marry anyone 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.269
 She is considered an adult only for 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:09.060
 her potential to have been married and to be 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.120
 potentially a woman who can 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.340
 linking a man with the potential and 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.889
 because everyone projects the heat that 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.260
 they feel 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:21.739
 I would not be able to stand in her place 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.000
 without sex 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:29.489
 From him 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.919
 he attributes what he could not 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.290
 so she does not have anybody herself is already a 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:42.299
 dutra in potential a hard state 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:44.489
 latent nor comb philosophizing about doing 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.819
 a parallel that the church looks this 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.819
 society 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:04:00.449
 the only thing you can not figure out is 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:03.359
 truthfulness of manifesting salt and 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:08.329
 purity of god, live a beautiful life 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:12.470
 no it's not because their god is like this 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:16.560
 do not forgive do not like moralise 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:19.530
 the guarantee that they have not to make 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.739
 same thing is to keep in everyone that 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.900
 has separated 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:31.520
 panic fear and sub retention so that they 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.610
 themselves to be frightened and obeyed 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.860
 divine laws 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.889
 afraid that they see this 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:51.880

 women to lure them out 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:30.060
