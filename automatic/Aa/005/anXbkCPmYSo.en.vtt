00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
match everything up based on where those

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.780 
match everything up based on where those
markings<00:01:43.439> are<00:01:43.560> at<00:01:43.680> once<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.340> was<00:01:44.460> happy<00:01:44.670> with

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
markings are at once I was happy with

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
markings are at once I was happy with
the<00:01:44.820> measurements<00:01:45.390> after<00:01:45.540> dry<00:01:45.840> fitting<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the measurements after dry fitting the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.190 
the measurements after dry fitting the
PVC<00:01:46.799> DIY<00:01:47.340> siphon<00:01:47.970> together<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.479> went<00:01:48.810> ahead<00:01:48.899> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
PVC DIY siphon together I went ahead and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.840 
PVC DIY siphon together I went ahead and
started<00:01:49.380> gluing<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.860> pieces<00:01:50.189> together<00:01:50.369> one

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
started gluing the pieces together one

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.609 
started gluing the pieces together one
important<00:01:51.329> note<00:01:51.360> though<00:01:51.689> when<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
important note though when you do the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.249 
important note though when you do the
PVC<00:01:53.130> gluing<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.850> insert<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> PVC<00:01:54.810> into<00:01:55.229> a

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
PVC gluing and you insert the PVC into a

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.840 
PVC gluing and you insert the PVC into a
fitting<00:01:55.710> there's<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.159> be<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.670> inch

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
fitting there's going to be a one inch
drop<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.420> take<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:58.020> inch<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.469> to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
drop so you take that one inch in to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.380 
drop so you take that one inch in to
account<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.100> any<00:01:59.340> other<00:01:59.579> measurements<00:02:00.270> that

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
into the PVC and glued it together so I

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.600 
into the PVC and glued it together so I
could<00:03:07.290> go<00:03:07.440> ahead<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.890> use<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.280> wrench<00:03:08.489> to

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
could go ahead and use the wrench to

has been completed what I'm going to do
here<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.460> measure<00:04:30.090> what<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:30.900> distance<00:04:31.350> from<00:04:31.770> a

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
here is measure what the distance from a

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.590 
here is measure what the distance from a
15<00:04:32.280> gallon<00:04:32.430> water<00:04:32.700> change<00:04:33.090> to<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.420> water

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
15 gallon water change to the water

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.470 
15 gallon water change to the water
surfaces<00:04:34.230> and<00:04:34.530> then<00:04:35.010> again<00:04:35.400> what<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:35.970> 10<00:04:36.300> gallon

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
surfaces and then again what a 10 gallon

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.660 
surfaces and then again what a 10 gallon
water<00:04:36.750> change<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.500> water<00:04:37.710> surface<00:04:37.950> is<00:04:38.340> and

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
water change to the water surface is and

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.010 
water change to the water surface is and
I'm<00:04:38.790> going<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.000> take<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.360> measurement<00:04:39.570> and

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
I'm going to take that measurement and

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.080 
I'm going to take that measurement and
measure<00:04:40.320> out<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:41.010> piece<00:04:41.250> of<00:04:41.430> PVC<00:04:41.580> that's

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
measure out the piece of PVC that's

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.330 
measure out the piece of PVC that's
going<00:04:42.360> into<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.810> tank<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.290> match<00:04:43.560> it<00:04:43.800> up<00:04:43.920> with

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
going into the tank and match it up with

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.640 
going into the tank and match it up with
that<00:04:44.580> water<00:04:44.880> line<00:04:45.150> at<00:04:45.390> 15<00:04:45.810> gallons<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.440> the

and the 10 gallon water mark measured 5

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.130 
and the 10 gallon water mark measured 5
and<00:04:53.640> 1/2<00:04:53.700> inches<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.540> I'm<00:04:54.630> going<00:04:54.810> to<00:04:54.870> go<00:04:54.990> ahead

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
and 1/2 inches so I'm going to go ahead

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.710 
and 1/2 inches so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:55.410> cut<00:04:55.590> the<00:04:55.770> PVC<00:04:55.950> down<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.820> 7<00:04:57.210> inches<00:04:57.540> and

and cut the PVC down to 7 inches and

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.120 
and cut the PVC down to 7 inches and
then<00:04:57.990> I'm<00:04:58.080> going<00:04:58.230> to<00:04:58.260> use<00:04:58.410> another<00:04:58.560> piece<00:04:58.950> of

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
then I'm going to use another piece of

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.040 
then I'm going to use another piece of
PVC<00:04:59.310> and<00:04:59.880> cut<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.270> down<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.450> 5<00:05:00.810> and<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.020> half

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
PVC and cut it down to 5 and a half

PVC and cut it down to 5 and a half
inches<00:05:01.560> earlier<00:05:02.250> in<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.430> video<00:05:02.550> I<00:05:02.730> mentioned

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
inches earlier in the video I mentioned

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.940 
inches earlier in the video I mentioned
I<00:05:03.180> was<00:05:03.210> going<00:05:03.420> to<00:05:03.480> glue<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.840> entire<00:05:03.950> siphon

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
I was going to glue the entire siphon

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.590 
I was going to glue the entire siphon
except<00:05:05.490> for<00:05:05.670> the<00:05:05.760> portion<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.180> goes<00:05:06.240> into

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
except for the portion that goes into

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.870 
except for the portion that goes into
the<00:05:06.720> tank<00:05:06.930> this<00:05:07.290> is<00:05:07.440> why<00:05:07.650> I<00:05:07.950> want<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.670> be<00:05:08.760> able

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
the tank this is why I want to be able

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.090 
the tank this is why I want to be able
to<00:05:09.060> have<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.480> option<00:05:09.660> of<00:05:10.170> doing<00:05:10.350> 10<00:05:10.800> gallon

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
to have the option of doing 10 gallon

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.000 
to have the option of doing 10 gallon
water<00:05:11.280> changes<00:05:11.820> 15<00:05:12.720> gallon<00:05:13.080> water<00:05:13.260> changes<00:05:13.770> or

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
water changes 15 gallon water changes or

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.370 
water changes 15 gallon water changes or
whatever<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.790> amount<00:05:15.030> I<00:05:15.270> want<00:05:15.510> based<00:05:16.080> on<00:05:16.260> the

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
whatever the amount I want based on the

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.530 
whatever the amount I want based on the
length<00:05:16.650> of<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:17.040> PVC<00:05:17.490> that's<00:05:17.700> inside<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.270> tank

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
length of the PVC that's inside the tank

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.690 
length of the PVC that's inside the tank
so<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:18.750> want<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.050> be<00:05:19.140> able<00:05:19.230> to<00:05:19.380> remove<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:20.220> PVC

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
so I want to be able to remove the PVC

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.520 
so I want to be able to remove the PVC
that<00:05:20.730> goes<00:05:21.030> in<00:05:21.180> the<00:05:21.270> tank<00:05:21.480> and<00:05:21.750> switch<00:05:22.020> it<00:05:22.170> out

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
that goes in the tank and switch it out

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.500 
that goes in the tank and switch it out
remember<00:05:23.190> when<00:05:23.370> cutting<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.820> PVC<00:05:24.240> you<00:05:24.360> have

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
remember when cutting the PVC you have

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.360 
remember when cutting the PVC you have
to<00:05:24.630> take<00:05:24.780> into<00:05:24.960> account<00:05:25.080> that<00:05:25.530> one<00:05:25.860> inch<00:05:26.100> of

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
to take into account that one inch of

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.730 
to take into account that one inch of
PVC<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.240> goes<00:05:27.630> into<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:28.080> fitting<00:05:28.320> so<00:05:28.620> that

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
PVC that goes into the fitting so that

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.140 
PVC that goes into the fitting so that
you<00:05:28.860> get<00:05:28.980> the<00:05:29.130> right<00:05:29.280> measurement<00:05:29.820> as<00:05:29.970> I

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
you get the right measurement as I

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.180 
you get the right measurement as I
mentioned<00:05:30.510> earlier<00:05:30.780> typically<00:05:31.320> I'll<00:05:31.470> do<00:05:31.650> a<00:05:31.680> 15

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
mentioned earlier typically I'll do a 15

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.190 
mentioned earlier typically I'll do a 15
gallon<00:05:32.490> water<00:05:32.670> change<00:05:33.090> every<00:05:33.270> Friday<00:05:33.840> or

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
gallon water change every Friday or

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.900 
gallon water change every Friday or
sometimes<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:34.890> only<00:05:35.040> do<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.220> 10<00:05:35.460> gallon<00:05:35.610> water

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
sometimes I only do a 10 gallon water

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.670 
sometimes I only do a 10 gallon water
change<00:05:36.330> other<00:05:36.630> times<00:05:36.900> I'll<00:05:37.050> do<00:05:37.170> a<00:05:37.200> 20<00:05:37.560> gallon

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
change other times I'll do a 20 gallon

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.260 
change other times I'll do a 20 gallon
water<00:05:38.010> change<00:05:38.310> so<00:05:38.490> here<00:05:38.730> you<00:05:38.820> can<00:05:38.940> see<00:05:39.150> the

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
water change so here you can see the

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.970 
water change so here you can see the
difference<00:05:39.630> in<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.840> size<00:05:40.050> of<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.560> PVC<00:05:40.950> that

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
difference in the size of the PVC that

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.980 
difference in the size of the PVC that
goes<00:05:41.250> in<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.490> tank<00:05:41.670> just<00:05:42.030> for<00:05:42.180> reference<00:05:42.360> ones

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
goes in the tank just for reference ones

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.780 
goes in the tank just for reference ones
longer<00:05:43.350> than<00:05:43.500> the<00:05:43.620> other<00:05:43.740> obviously<00:05:44.550> the

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
longer than the other obviously the

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.610 
longer than the other obviously the
longer<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:45.300> is<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.690> more<00:05:45.780> water<00:05:46.290> you're<00:05:46.470> going

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
longer it is the more water you're going

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.080 
longer it is the more water you're going
to<00:05:46.680> pull<00:05:46.860> out<00:05:46.980> before<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:47.460> site<00:05:47.670> from<00:05:47.790> breaks

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
to pull out before that site from breaks

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.480 
to pull out before that site from breaks
the<00:05:48.420> shorter<00:05:48.810> is<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.260> less<00:05:49.530> water<00:05:49.890> change<00:05:50.220> or

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
the shorter is the less water change or

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.530 
the shorter is the less water change or
the<00:05:50.550> less<00:05:50.700> water<00:05:50.970> you're<00:05:51.120> going<00:05:51.240> to<00:05:51.300> take<00:05:51.420> out

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
the less water you're going to take out

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.360 
the less water you're going to take out
your<00:05:51.690> tank<00:05:51.990> before<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.500> siphon<00:05:52.830> breaks<00:05:53.040> I

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
your tank before the siphon breaks I

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.160 
your tank before the siphon breaks I
have<00:05:53.670> rain<00:05:53.940> gutters<00:05:54.300> all<00:05:54.540> around<00:05:54.870> my<00:05:54.990> house

have rain gutters all around my house

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.990 
have rain gutters all around my house
however<00:05:55.530> purchasing<00:05:56.160> a<00:05:56.250> hose<00:05:56.460> that's<00:05:56.700> long

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
however purchasing a hose that's long

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.160 
however purchasing a hose that's long
enough<00:05:57.030> to<00:05:57.420> reach<00:05:57.600> one<00:05:57.810> of<00:05:57.840> those<00:05:57.990> rain

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.170 
enough to reach one of those rain

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.230 
enough to reach one of those rain
gutters<00:05:58.530> it's<00:05:58.710> just<00:05:58.890> too<00:05:59.070> expensive<00:05:59.210> so<00:06:00.210> I

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
gutters it's just too expensive so I

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.150 
gutters it's just too expensive so I
decided<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.690> get<00:06:00.810> a<00:06:00.870> little<00:06:00.930> creative<00:06:01.350> instead

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
decided to get a little creative instead

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.710 
decided to get a little creative instead
of<00:06:02.250> doing<00:06:02.490> that<00:06:02.520> what<00:06:02.910> I<00:06:02.940> did<00:06:03.240> is<00:06:03.390> purchase

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
of doing that what I did is purchase

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.140 
of doing that what I did is purchase
some<00:06:03.900> PVC<00:06:04.260> mounted<00:06:05.130> it<00:06:05.250> on<00:06:05.430> the<00:06:05.670> wall<00:06:05.850> outside

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
some PVC mounted it on the wall outside

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.050 
some PVC mounted it on the wall outside
and<00:06:06.840> ran<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.290> PVC<00:06:07.770> up<00:06:07.950> to<00:06:08.100> my<00:06:08.220> front<00:06:08.430> door<00:06:08.580> so

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
and ran the PVC up to my front door so

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.730 
and ran the PVC up to my front door so
now<00:06:09.270> what<00:06:09.540> I<00:06:09.570> could<00:06:09.690> do<00:06:09.900> is<00:06:10.170> take<00:06:10.440> the<00:06:10.560> other

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
now what I could do is take the other

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.400 
now what I could do is take the other

then<00:06:16.350> route<00:06:16.860> the<00:06:16.890> water<00:06:17.250> that's<00:06:17.490> coming<00:06:17.580> out

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
then route the water that's coming out

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.120 
then route the water that's coming out
of<00:06:17.970> tank<00:06:18.360> directly<00:06:18.870> into<00:06:19.470> one<00:06:19.650> of<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.920> rain
