00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.819
 no no 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.950
 we can start the fifth tutorial 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.560
 we will see further spin control 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.630
 front 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.660
 computing 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.530
 and his life 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.530
 where are we 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.390
 Y 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.020
 if I want to make bread here back 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.530
 and thanks to the left 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.039
 is going to do a little bit of everything behind 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.039
 here 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.760
 on the right 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.360
 is different 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.360
 that come up by hand lowers the time 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.259
 I can master it with more needs 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.259
 I want to enjoy 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:26.380
 we continue with the rotation management 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.969
 for that we're going to have a palms grip 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.560
 down right hand and not even 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.600
 initial 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.670
 change the vagina from the sense of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.539
 clock hands with a contribution 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.229
 giving palms upwards and 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.229
 above 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.020
 important place education in the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.680
 sense of all 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.170
 yes Bogota 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.410
 from a beginning back where the palms 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.410
 open 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.850
 already with form in practice that can 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:20.790
 start doing more number of 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.790
 rotations and go down to the left 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.300
 but according to the practice 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.020
 moving 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.790
 I want to face 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.480
 for this movement we use 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.470
 the leg 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.790
 I'm going to give a lot more you want 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.080
 palms and two parties 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.930
 it can not be so much with the right hand 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.849
 as with the left hand with 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.489
 either of the two hands I can 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.489
 continue the horizontal turn 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.230
 want 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.230
 palm 2 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.030
 is applying any other type of 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.030
 movements that we already have 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.319
 and changes of address 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.600
 in the rotation 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.300
 and I left it 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.459
 to practice and see you 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.980
 that's it 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.980
 now 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.500
 two
