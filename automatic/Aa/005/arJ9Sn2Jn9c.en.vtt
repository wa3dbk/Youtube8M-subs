it okay so the first scene I noticed was

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.760 
it okay so the first scene I noticed was
when<00:01:44.909> they're<00:01:45.179> practicing<00:01:45.750> getting<00:01:46.470> ready

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
for the army to come vampires so this is

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.859 
for the army to come vampires so this is
the<00:01:54.840> first<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:56.209> you're<00:01:57.209> going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.569> braid

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
the first one you're going to just braid

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.249 
the first one you're going to just braid
it<00:01:57.899> down<00:01:58.349> again<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> ends<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.110> was

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
it down again to the ends now it was

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.160 
it down again to the ends now it was
really<00:02:01.590> quick<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.520> from<00:02:02.670> what<00:02:02.819> I<00:02:02.849> could<00:02:02.970> see

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
really quick but from what I could see

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.859 
really quick but from what I could see
she<00:02:04.170> had<00:02:04.319> just<00:02:04.670> left<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.090> two<00:02:06.299> braids<00:02:06.630> like

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
she had just left the two braids like

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.539 
she had just left the two braids like
this<00:02:07.140> with<00:02:07.380> her<00:02:07.560> hair<00:02:07.829> down<00:02:10.220> exactly<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.370> I'm

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
this with her hair down exactly like I'm

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.550 
this with her hair down exactly like I'm
about<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.880> do<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.329> her<00:02:12.989> hair<00:02:13.170> out<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.349> little

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
about to do it her hair out a little

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:21.259 
about to do it her hair out a little
more<00:02:13.799> curl<00:02:14.450> added<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:17.989> but<00:02:18.989> essentially<00:02:20.269> same

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
more curl added in but essentially same

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.610 
more curl added in but essentially same
thing<00:02:22.400> so<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.269> this<00:02:24.480> with<00:02:24.840> her

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
thing so you can just do this with her

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.039 
thing so you can just do this with her
the<00:02:25.920> two<00:02:26.130> braids<00:02:26.370> coming<00:02:26.730> down<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.180> loose

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
that's style one and then when they

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.819 
that's style one and then when they
actually<00:02:31.530> fought<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.639> vampires<00:02:33.450> she<00:02:34.350> had<00:02:34.620> her

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829
