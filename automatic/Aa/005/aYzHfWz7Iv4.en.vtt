00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
to the medium and then finish it with

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.650 
to the medium and then finish it with
lighter<00:03:13.170> shade<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.860> do<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> minimum<00:03:14.880> saturation

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
lighter shade to do a minimum saturation

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.440
