now one of the things that usually

now one of the things that usually
concerns<00:00:54.510> me<00:00:54.750> about<00:00:54.780> point-and-shoot

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.160 
concerns me about point-and-shoot
cameras<00:00:55.950> is<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.460> low-light<00:00:57.329> performance<00:00:57.360> in

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
cameras is the low-light performance in

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
cameras is the low-light performance in
addition<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.190> image<00:00:59.520> sensor<00:00:59.730> performing

addition to the image sensor performing
well<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:00.600> low<00:01:00.900> light

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
well in low light

well in low light
the<00:01:01.649> LCD<00:01:02.190> matches<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.149> performance<00:01:03.720> and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the LCD matches this performance and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.719 
the LCD matches this performance and
gives<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.199> clearer<00:01:04.589> image<00:01:04.619> when<00:01:05.250> working<00:01:05.489> in

gives a clearer image when working in
darker<00:01:06.119> conditions<00:01:06.690> what<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> mean<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.830> that

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
darker conditions what I mean is that

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.430 
darker conditions what I mean is that
