00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:12.290
 Hi cdn I 'm going to take a look at the camera function. 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:19.490
 Now when I praise the camera , the timer is getting bigger. 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:23.840

 I will shoot three seconds later. 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.040
 Yes, and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.040
 When moved to the Mermaid statue that I'm a little material features 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:42.830

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.630
 There is something like stop motion . What is it again? 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.560
 There are several side up 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:52.760
 You might have seen this video . When I wore this documentary, 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.620
 Two clouds go fast, so a mile or a minute 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.880
 Continue to take the sky 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.500
 It is said that if you take a picture during the day, 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.960
 It looks like it's flowing. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.960
 That way true inspiration haebomyeon uncle 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 I'll think of it like three. I do. 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.170
 I moved the video slowly, 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.030

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:31.009
 Well, your camcorder has an Interval Vehicle code like this 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.340
 That's why it's the same way. 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:39.679
 Of course, even with the statue taken , 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:43.429

 However, if you are a little bit tired, 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.189
 When you want to shoot special video, you can be so flashy. 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.569
 For example, a silver man keeps standing and people around 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:02.209

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.870
