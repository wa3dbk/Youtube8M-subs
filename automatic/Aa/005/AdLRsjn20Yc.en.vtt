00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
both dash and Lily were both relatable

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.449 
both dash and Lily were both relatable
on<00:03:58.389> a<00:03:58.449> very<00:03:59.079> personal<00:03:59.379> level<00:03:59.680> I<00:04:00.040> could<00:04:00.220> kind<00:04:00.340> of

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
on a very personal level I could kind of

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.670 
on a very personal level I could kind of
see<00:04:00.639> myself<00:04:00.849> in<00:04:01.180> both<00:04:01.329> dash<00:04:01.659> and<00:04:02.049> lonely<00:04:02.530> when

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
see myself in both dash and lonely when

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.830

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
I was their age to even now and I

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.229 
I was their age to even now and I
thought<00:04:04.989> that's<00:04:05.260> what<00:04:05.530> made<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.829> book
