00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
let's move on just so you don't think

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.300 
let's move on just so you don't think
I'm<00:00:54.630> some<00:00:54.930> crank<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.620> echo<00:00:55.950> should<00:00:56.190> be

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
I'm some crank the echo should be

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.160 
I'm some crank the echo should be
getting<00:00:56.580> an<00:00:56.670> average<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.240> 32<00:00:57.780> miles<00:00:58.020> per

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
gallon on our first tank with

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.290 
gallon on our first tank with
hypermiling<00:01:00.780> techniques<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:01.950> 41<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.820> on

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
hypermiling techniques we got 41 and on

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.329 
hypermiling techniques we got 41 and on
this<00:01:03.480> tank<00:01:03.810> that<00:01:04.019> we're<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.229> right<00:01:04.409> now<00:01:04.470> we're

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
this tank that we're on right now we're

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.480 
this tank that we're on right now we're
getting<00:01:05.460> over<00:01:05.700> 45<00:01:06.499> so<00:01:07.499> we've<00:01:08.070> tried<00:01:08.310> this

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
getting over 45 so we've tried this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.270 
getting over 45 so we've tried this
stuff<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.659> worked<00:01:09.929> so<00:01:10.259> let's<00:01:10.829> get<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.039> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
stuff and it's worked so let's get on to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.649 
stuff and it's worked so let's get on to
the<00:01:11.310> tips<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.039> are<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.219> five<00:01:14.490> tips<00:01:14.850> 1

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
the tips so here are the five tips 1

gallons of gas you used let's look at

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.160 
gallons of gas you used let's look at
the<00:01:55.889> money<00:01:56.100> numbers<00:01:56.520> here<00:01:56.789> assuming<00:01:57.689> gas<00:01:57.869> is
