00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
so the reason she did and I obviously

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.369 
so the reason she did and I obviously
because<00:03:02.819> I'm<00:03:02.940> not<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.180> chemistry<00:03:03.599> but<00:03:03.720> do<00:03:04.260> you

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
because I'm not a chemistry but do you

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:10.220 
because I'm not a chemistry but do you
understand<00:03:04.799> that<00:03:08.000> yes<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.599> she's<00:03:09.840> listed
