your<00:01:49.740> using<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.250> line<00:01:50.579> cutter<00:01:50.880> they're<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
your using this line cutter they're the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.120 
your using this line cutter they're the
kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.630> cord<00:01:51.960> or<00:01:52.170> seatbelt<00:01:52.619> cutter<00:01:52.799> and

kind of that cord or seatbelt cutter and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.370 
kind of that cord or seatbelt cutter and
that's<00:01:53.610> actually<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> blade<00:01:54.390> sitting<00:01:54.899> in<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that's actually the blade sitting in and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.670 
that's actually the blade sitting in and
exposed<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.909> handle<00:01:57.439> rather<00:01:58.439> than<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
exposed in the handle rather than a

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.810 
exposed in the handle rather than a
separate<00:01:59.600> piece<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.810> steel<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.320> cut<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:01.920> nice

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
separate piece of steel to cut so nice

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.139 
separate piece of steel to cut so nice
added<00:02:03.240> bonus<00:02:03.869> with<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.409> knife

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
added bonus with this knife

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.190 
added bonus with this knife
anyways<00:02:07.149> let's<00:02:07.329> take<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.479> look<00:02:07.719> at<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.899> blade

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
anyways let's take a look at the blade

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.170 
anyways let's take a look at the blade
itself<00:02:09.209> select<00:02:10.209> recurve<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:13.060> got<00:02:13.239> a<00:02:15.180> hollow

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
itself select recurve it's got a hollow

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.500 
itself select recurve it's got a hollow
grind<00:02:16.629> on<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.040> blade<00:02:18.040> steel<00:02:18.310> itself<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:19.180> eight

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
grind on it blade steel itself is eight

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.270 
grind on it blade steel itself is eight
CR<00:02:20.110> 13<00:02:20.860> MOV<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.879> this<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.290> large<00:02:23.590> size<00:02:23.920> so

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
CR 13 MOV and this is the large size so

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.970 
CR 13 MOV and this is the large size so
let's<00:02:24.430> go<00:02:24.580> ahead<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:24.880> take<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.030> measurement

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
let's go ahead and take a measurement

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.920 
let's go ahead and take a measurement
and<00:02:26.980> I'm<00:02:27.160> super<00:02:27.430> excited<00:02:27.550> everybody<00:02:28.239> I<00:02:28.300> have<00:02:28.690> a

and I'm super excited everybody I have a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.039 
and I'm super excited everybody I have a
clear<00:02:29.319> ruler<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:29.950> hope<00:02:30.160> this<00:02:30.340> helps<00:02:30.700> for<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.540> to

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
clear ruler I hope this helps for you to

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.160 
clear ruler I hope this helps for you to
see<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.590> measurements<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.250> little<00:02:33.459> bit<00:02:33.580> better

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
see the measurements a little bit better

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.440 
see the measurements a little bit better
so<00:02:35.170> overall<00:02:35.500> we're<00:02:35.860> looking<00:02:36.160> at<00:02:36.340> eight<00:02:37.000> point

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
so overall we're looking at eight point

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.789 
so overall we're looking at eight point
six<00:02:37.810> inches<00:02:39.120> with<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.390> three<00:02:40.989> point<00:02:41.260> seven<00:02:41.500> inch

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
six inches with a three point seven inch

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.350 
six inches with a three point seven inch
blade<00:02:42.220> as<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.720> said<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.079> is<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.500> large<00:02:44.799> one

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
blade as I said this is the large one

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.270 
blade as I said this is the large one
comes<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:46.510> black<00:02:46.720> in<00:02:47.019> both<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.650> standard<00:02:47.920> size

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
comes in black in both the standard size

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.759 
comes in black in both the standard size
and<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.819> smaller<00:02:49.090> here<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.110> smaller<00:02:50.440> in

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
and the smaller here is the smaller in

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.789 
and the smaller here is the smaller in
the<00:02:51.700> kind<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:51.970> satin<00:02:52.329> finish<00:02:52.690> again<00:02:53.440> all<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
the kind of satin finish again all the

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.630 
the kind of satin finish again all the
same<00:02:54.010> features<00:02:55.739> just<00:02:56.739> has<00:02:56.950> a<00:02:56.980> satin<00:02:57.430> finish

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
same features just has a satin finish

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.970 
same features just has a satin finish
and<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.540> handle<00:02:58.930> has<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.739> kind<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.069> aluminum

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
and the handle has that kind of aluminum

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.030 
and the handle has that kind of aluminum
polished<00:03:02.980> look<00:03:03.220> rather<00:03:03.459> than<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.870> black<00:03:05.200> so

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
polished look rather than the black so

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.460 
polished look rather than the black so
this<00:03:06.220> is<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.430> small<00:03:06.930> give<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.019> a<00:03:08.049> little<00:03:08.170> size

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
this is a small give you a little size

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.059 
this is a small give you a little size
comparison<00:03:08.500> there<00:03:10.109> and<00:03:11.109> we'll<00:03:11.440> also<00:03:11.620> measure

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
comparison there and we'll also measure

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.009 
comparison there and we'll also measure
that<00:03:14.130> so<00:03:15.130> overall<00:03:15.970> is<00:03:16.269> seven<00:03:16.720> point<00:03:16.959> three

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
that so overall is seven point three

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.020 
that so overall is seven point three
there<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:18.000> has<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:20.130> three<00:03:21.130> point<00:03:21.459> two<00:03:21.730> five

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
there and has a three point two five

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.440 
there and has a three point two five
inch<00:03:22.799> blade<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:26.069> as<00:03:27.069> I<00:03:27.609> mentioned<00:03:28.000> plenty<00:03:28.329> of

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
inch blade so as I mentioned plenty of

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.840 
inch blade so as I mentioned plenty of
jumping<00:03:28.780> everywhere<00:03:29.109> super<00:03:29.859> grippy<00:03:30.220> super

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
jumping everywhere super grippy super

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.729 
jumping everywhere super grippy super
lightweight<00:03:31.269> like<00:03:31.569> I<00:03:31.660> said<00:03:31.870> glass<00:03:32.109> reinforced

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
lightweight like I said glass reinforced

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.520 
lightweight like I said glass reinforced
nylon<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:33.639> blades<00:03:34.000> itself<00:03:34.540> is<00:03:34.750> really<00:03:35.230> thin

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
nylon the blades itself is really thin

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.580 
nylon the blades itself is really thin
so<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.370> one<00:03:36.549> comes<00:03:36.730> in<00:03:36.970> at<00:03:37.150> 2.6<00:03:37.870> ounces<00:03:38.019> and

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
so this one comes in at 2.6 ounces and

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.309 
so this one comes in at 2.6 ounces and
the<00:03:38.889> larger<00:03:39.280> is<00:03:39.459> three<00:03:40.090> point<00:03:40.329> one<00:03:40.540> very<00:03:40.989> light

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
the larger is three point one very light

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.740 
the larger is three point one very light
in<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.560> hand<00:03:41.850> another<00:03:42.850> feature<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.209> take<00:03:43.540> note

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
in the hand another feature to take note

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.530 
in the hand another feature to take note
of<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:44.109> it<00:03:44.590> does<00:03:44.769> taper<00:03:45.040> right<00:03:45.819> here<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.299> this

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
of is it does taper right here on this

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.699 
of is it does taper right here on this
index<00:03:46.930> finger<00:03:47.290> choil

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
index finger choil

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.589 
index finger choil
but<00:03:48.250> then<00:03:48.370> it's<00:03:48.519> wide<00:03:48.790> up<00:03:49.030> top<00:03:49.269> where<00:03:49.480> the

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
but then it's wide up top where the

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.319 
but then it's wide up top where the
thumb<00:03:49.840> is<00:03:50.019> so<00:03:50.400> really<00:03:51.400> ergonomic<00:03:52.349> very<00:03:53.349> nice

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
thumb is so really ergonomic very nice

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.150 
thumb is so really ergonomic very nice
as<00:03:55.329> far<00:03:55.420> as<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.079> larger<00:03:56.380> one<00:03:56.530> in<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.889> hand

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
as far as the larger one in the hand

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.030 
as far as the larger one in the hand
again<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:58.209> can<00:03:58.359> choke<00:03:58.569> up<00:03:58.780> on<00:03:58.959> it<00:03:59.170> hold<00:03:59.739> it<00:03:59.889> back

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
again it can choke up on it hold it back

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.069 
again it can choke up on it hold it back
you<00:04:00.670> can<00:04:00.819> hold<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.150> reverse<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:01.750> I<00:04:01.870> said

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
you can hold it reverse like I said

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.309 
you can hold it reverse like I said
there's<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.560> jumping<00:04:02.980> everywhere<00:04:04.319> so

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
there's that jumping everywhere so

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.430 
there's that jumping everywhere so
