it when it will relates to obesity we

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.350 
it when it will relates to obesity we
know<00:00:43.960> that<00:00:44.200> almost<00:00:44.470> every<00:00:45.220> hour<00:00:45.370> of<00:00:45.700> TV<00:00:46.000> that<00:00:46.210> a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
know that almost every hour of TV that a

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.990 
know that almost every hour of TV that a
child<00:00:46.660> adds<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.230> their<00:00:47.380> daily<00:00:47.590> watching<00:00:48.250> their

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
child adds to their daily watching their

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.540 
child adds to their daily watching their
risk<00:00:49.300> of<00:00:49.480> obesity<00:00:49.840> increases<00:00:50.620> by<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:50.920> factor<00:00:51.070> of

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
risk of obesity increases by a factor of

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.180 
risk of obesity increases by a factor of
10<00:00:52.120> 15<00:00:52.450> 20<00:00:53.170> 25<00:00:53.890> percent<00:00:54.489> it's<00:00:55.150> amazingly

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
10 15 20 25 percent it's amazingly

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.590 
10 15 20 25 percent it's amazingly
dangerous<00:00:57.190> as<00:00:57.370> an<00:00:57.489> activity<00:00:57.820> for<00:00:58.239> children

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
dangerous as an activity for children

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.960 
dangerous as an activity for children
one<00:00:59.320> reason<00:00:59.649> is<00:00:59.800> that<00:01:00.070> a<00:01:00.430> child<00:01:00.730> that's

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
one reason is that a child that's

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.259 
one reason is that a child that's
watching<00:01:01.270> TV<00:01:02.020> burns<00:01:02.800> less<00:01:03.250> calories<00:01:03.850> than

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
watching TV burns less calories than

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.380 
watching TV burns less calories than
challenge<00:01:04.750> reading<00:01:05.290> or<00:01:06.070> doing<00:01:06.100> homework<00:01:06.460> and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
challenge reading or doing homework and

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.690 
challenge reading or doing homework and
I<00:01:07.450> think<00:01:07.630> that<00:01:07.780> shocks<00:01:08.290> parents<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.250> find<00:01:09.460> out

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
I think that shocks parents to find out

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.709 
I think that shocks parents to find out
watching<00:01:10.479> TV<00:01:11.520> stimulates<00:01:12.520> passive<00:01:13.329> learning

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
watching TV stimulates passive learning

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.649 
watching TV stimulates passive learning
instead<00:01:14.290> of<00:01:14.409> active<00:01:15.159> learning<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.909> it

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
instead of active learning and it

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.870 
instead of active learning and it
destroys<00:01:17.170> relationships<00:01:17.880> relationships

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
destroys relationships relationships

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.060 
destroys relationships relationships
what<00:01:19.060> I<00:01:19.090> mean<00:01:19.240> by<00:01:19.330> that<00:01:19.360> is<00:01:19.630> that<00:01:20.260> instead<00:01:20.799> of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
what I mean by that is that instead of

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.399 
what I mean by that is that instead of
learning<00:01:21.820> how<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.270> relate<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.780> how<00:01:22.900> to<00:01:23.080> talk

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
learning how to relate and how to talk

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.140 
learning how to relate and how to talk
and<00:01:23.710> how<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:23.890> think<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.430> how<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.610> react

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
and how to think and how to react

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.090 
and how to think and how to react

unhealthy thing we can do is to allow

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.560 
unhealthy thing we can do is to allow
