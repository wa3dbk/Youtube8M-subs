00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.000
 Good day dear subscribers 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.560
 and guests of today's video will be 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.139
 comparative testing of two pairs 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.580
 headphones good old goat models 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.990
 burst into tears and 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.990
 earpods from the apple company 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.460
 Let's start with the assembly and I was crawling in fact 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.470
 solid plastic to the pluses I would attribute 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.840
 large outlet located 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.890
 on the side of the headphone and 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.629
 directing ear sound directly 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.190
 channel 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.440
 however, goats in this plan went further and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.480
 obtyanuli tube delivering sound soft 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.370
 silicone pillow which takes 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.620
 the shape of any ear canal thereby 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.000
 cutting off extraneous noise 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:50.190
 headphones sit firmly in the ears which is not 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.379
 you say slippery plastic 1 in general 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.900
 usability plan cost for me is undeniable 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 favorite 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.869
 honestly write comparative 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.640
 review led me numerous 

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:00.510
 rave reviews on the internet about new 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.269
 headphones people 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.580
 I do not believe that the ears out of the box are capable 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.530
 play well so for a start 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.260
 We pump headphones with sounds of different 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.880
 frequency ranges of references to test 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.250
 sounds will be in the video description and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.820
 let's see the physical boundaries sound 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.189

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.150
 such as lower bound ranges 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.080
 upper bound 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.080

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.689
 there is no spirit 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.090
 From the results it is clear that all the tests 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.040
 devices went the same on balance 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.290
 subjectively it seemed to me that at low 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.380
 the frequencies of the goats slightly turn down the sound to the left 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.290
 airports on the contrary to the right but to listen 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.870
 I made sure that everything sounded exactly and 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.190
 old grandfather perception test 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.110
 runs on both devices one and the 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.430
 same track and compare the sound by eye 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.430
 more precisely in the ear 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.500

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.889
 loudness 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.370
 earpods give a less loud sound 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.740
 sound ucoz 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.039
 deeper rosaries are possible only for 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.470
 due to better sound insulation and yes absolutely 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.479
 forgot to voice the price 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.990
 the bulk of the stores is 500 600 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.470
 rubles 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.479
 apple earpods from a thousand to a half as 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.849

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.199
