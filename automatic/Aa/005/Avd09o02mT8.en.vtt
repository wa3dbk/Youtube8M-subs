00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 by the grapes he decided to tackle 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.859
 with hops gwénolé olivier at 27 years old and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.110
 has just launched and launched its 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.400
 own brand of beer to plow a 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.340
 new adventure for this oenologist 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.820
 more used to wines than to pressure 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.270
 julie seeko'o met him for gwénolé 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.680
 it's time for truth 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.449
 after spending the night brewing her 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.670
 beer the next morning it comes 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.810
 taste the fresh brew close 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.329
 I managed to increase my 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.360
 bitterness precisely there the evil that has me a 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.180
 little colored beer comes round the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.070
 angles so now not bad and if 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.780
 gwénolé tasted his beer with a glass of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.000
 wine is because there are still some 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.700
 traces of his former oenologist profession 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 whose vineyards the world over but 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.840
 difficult to establish as winemaker 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.059
 in Brittany then for his return on 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.489
 his native lands to plow he adapts 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.350
 his wine-making experience with beer and 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.219
 form in a local brewery 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.960
 I was hired as a 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.260
 responsible quality taste of beers 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.619
 and they in turn formed me in 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.450
 brewing to know that if we make a 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.640
 comparison of the middle of the wine and the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.680
 beer the middle of the fermentation is 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.409
 relatively comparable between beer 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.439
 and wine is just the process of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.659
 brewing as the harvesting process 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.310
 for vinification that differ but 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.380
 otherwise we are on the hands process what 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.350
 in December he creates his own brand 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.420
 distributed blonde brown or amber 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.340
 gwénolé marries the aromas and lets go 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.750
 his palace hops and master come 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.299
 from around the world and the whole thing is 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 bio a craft production they 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.439
 refine like a grand cru 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.570
 I took inspiration from Belgian proceedings 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.820
 with an English method with 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.899
 German raw materials as well as 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.259
 Canadian etc 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.000
 I do not limit myself to finding a recipe 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.299
 and implement it 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.579
 I use my experience in wine 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.320
 to know is to diversify more 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.420
 gouvenaux wishes to produce them near 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.430
 twenty thousand liters of beer a year a 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.619
 successful reconversion for this master of 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.619
 winery that has adapted to its terroir
