00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.450 

now<00:00:55.630> what<00:00:55.840> we've<00:00:55.990> got<00:00:56.020> there<00:00:56.530> is<00:00:56.560> three<00:00:57.070> chords

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
now what we've got there is three chords

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:04.970 
now what we've got there is three chords
that<00:00:58.240> are<00:00:58.270> majors<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:01.470> then<00:01:02.470> the<00:01:03.010> same<00:01:03.430> quartz

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.980 
that are majors and then the same quartz

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.710 
that are majors and then the same quartz
majors<00:01:05.980> but<00:01:06.580> they're<00:01:06.790> inverted<00:01:07.090> like<00:01:07.540> this

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
majors but they're inverted like this

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.810 
majors but they're inverted like this
they're<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.750> same<00:01:11.110> three<00:01:11.500> chords<00:01:11.770> but<00:01:12.670> the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
they're the same three chords but the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.050 
they're the same three chords but the
note<00:01:13.060> on<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.390> top<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.979> third<00:01:15.280> okay

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
note on the top is the third okay

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.790 
note on the top is the third okay
normally<00:01:16.660> when<00:01:16.810> we<00:01:16.900> have<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:17.110> major<00:01:17.410> chord

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
normally when we have a major chord

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.130 
normally when we have a major chord
played<00:01:18.100> this<00:01:18.280> way<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:20.020> have<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.320> root<00:01:20.530> on<00:01:21.250> top

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
played this way we have the root on top

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.310 
played this way we have the root on top
okay

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
okay

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.900 
okay
but<00:01:23.530> when<00:01:23.650> you<00:01:23.740> flip<00:01:24.010> a<00:01:24.070> chord<00:01:24.370> around<00:01:24.670> like

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
but when you flip a chord around like

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.430 
but when you flip a chord around like
this

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.040

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
the third of the key is on top so that

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.570 
the third of the key is on top so that
gives<00:01:31.440> it<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.590> unique<00:01:31.740> sound<00:01:32.570> same<00:01:33.570> cord<00:01:33.900> see

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580
