 welcome to this video we have us 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.279
 here today we gather together 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.740
 my top ten products under one euro 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.500
 You can see all of these products 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.540
 from dm and lately do yes 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.680
 totally many youtube this video and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.780
 not totally by bus 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.670
 I love these videos and I thought 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.850
 I 'll show you a little bit 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.570
 my favorites first favorite is one 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.550
 how do you say hand disinfectant gel that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.350
 are the travel sizes in the mm 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.930
 costs under one euro and is the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.789
 ideal handbag companions if you 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.520
 go on public toilets 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.899
 have to go or take a subway ride 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.910
 Also, always go round when you are in 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.829
 The spa town live there one often has 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.930
 the feeling one did not have hands together 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.850
 and this game at least makes one 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.990
 bit better I got him the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.400
 but especially if I go to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.110
 give an example on festivals or something 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.610
 because you just do not really the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.299
 you have your hands flowing 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.630
 can wash 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.180
 and there it is a big help that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.560
 next are the cosmetic sticks of 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.060
 Evelin probably you have now 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.979
 already seen a few times are 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 namely about every youtube the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.610
 favorite list under one euro that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.939
 is just because they have pointed 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.320
 are 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.970
 I'll show you what that is 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.869
 special is i think though 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.680
 most of you actually 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.479
 already know 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.670
 okay you did not pull that out 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.140
 was somehow show not immediately able 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.659
 but now a bit better 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.610
 you see the upper side goes 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.530
 apart paddle and the bottom 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.899
 Side is super sharp the advantage 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.970
 which, moreover, they are totally stuck 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.399
 bound are super zoom egger 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.049
 Correct can use a thing 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.390
 about which you often have me 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.880
 Talk about it are the proteins regulate and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.110
 Although it is exactly this power here 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.570
 bars and that protein plus eighth so 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.180
 after the sport once in the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.590
 flavor of chocolate brownie and 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.690
 Now I have newly discovered there 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.770
 I also have it in vanilla vanilla 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.599
 I will not try it though 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.040
 do it and then tell you who they are 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.150
 but those with chocolate flavor 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.260
 sensible wave great and as you can see 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.530
 it's not really that either 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.660
 considered up to this point of the video 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.940
 another thing from the travel sizes 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.739
 these are two helpers that is for 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.800
 a mini nail polish remover and 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.480
 a mini refreshing gel that 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.150
 I always use it as a play as you do 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.739
 is likely and this is so even 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.190
 These mini sizes when you're on the go 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.840
 be and say with friends 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.550
 stayed overnight or a bit bland 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.800
 then these small sizes are enough 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.379
 enough for me about three times 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.500
 make-up and so on a box 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.840
 nail polish remover us box bottle 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.010
 nail polish remover I got you 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.540
 real indeed for the whole holiday 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.800
 if you leave on two weeks 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.440
 you do not have to be the big one 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.489
 take the small one completely and 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.040
 that's why my recommendation 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.810
 the great thing about valeo products is that 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.239
 They are really super super cheap 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.319
 there is, for example, valeo right 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:15.090
 full sized shower gel under one euro and 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.750
 These scents I found here so 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.150
 super that 's humbug lemon grass and it 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.460
 is so incredible it smells 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.160
 bit the gummy bears 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.720
 but in a good way of the duh 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.950
 game effect are quite normal 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.320
 but I think it is consistent throughout 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.160
 always difficult somehow an effect 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.480
 make out 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.160
 somehow we are all the same for me 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.690
 also from virgil to scarce we are 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.910
 a little bit better but this one 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.740
 Games were not effective 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.390
 difference but the fragrance is wonderful 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.580
 and under one euro 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.500
 if you turn off and somehow 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.110
 the feeling you have got your pores 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.630
 not really clean with the gel 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.850
 or you used then these are 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.410
 Spongey super I use the 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.330
 really partly in the evening for 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.770
 make-up so I give myself first 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.440
 Once it was quiet on the fingers 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.760
 spread in the face and what feeling 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.740
 I have it working properly 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.780
 or somehow I was traveling a long way 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.950
 my pores are clogged then take 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.410
 I was still a scourers to 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.440
 I need it and then go please 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.610
 once extremely what that cleans so 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.470
 thoroughly and it really tries too 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.000
 Home are incredibly pleasant 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.670
 it's like a gentle peeling 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.110
 actually and also under one euro 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.620
 I do not always need it 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.050
 say 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.970
 If you have a bath at home 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.400
 and I like to bathe you the 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.910
 bath salts or what do you call that 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.920
 Ever bath accessories from Barea 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.620
 recommend they are also the 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.350
 stock cheap and have quite 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.330
 many of them have quite a few 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.800
 different fragrances and 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.750
 sometimes really bathing in the summer 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.120
 but then I'm not that serious 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.190
 fragrances but he still something 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.860
 fresh and there I find you this 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.380
 recommend that is flowers from when he 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.540
 said and they all have this back 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.920
 it is easier to smell a high degree 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.630
 So you can of course you can 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.850
 first try if you the air 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.980
 also like and I think of valea 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.500
 The foams are really good for you 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.000
 the price we come to my favorite 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.160
 product in this video is easy 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.470
 unbelievable that you can do that under one 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.750
 gets and also from bel-air world 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.120
 thought that would be perfect or that 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.770
 trees effect foam stabilizer actually 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.680
 for fine hair but it works 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.630
 five as well in extra strong that is one 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.880
 volume he has to quasi after the 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.790
 wash in santos dry hair in the 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.590
 approaches are then your hair over the 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.460
 Head under super gives you super 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.290
 nice volume 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.000
 I think I have two three times 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.710
 Tried out and then as I did through the 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.120
 dm gone and looked what from 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.310
 The product does not actually own 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.870
 it cost me less than a euro 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.450
 baff that that belongs 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.250
 they also have different others 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.540
 volume or 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.040
 scary things there you can look 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.510
 I think they have something to entice 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.400
 and I have the vital and have 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.710
 that means that it definitely costs a euro 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.570
 A huge recommendation an edible 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.750
 I still have something and that is it 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.730
 Most of them from their own brand 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.600
 are also gluten free if you are the 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.420
 sensitivity 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.040
 yes there are rice waffles and 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.480
 rice waffeln me really many that 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.920
 we have already discovered some for themselves 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.500
 because they are relatively low in calories 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.700
 but still are totally 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.400
 tasteless and in contrast to it 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.020
 Most have a taste and 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.760
 I think that's a lot better because 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.160
 you do not just taste that 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.750
 but also so and so a little 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.850
 Taste this bread a bit and get it 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.280
 Setzinger noticed but rather such a 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.200
 Bit of popcorn but not on 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.910
 sweet way but really really 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.430
 it tastes delicious if you 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.940
 hope rice is then gives the main 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.160
 chance 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.419
 then we come to the last product and 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.840
 that is really one of my own 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.580
 favorites that also from valea that 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.010
 refreshing gel in the fullsize 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.130
 size and it actually costs too 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.530
 under one euro this example is enough 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.720
 for about three or four months 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.640
 and make me really with it all 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.440
 evening off and even if I'm not 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.700
 you are decorated with something for me in the evening 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.120
 I go to bed with it again 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.050
 face of need about 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.710
 now comes with sizes 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.449
 that's difficult, so a teaspoon 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.300
 Teaspoon large amount that is enough 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.229
 is a relatively thick style so the skin 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.629
 is really really nice 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:16.729
 including me every mask 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:18.470
 down which is not waterproof and
