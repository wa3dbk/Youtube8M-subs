00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
in it right when we started out with the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.450 
in it right when we started out with the
first<00:01:20.250> building<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:20.820> 3,000<00:01:21.570> square<00:01:21.869> foot<00:01:22.170> and

first building was 3,000 square foot and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.149 
first building was 3,000 square foot and
and<00:01:23.600> within<00:01:24.600> our<00:01:24.930> county<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.650> thought<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
and within our county we thought the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.789 
and within our county we thought the
first<00:01:26.310> thing<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:26.700> could<00:01:26.880> do<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.930> live<00:01:28.439> there<00:01:28.650> we

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
first thing we could do to live there we

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.039 
first thing we could do to live there we
put<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> mobile<00:01:29.970> home<00:01:30.119> there<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.869> could

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
put a mobile home there so that we could

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.450 
put a mobile home there so that we could
live<00:01:31.170> there<00:01:31.290> real<00:01:31.500> quick<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> idea<00:01:32.280> was

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
live there real quick and the idea was

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.600 
live there real quick and the idea was
we<00:01:32.759> would<00:01:33.180> build<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.509> house<00:01:33.689> next<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.500> hook<00:01:35.490> it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
we would build a house next and hook it

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.370 
we would build a house next and hook it
to<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> kids<00:01:36.000> building<00:01:36.390> well<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:36.990> found<00:01:37.170> out

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
to the kids building well we found out

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230 
to the kids building well we found out
the<00:01:37.500> 3,000<00:01:38.130> square<00:01:38.369> foot<00:01:38.579> was<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:38.850> big<00:01:39.210> enough

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
the 3,000 square foot was not big enough

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.810 
the 3,000 square foot was not big enough
so<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.900> added<00:01:40.200> another<00:01:40.590> three<00:01:41.340> thousand

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
so we added another three thousand

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.580 
so we added another three thousand
square<00:01:41.909> foot<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:42.600> we<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:42.840> they<00:01:43.320> live<00:01:43.500> in
