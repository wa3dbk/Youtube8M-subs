00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.770 

today<00:00:06.990> so<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.620> promised<00:00:08.040> I'd<00:00:08.189> do<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.030> quick<00:00:09.240> video

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
today so I promised I'd do a quick video

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.959 
today so I promised I'd do a quick video
of<00:00:10.580> how<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.179> do<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.019> thermal<00:00:13.349> paste<00:00:13.969> my

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
of how I like to do the thermal paste my

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.710 
of how I like to do the thermal paste my
ps3<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:16.100> already<00:00:17.100> cleaned<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:18.270> paste<00:00:18.510> off

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
ps3 so already cleaned the paste off

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.609 
ps3 so already cleaned the paste off
this<00:00:18.990> machine<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:20.510> I've<00:00:21.510> applied<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.410> pace

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
this machine and I've applied the pace

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.320 
this machine and I've applied the pace
to<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.070> chip<00:00:23.430> I'm<00:00:23.580> just<00:00:23.760> smoothing<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.240> out

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
to this chip I'm just smoothing it out

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.660 
to this chip I'm just smoothing it out
now<00:00:24.600> this<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.859> started<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.609> just

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
now this is what it started like I just

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.330 
now this is what it started like I just
kind<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.000> smeared<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.449> over<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.840> place<00:00:28.340> this

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
kind of smeared all over the place this

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.099 
kind of smeared all over the place this
is<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:30.060> trying<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.359> get<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.720> smooth<00:00:30.960> as

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
is I'm trying to get it as smooth as

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.910 
is I'm trying to get it as smooth as
possible<00:00:31.140> right<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.719> I've<00:00:33.719> half<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.170> subway

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
possible right so I've half a subway

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.569 
possible right so I've half a subway
point<00:00:35.790> card<00:00:36.290> so<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.590> see<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> pointes

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
point card so you see I'm on the pointes

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.010 
point card so you see I'm on the pointes
card<00:00:38.790> there's<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> lot<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.270> access<00:00:39.660> cuz<00:00:39.899> I'm

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
card there's a lot of access cuz I'm

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.090 
card there's a lot of access cuz I'm
just<00:00:40.200> trying<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.410> get<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.620> off

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
just trying to get it off

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.590 
just trying to get it off
now<00:00:41.969> some<00:00:42.210> people<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:42.809> say<00:00:44.450> some<00:00:45.450> people

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
now some people will say some people

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
now some people will say some people
will<00:00:46.020> say<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.879> they<00:00:47.879> don't<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:49.910> smooth

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
will say that they don't like to smooth

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.250 
will say that they don't like to smooth
it<00:00:51.030> out<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.510> because<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:51.930> might<00:00:52.079> get

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
it out like this because you might get

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.150 
it out like this because you might get
air<00:00:52.440> bubbles<00:00:52.620> which<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.160> fine<00:00:53.899> but<00:00:55.160> I'll

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
air bubbles which is fine but I'll

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.830 
air bubbles which is fine but I'll
explain<00:00:56.489> why<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.270> spread<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
explain why I like to spread it in a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.170 
explain why I like to spread it in a
second<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.949> long<00:00:59.129> as<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.460> very<00:00:59.520> thin<00:00:59.969> it's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
second as long as it's very thin it's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.150 
second as long as it's very thin it's
it's<00:01:00.690> pretty<00:01:00.870> hard<00:01:01.170> for<00:01:01.379> air<00:01:01.590> bubbles<00:01:02.010> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
it's pretty hard for air bubbles to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.990 
it's pretty hard for air bubbles to
develop<00:01:02.579> anyways<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:04.489> I'll<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.610> keep<00:01:05.760> going

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
develop anyways and I'll just keep going

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:38.880 
develop anyways and I'll just keep going
with<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> sec<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.840> I'll<00:01:06.960> explain

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.240 

very<00:01:39.890> smooth<00:01:40.250> all<00:01:41.210> right<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.860> reason<00:01:43.160> why

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
very smooth all right so the reason why

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.530 
very smooth all right so the reason why
I<00:01:43.280> don't<00:01:43.460> like<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.760> just<00:01:43.910> put<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.090> blob<00:01:44.330> in<00:01:44.479> the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
I don't like to just put a blob in the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.450 
I don't like to just put a blob in the
middle<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.020> let<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.260> heatsink<00:01:45.830> spread<00:01:46.190> it<00:01:46.310> is

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
middle and let the heatsink spread it is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.100 
middle and let the heatsink spread it is
because<00:01:48.070> with<00:01:49.070> this<00:01:49.190> kind<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.580> chip<00:01:50.860> the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
because with this kind of chip the

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.109 
because with this kind of chip the
processor<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.440> right<00:01:55.009> under<00:01:55.430> this<00:01:55.580> thing<00:01:55.880> so

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
processor is right under this thing so

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.700 
processor is right under this thing so
it<00:01:56.210> takes<00:01:56.420> up<00:01:56.570> like<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.080> middle<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.530> lot<00:01:57.680> of

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
it takes up like the middle so a lot of

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.460 
it takes up like the middle so a lot of
people<00:01:57.860> will<00:01:58.130> put<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:59.060> drop<00:01:59.300> of<00:01:59.470> thermal

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
people will put the drop of thermal

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.870 
people will put the drop of thermal
paste<00:02:00.680> in<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:00.950> middle<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.460> let<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:03.880> heat

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
paste in the middle and let the heat

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.660 
paste in the middle and let the heat
sink<00:02:05.210> and<00:02:05.330> press<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.810> down<00:02:06.399> spreading<00:02:07.399> it<00:02:07.490> out

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
sink and press it down spreading it out

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.560 
sink and press it down spreading it out
and<00:02:08.270> it'll<00:02:08.539> make<00:02:08.660> like<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.929> like<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.860> circle

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
and it'll make like a like a circle

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.060 
and it'll make like a like a circle
which<00:02:11.570> is<00:02:11.750> fine<00:02:12.050> but<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:14.390> spot<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.470> spot<00:02:15.800> at

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
which is fine but this spot the spot at

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.830 
which is fine but this spot the spot at
these<00:02:16.310> corners<00:02:16.850> will<00:02:17.750> all<00:02:17.900> be<00:02:18.110> left<00:02:18.380> open<00:02:18.800> and

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
these corners will all be left open and

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.780 
these corners will all be left open and
though<00:02:20.840> they're<00:02:21.230> not<00:02:21.380> above<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.100> chip<00:02:22.370> they

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
though they're not above the chip they

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.600 
though they're not above the chip they
do<00:02:22.850> get<00:02:23.239> hot<00:02:23.560> those<00:02:24.560> areas<00:02:25.010> would<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:25.340> still

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
do get hot those areas would you still

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.930 
do get hot those areas would you still
get<00:02:25.730> hot<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.030> they<00:02:26.150> could<00:02:26.530> dissipate<00:02:27.530> heat<00:02:27.940> so

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
get hot and they could dissipate heat so

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.229 
get hot and they could dissipate heat so
if<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.959> spread<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:31.480> then<00:02:33.550> at<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.790> very<00:02:35.000> least

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
if you spread it then at the very least

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.240 
if you spread it then at the very least
like<00:02:35.630> let's<00:02:35.840> say<00:02:36.019> for<00:02:36.230> example<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:36.769> got<00:02:36.980> an<00:02:37.070> air

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
like let's say for example I got an air

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.180 
like let's say for example I got an air
bubble<00:02:37.510> here<00:02:40.209> it's<00:02:41.209> still<00:02:41.450> better<00:02:41.690> than

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
bubble here it's still better than

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.039 
bubble here it's still better than
having<00:02:43.190> this<00:02:43.610> spot<00:02:43.940> not<00:02:44.239> thermal<00:02:44.630> paste<00:02:44.810> at

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
having this spot not thermal paste at

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.170 
having this spot not thermal paste at
this<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.530> spot<00:02:45.769> not<00:02:46.130> thermal<00:02:46.489> paste<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.880> this

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
this the spot not thermal paste it this

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.390 
this the spot not thermal paste it this
one<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.799> this<00:02:48.799> one<00:02:48.860> so<00:02:49.280> I<00:02:50.410> mean<00:02:51.410> instead<00:02:52.340> of

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
one and this one so I mean instead of

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.270 
one and this one so I mean instead of
having<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:53.239> complete<00:02:54.079> circle<00:02:54.560> no<00:02:54.680> air<00:02:54.920> bubble

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
having a complete circle no air bubble

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.979 
having a complete circle no air bubble
and<00:02:56.380> having<00:02:57.380> those<00:02:57.470> four<00:02:57.860> spots<00:02:58.040> open<00:02:58.989> I'm

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
and having those four spots open I'm

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.670 
and having those four spots open I'm
Megan<00:03:00.950> air<00:03:01.190> bubble<00:03:01.519> here<00:03:01.970> or<00:03:02.930> maybe<00:03:03.079> here<00:03:03.530> but

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
Megan air bubble here or maybe here but

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.789 
Megan air bubble here or maybe here but
I<00:03:04.160> have<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.670> middle<00:03:04.910> covered<00:03:05.360> and<00:03:05.510> all<00:03:06.110> three

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
I have the middle covered and all three

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.920 
I have the middle covered and all three
of<00:03:06.890> these<00:03:07.010> spots<00:03:07.310> covered<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.600> think<00:03:08.720> the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
of these spots covered so I think the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.270 
of these spots covered so I think the
risk<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.260> an<00:03:09.380> air<00:03:09.500> bubble<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.980> well<00:03:10.670> worth<00:03:10.910> it

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
risk of an air bubble is well worth it

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.270 
risk of an air bubble is well worth it
getting<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.730> entire<00:03:13.940> shift<00:03:14.269> covered<00:03:15.280> I'll

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
getting the entire shift covered I'll

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.030 
getting the entire shift covered I'll
just<00:03:16.370> kind<00:03:16.610> of<00:03:16.700> do<00:03:16.850> this<00:03:17.060> but<00:03:17.299> I<00:03:18.040> keep

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
just kind of do this but I keep

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.479 
just kind of do this but I keep
spreading<00:03:19.370> it<00:03:19.519> around<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.130> don't<00:03:22.280> need<00:03:22.430> a

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
spreading it around and you don't need a

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.039 
spreading it around and you don't need a
lot<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.030> if<00:03:23.180> you're<00:03:23.360> spreading<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.870> you're

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
lot so if you're spreading it you're

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.520 
lot so if you're spreading it you're
like<00:03:24.230> oh<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:26.120> might<00:03:26.450> not<00:03:26.660> have<00:03:26.870> enough

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
like oh I might not have enough

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.610 
like oh I might not have enough
I'm<00:03:28.280> just<00:03:28.549> keep<00:03:28.730> working<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.260> I'm<00:03:30.260> sure<00:03:30.320> you

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
I'm just keep working it I'm sure you

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.130 
I'm just keep working it I'm sure you
have<00:03:30.739> enough<00:03:31.070> it's<00:03:31.400> just<00:03:31.519> sometimes<00:03:32.510> it's

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
have enough it's just sometimes it's

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:42.250 
have enough it's just sometimes it's
difficult<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:34.450> get<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.660> to<00:03:35.840> go<00:03:36.820> there<00:03:37.820> we<00:03:37.940> go

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.140 

just<00:03:43.260> like<00:03:43.530> that

to me I'll do it for free
so<00:04:16.949> I<00:04:17.609> did<00:04:18.209> reflow<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:18.840> ps3<00:04:19.139> I<00:04:19.680> don't<00:04:20.280> know<00:04:20.370> if

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
so I did reflow this ps3 I don't know if

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.210 
so I did reflow this ps3 I don't know if
it<00:04:20.579> works<00:04:20.760> yet<00:04:21.060> but<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.359> mean<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.660> have<00:04:21.840> to

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
it works yet but you mean you have to

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.200 
it works yet but you mean you have to
apply<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.370> thermal<00:04:23.669> paste<00:04:23.970> anyways<00:04:26.210> the

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
apply the thermal paste anyways the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.990 
apply the thermal paste anyways the
problem<00:04:27.600> is<00:04:27.750> if<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.169> doesn't<00:04:28.770> work<00:04:29.160> then<00:04:29.760> what

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
problem is if it doesn't work then what

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.060 
problem is if it doesn't work then what
we're<00:04:30.120> gonna<00:04:30.240> have<00:04:30.479> to<00:04:30.630> do<00:04:30.780> is<00:04:30.990> just<00:04:31.440> scrape

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
we're gonna have to do is just scrape

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.890 
we're gonna have to do is just scrape
all<00:04:32.340> this<00:04:32.520> paste<00:04:32.820> off<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.270> we<00:04:33.360> just<00:04:33.539> put<00:04:33.750> on

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
all this paste off that we just put on

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:44.840 
all this paste off that we just put on
and<00:04:35.870> reflow<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:36.990> again<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:38.419> then<00:04:40.669> see<00:04:41.669> if<00:04:43.850> we

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
and reflow it again and then see if we

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.330 
and reflow it again and then see if we
have<00:04:45.030> it<00:04:45.240> working<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.860> then<00:04:47.010> we<00:04:47.099> have<00:04:47.250> to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
have it working and then we have to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.279 
have it working and then we have to
replace<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.820> bowl<00:04:48.000> because<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.960> can<00:04:49.139> never

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
replace the bowl because you can never

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.560 
replace the bowl because you can never
take<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.620> heatsink<00:04:50.070> often<00:04:50.550> but<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.180> heatsink

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
take a heatsink often but the heatsink

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.810 
take a heatsink often but the heatsink
back<00:04:51.720> on<00:04:51.930> with<00:04:52.080> a<00:04:52.110> replace<00:04:52.470> in<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.620> face<00:04:52.830> ever

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
back on with a replace in the face ever

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.029 
back on with a replace in the face ever
it<00:04:54.660> just<00:04:54.870> creates<00:04:55.200> air<00:04:55.349> bubbles<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:55.860> wreck

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
it just creates air bubbles and wreck

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.400 
it just creates air bubbles and wreck
stuff<00:04:59.389> this<00:05:00.389> isn't<00:05:00.599> gonna<00:05:00.780> be<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.960> long<00:05:01.169> video

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
stuff this isn't gonna be a long video

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.800 
stuff this isn't gonna be a long video
it's<00:05:01.740> kind<00:05:01.860> of<00:05:01.950> boring<00:05:02.160> sorry<00:05:03.060> it's<00:05:03.389> just<00:05:03.450> I
