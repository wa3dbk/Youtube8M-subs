00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.000
 hello how about I bring you an idea for 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.070
 this Valentine's Day that is coming 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.040
 well flying soon because he's leaving 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.660
 very fast the time and then I did not 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.110
 I could lose to me I love I have 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.230
 other pending earrings to do here 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:31.610
 in my house and I'm fixing my room 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.850
 to the nails but I needed to go up for the day 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.579
 of valentine I needed because I 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.100
 love that date I walk a little 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.750
 dark and that colors do not create 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.700
 that I have come out very nice 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.100
 follow what you will notice in the design that 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.280
 follow then if not already what 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.540
 they noticed because I'm half Martian half 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.540
 dark and already 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.220
 there I am using the acrylic rose and they 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.560
 I wanted to comment how that to me in my 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.589
 experience I feel that the acrylics of 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:07.200
 organic take longer to dry when 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.540
 it's cold all the acrylics take that 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.650
 field is not cold and I know it but this 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.290
 it's my experience that takes the longest 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.340
 So he wrote I suffered for having chosen 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.160
 that color of the almond because right now 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.430
 is not who I say if my house though 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.270
 have the heater on is frozen 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.820
 over here 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.140
 It did not work for me and it took me a lot 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.390
 despair 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.030
 good, we continue with the golden color 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.610
 that this one being there that's also 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.950
 of organic is the metallic golden color 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.590
 I'm in love with this gold me 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.050
 love the golden color you know but 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.270
 that I 'm discovering this because I 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.300
 I had already seen it in videos but the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.729
 to have them in front of you is that it's like metal 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.409
 liquid to me I loved this and the 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.170
 banana I recommend them 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.469
 then I'm putting a color like pink 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.659
 old and meanwhile I tell you that the 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.759
 name of the business of my channel here 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.190
 I'll leave the business outlook this 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.239
 that I bring one with a money of the created 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.250
 but I need to leave it like that because I do not 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.830
 I could remove it as I could remove the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.989
 new but you can not and I wanted 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.950
 guys because that's the way everyone tells me 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:28.400
 you do not know that's a nick for dew or a 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.530
 nickname and take excessive is that I 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.780
 I wanted you to be facing public titling 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.700
 we left the business and in the end I 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.250
 I will always put non-stop 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.910
 and that they know me by my name as 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.550
 my family tells me 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.440
 and nothing is going on and with the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.960
 little hearts obviously if I'm using 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.490
 I accept sometimes with hearts sometimes I 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.040
 I do not use acetone but with this cold 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.660
 We need help to dry the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.120
 quick acrylic if it is not going to 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.770
 scatter everywhere and it goes well 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.680
 fried heart 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.530
 I'm going to add about two or three and I'm going to 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.920
 Give a golden colored ton 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.410
 then I thought because of seeing them with a 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.740
 brush but you know I like it 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.630
 complicate my life and we give it here 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.430
 for example fill it in with color 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.080
 golden and so also from the set I have 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.540
 asked a lot the set that I bring that 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.680
 if you encapsulate it if gentlemen the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.660
 encapsulated because obviously if it 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.520
 would have left the leader exposed last 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.880
 less as well as those nails that are called 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.730
 caviar that carry pellets are nails that 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.450
 you have to obviously put a gel 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.860
 or acrylic on top if that's not like 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.290
 a halloween ad and the most 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.900
 it lasts in one night and I wanted them to 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.900
 my photoshop I'm going to build the 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.370
 different channel 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:59.480
 well the bottom of the channel then I took 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.180
 those photos for that but since I finish 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.360
 Well of course I encapsulate against 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.090
 the leader there in the house everywhere 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.540
 so I answer the ones that had 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.340
 that doubt if obviously encapsulate already 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.489
 it does not look the same of course it's not the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.739
 but it was intended for the 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.739
 Photos 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.739
 ah 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.150
 good and coming back this is all already 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.790
 clean the nail you do not need clearer than 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.220
 you can add me I'm not very manuel 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:52.639
 zelaya knows now in another video les 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.539
 I teach another great style gap 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.539
 I hope you like it
