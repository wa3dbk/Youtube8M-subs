00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
it's true to say that the more you

it's true to say that the more you

practice your shooting the more you'll
score<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:04.600> also<00:02:04.720> true<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.440> more<00:02:05.590> you

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
shoot the more you'll see balls rebound

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.260 
shoot the more you'll see balls rebound
if<00:02:08.770> you<00:02:08.979> observe<00:02:09.310> what<00:02:09.490> happens<00:02:09.520> to<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.119> ball

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
if you observe what happens to the ball

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.270 
if you observe what happens to the ball
before<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.930> after<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.410> bounce<00:02:11.620> is<00:02:11.800> of<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.070> ring

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
before and after a bounce is of the ring

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.920 
before and after a bounce is of the ring
then<00:02:12.820> you'll<00:02:12.970> learn<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.150> anticipate<00:02:13.510> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
then you'll learn to anticipate the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.320 
then you'll learn to anticipate the
angle<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.380> direction<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.100> rebound<00:02:15.490> for

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
angle and direction of the rebound for

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.090 
angle and direction of the rebound for
example<00:02:16.780> if<00:02:16.870> your<00:02:16.990> shot<00:02:17.200> has<00:02:17.350> been<00:02:17.380> too<00:02:17.770> flat

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
example if your shot has been too flat

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.710 
example if your shot has been too flat
then<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.640> ball<00:02:18.880> will<00:02:19.090> probably<00:02:19.480> come<00:02:19.690> down

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
then the ball will probably come down

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.530 
then the ball will probably come down
directly<00:02:20.610> remember<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.730> every<00:02:22.030> action<00:02:22.210> has

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
directly remember that every action has

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.840 
directly remember that every action has
an<00:02:22.720> equal<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.080> opposite<00:02:23.590> reaction<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:24.640> if<00:02:24.760> the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
an equal and opposite reaction so if the

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.850 
an equal and opposite reaction so if the
shot<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.210> too<00:02:25.360> flat<00:02:25.630> then<00:02:26.110> will<00:02:26.260> bounce<00:02:26.440> off<00:02:26.680> at

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
shot is too flat then will bounce off at

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.130 
shot is too flat then will bounce off at
a<00:02:26.920> flat<00:02:27.130> angle<00:02:27.340> if<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.180> looped<00:02:28.420> high<00:02:28.660> then<00:02:29.050> it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
a flat angle if it's looped high then it

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.230 
a flat angle if it's looped high then it
will<00:02:29.260> bounce<00:02:29.440> back<00:02:29.620> high<00:02:30.070> be<00:02:30.550> more<00:02:30.760> likely<00:02:31.120> to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
will bounce back high be more likely to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.290 
will bounce back high be more likely to
go<00:02:31.390> in<00:02:31.570> or<00:02:31.780> be<00:02:31.900> reachable<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.620> rebound<00:02:33.300> all

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
go in or be reachable on a rebound all

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.940 
go in or be reachable on a rebound all
in<00:02:34.540> all<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.840> more<00:02:35.020> you<00:02:35.140> observe<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.709> better

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
in all the more you observe the better

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.620 
in all the more you observe the better
you'll<00:02:36.160> become<00:02:36.310> at<00:02:36.550> anticipating<00:02:37.270> where<00:02:37.480> the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
you'll become at anticipating where the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.930 
you'll become at anticipating where the
ball<00:02:37.840> will<00:02:38.020> go<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:39.190> won't<00:02:39.370> always<00:02:39.520> get<00:02:39.820> it

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
ball will go you won't always get it

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.370 
ball will go you won't always get it
right<00:02:40.150> but<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.570> will<00:02:40.840> improve<00:02:41.080> your<00:02:41.200> chances

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
right but you will improve your chances

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.590 
right but you will improve your chances
of<00:02:41.890> successfully<00:02:42.610> gathering<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.090> ball<00:02:43.300> and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
of successfully gathering the ball and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.360 
of successfully gathering the ball and
remember<00:02:44.350> if<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.680> defender<00:02:45.070> has<00:02:45.100> been

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
remember if the defender has been

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.220 
remember if the defender has been
marking<00:02:45.790> your<00:02:45.910> shot<00:02:46.180> then<00:02:46.660> you'll<00:02:46.780> already<00:02:46.959> be

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
marking your shot then you'll already be

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.260 
marking your shot then you'll already be
one<00:02:47.560> step<00:02:47.830> ahead<00:02:47.890> because<00:02:48.700> not<00:02:48.850> only<00:02:49.000> will

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
one step ahead because not only will

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.970 
one step ahead because not only will
their<00:02:49.420> back<00:02:49.570> be<00:02:49.720> turned<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.170> post<00:02:50.470> but

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
their back be turned to the post but

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.530 
their back be turned to the post but
they<00:02:51.100> also<00:02:51.250> won't<00:02:51.640> see<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.060> flight<00:02:52.270> of<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
they also won't see the flight of the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.020 
they also won't see the flight of the
ball

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
ball

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.820 
ball
finally<00:02:55.030> use<00:02:55.360> technique<00:02:55.930> if<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.620> reach

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
finally use technique if you can reach

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.500 
finally use technique if you can reach
and<00:02:57.100> catch<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.459> ball<00:02:57.580> with<00:02:57.790> two<00:02:57.820> hands<00:02:58.240> then

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
and catch the ball with two hands then

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.690 
and catch the ball with two hands then
fantastic<00:02:59.200> but<00:02:59.620> if<00:02:59.709> you<00:02:59.739> can't<00:03:00.100> then<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.430> can

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
fantastic but if you can't then you can

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.490 
fantastic but if you can't then you can
use<00:03:00.850> technique<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.570> improve<00:03:01.660> your<00:03:02.050> chances<00:03:02.440> of

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
use technique to improve your chances of

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.890 
use technique to improve your chances of
success<00:03:03.030> let's<00:03:04.030> start<00:03:04.330> by<00:03:04.480> looking<00:03:04.660> at

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
success let's start by looking at

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.350 
success let's start by looking at
gathering<00:03:05.440> with<00:03:05.590> one<00:03:05.800> hand<00:03:06.130> you<00:03:07.030> should<00:03:07.090> be

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
gathering with one hand you should be

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.759 
gathering with one hand you should be
able<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.570> reach<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.930> little<00:03:08.110> higher<00:03:08.230> with<00:03:08.590> one

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
able to reach a little higher with one

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.680 
able to reach a little higher with one
hand<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.220> with<00:03:09.370> two<00:03:09.610> especially<00:03:10.300> if<00:03:10.540> you're

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
hand that with two especially if you're

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.050 
hand that with two especially if you're
jumping<00:03:11.110> up<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.470> at<00:03:11.620> an<00:03:11.739> angle<00:03:11.860> if<00:03:12.820> you're

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
jumping up and at an angle if you're
