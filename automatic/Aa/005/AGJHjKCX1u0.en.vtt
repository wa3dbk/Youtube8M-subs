00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
you're looking it's really helpful the

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.730 
you're looking it's really helpful the
stupid<00:05:39.180> thing<00:05:39.389> is<00:05:39.570> that<00:05:40.020> everyone<00:05:40.200> else<00:05:40.650> can

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
stupid thing is that everyone else can

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.580 
stupid thing is that everyone else can
see<00:05:40.889> where<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.280> laser<00:05:41.639> is<00:05:42.080> landing<00:05:43.080> so<00:05:43.470> if

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
see where that laser is landing so if

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.040 
see where that laser is landing so if
you're<00:05:43.740> smart<00:05:44.039> you<00:05:44.460> see<00:05:44.639> a<00:05:44.669> laser<00:05:44.910> go<00:05:45.630> hey<00:05:46.020> I

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
you're smart you see a laser go hey I

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.839 
you're smart you see a laser go hey I
bet<00:05:46.320> there's<00:05:46.500> a<00:05:46.560> guy<00:05:46.710> on<00:05:46.740> the<00:05:46.919> other<00:05:46.950> end<00:05:47.610> of

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
bet there's a guy on the other end of

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.330 
bet there's a guy on the other end of
that<00:05:47.880> and<00:05:48.180> you<00:05:48.330> can<00:05:48.510> probably<00:05:48.960> find<00:05:49.200> him<00:05:49.500> a<00:05:49.710> lot

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
that and you can probably find him a lot

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.550 
that and you can probably find him a lot
of<00:05:50.460> people<00:05:50.700> don't<00:05:51.000> also<00:05:51.300> know<00:05:51.720> that<00:05:51.960> when

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
of people don't also know that when

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.100 
of people don't also know that when
you're<00:05:52.740> in<00:05:52.830> stealth<00:05:53.190> motor<00:05:53.460> armor<00:05:53.910> mode<00:05:54.110> just

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
you're in stealth motor armor mode just

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.170 
you're in stealth motor armor mode just
chilling<00:05:55.620> there<00:05:55.800> doesn't<00:05:56.639> drain<00:05:56.849> it<00:05:57.000> very

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
chilling there doesn't drain it very

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.510 
chilling there doesn't drain it very
fast<00:05:57.449> just<00:05:57.870> chillin<00:05:58.289> you<00:05:58.680> know<00:05:58.710> standing

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
fast just chillin you know standing

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.460 
fast just chillin you know standing
still<00:05:59.789> you<00:06:00.389> could<00:06:00.570> probably<00:06:00.840> I<00:06:01.050> think<00:06:01.110> it<00:06:01.320> goes

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
still you could probably I think it goes

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.230 
still you could probably I think it goes
down<00:06:01.650> one<00:06:01.979> a<00:06:02.010> second<00:06:02.520> when<00:06:02.849> you<00:06:02.880> start

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
down one a second when you start

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.150 
down one a second when you start
sprinting<00:06:03.599> and<00:06:03.900> using<00:06:04.199> energy<00:06:04.560> when<00:06:04.889> you<00:06:04.979> turn

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
sprinting and using energy when you turn

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.159 
sprinting and using energy when you turn
on<00:06:05.280> armor<00:06:05.669> mode<00:06:05.789> and<00:06:06.120> stealth<00:06:06.479> or<00:06:06.690> when<00:06:07.080> you

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
on armor mode and stealth or when you

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.589 
on armor mode and stealth or when you
sprint<00:06:07.500> with<00:06:07.680> armor<00:06:08.039> mode<00:06:08.190> uh<00:06:08.699> both<00:06:09.270> go<00:06:09.570> down

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
sprint with armor mode uh both go down

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:12.950 
sprint with armor mode uh both go down
very<00:06:10.440> fast<00:06:11.099> when<00:06:11.820> you<00:06:11.940> move<00:06:12.150> around<00:06:12.419> with<00:06:12.810> that

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
very fast when you move around with that

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.830 
very fast when you move around with that
it<00:06:13.919> drains<00:06:14.430> it<00:06:14.669> you<00:06:15.030> know<00:06:15.150> three<00:06:15.510> or<00:06:15.539> four

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
it drains it you know three or four

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.270 
it drains it you know three or four
times<00:06:16.080> as<00:06:16.320> fast<00:06:16.500> as<00:06:16.710> just<00:06:16.889> standing<00:06:17.250> there

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 
times as fast as just standing there

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.129 
times as fast as just standing there
would<00:06:17.490> be<00:06:17.520> so<00:06:18.060> if<00:06:18.150> you<00:06:18.300> are<00:06:18.539> going<00:06:18.750> to<00:06:18.870> be<00:06:18.960> that

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
would be so if you are going to be that

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.300 
would be so if you are going to be that
camping<00:06:19.500> bitch<00:06:19.650> who<00:06:19.770> sits<00:06:19.979> in<00:06:20.070> the<00:06:20.130> corner

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
camping bitch who sits in the corner

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:22.159 
camping bitch who sits in the corner
using<00:06:20.610> a<00:06:20.669> shotgun<00:06:20.880> in<00:06:21.150> stealth<00:06:21.419> mode<00:06:21.510> which<00:06:22.050> I

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
using a shotgun in stealth mode which I

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.420 
using a shotgun in stealth mode which I
highly<00:06:22.289> suggest<00:06:22.560> you<00:06:22.800> don't<00:06:23.039> because

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430
