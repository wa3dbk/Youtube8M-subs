00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
partnership our bunny really really is

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.760 
partnership our bunny really really is
the<00:00:38.739> best<00:00:38.950> cow<00:00:39.190> hand<00:00:39.550> I<00:00:39.700> could<00:00:39.940> ever<00:00:40.630> yes<00:00:41.020> I'm

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
the best cow hand I could ever yes I'm

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.700 
the best cow hand I could ever yes I'm
sure<00:00:43.500> he<00:00:44.500> is<00:00:44.580> and<00:00:46.380> let<00:00:47.380> me<00:00:47.470> do<00:00:47.590> everything

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
sure he is and let me do everything

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.410 
sure he is and let me do everything
together<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:51.370> it<00:00:51.610> that<00:00:51.940> makes<00:00:52.150> it<00:00:52.270> so<00:00:52.390> much

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
together and it that makes it so much

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.479 
together and it that makes it so much
easier<00:00:52.780> I<00:00:53.020> think<00:00:53.110> and<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.850> anyhow<00:00:55.210> so<00:00:56.489> but

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
easier I think and but anyhow so but

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.840 
easier I think and but anyhow so but
because<00:00:57.820> of<00:00:57.850> that<00:00:58.060> it<00:00:58.750> isn't<00:00:59.560> it<00:01:00.250> isn't<00:01:00.460> hard

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
because of that it isn't it isn't hard

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.580

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
started back in 2002 after I had been

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.919 
started back in 2002 after I had been
retired<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:49.270> couldn't<00:01:49.569> sit<00:01:49.720> around

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
retired and just couldn't sit around

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.020 
retired and just couldn't sit around
doing<00:01:50.200> nothing<00:01:50.319> so<00:01:50.890> my<00:01:51.459> wife<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:51.970> decided

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
doing nothing so my wife and I decided

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.600 
doing nothing so my wife and I decided
that<00:01:52.599> we'd<00:01:52.899> start<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.289> small<00:01:53.560> herd<00:01:53.829> and<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.399> did

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
that we'd start a small herd and we did

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.779 
that we'd start a small herd and we did
that<00:01:54.929> and<00:01:55.929> at<00:01:56.530> first<00:01:56.829> we<00:01:57.130> were<00:01:57.310> not<00:01:57.520> thinking

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
that and at first we were not thinking

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.620 
that and at first we were not thinking
about<00:01:58.000> going<00:01:59.369> we<00:02:00.369> want<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.700> feel<00:02:00.909> bad<00:02:01.179> but<00:02:01.479> we

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
about going we want to feel bad but we

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.059 
about going we want to feel bad but we
weren't<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:02.229> know<00:02:02.319> getting<00:02:02.619> too<00:02:02.739> excited

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
weren't you know getting too excited

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.219 
weren't you know getting too excited
about<00:02:03.369> him<00:02:03.670> but<00:02:04.209> we<00:02:04.329> were<00:02:04.509> fortunate<00:02:04.780> enough

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
about him but we were fortunate enough

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.240 
about him but we were fortunate enough
to<00:02:05.880> buy<00:02:06.880> some<00:02:07.390> bulls<00:02:07.659> that<00:02:07.780> really<00:02:08.380> helped<00:02:09.099> our

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
to buy some bulls that really helped our

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.240 
to buy some bulls that really helped our
routine<00:02:09.610> program<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.989> but<00:02:11.500> yet<00:02:11.709> in<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.040> long

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
routine program and but yet in the long

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.870 
routine program and but yet in the long
run<00:02:12.549> because<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.750> enjoy<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.620> genetics<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.430> I

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
run because I enjoy the genetics and I

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.150 
run because I enjoy the genetics and I
enjoy<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:17.170> new<00:02:17.380> found<00:02:18.630> possibilities<00:02:19.630> in

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
enjoy the new found possibilities in

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.080 
enjoy the new found possibilities in
using<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:22.060> DNA<00:02:22.630> testing<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.739> think<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.819> a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
using the DNA testing I think that a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.800 
using the DNA testing I think that a
small<00:02:25.840> herd<00:02:26.170> now<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.799> be<00:02:26.829> competitive<00:02:27.750> with<00:02:28.750> a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
small herd now can be competitive with a

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.920 
small herd now can be competitive with a
larger<00:02:29.350> herd<00:02:29.530> that's<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.130> in<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.489> long<00:02:30.700> run<00:02:31.030> we

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
larger herd that's so in the long run we

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.740 
larger herd that's so in the long run we
are<00:02:31.959> just<00:02:32.350> starting<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.859> use<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:34.030> information

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
are just starting to use the information

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.509 
are just starting to use the information
we<00:02:35.079> get<00:02:35.340> from<00:02:36.340> our<00:02:37.120> DNA<00:02:37.870> testing<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.560> with<00:02:39.310> our

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
we get from our DNA testing and with our

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.900 
we get from our DNA testing and with our
APD's<00:02:40.030> and<00:02:40.329> we're<00:02:41.079> just<00:02:41.319> building<00:02:41.889> block<00:02:42.639> by

great advantage to that Jenny profile

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.050 
great advantage to that Jenny profile
for<00:02:49.389> Angus<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:50.139> allows<00:02:50.470> small<00:02:51.100> producers<00:02:51.700> to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060
