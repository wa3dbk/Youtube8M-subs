00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.149
 so people now we take care of that 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.700
 close 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.519
 from the engine on the farms or on the 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.900
 custom page 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:20.150
 I have this now 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:26.750
 crowded left Monday probably 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:32.810
 I can essays about that again 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:36.379
 Rooney without screwing together on 8 mm 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.590
 effort and then the seat begins 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:42.850
 The situation was cultural, that is, the one said 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.699
 rest now has to go up or so 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.449
 be pressed together 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:54.859
 I'll show you that with the help of old ones 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:01:01.489
 names as I imagine this and that 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:08.030
 it is so if the camp then too 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:10.040
 the location of the seat would be on 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.220
 most meaningful if of course over the 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.009
 inner ring the bearing on the customers 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.110
 wool would be expressed 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.110
 and you can actually do that because 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 heard about a win here 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:35.899
 paul has you could now here a pipe 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:38.090
 then put the halt so long would 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.200
 that the eight millimeter you down 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.200
 It could be like that with me 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.020
 the profit height is twelve millimeters and 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.600
 then without a parking disc on it and and then 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.479
 I only have 23 millimeters left 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:02:00.409
 win would transition to express 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.500
 Maybe I'm driving something there now 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.990
 made 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.360
 I have the thread handy 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.700
 I extended that way to the 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:19.110
 touchscreen but 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.110
 then I can do it then you have to be 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.650
 Here I can kill with a murder 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.180
 start in a queue here 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.849
 I have an area here for me 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:34.120
 ground down your master with ambition 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:41.830
 Driven product today was the otherwise 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:43.690
 but it runs on a queue 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.230
 do not fix that anymore 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.230
 can displace 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:03.610
 then I put the gate on my mother 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:08.849
 Can I have this up here? 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.799
 snack bar welded today by the 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:16.239
 turned a little bit of diameter ago 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.859
 as an alter ego as a Roman is it has 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.730
 the core the knife of my 16 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:27.639
 you can win that can occur 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.940
 then i can give you my tactic against 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.660
 twisted secures and then can the stock 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.180
 raise 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:46.900
 So or the ball-bearings in berlin 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:50.160
 in the end, based on the 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:56.290
 mother than 30 will be adapters on three 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:04:00.609
 fix the inner bearing things 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:05.760
 acquire to 80 degrees or 100 degrees white 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:05.760
 do not settle 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:23.229
 then I noticed that the 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:25.330
 companies want that already here in 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:30.310
 the intended sequence is one 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.050
 guidelines on already a piece a two 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.720
 millimeter beaks that occasion 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.640
 is then that fits together so there can 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.150
 nothing goes wrong 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.740
 and with me is still as well as 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:45.190
 said want or the choice of the last 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.409
 meeting comes in with my hand 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.340
 In the camp so here I will have none 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.750
 Having trouble 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.479
 that's why I can do that now 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:07.950
 would then expose it, so to speak 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:07.950
 so talk 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.729
 and then i can get the motor nut 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:19.360
 has undergone her 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:22.610
 on the cole it will be in the plan 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.060
 To close the engine is belief 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.740
 I worked out a checklist 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.930
 We must not forget that because if 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.099
 I wanted to have motor together and 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.460
 we do not want the imitators anymore 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:39.050
 pull it apart again and that 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.849
 First, cornwall spacers 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.990
 hang up or you can not 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:47.719
 forgot to be hung up pass 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.050
 put the motor housing erin to him 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:55.490
 So the two are here would 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:58.509
 then be used next 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.069
 georgs seal rest 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.440
 and when the big direction is taken 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.449
 then it continues with the 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.620
 kickstarter wool with spacers 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.539
 use 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.360
 they will come here once 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.879
 below a distance disc and again 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.110
 on the other side because we see that 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:22.759
 then and then in the roll 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:25.610
 system follows because the completely assembled 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:28.069
 use with ca and distance discs 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:30.979
 So we must lead the target to do 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:32.870
 do not forget a case as the 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.979
 mother still pull apart then 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.669
 you can not do it later 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.020
 drive to 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:41.599
 because the coupons corp obscures that 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.879
 citaro and then we will not come back 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:46.129
 on 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:49.270
 and then I wrote down 

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:53.900
 gear lock is target circle note 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:56.509
 So I have the mother in the classroom 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.759
 Opened honey becomes the target after that 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:01.759
 again in the ddr whole position 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.919
 Insert into the sound source because it 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:07.330
 agrees that later that 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.330
 strengthened no longer match
