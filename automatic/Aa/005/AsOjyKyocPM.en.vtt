00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
really no big deal in most of the cases

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.110 
really no big deal in most of the cases

down the Queen and also the earth
sweeper<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:50.760> basically<00:02:51.760> once<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.239> dragon

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
sweeper and basically once this dragon

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.660 
sweeper and basically once this dragon
is<00:02:52.750> down<00:02:52.959> he<00:02:53.140> can<00:02:53.319> start<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:54.099> lava<00:02:54.340> attack

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
is down he can start the lava attack

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.520 
is down he can start the lava attack
while<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> Queen<00:02:55.269> keeps<00:02:55.540> doing<00:02:55.780> damage<00:02:56.110> I

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
while the Queen keeps doing damage I

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.620 
while the Queen keeps doing damage I
wouldn't<00:02:57.220> wait<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.640> would<00:02:57.819> go<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.299> bit<00:02:58.840> earlier

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
wouldn't wait I would go a bit earlier

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.319 
wouldn't wait I would go a bit earlier
maybe<00:03:01.630> like<00:03:01.959> five<00:03:02.319> seconds<00:03:03.310> earlier<00:03:03.819> at<00:03:04.030> least

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
maybe like five seconds earlier at least

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.580 
maybe like five seconds earlier at least
I<00:03:04.660> think<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:07.180> would<00:03:07.359> make<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:08.380> base

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
I think that it would make that base

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.300 
I think that it would make that base
going<00:03:08.889> down<00:03:09.100> even<00:03:10.090> easier<00:03:10.389> than<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:11.049> is<00:03:11.310> so

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
going down even easier than it is so

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.390 
going down even easier than it is so
first<00:03:12.609> lava<00:03:12.880> is<00:03:13.410> down<00:03:14.410> by<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.709> second<00:03:15.190> level

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
first lava is down by the second level

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.220 
first lava is down by the second level
shielding's<00:03:16.120> for<00:03:16.420> those<00:03:16.599> balloons<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:18.870> now

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
shielding's for those balloons and now

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.020 
shielding's for those balloons and now
it's<00:03:21.599> the<00:03:22.599> attack<00:03:22.930> with<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.440> third<00:03:24.159> lava<00:03:24.489> so

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
it's the attack with the third lava so

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.619 
it's the attack with the third lava so
notice<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.659> this<00:03:25.780> guy<00:03:25.989> put<00:03:27.000> his<00:03:28.000> Tesla's

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
notice that this guy put his Tesla's

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.280 
notice that this guy put his Tesla's
outside<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.319> base<00:03:29.500> for<00:03:29.890> trolling<00:03:30.310> or<00:03:30.730> for

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
outside the base for trolling or for

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.259 
outside the base for trolling or for
messing<00:03:32.290> up<00:03:32.409> with<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.220> balloon<00:03:33.519> path<00:03:33.790> but

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
messing up with the balloon path but

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.080 
messing up with the balloon path but
since<00:03:34.870> he's<00:03:35.080> sending<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:36.430> balloons<00:03:36.549> in<00:03:37.000> a

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
since he's sending the balloons in a

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.970 
since he's sending the balloons in a
surgical<00:03:37.330> way<00:03:37.599> about<00:03:37.959> two<00:03:38.170> balloons<00:03:38.440> at<00:03:38.680> each

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
surgical way about two balloons at each

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.660 
surgical way about two balloons at each
defense<00:03:39.489> it<00:03:40.420> doesn't<00:03:40.840> really<00:03:40.989> bother<00:03:41.670> lexerd

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
defense it doesn't really bother lexerd

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.759 
defense it doesn't really bother lexerd

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
on his attack so is getting this base

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.630 
on his attack so is getting this base
very<00:03:45.459> easily<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:46.650> let's<00:03:47.650> make<00:03:47.829> it<00:03:47.860> faster<00:03:48.400> so
