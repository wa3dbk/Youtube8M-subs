00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello guys 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.040
 let's know a feature of the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.480
 micro tech tech unifae line 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.059
 called kolberg 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.269
 The principle is when I want to perform 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.699
 a call I'm going to receive a call 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.100
 this reduces the cost of calls to 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.470
 when you are on the street 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.390
 and you can call any cell phone 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.609
 of Brazil with zero cost 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.210
 we do koubek through 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.009
 free apps for smartphones 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.399
 iphone blackberry android 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.690
 So let's see how it works, let's go. 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.640
 open the dialer application and fetch the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.640
 desired number on sale 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.780
 when I select 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.550
 I'll click the dial button 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.850
 application will then send a 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.430
 prouni call request does this 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.140
 request is my number and the number 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.000
 destination when receiving this requisition 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.189
 was to consult the numbers on a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.080
 of numerical portability and discovers that 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.600
 My operator is alive. 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.549
 it automatically selects a 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.860
 and returns the call to my 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.280
 cell phone and that's what we call 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.280
 karol beck 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.689
 so when I answer that call 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:29.729
 you will hear that he informs the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:31.590
 destination operator and now it goes 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.409
 complete the mobile phone call from 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.409
 destination and compute the two calls 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.330
 so now that your destiny is 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.360
 getting called ok 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.610
 Imagine that he did not answer, he does not 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.250
 You know the number you called since this number 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.060
 number is from a chip that is here in the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.580
 unifil 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.960
 When it returns this call goes 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.210
 another feature 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.420
 the fantastic UniFAE called 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.270
 routing that is as follows 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.510
 the machine keeps all the memory 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.340
 calls made to and from the destination 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.730
 and when a number for which you 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.489
 turned on the equipment 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.300
 automatically redirects to your 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.720
 cell phone 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.950
 So let's see how the call works. 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.580
 not met 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.220
 I'm going to call the parent again. 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.470
 identify that number has already received 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.330
 a call from my number 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.760
 my cell phone is going to forward 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.760
 automatically call my mobile 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.350
 Okay, let's make a call now. 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.840

 The destination's cell phone is the phone he
