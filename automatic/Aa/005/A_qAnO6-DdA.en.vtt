sticking to the foil which is going to
be<00:04:06.400> wasted<00:04:06.819> so<00:04:07.419> we<00:04:07.569> think<00:04:07.870> we're<00:04:08.410> done<00:04:08.620> I'm

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
be wasted so we think we're done I'm

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.460 
be wasted so we think we're done I'm
even<00:04:09.549> smelling<00:04:10.060> some<00:04:10.329> toasted<00:04:10.840> action<00:04:11.199> here

even smelling some toasted action here

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.920 
even smelling some toasted action here
so<00:04:12.069> put<00:04:12.280> the<00:04:12.370> iron<00:04:12.549> away<00:04:12.790> far<00:04:13.480> away<00:04:13.660> from<00:04:13.720> my

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
so put the iron away far away from my

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.060 
so put the iron away far away from my
face<00:04:14.199> oh<00:04:14.760> wow<00:04:15.790> here<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.239> go<00:04:16.419> check<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.739> out

face oh wow here you go check that out

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.009 
face oh wow here you go check that out
that<00:04:18.940> works

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
that works

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.990 
that works
but<00:04:20.319> he's<00:04:20.440> sticking<00:04:20.709> I<00:04:21.129> have<00:04:21.579> to<00:04:21.699> get<00:04:21.849> it<00:04:21.940> from

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
but he's sticking I have to get it from

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.969 
but he's sticking I have to get it from
the<00:04:22.180> other<00:04:22.210> end<00:04:22.800> fork<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:24.039> the<00:04:24.069> rescue<00:04:31.770> we<00:04:32.770> got

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
the other end fork to the rescue we got

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:40.409 
the other end fork to the rescue we got
a<00:04:33.009> coelom<00:04:36.270> don't<00:04:37.270> know<00:04:39.000> he<00:04:40.000> doesn't<00:04:40.090> want<00:04:40.360> to

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
a coelom don't know he doesn't want to

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.540 
a coelom don't know he doesn't want to
come<00:04:40.509> off<00:04:40.599> I<00:04:40.960> didn't<00:04:41.800> put<00:04:41.949> any<00:04:42.039> butter<00:04:42.159> on<00:04:42.430> him

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
maybe I should have put butter on him

00:04:44.199 --> 00:05:00.670 
maybe I should have put butter on him
maybe<00:04:44.919> butter<00:04:45.190> what<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.370> help

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.409 

we<00:05:01.680> always<00:05:01.860> learn<00:05:02.220> from<00:05:02.250> our<00:05:02.639> mistake

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
we always learn from our mistake

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.870 
we always learn from our mistake
so<00:05:04.110> make<00:05:04.350> a<00:05:04.380> few<00:05:04.770> case<00:05:05.400> you're<00:05:05.580> gonna<00:05:05.639> learn

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
so make a few case you're gonna learn

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.350 
so make a few case you're gonna learn
where<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.300> way<00:05:07.250> he<00:05:08.250> was<00:05:08.370> hard<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.669> peel<00:05:08.850> off<00:05:09.060> I

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
where that way he was hard to peel off I

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.120 
where that way he was hard to peel off I
need<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:09.870> have<00:05:09.990> butter<00:05:10.230> on<00:05:10.320> the<00:05:10.590> sides<00:05:10.830> of<00:05:11.010> them

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
need to have butter on the sides of them

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.220 
need to have butter on the sides of them
I<00:05:11.310> guess<00:05:12.090> I'm<00:05:12.210> learning<00:05:12.330> really<00:05:12.690> fast<00:05:12.930> right

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
I guess I'm learning really fast right

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.610 
I guess I'm learning really fast right
now<00:05:14.120> okay

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
now okay

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.370 
now okay

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380
