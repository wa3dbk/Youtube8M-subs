00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
has a lot of challenge to it unlike

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.199 
has a lot of challenge to it unlike
Mario<00:02:46.140> obviously<00:02:46.560> Mario<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:46.980> more<00:02:47.280> more

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
Mario obviously Mario is more more

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.380 
Mario obviously Mario is more more
easier<00:02:48.840> because<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:50.310> psychosis<00:02:50.910> racing<00:02:51.270> it

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
easier because in psychosis racing it

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.710 
easier because in psychosis racing it
kind<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.900> forces<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.340> drift<00:02:53.910> at<00:02:54.180> times<00:02:54.450> and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
kind of forces you to drift at times and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.870 
kind of forces you to drift at times and
I<00:02:54.930> wish<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.410> they<00:02:55.650> added<00:02:56.010> an<00:02:56.190> automatic

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
I wish that they added an automatic

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.690 
I wish that they added an automatic
format<00:02:57.390> so<00:02:58.080> for<00:02:58.410> beginners<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.220> not<00:02:59.459> too

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
format so for beginners it's not too

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.520 
format so for beginners it's not too
difficult<00:02:59.880> for<00:03:00.209> them<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.480> jump<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.050> right<00:03:01.290> in

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
difficult for them to jump in right in

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.250 
difficult for them to jump in right in
for<00:03:02.100> more<00:03:02.250> Mario<00:03:02.820> does<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.660> really<00:03:03.930> easily

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
for more Mario does that really easily

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.470 
for more Mario does that really easily
cycle<00:03:04.770> stars<00:03:05.010> racing<00:03:05.220> is<00:03:05.489> more<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.940> like<00:03:05.970> I

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
cycle stars racing is more of like I

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.810 
cycle stars racing is more of like I
guess<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.709> need<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.220> know<00:03:08.370> what<00:03:08.610> you're<00:03:08.790> doing

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
guess you need to know what you're doing

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.940 
guess you need to know what you're doing
type<00:03:09.480> of<00:03:09.630> game<00:03:09.810> or<00:03:10.050> else<00:03:10.230> you're<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.680> not

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
type of game or else you're just not

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.800

going<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.760> fun<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.150> need<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.630> learn

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
going to have fun and you need to learn

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.449 
going to have fun and you need to learn
how<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:13.050> drift<00:03:13.410> my<00:03:13.920> sister<00:03:14.280> obviously

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
how to drift my sister obviously

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.500 
how to drift my sister obviously
wouldn't<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.450> when<00:03:15.720> she<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.350> played<00:03:16.680> both

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
wouldn't you when she and I played both

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.570 
wouldn't you when she and I played both
sonic<00:03:18.510> also<00:03:18.810> racing<00:03:19.170> games<00:03:19.380> she<00:03:20.250> had<00:03:20.340> trouble

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
sonic also racing games she had trouble

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.250 
sonic also racing games she had trouble
playing<00:03:20.970> because<00:03:21.510> she<00:03:21.840> doesn't<00:03:22.080> like

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
playing because she doesn't like

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.440 
playing because she doesn't like
drifting<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:22.950> every<00:03:23.190> time<00:03:23.310> she<00:03:23.489> drifts<00:03:23.940> she

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
drifting and every time she drifts she

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.880 
drifting and every time she drifts she
doesn't<00:03:24.690> know<00:03:24.750> how<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.930> control<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.380> properly

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
doesn't know how to control it properly

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.360 
doesn't know how to control it properly
so<00:03:26.010> as<00:03:26.630> you<00:03:27.630> can<00:03:27.750> see<00:03:27.959> they<00:03:28.230> both<00:03:28.440> both<00:03:29.160> these

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
so as you can see they both both these

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.670 
so as you can see they both both these
games<00:03:29.640> have<00:03:29.820> their<00:03:30.150> problems<00:03:30.360> but<00:03:31.049> if<00:03:31.350> they

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
games have their problems but if they

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.039 
games have their problems but if they
were<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.920> put<00:03:32.280> if<00:03:32.580> sumo<00:03:32.940> digital<00:03:33.060> were<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.840> put

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
were to put if sumo digital were to put

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.870 
were to put if sumo digital were to put
these<00:03:34.260> two<00:03:34.470> characters<00:03:34.950> head-to-head<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.670> a

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
these two characters head-to-head in a

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.600 
these two characters head-to-head in a
racing<00:03:36.360> game<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.870> think<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.680> would<00:03:37.799> really<00:03:37.980> turn

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
racing game I think it would really turn

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.820 
racing game I think it would really turn
out<00:03:38.670> really<00:03:39.090> well<00:03:39.360> especially<00:03:39.989> when<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.680> comes

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
out really well especially when it comes

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.270 
out really well especially when it comes
to<00:03:40.950> control<00:03:41.489> wise<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.180> whatnot<00:03:43.040> it<00:03:44.040> also

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
to control wise and whatnot it also

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.949 
to control wise and whatnot it also
brings<00:03:44.549> up<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:44.820> question<00:03:44.850> would<00:03:45.540> they<00:03:45.720> make

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
brings up the question would they make

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.490 
brings up the question would they make
another<00:03:46.380> we<00:03:46.680> wheel<00:03:46.950> with<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.489> we<00:03:47.670> will<00:03:48.500> be

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
another we wheel with the we will be

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.199 
another we wheel with the we will be
compatible<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.220> probably<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.700> because<00:03:51.180> you

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
compatible it probably it is because you

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.850 
compatible it probably it is because you
