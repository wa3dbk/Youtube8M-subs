00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.089 
gives it very edgy look but also very
girly<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:37.019> of<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> lace<00:02:37.410> texture<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.890> I

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
girly because of the lace texture and I

and<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.790> shirt<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.239> main<00:02:57.420> focus<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.050> I

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
and the shirt is the main focus so I

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.540 
and the shirt is the main focus so I

think the lighting was too bright but
there<00:03:04.140> are<00:03:04.230> these<00:03:04.440> red<00:03:04.709> glitters<00:03:05.099> on<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.550> lip
