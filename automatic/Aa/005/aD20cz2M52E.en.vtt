00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.570
 that takes from that survey to see what note 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.250
 you have put the game and other 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.020
 parameters that are in that survey so 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.700
 that you can see everything in the link 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.210
 guys that I leave in the description of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.149
 video said this I want to tell you that I have 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.010
 open I created a gmail account and 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.719
 in the bureau that I want to send me and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.149
 ok these are what I want that 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.800
 send plays do not have to end 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.300
 in google they can be very pretty so 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.070
 you can send me nice games though 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.899
 do not finish any and many times you do 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.280
 an awesome wheel and then it's over 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.620
 in a good goal because that also fits me 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.960
 of course the golazos that you mark 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.640
 all these plays that end in goal 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.710
 you can send it to me and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.630
 also in third place the goalkeepers 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.850
 it's worth the stops that 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.560
 make the porters the paradones that you 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.630
 lift off the seat that says what you say 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.390
 how can this be stopped 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.130
 I also want you to send it to me 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.289
 only requirement to be able to send me 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.149
 all these videos is simply that what 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.130
 serious is directly from the console 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.049
 agreement or the console or with a 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.299
 recorder or somehow in which 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.799
 It looks perfect, I do not want videos 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.360
 so they are very heavy or they are 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.310
 recorded with the mobile if you can see with 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.259
 the mobile but it looks good to see 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.850
 very well then it also works for me 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.799
 if it can be if it can be directly 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.479
 recorder from the console then I will 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.860
 I would appreciate quite agree and if not 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.399
 I could create from the console because you have 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.110
 playstation 3 or xbox 360 and you do not have 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.549
 recorder to record it then I would 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.899
 You can also record with your mobile but 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.549
 I already tell you that it looks very good that 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.740
 very well squared in that it is very well 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.750
 configured the video when in the video 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.149
 I do not know yet I 'll wait more or less 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.709
 one week or seven days 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.810
 approximately according to what I 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.250
 send many quantities played and I 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.159
 can go taking the ones that go in the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.470
 that I like the most and also how I'm going to 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.840
 do it then I'll make a top of each thing 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.830
 worth of each play and each and every 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.570
 goal 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.340
 and even the good together I do not know very well 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.810
 how am I going to do it good but what 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.430
 yes, I am clear that I can mention them 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.230
 to you with your name 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.480
 in the word aguada or when they are 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.250
 your play will put your name 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.590
 so you know that for all the 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.820
 the world knows who has done it is watered down like this 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.710
 that will surely like you even in 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.450
 a very funny version of that 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.490
 that nothing is all for today 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.570
 I remember what I remember about the survey 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.430
 the video that you can give us our opinion 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.860
