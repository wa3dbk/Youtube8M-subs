because<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> most

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
because I think one of the most

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.209 
because I think one of the most
remarkable<00:00:59.969> things<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.960> physics<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.680> we

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
remarkable things in physics is that we

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.520 
remarkable things in physics is that we
can<00:01:02.370> even<00:01:02.489> talk<00:01:02.969> about<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:04.019> only<00:01:04.049> three

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
can even talk about not only three

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
can even talk about not only three
minutes<00:01:04.890> after<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> universe<00:01:05.610> began<00:01:05.909> but

minutes after the universe began but

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.510 
minutes after the universe began but
actually<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.080> billionth<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.979> second<00:01:08.400> after

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
the universe began how on earth can we

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.649 
the universe began how on earth can we
talk<00:01:10.890> about<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.369> processes<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.240> happened

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
talk about the processes that happened

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.350 
talk about the processes that happened
back<00:01:12.810> then<00:01:13.049> well<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.520> because<00:01:15.030> we've<00:01:15.210> got

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
little people stood underneath it so you

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.400 
little people stood underneath it so you
can<00:02:23.430> get<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.580> sense<00:02:23.819> of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> scale<00:02:24.450> here's<00:02:25.350> a

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
can get a sense of the scale here's a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.110 
can get a sense of the scale here's a
picture<00:02:25.950> when<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.160> was<00:02:26.280> being<00:02:26.459> built<00:02:26.730> just

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
picture when it was being built just

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.970 
picture when it was being built just
again<00:02:27.450> you<00:02:27.630> get<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> sense<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.680> size

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
again you get a sense of the the size

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.220 
again you get a sense of the the size
and<00:02:29.250> ambition<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.330> project<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.110> there's

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
30th of March of this year so we're now

what<00:02:49.260> have<00:02:49.350> we<00:02:49.470> found<00:02:49.580> well<00:02:50.580> we<00:02:50.670> found<00:02:50.910> that

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
what have we found well we found that

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.570 
what have we found well we found that
the<00:02:51.239> universe<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.959> made<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.350> twelve<00:02:53.220> particles

the universe is made of twelve particles

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.910 
the universe is made of twelve particles
of<00:02:54.209> matter<00:02:54.269> held<00:02:54.780> together<00:02:54.959> by<00:02:55.200> four<00:02:55.590> forces

of<00:02:56.160> nature<00:02:56.570> we've<00:02:57.570> also<00:02:57.750> found<00:02:58.230> that<00:02:58.590> there's

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
of nature we've also found that there's

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.620 
of nature we've also found that there's
something<00:02:59.100> missing<00:02:59.489> in<00:02:59.880> our<00:03:00.060> picture<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.569> the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
something missing in our picture of the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.630 
something missing in our picture of the
universe<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.620> if<00:03:01.680> something<00:03:02.010> happened<00:03:02.430> in

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
universe so if something happened in

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.550 
universe so if something happened in
those<00:03:02.730> first<00:03:03.000> billionth<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.110> second<00:03:04.470> after

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
those first billionth of a second after

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.620 
those first billionth of a second after
the<00:03:04.709> Big<00:03:04.800> Bang<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.790> that's<00:03:06.030> something<00:03:06.450> is

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
the Big Bang and that's something is

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.559 
the Big Bang and that's something is
that<00:03:06.989> things<00:03:07.260> got<00:03:07.530> mass<00:03:07.860> so<00:03:08.610> literally<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.450> you

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
that things got mass so literally if you

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.330 
that things got mass so literally if you
look<00:03:09.720> at<00:03:09.810> your<00:03:09.930> hands<00:03:10.380> now<00:03:10.560> it's<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.890> solid

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
look at your hands now it's a solid

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.970 
look at your hands now it's a solid
thing<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:12.150> got<00:03:12.360> mass<00:03:12.630> you've<00:03:13.080> got<00:03:13.290> mass<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
thing it's got mass you've got mass the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.920 
thing it's got mass you've got mass the
particles<00:03:14.610> in<00:03:14.730> your<00:03:14.880> body<00:03:15.150> have<00:03:15.480> got<00:03:15.690> mass

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
particles in your body have got mass

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.319 
particles in your body have got mass
everywhere<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.800> look<00:03:16.980> that's<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.000> place

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
everywhere you look that's the place

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.210 
everywhere you look that's the place
where<00:03:18.630> our<00:03:18.660> understanding<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.620> universe

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
where our understanding of the universe

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.340 
where our understanding of the universe
stops<00:03:20.519> at<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:20.910> moment<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.480> that's<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.140> place

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
stops at the moment and that's the place

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.949 
stops at the moment and that's the place
that<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.709> LHC<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.519> beginning<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.000> explore<00:03:24.209> and

that the LHC is beginning to explore and

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.000 
that the LHC is beginning to explore and
I'll<00:03:25.140> show<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.350> one<00:03:25.560> more<00:03:25.590> piece<00:03:25.980> of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
I'll show you one more piece of

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.729 
I'll show you one more piece of
absolutely<00:03:26.790> crazy<00:03:27.120> maps<00:03:27.510> there<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.110> is<00:03:28.200> that

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
absolutely crazy maps there it is that

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.530 
absolutely crazy maps there it is that
is<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:28.950> summary<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.610> our<00:03:29.730> understanding<00:03:30.060> of

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
is the summary of our understanding of

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.020 
is the summary of our understanding of
the<00:03:30.600> universe<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.769> today<00:03:31.980> but<00:03:32.760> with<00:03:33.000> a

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
the universe as it is today but with a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.420 
the universe as it is today but with a
guess<00:03:33.329> for<00:03:34.079> how<00:03:34.260> particles<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.250> very

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
guess for how particles in the very

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.190 
guess for how particles in the very
early<00:03:35.730> universe<00:03:35.820> got<00:03:36.269> mass<00:03:36.480> which<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:36.930> this

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
early universe got mass which is this

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.220 
early universe got mass which is this
bit<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.010> LHC<00:03:38.400> is<00:03:38.579> checking<00:03:39.060> this<00:03:39.510> fit<00:03:39.750> so

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
bit and the LHC is checking this fit so

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.890 
bit and the LHC is checking this fit so
by<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.799> time<00:03:41.040> actually<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.910> if<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.540> decide

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
by the time actually you if you decide

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.050 
by the time actually you if you decide
to<00:03:42.930> do<00:03:43.200> physics<00:03:43.590> through<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> level<00:03:44.579> and

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
to do physics through to a level and

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.610 
to do physics through to a level and
come<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.390> University<00:03:45.900> by<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.260> time<00:03:46.470> you

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
get to university it may well be that we

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.140 
get to university it may well be that we

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
know whether that bit is right whether

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.910 
know whether that bit is right whether
that<00:03:51.269> bit<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:51.540> wrong<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.260> you<00:03:52.500> should<00:03:52.769> be

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
that bit is wrong and you should be

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.560 
that bit is wrong and you should be
learning<00:03:53.310> about<00:03:53.430> what<00:03:54.030> happened<00:03:54.390> in<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
learning about what happened in the

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.090 
learning about what happened in the
first<00:03:54.720> billionth<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.500> second<00:03:55.859> after<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
first billionth of a second after the

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.729 
first billionth of a second after the
Big<00:03:56.190> Bang<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:57.090> how<00:03:57.239> things<00:03:57.570> acquired<00:03:58.049> mass<00:03:58.380> in

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
Big Bang and how things acquired mass in

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.620 
Big Bang and how things acquired mass in
the<00:03:58.829> universe<00:04:00.019> so<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.320> think<00:04:01.680> that's<00:04:02.190> a

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
the universe so I think that's a

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.530 
the universe so I think that's a
remarkable<00:04:03.980> story<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.370> think<00:04:05.700> what<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:06.239> hope

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
remarkable story I think what I hope

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.740 
remarkable story I think what I hope
I've<00:04:06.810> done<00:04:07.079> is<00:04:07.320> gone<00:04:07.650> back<00:04:07.709> from<00:04:08.250> today<00:04:08.790> the

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
I've done is gone back from today the

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.690 
I've done is gone back from today the
formation<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.530> moon<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:11.220> fact<00:04:11.430> that<00:04:11.489> the

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
formation of the moon the fact that the

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
earth has an atmosphere and then sweep

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.830 
earth has an atmosphere and then sweep
back<00:04:14.010> in<00:04:14.220> time<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.970> show<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.209> some<00:04:15.450> evidence

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
back in time to show you some evidence

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.529 
back in time to show you some evidence
for<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.200> fact<00:04:16.410> that<00:04:16.709> we<00:04:17.220> believe<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.820> we

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
for the fact that we believe that we

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.659 
for the fact that we believe that we
found<00:04:18.810> out<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.350> universe<00:04:19.709> began<00:04:19.919> 13.7

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
found out that the universe began 13.7

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.659 
found out that the universe began 13.7
billion<00:04:21.450> years<00:04:21.870> ago<00:04:22.019> in<00:04:22.620> an<00:04:22.710> immensely<00:04:23.130> Copps

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
billion years ago in an immensely Copps

billion years ago in an immensely Copps
immensely<00:04:24.360> dense<00:04:24.630> States<00:04:25.760> but

immensely dense States but

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.010 
immensely dense States but
that's<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.930> think<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.650> demonstration<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:30.120> the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
that's I think a demonstration of the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.620 
that's I think a demonstration of the
power<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.880> physics<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.210> power<00:04:33.420> of

way of thinking and just for the last
minute<00:04:38.910> or<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:39.360> I'd<00:04:39.510> like<00:04:39.690> to<00:04:39.750> tell<00:04:40.320> you<00:04:40.440> what<00:04:40.560> I

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
think this is it's a very famous

think this is it's a very famous

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
very fundamental level back in the 1950s

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
and 1960s and he used to say that the

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.720 
and 1960s and he used to say that the
key<00:04:57.390> to<00:04:57.420> science<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:58.260> very<00:04:58.530> simple<00:04:59.070> very

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
key to science is very simple very

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.770 
key to science is very simple very
simple<00:05:00.120> indeed<00:05:00.980> what<00:05:01.980> you<00:05:02.010> do<00:05:02.280> is<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:03.510> make<00:05:03.750> a

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
simple indeed what you do is you make a

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.510 
simple indeed what you do is you make a
guess<00:05:04.110> as<00:05:04.560> to<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.710> way<00:05:04.890> the<00:05:05.040> universe<00:05:05.370> works

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
guess as to the way the universe works

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.760 
guess as to the way the universe works
so<00:05:06.420> all<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.720> way<00:05:06.810> back<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.200> thinking<00:05:07.680> about

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
so all the way back to thinking about

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.980 
so all the way back to thinking about
the<00:05:08.130> way<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.430> moon<00:05:08.610> was<00:05:08.850> formed<00:05:09.090> we<00:05:09.690> looked<00:05:09.840> at

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
the way the moon was formed we looked at

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.870 
the way the moon was formed we looked at
the<00:05:10.080> moon<00:05:10.260> we<00:05:10.860> thought<00:05:11.070> it<00:05:11.190> was<00:05:11.280> a<00:05:11.310> bit<00:05:11.490> odd<00:05:11.640> and

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
the moon we thought it was a bit odd and

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.730 
the moon we thought it was a bit odd and
we<00:05:12.270> guessed<00:05:12.540> something<00:05:12.810> we<00:05:13.230> guessed<00:05:13.500> that

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
we guessed something we guessed that

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.370 
we guessed something we guessed that
another<00:05:14.040> planet<00:05:14.400> hit<00:05:14.580> it<00:05:14.790> you<00:05:15.630> then<00:05:15.750> take<00:05:16.200> that

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
another planet hit it you then take that

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.370 
another planet hit it you then take that
guess<00:05:16.650> and<00:05:17.010> you<00:05:17.580> see<00:05:18.300> what<00:05:18.510> the<00:05:18.630> consequences

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
guess and you see what the consequences

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.320 
guess and you see what the consequences
are<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:20.130> you<00:05:20.220> say<00:05:20.340> whatever<00:05:20.520> planet<00:05:21.030> hit<00:05:21.210> the

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
are so you say whatever planet hit the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.490 
are so you say whatever planet hit the
moon<00:05:21.510> what<00:05:21.900> would<00:05:21.990> happen

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
moon what would happen

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.500 
moon what would happen
well<00:05:22.830> everything<00:05:23.730> would<00:05:23.820> be<00:05:23.910> spinning<00:05:24.180> pretty

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
well everything would be spinning pretty

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.440 
well everything would be spinning pretty
fast<00:05:24.840> if<00:05:25.350> it<00:05:25.500> glanced<00:05:26.100> it<00:05:27.000> was<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.180> glancing

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
fast if it glanced it was a glancing

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.090 
fast if it glanced it was a glancing
blow<00:05:27.780> there<00:05:28.110> wouldn't<00:05:28.290> be<00:05:28.320> much<00:05:28.440> iron<00:05:28.890> in<00:05:29.010> the

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
blow there wouldn't be much iron in the

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.970 
blow there wouldn't be much iron in the
core<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.640> you<00:05:30.390> form<00:05:30.720> where<00:05:31.500> you<00:05:31.590> work<00:05:31.740> out

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
core and you form where you work out

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.070 
core and you form where you work out
what<00:05:32.100> your<00:05:32.250> guest<00:05:32.520> implies<00:05:33.000> about<00:05:33.600> nature

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
what your guest implies about nature

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.800 
what your guest implies about nature
then<00:05:34.830> you<00:05:34.950> go<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.220> observe<00:05:35.370> nature<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:36.600> do<00:05:36.720> an

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
then you go and observe nature you do an

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.570 
then you go and observe nature you do an
experiment<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.680> you<00:05:38.010> see<00:05:38.220> whether<00:05:38.430> the

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
experiment and you see whether the

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.640 
experiment and you see whether the
outcome<00:05:38.700> of<00:05:38.910> that<00:05:38.970> experiment<00:05:39.650> coincides

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
outcome of that experiment coincides

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.040 
outcome of that experiment coincides
with<00:05:40.890> your<00:05:41.220> guests<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:42.270> consequences<00:05:42.990> of

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
with your guests and the consequences of

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.920 
with your guests and the consequences of
your<00:05:43.200> guests<00:05:43.850> and<00:05:44.850> then<00:05:45.060> you<00:05:45.450> said<00:05:45.630> this<00:05:45.810> is

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
your guests and then you said this is

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.350 
your guests and then you said this is
the<00:05:46.020> key<00:05:46.200> to<00:05:46.230> science<00:05:46.620> if<00:05:47.340> what<00:05:47.850> you<00:05:48.000> find

the key to science if what you find
disagrees<00:05:49.260> with<00:05:49.290> experiment<00:05:49.830> then<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.610> are

disagrees with experiment then you are

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.750 
disagrees with experiment then you are
wrong<00:05:50.940> right<00:05:51.810> it<00:05:52.530> doesn't<00:05:52.770> matter<00:05:52.920> who<00:05:53.580> you

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
wrong right it doesn't matter who you

wrong<00:06:01.380> and<00:06:01.980> in<00:06:02.100> that<00:06:02.220> statement<00:06:02.760> is<00:06:02.850> the<00:06:03.000> key

wrong and in that statement is the key

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.150 
wrong and in that statement is the key
to<00:06:03.330> science<00:06:03.750> and<00:06:04.410> I<00:06:04.530> think<00:06:04.680> that's<00:06:04.830> probably

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
to science and I think that's probably

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.340 
to science and I think that's probably
if<00:06:05.790> you<00:06:05.880> take<00:06:06.060> one<00:06:06.300> thing<00:06:06.330> away<00:06:06.660> from<00:06:06.990> my<00:06:07.290> talk

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
if you take one thing away from my talk

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.680 
if you take one thing away from my talk
I<00:06:07.770> think<00:06:07.830> that's<00:06:08.160> what<00:06:08.370> it<00:06:08.490> should<00:06:09.000> be<00:06:09.210> because

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
I think that's what it should be because

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.020 
I think that's what it should be because
having<00:06:10.500> opinions<00:06:11.100> about<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.760> way<00:06:11.880> the

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
having opinions about the way the

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.780 
having opinions about the way the
universe<00:06:12.180> began<00:06:12.780> seems<00:06:13.410> quite<00:06:13.770> bold<00:06:14.070> right<00:06:14.580> to

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
universe began seems quite bold right to

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.430 
universe began seems quite bold right to
say<00:06:14.940> I<00:06:14.970> think<00:06:15.120> the<00:06:15.420> universe<00:06:15.690> began<00:06:15.960> 13.7

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
say I think the universe began 13.7

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.280 
say I think the universe began 13.7
billion<00:06:17.100> years<00:06:17.400> ago<00:06:17.490> but<00:06:17.870> we've<00:06:18.870> computed

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
billion years ago but we've computed

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.430 
billion years ago but we've computed
what<00:06:19.980> happens<00:06:20.400> if<00:06:20.760> you<00:06:20.910> think<00:06:21.180> that<00:06:21.420> and<00:06:21.780> we

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
what happens if you think that and we

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.110 
what happens if you think that and we
found<00:06:22.680> that<00:06:22.920> it<00:06:23.040> agrees<00:06:23.370> with<00:06:23.400> experiment

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
found that it agrees with experiment

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.390 
found that it agrees with experiment
that<00:06:24.690> doesn't<00:06:24.960> mean<00:06:25.050> it's<00:06:25.200> right<00:06:25.470> but<00:06:26.280> it

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
that doesn't mean it's right but it

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.520 
that doesn't mean it's right but it
certainly<00:06:26.580> means<00:06:26.910> that<00:06:27.120> that<00:06:27.210> picture<00:06:27.480> is<00:06:28.140> not

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
certainly means that that picture is not

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.850 
certainly means that that picture is not
wrong<00:06:29.310> and<00:06:29.970> I<00:06:30.270> think<00:06:30.300> that's<00:06:30.860> vitally

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
wrong and I think that's vitally

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.160 
wrong and I think that's vitally
important<00:06:32.790> because<00:06:33.420> it's<00:06:33.660> allowed<00:06:33.870> us<00:06:33.900> to

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
important because it's allowed us to

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.230 
important because it's allowed us to
form<00:06:34.410> this<00:06:34.620> remarkable<00:06:35.190> picture<00:06:35.670> of<00:06:35.880> the

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
motto which is essentially on the word

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.250 
motto which is essentially on the word
of<00:06:52.690> no<00:06:52.990> one<00:06:53.230> right<00:06:53.920> so<00:06:54.400> no<00:06:54.790> matter<00:06:54.970> what<00:06:55.720> anyone

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
of no one right so no matter what anyone

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.070 
of no one right so no matter what anyone
says<00:06:56.490> you<00:06:57.490> can<00:06:57.640> test<00:06:57.940> what<00:06:58.450> they<00:06:58.540> say<00:06:58.720> against

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
says you can test what they say against

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.040 
says you can test what they say against
nature<00:06:59.500> that<00:07:00.040> is<00:07:00.310> the<00:07:00.670> process<00:07:01.630> of<00:07:01.810> thought

nature that is the process of thought

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.890 
nature that is the process of thought
which<00:07:02.740> has<00:07:02.890> taken<00:07:03.310> us<00:07:03.430> from<00:07:03.790> the<00:07:04.270> mudflats<00:07:04.720> of

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900 
which has taken us from the mudflats of

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.990 
which has taken us from the mudflats of
Tanzania<00:07:05.500> to<00:07:06.040> the<00:07:06.520> moon

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
Tanzania to the moon

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.330 
Tanzania to the moon
it<00:07:07.300> took<00:07:07.480> us<00:07:07.660> from<00:07:07.780> the<00:07:08.200> Wright<00:07:08.440> brothers<00:07:08.470> to

it took us from the Wright brothers to

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.690 
it took us from the Wright brothers to
the<00:07:09.460> moon<00:07:09.670> in<00:07:10.030> 17<00:07:10.720> years<00:07:10.900> and<00:07:11.350> I<00:07:11.560> think<00:07:11.620> if<00:07:12.190> just

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700 
the moon in 17 years and I think if just

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.880 
the moon in 17 years and I think if just
a<00:07:12.820> fraction<00:07:13.450> of<00:07:13.510> you<00:07:13.930> decide<00:07:14.500> you<00:07:14.680> want<00:07:14.830> to

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
a fraction of you decide you want to

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.610 
a fraction of you decide you want to
carry<00:07:15.190> on<00:07:15.370> in<00:07:15.520> that<00:07:15.640> spirit<00:07:16.230> don't<00:07:17.230> believe

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:17.620 
carry on in that spirit don't believe

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.590 
carry on in that spirit don't believe
anything<00:07:18.160> that<00:07:18.370> you're<00:07:18.670> told<00:07:18.910> essentially

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:19.600 
anything that you're told essentially

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.450 
anything that you're told essentially
unless<00:07:20.080> you<00:07:20.230> can<00:07:20.380> check<00:07:20.650> that<00:07:20.860> it<00:07:20.980> agrees<00:07:21.250> with

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:21.460 
unless you can check that it agrees with

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.550 
unless you can check that it agrees with
the<00:07:21.550> evidence<00:07:21.910> then<00:07:22.480> I<00:07:22.750> think<00:07:23.110> that<00:07:23.290> we<00:07:23.410> will

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
the evidence then I think that we will

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.920 
the evidence then I think that we will
progress<00:07:24.010> much<00:07:24.880> further<00:07:25.150> than<00:07:25.360> the<00:07:25.450> moon<00:07:25.630> in

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
progress much further than the moon in

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.640 
progress much further than the moon in
the<00:07:26.020> future<00:07:26.410> thank<00:07:27.160> you<00:07:27.280> very<00:07:27.430> much
