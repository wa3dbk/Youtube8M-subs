00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.290
 Hi, I'm Luis Puchades. I'm a trainer 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.750
 samsung and today I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.300
 new devices that were presented 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.400
 in the mobile world congress in February 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.410
 As you know, not only did they show up 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.920
 phones and that also does not 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.090
 they presented supplements in this case 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:44.170
 we talk about guiding two we talk about guiding 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.120
 two children and of course to fit guide 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.920
 of our device with a screen 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.920
 super amoled curved 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:01:00.019
 previously last year we presented the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.089
 galaxy guide that our device with 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.840
 format father clock with which we could 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:09.530
 take pictures because we could listen 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.360
 music depended on our devices 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.810
 or synchronized we received the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.810
 notifications with the new family of 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.280
 a galaxy guided what we are going to be able 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.470
 to do is, on the one hand, enjoy 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.600
 our music we will be able to receive the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.450
 notifications there are like with 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.670
 galaxy guide but we will also include 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.380
 some novelties on the one hand we are going to 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.710
 include a device with a camera 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.050
 photos so that it would be galaxy guided and a 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.140
 device without a camera that 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:49.040
 it would be galaxy left neon 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:51.260
 if you look here galaxy 2 includes a 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.930
 2 megapixel camera and now 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.750
 left we can see that it has like 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.600
 intention that this would be what is the 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.450
 infrared port in guiding two neo 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.220
 we find it here the difference that 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.920
 the chs and guide both devices 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.470
 we can exchange what would be the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.200
 the straps something really 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.450
 they demanded there are not many consumers anymore 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.540
 we do not have a speaker here 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.010
 that we have here and then when we 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.590
 between some call we can 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.989
 pick it up perfectly and talk to 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.280
 the galaxy that as if it were a 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.610
 free hands 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.150
 If you look here, you can call us the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.450
 attention here the galaxy looks better 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.950
 gear 2 neon that we have as a sensor 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.819
 what is this 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.010
 this is a heart rate sensor 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.170
 We can measure our pulse when 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.860
 example, let's be doing an exercise 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.890
 physical to see if we can raise the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.860
 intensity or keep it 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.730
 as for the interface it is very very 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.940
 We are talking about a type menu 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.390
 Carousel when we get to the last 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.470
 screen the screen of 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.800
 Home screen No. 11 here 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.600
 who have used my galaxy guide 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.270
 you will notice that we now see the icons 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.360
 grouped four by four if you 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.050
 prefer the other kind of view we could 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.350
 zoom in on the screen 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.960
 and now we would find what would be a 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.600
 icon by plant and then to have a 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.410
 easier access we could even 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.870
 order keep them pressed and ordered 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.220
 depending on the use that is going to 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.870
 give therefore what to retain closer to 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.800
 main screen good to go to the 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.700
 main screen 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.920
 we keep pressing the middle button that 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.070
 we have put it this time here in the 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:55.730
 central part so that to facilitate a 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.910
 little also the work to the 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.700
 left-handed people 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.570
 galaxy gear 2 and galaxy guides 2 neo 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.080
 They have a super amoled screen 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:11.220
 that and also have 4 gigas of 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:15.310
 internal memory that we will provide 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.540
 to listen to music and with our 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.880
 device without needing to have 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.480
 coupled a have within reach of our 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.620
 um 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.860
 and galaxy device the music the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.070
 we would keep in our galaxy guide and 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.840
 we will open the music player 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.660
 once it's paired with ones 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.620
 bluetooth headphones we give to 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.570
 play 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.570
 and we could already listen to the music 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.849
 I want to spend it cause 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.360
 I go to the music player 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:00.909
 to pause and could even raise the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.689
 volume or watch the playlist 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.689
 of songs 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.450
 gear fit is another of our 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:15.610
 complements and has a screen 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.070
 super amoled curved our first 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.140
 superama curved screen that we 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.020
 it comes in handy because that's how it fits 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.460
 better to what our doll would be with 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.190
 galaxy and the fit 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:31.420
 We will be able to receive notifications from 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:34.350
 calendar alarms and of course 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:37.150
 control in multimedia playback 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.940
 of our device that we have 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.490
 synchronized our galaxy device 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.950
 we can search the phone we can 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.560
 start the countdown timer 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.110
 galaxy gear fit is very focused on 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.110
 people who do sports in it so they 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:56.940
 a reader will also be included 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.940
 heart rate sensor 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:05.200
 suppose we want to go running 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.780
 we will press on exercise 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.060
 and from here we launch our 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.250
 application s health which is the application 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.010
 which measures what allows us 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.490
 control a bit all our 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.880
 calories ingested calories burned 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.560
 etc 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.560
 in our galaxy s 5 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.139
 for example if we go to the application of 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.260
 career 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.990
 we started sg now I would save 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:37.090
 also all our data from 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:39.580
 pulsations and so on and we could go 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.139
 indicating if we have to raise the pace 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.590
 or lower it depending on the intensity 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.590
 The exercise
