I suggest figuring out a schedule that
matches<00:01:23.759> your<00:01:23.909> lifestyle<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.780> lights<00:01:25.020> are

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
matches your lifestyle so the lights are

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.260 
matches your lifestyle so the lights are
on<00:01:25.350> when<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.890> home<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> sake<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.090> this
