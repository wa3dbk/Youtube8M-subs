00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
that's where you'll want your plate to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.180 
that's where you'll want your plate to
be<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:41.600> bike<00:00:41.840> has<00:00:42.079> plenty<00:00:42.500> of<00:00:42.530> room<00:00:42.800> for<00:00:42.859> the

be this bike has plenty of room for the
engine<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:43.579> we'll<00:00:43.730> get<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.120> dimensions

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
engine and we'll get you the dimensions

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.610 
engine and we'll get you the dimensions
here<00:00:44.840> shortly<00:00:45.170> as<00:00:45.440> we<00:00:46.399> do<00:00:46.579> this<00:00:46.789> install<00:00:47.620> we

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
here shortly as we do this install we

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.819 
here shortly as we do this install we
could<00:00:48.800> certainly<00:00:49.010> not<00:00:49.339> it<00:00:49.489> higher<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.829> which

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
could certainly not it higher and which

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.669 
could certainly not it higher and which
we<00:00:52.010> may<00:00:52.219> do<00:00:52.420> but<00:00:53.420> if<00:00:53.570> we<00:00:53.780> do<00:00:54.019> mount<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:54.469> higher

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
we may do but if we do mount it higher

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:56.799 
we may do but if we do mount it higher
we're<00:00:55.429> going<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.579> have<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.999> really<00:00:56.239> stretch

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
we're going to have to really stretch

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.720 
we're going to have to really stretch
this<00:00:57.140> plate<00:00:57.440> out<00:00:57.469> to<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.010> point<00:00:58.249> where<00:00:58.489> we're

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
this plate out to the point where we're

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.579 
this plate out to the point where we're
going<00:00:58.850> to<00:00:58.910> have<00:00:58.999> to<00:00:59.269> drill<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.539> hole<00:00:59.659> here<00:00:59.839> a

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
going to have to drill a hole here a

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.860 
going to have to drill a hole here a
hole<00:01:01.370> here<00:01:01.760> in<00:01:01.909> one<00:01:02.089> here<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.480> work<00:01:02.600> for<00:01:02.839> our

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
hole here in one here and work for our

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.420 
hole here in one here and work for our
three<00:01:03.199> bolts<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.649> go<00:01:03.679> and<00:01:03.949> we<00:01:04.040> can<00:01:04.220> certainly

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
three bolts to go and we can certainly

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.290 
three bolts to go and we can certainly
do<00:01:04.820> that<00:01:05.500> but<00:01:06.500> mounting<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.280> down<00:01:07.460> lower<00:01:07.790> gives

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
do that but mounting it down lower gives

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.550 
do that but mounting it down lower gives
you<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.510> course<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.870> lower<00:01:09.050> center<00:01:09.410> of<00:01:09.440> gravity

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
you of course a lower center of gravity

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.460 
you of course a lower center of gravity
which<00:01:10.100> is<00:01:10.130> good<00:01:10.520> for<00:01:10.730> handling<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.330> as<00:01:12.200> you

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
which is good for handling and as you

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.440 
which is good for handling and as you
can<00:01:12.620> see<00:01:12.860> all<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.220> holes<00:01:13.400> line<00:01:13.730> ups<00:01:14.000> we<00:01:14.240> won't

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
can see all the holes line ups we won't

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.930 
can see all the holes line ups we won't
have<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.780> do<00:01:14.930> any<00:01:15.140> drilling<00:01:15.590> but<00:01:16.370> it's<00:01:16.760> all

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
have to do any drilling but it's all

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.430 
have to do any drilling but it's all
dependent<00:01:17.540> upon<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.870> bike<00:01:18.050> on<00:01:18.260> this

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
dependent upon the bike on this
