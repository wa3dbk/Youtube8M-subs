flexors<00:00:35.020> as<00:00:35.470> well<00:00:35.680> if<00:00:36.280> we<00:00:36.370> wanted<00:00:36.610> to<00:00:36.670> increase

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
flexors as well if we wanted to increase

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.370 
flexors as well if we wanted to increase
the<00:00:37.120> intensity<00:00:37.360> of<00:00:37.660> this<00:00:37.810> we<00:00:37.990> could<00:00:38.140> obviously

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
the intensity of this we could obviously

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.100 
the intensity of this we could obviously
throw<00:00:39.340> an<00:00:39.460> ankle<00:00:39.730> weight<00:00:39.850> on<00:00:40.300> his<00:00:40.600> ankle<00:00:40.780> to

throw an ankle weight on his ankle to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.170 
throw an ankle weight on his ankle to
increase<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.250> muscle<00:00:42.520> activation<00:00:42.790> or<00:00:43.060> the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
increase the muscle activation or the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.790 
increase the muscle activation or the
muscle<00:00:43.329> force<00:00:43.660> required<00:00:43.990> to<00:00:44.110> do<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.350> activity

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
muscle force required to do the activity

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.890 
muscle force required to do the activity
okay<00:00:45.670> let's<00:00:45.880> have<00:00:46.000> you<00:00:46.090> bend<00:00:46.300> this<00:00:46.420> leg<00:00:46.480> up

also<00:01:04.689> we're<00:01:04.839> getting<00:01:05.049> some<00:01:05.229> back<00:01:05.409> extensors

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
also we're getting some back extensors

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.419 
also we're getting some back extensors
activation<00:01:07.060> as<00:01:07.270> well<00:01:08.280> benefits<00:01:09.280> of

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
activation as well benefits of

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:10.620 
activation as well benefits of
strengthening<00:01:09.819> the<00:01:10.030> muscles<00:01:10.119> around<00:01:10.389> the

the last exercise I'd like to
demonstrate<00:01:22.600> is<00:01:23.109> a<00:01:23.139> side<00:01:23.469> leg<00:01:23.859> raise<00:01:23.889> so<00:01:24.670> if<00:01:24.759> we

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
demonstrate is a side leg raise so if we

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.109 
demonstrate is a side leg raise so if we
can<00:01:24.999> have<00:01:25.149> you<00:01:25.270> lay<00:01:25.479> on<00:01:25.509> your<00:01:25.689> left<00:01:26.139> side<00:01:26.350> Bob

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
can have you lay on your left side Bob

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.669 
can have you lay on your left side Bob
we're<00:01:28.119> going<00:01:28.209> to<00:01:28.299> roll<00:01:28.689> your<00:01:28.929> hips<00:01:29.139> forward

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
we're going to roll your hips forward

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.029 
we're going to roll your hips forward
and<00:01:29.789> let's<00:01:30.789> bring<00:01:30.969> your<00:01:31.149> leg<00:01:31.299> up<00:01:31.509> and<00:01:31.840> back<00:01:32.200> and

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
and let's bring your leg up and back and

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.249 
and let's bring your leg up and back and
then<00:01:33.429> back<00:01:33.639> down<00:01:33.670> if<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:34.509> look<00:01:34.659> at<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.929> the

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
then back down if you look at the the

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.099 
then back down if you look at the the
direction<00:01:36.159> of<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.520> muscle<00:01:36.850> fibers<00:01:37.450> they<00:01:37.810> run

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
direction of the muscle fibers they run

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.649 
direction of the muscle fibers they run
in<00:01:38.920> this<00:01:39.130> direction<00:01:39.340> here<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:40.119> we<00:01:40.240> almost<00:01:40.389> want

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
in this direction here so we almost want
