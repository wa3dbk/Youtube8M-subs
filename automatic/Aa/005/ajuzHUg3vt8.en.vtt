00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.470
 therefore salute as indicated in the title 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.120
 of the video I will show you the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.790
 sun benefits for our hair 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.769
 as well as ways to protect them from 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.929
 the exhibition seems contradictory 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.259
 but you will understand over the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.259
 video 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.270
 who says sun says heat so your 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.280
 scalp will be much more stimulated 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.160
 that is, the blood vessels 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.710
 in fact will be much more dilated the 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.330
 blood circulation will be accelerated and 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.180
 so that allows your hair to be 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.460
 better bulb-fed and so you 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.879
 new hair will grow faster and 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.879
 stronger 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.379
 in general we are often told that he 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.199
 avoid exposure to the sun but 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.000
 moderate way of exposure 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.190
 a lot of benefits for our health 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.579
 and so for the hair I give you 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.610
 three examples the first is that the 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.129
 uvb rays allow the skin to 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.470
 produce vitamin d and this 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.030
 vitamin would have an important role for 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.770
 hair growth and for the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.440
 prevention of hair loss 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.420
 secondly sun exposure 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.909
 allows to increase the amount of water 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.159
 dauphine in the blood which helps 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.170
 strongly to decrease the stress that 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.789
 also allows the synchronization of the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.009
 rhythm to the body's mandate I think 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.050
 including melatonin and 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.509
 serotonin that contribute to 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.460
 improving sleep energy 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.039
 and mood so all this a 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.460
 positive influence on the growth of 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.350
 hair 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.880
 of course if you know that you are 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.039
 will expose longer it takes 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.950
 really protect yourself when that too 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:46.240
 harmful effects when it is abused and 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.399
 so on the hair actually it has a 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.099
 drying effect and it can also 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.200
 degraded the pigments whether it's the 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.599
 natural color of your hair or 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.250
 an artificial coloring 

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:00.729
 so it's still important to 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.679
 protect your hair from the sun is there I 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.619
 will show you ways to 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:14.260
 protection whatsoever so is a 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:17.620
 text to protect your hair but 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.349
 also your skin against the sun 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.480
 do not hesitate to take supplements 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.450
 foods or foods rich in 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.879
 antioxidants like watermelon them the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.580
 tomatoes the carrot finally I think the 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.430
 most fruits are rich in 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.500
 antioxidants fruits and vegetables 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.090
 not to mention the fact that the more your 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.370
 hair are doing these rains will be 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:47.319
 protected because melanin plays a role 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:49.360
 protector against millions us for 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.190
 protect your hair externally 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.130
 There are two types of oil to focus on 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.200
 oils rich in antioxidants and 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.569
 oils rich in saturated fatty acids or 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.050
 unsaturated mono like coconut oil 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.260
 but olive or castor oil 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.569
 the ideal is to take a rich oil 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.490
 saturated fatty acids and to add 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.040
 little vitamin in since the 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.380
 Vitamin is a good antioxidant you 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.200
 can also enjoy the oils 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.020
 and greens having a factor of 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.750
 significant sun protection 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.970
 as once again he cuckoo 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.100
 olive oil castor oil but 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.600
 also shea butter or 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.459
 cocoa butter you can also 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.350
 give preference to the hairdressers who go 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.350
 protect your hair like mats 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.260
 cabbage vanilla finally it's up to 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.500

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.599

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.410
 to try to protect them to the maximum 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:50.410
 you can also do the attachment 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.180
 scarf or use a cat so that's it 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.940
