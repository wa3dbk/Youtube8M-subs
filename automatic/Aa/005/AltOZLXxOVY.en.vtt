high<00:02:09.270> fructose<00:02:09.569> corn<00:02:09.810> syrup<00:02:10.280> is<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.489> worse

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
high fructose corn syrup is it worse

high fructose corn syrup is it worse

because it's the exact same they are
basically<00:02:16.080> equivalent<00:02:16.709> problem<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:18.260> they're

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
basically equivalent problem is they're

basically equivalent problem is they're
