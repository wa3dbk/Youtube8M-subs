for<00:00:14.199> me<00:00:14.349> I<00:00:14.379> don't<00:00:14.589> really<00:00:14.679> have<00:00:14.769> a<00:00:16.230> practice<00:00:17.230> or

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
for me I don't really have a practice or

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.019 
for me I don't really have a practice or
a<00:00:17.439> routine<00:00:18.070> that<00:00:18.189> I<00:00:18.250> have<00:00:18.490> for<00:00:18.640> alternate

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
a routine that I have for alternate

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.510 
a routine that I have for alternate
picking<00:00:19.210> a<00:00:19.810> lot<00:00:20.650> of<00:00:20.739> it<00:00:20.829> is<00:00:20.949> in<00:00:21.099> my<00:00:21.279> hand

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
picking a lot of it is in my hand

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.359 
picking a lot of it is in my hand
position<00:00:22.029> I<00:00:22.239> choke<00:00:23.230> to<00:00:23.349> pick<00:00:23.529> off<00:00:23.680> really

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
position I choke to pick off really

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.409 
position I choke to pick off really
really<00:00:24.730> shallow<00:00:25.060> so<00:00:25.390> there's<00:00:25.599> not<00:00:25.930> a<00:00:25.960> lot<00:00:26.259> of

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
really shallow so there's not a lot of

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.089 
really shallow so there's not a lot of
material<00:00:28.419> sticking<00:00:28.689> earnings<00:00:28.989> my<00:00:29.140> hand<00:00:29.439> and<00:00:29.680> I

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
material sticking earnings my hand and I

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.220 
material sticking earnings my hand and I
also<00:00:30.250> keep<00:00:30.579> the<00:00:30.759> pic<00:00:31.000> so<00:00:31.239> that<00:00:31.419> it's<00:00:31.599> it's<00:00:31.840> kind

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
also keep the pic so that it's it's kind

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.709 
also keep the pic so that it's it's kind
of<00:00:32.290> it's<00:00:32.950> almost<00:00:33.280> parallel<00:00:34.059> to<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.360> string

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
of it's almost parallel to the string

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.450 
of it's almost parallel to the string
but<00:00:34.989> not<00:00:35.200> not<00:00:35.440> too<00:00:35.649> much<00:00:35.829> some<00:00:36.100> people<00:00:36.340> when<00:00:36.430> I

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
but not not too much some people when I

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.670 
but not not too much some people when I
have<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.789> pick<00:00:37.239> parallel<00:00:37.750> it's<00:00:38.230> harder<00:00:38.649> to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
have to pick parallel it's harder to

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.889 
have to pick parallel it's harder to
pick<00:00:39.010> the<00:00:39.160> string<00:00:39.579> I<00:00:39.850> haven't<00:00:40.329> just<00:00:40.539> a<00:00:40.660> little

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
pick the string I haven't just a little

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.410 
pick the string I haven't just a little
bit<00:00:40.989> turn<00:00:41.289> so<00:00:41.590> that<00:00:41.739> it<00:00:41.829> almost<00:00:42.430> nudges<00:00:43.390> the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
bit turn so that it almost nudges the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.750 
bit turn so that it almost nudges the
string<00:00:43.930> over<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.739> other<00:00:44.860> thing<00:00:45.100> too<00:00:45.370> for<00:00:45.610> me

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
string over the other thing too for me

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.180 
string over the other thing too for me
with<00:00:46.000> some<00:00:46.810> of<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.050> picking<00:00:47.650> patterns<00:00:48.010> that<00:00:48.130> I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
with some of the picking patterns that I

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.910 
with some of the picking patterns that I
have<00:00:48.460> they<00:00:49.420> would<00:00:49.630> just<00:00:49.899> be<00:00:50.590> totally

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
have they would just be totally

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.979 
have they would just be totally
inaudible<00:00:51.399> if<00:00:51.790> there<00:00:52.090> was<00:00:52.180> a<00:00:52.210> de<00:00:52.450> pomme<00:00:52.690> muting

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
inaudible if there was a de pomme muting

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.530 
inaudible if there was a de pomme muting
technique<00:00:53.020> that<00:00:53.649> I<00:00:53.680> use<00:00:53.800> myself<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.760> I<00:00:55.300> like

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
technique that I use myself and I like

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.510 
technique that I use myself and I like
to<00:00:55.660> put<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:55.989> bridge<00:00:56.620> of<00:00:56.770> my<00:00:56.950> hand<00:00:57.190> right<00:00:57.370> here

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
to put the bridge of my hand right here

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.580 
to put the bridge of my hand right here
than<00:00:57.760> me<00:00:57.970> of<00:00:58.090> it<00:00:58.270> right<00:00:58.630> across<00:00:58.840> the<00:00:59.110> bridge<00:00:59.350> of

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
than me of it right across the bridge of

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.220 
than me of it right across the bridge of
the<00:01:00.160> pickup<00:01:00.430> I<00:01:00.730> mean<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.000> bridge<00:01:01.780> there<00:01:01.989> and

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
the pickup I mean the bridge there and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.810 
the pickup I mean the bridge there and
just<00:01:02.350> kind<00:01:02.590> of<00:01:02.620> wallet<00:01:02.950> forward<00:01:03.219> to<00:01:03.309> dampen<00:01:03.670> of

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
just kind of wallet forward to dampen of

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.410 
just kind of wallet forward to dampen of
strings<00:01:04.149> it's<00:01:04.869> different<00:01:05.049> different<00:01:06.420> amounts

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
strings it's different different amounts

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.270 
strings it's different different amounts
that<00:01:07.540> I<00:01:07.659> roll<00:01:07.869> afford<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.530> dead<00:01:09.070> in<00:01:09.189> the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
that I roll afford to dead in the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that I roll afford to dead in the
strings<00:01:09.610> like

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.010 

sometimes<00:01:14.300> I'll<00:01:14.450> just<00:01:14.630> keep<00:01:14.780> with<00:01:14.960> each

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
sometimes I'll just keep with each

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
sometimes I'll just keep with each
other's<00:01:15.380> pain<00:01:15.620> I<00:01:16.360> can<00:01:17.360> train<00:01:17.570> of<00:01:17.690> consequences

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.270 

I<00:01:23.869> can't<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.110> can't<00:01:25.140> start<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.860> pattern<00:01:26.159> if

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I can't I can't start a pattern if

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.709 
I can't I can't start a pattern if
there's<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.729> there's<00:01:26.789> four<00:01:27.180> notes<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.600> there

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
there's if there's four notes in there

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.480 
there's if there's four notes in there
and<00:01:27.960> I'm<00:01:28.140> doing<00:01:28.500> three<00:01:28.799> notes<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.219> want<00:01:29.399> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and I'm doing three notes and I want to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.149 
and I'm doing three notes and I want to
down<00:01:29.610> pick<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.890> alternate<00:01:33.979> because<00:01:34.979> of

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
down pick on the alternate because of

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.830 
down pick on the alternate because of
the<00:01:35.310> timing<00:01:35.579> i'm<00:01:35.789> gonna<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.240> fourth<00:01:36.570> note

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
the timing i'm gonna do the fourth note

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.350 
the timing i'm gonna do the fourth note
it's<00:01:37.020> going<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.409> same<00:01:37.590> thing<00:01:38.360> it's

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
it's going to be the same thing it's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.910 
it's going to be the same thing it's
going<00:01:39.539> to<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.689> an<00:01:39.780> uptick<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.439> fourth<00:01:40.710> note

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
going to be an uptick on the fourth note

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.830 
going to be an uptick on the fourth note
if<00:01:41.069> I<00:01:41.189> want<00:01:41.399> a<00:01:41.460> Down<00:01:41.670> pick<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.270> down<00:01:42.539> up

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
if I want a Down pick and I go down up

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.240 
if I want a Down pick and I go down up
down<00:01:42.869> down<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:44.369> gonna<00:01:45.560> suspect<00:01:46.560> when<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> want

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
down down it's gonna suspect when I want

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.109 
down down it's gonna suspect when I want
to<00:01:47.340> go<00:01:47.460> from<00:01:47.689> from<00:01:48.689> string<00:01:49.319> to<00:01:49.350> string

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
to go from from string to string

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.580 
to go from from string to string
sometimes<00:01:51.119> I'll<00:01:51.299> start<00:01:51.630> with<00:01:51.840> an<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.170> pick<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
sometimes I'll start with an up pick and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.590 
sometimes I'll start with an up pick and
then<00:01:52.710> go<00:01:52.890> down<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.880> try<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.149> keep<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.450> as

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
then go down as I try and keep it as

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.320 
then go down as I try and keep it as
flowing<00:01:54.929> as<00:01:55.110> possible<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.709> between<00:01:56.099> notes<00:01:56.429> the

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
flowing as possible in between notes the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.850 
flowing as possible in between notes the
other<00:01:57.509> thing<00:01:57.689> too<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.110> cheat<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> lot<00:01:58.619> when

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
other thing too is I cheat a lot when

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.050 
other thing too is I cheat a lot when
you're<00:01:58.950> asking<00:01:59.250> me<00:01:59.340> how<00:01:59.459> I<00:01:59.490> go<00:01:59.700> back<00:01:59.819> and<00:02:00.000> forth

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
you're asking me how I go back and forth

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.899 
you're asking me how I go back and forth
between<00:02:00.330> strings<00:02:00.979> I'll<00:02:01.979> anchor<00:02:02.399> my<00:02:02.549> finger

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
between strings I'll anchor my finger

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.580 
between strings I'll anchor my finger
either<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.209> the<00:02:03.299> pickup<00:02:03.509> ring<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.470> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
either on the pickup ring or on the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.830

position so the palm was facing up I

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.530 
position so the palm was facing up I
could<00:02:44.220> pull<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.520> muscle<00:02:44.819> up<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.090> way<00:02:45.300> could

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
could pull the muscle up this way could

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.120 
could pull the muscle up this way could
close<00:02:46.050> my<00:02:46.080> hand<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.590> everything<00:02:46.860> like<00:02:46.920> this

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
close my hand and everything like this

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.100 
close my hand and everything like this
if<00:02:47.310> my<00:02:47.459> hand<00:02:47.700> was<00:02:47.880> in<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.480> position<00:02:48.600> where

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
if my hand was in this position where

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.839 
if my hand was in this position where
the<00:02:49.200> palm<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.560> facing<00:02:49.709> down<00:02:50.069> I<00:02:50.310> couldn't<00:02:50.760> do

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
the palm is facing down I couldn't do

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.300 
the palm is facing down I couldn't do
nothing<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.239> just<00:02:51.300> hung<00:02:51.810> like<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.950> because

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
nothing I just hung like that so because

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.420 
nothing I just hung like that so because
the<00:02:53.430> guitar<00:02:54.050> in<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:55.260> position<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:56.190> know<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the guitar in this position you know the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.740 
the guitar in this position you know the
palm<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.760> facing<00:02:56.910> up<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.330> would<00:02:57.420> think<00:02:57.630> that

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
palm is facing up you would think that

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.600 
palm is facing up you would think that
something<00:02:58.170> could<00:02:58.319> happen<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:59.250> was<00:02:59.370> fine

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
something could happen and it was fine

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.130 
something could happen and it was fine
going<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.060> way<00:03:00.239> but<00:03:00.390> when<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.510> had<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.780> pull<00:03:00.989> my

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
going this way but when I had to pull my

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.170 
going this way but when I had to pull my
hand<00:03:01.319> back<00:03:01.500> down<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.920> way<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.459> couldn't<00:03:03.060> get

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
hand back down this way I couldn't get

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.360 
hand back down this way I couldn't get
the<00:03:03.299> muscle<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.720> pull<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.080> way<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.920> some<00:03:05.340> of

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
the muscle to pull this way so some of

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.650 
the muscle to pull this way so some of
the<00:03:05.489> things<00:03:05.549> that<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:05.880> did<00:03:06.090> when<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.299> was<00:03:06.330> trying

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
the things that I did when I was trying

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.870 
the things that I did when I was trying
to<00:03:06.780> rehabilitate<00:03:07.140> my<00:03:07.680> arm<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.069> this<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:08.549> this

to rehabilitate my arm and this is this
would<00:03:09.060> be<00:03:09.209> before<00:03:09.900> any<00:03:10.200> guitar<00:03:10.590> player<00:03:10.830> who's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
would be before any guitar player who's

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.470 
would be before any guitar player who's
entered<00:03:11.340> their<00:03:11.519> arm<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.000> they<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.299> it's

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
weird wheel that they had it was like a

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.849 
weird wheel that they had it was like a
mesh<00:03:24.600> thing<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.170> just<00:03:25.319> do<00:03:25.680> these

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
mesh thing and you just do these

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.130 
mesh thing and you just do these
gripping<00:03:26.280> exercises<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.660> having<00:03:27.930> said<00:03:27.989> that

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
gripping exercises so having said that

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.130 
gripping exercises so having said that
as<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.950> muscle<00:03:29.280> came<00:03:29.489> back<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:30.329> just<00:03:30.840> started

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
as the muscle came back I just started

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.259 
as the muscle came back I just started
doing<00:03:31.530> basic<00:03:32.040> picking<00:03:32.370> patterns<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.150> know

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
doing basic picking patterns you know

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.940 
doing basic picking patterns you know
all<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.840> blockheaded<00:03:34.320> stuff<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.769> learn<00:03:34.920> in

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.500 
all the blockheaded stuff you learn in
the<00:03:35.130> beginning

try<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.180> do<00:04:36.240> it<00:04:36.330> as<00:04:36.420> much<00:04:36.570> as<00:04:36.600> I<00:04:36.780> can't

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020

discipline<00:04:37.440> myself

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.340 

when<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.340> was<00:04:42.759> in<00:04:42.910> Metallica<00:04:43.449> I<00:04:43.630> had<00:04:44.139> brought

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
when I was in Metallica I had brought

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.080 
when I was in Metallica I had brought
this<00:04:44.620> rift<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.280> them<00:04:45.430> that<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.669> had<00:04:45.699> invented

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
this rift to them that I had invented

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.629 
this rift to them that I had invented
and<00:04:46.800> nobody<00:04:47.800> had<00:04:47.889> ever<00:04:47.949> seen<00:04:48.220> this<00:04:48.310> before<00:04:48.460> I

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
and nobody had ever seen this before I

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:56.159 
and nobody had ever seen this before I
was<00:04:48.729> caused<00:04:48.970> by<00:04:54.660> stuff<00:04:55.660> like<00:04:55.840> that<00:04:55.870> because

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
was caused by stuff like that because

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.040 
was caused by stuff like that because
it's<00:04:56.500> it<00:04:56.650> so<00:04:58.080> it's<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.229> much<00:04:59.380> easier<00:05:01.050> because

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
it's it so it's so much easier because

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.050 
it's it so it's so much easier because
you're<00:05:02.410> you're<00:05:02.740> taking<00:05:03.580> your<00:05:03.639> fingers<00:05:03.940> off

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
you're you're taking your fingers off

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.189 
you're you're taking your fingers off
the<00:05:04.180> one<00:05:04.330> school<00:05:04.570> you<00:05:04.690> went<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:04.930> the<00:05:05.050> other

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
the one school you went to the other

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.409 
the one school you went to the other
string<00:05:05.560> is<00:05:05.680> going<00:05:05.889> to<00:05:05.949> be<00:05:06.039> string<00:05:06.310> noise<00:05:06.460> also

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
string is going to be string noise also

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.540 
string is going to be string noise also
the<00:05:07.570> timing

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.880 

basically<00:05:12.420> my<00:05:12.600> style<00:05:12.900> is<00:05:13.080> I<00:05:13.290> play<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.650> lot<00:05:13.770> of

basically my style is I play a lot of
pentatonic<00:05:14.460> stuff<00:05:14.700> I<00:05:14.820> guess<00:05:15.000> since<00:05:15.150> when<00:05:15.360> it's

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
pentatonic stuff I guess since when it's

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.880 
pentatonic stuff I guess since when it's
called<00:05:17.840> said<00:05:18.840> old<00:05:18.990> blue<00:05:19.230> stopped<00:05:19.590> because

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
scale and that's basically all got

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:45.280 
scale and that's basically all got
scales<00:05:36.000> if<00:05:36.240> I<00:05:36.330> didn't<00:05:36.570> really<00:05:36.660> slow<00:05:36.960> up<00:05:37.050> here
