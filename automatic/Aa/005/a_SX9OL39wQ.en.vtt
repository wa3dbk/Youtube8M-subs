shock mount as well you can get all

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.510 
shock mount as well you can get all
these<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.030> Amazon<00:01:00.379> you<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.920> need<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.160> tweak<00:01:02.399> it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
these on Amazon you do need to tweak it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.399 
these on Amazon you do need to tweak it
a<00:01:02.579> little<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.449> pop<00:01:03.899> filter<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
a little bit to get this pop filter to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.590 
a little bit to get this pop filter to
fit<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:05.010> because<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.450> they

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
fit on there because you know they

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.030 
fit on there because you know they
should<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.229> set<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.740> little<00:01:07.830> bit

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
should have set it up a little bit

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.300 
should have set it up a little bit
different<00:01:09.110> for<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.140> mic<00:01:10.380> itself<00:01:10.799> because<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
different for the mic itself because it

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.830 
different for the mic itself because it
comes<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.640> stand<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.180> all<00:01:12.330> sort<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.600> stuff

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
comes on a stand and all sort of stuff

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.960 
comes on a stand and all sort of stuff
and<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> takes<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.100> little<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.400> tweaking<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and it takes a little bit tweaking and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.249 
and it takes a little bit tweaking and
then<00:01:15.090> once<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.450> figure<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.140> can

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
then once you figure out you can

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.200 
then once you figure out you can
actually<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.159> know<00:01:17.520> some<00:01:17.729> people<00:01:17.790> drill

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
actually do it I know some people drill

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.090 
actually do it I know some people drill
holes<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.720> there<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.229> their<00:01:19.560> mic<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> stuff

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
holes in there and their mic and stuff

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.280 
holes in there and their mic and stuff
like<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.939> work<00:01:21.090> which<00:01:21.390> would

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
like that to get it to work which would

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.190 
like that to get it to work which would
probably<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.670> don't<00:01:24.180> know<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.479> most

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
probably be the I don't know the most

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.499 
probably be the I don't know the most
secure<00:01:25.650> way<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.460> works<00:01:26.670> fine<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
secure way but this works fine so and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.429 
secure way but this works fine so and
then<00:01:27.990> again<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.439> use<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> road<00:01:30.350> what<00:01:31.350> is

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439

I don't drill any holes or anything I

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.280 
I don't drill any holes or anything I
just<00:01:47.250> use<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:48.000> little<00:01:48.689> clamp<00:01:49.049> thing

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
just use that little little clamp thing

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.649 
just use that little little clamp thing
that's<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> back<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.659> that's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that's on the back of here and that's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.090 
that's on the back of here and that's
pretty<00:01:51.780> much<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.380> then<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
pretty much it and then you just you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.889 
pretty much it and then you just you
know<00:01:53.220> hook<00:01:53.579> up<00:01:53.700> your<00:01:53.850> wires<00:01:54.060> right<00:01:54.360> here<00:01:54.420> your

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
know hook up your wires right here your

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.649 
know hook up your wires right here your
wire<00:01:55.049> goes<00:01:55.290> across<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> then<00:01:57.240> so

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
wire goes across like that and then so

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.300 
wire goes across like that and then so
you<00:01:57.719> got<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> shock<00:01:58.290> mount<00:01:58.590> here<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.219> just

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
you got the shock mount here so you just

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.090 
you got the shock mount here so you just
hook<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.759> shock<00:02:00.030> mount<00:02:00.360> shock<00:02:01.290> mount<00:02:01.530> onto

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
hook the shock mount shock mount onto

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.910 
hook the shock mount shock mount onto
the<00:02:02.340> onto<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> microphone<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.500> that's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the onto the to the microphone so that's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.609 
the onto the to the microphone so that's
pretty<00:02:05.189> self-explanatory<00:02:06.320> now<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.380> one

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
pretty self-explanatory now the one

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.559 
pretty self-explanatory now the one
thing<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:07.920> with<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.459> pop<00:02:08.970> filter<00:02:09.390> though

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
thing I do with this pop filter though

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.520 
thing I do with this pop filter though
is<00:02:10.280> actually<00:02:11.280> run<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.840> through

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
is actually run it through

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.860 
is actually run it through
through<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.890> ash<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.550> take<00:02:14.819> this<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.600> part

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
through the ash so I take this this part

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.430 
through the ash so I take this this part
right<00:02:16.020> here<00:02:16.080> right<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.880> part<00:02:18.120> right<00:02:18.180> here

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
right here right so this part right here

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.320 
right here right so this part right here
which<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.800> bottom<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.370> shock<00:02:20.640> mount<00:02:20.940> and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
which is the bottom the shock mount and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.880 
which is the bottom the shock mount and
then<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.600> have<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.870> little<00:02:22.290> screw<00:02:22.680> thing

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
then you have this little screw thing

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.650 
then you have this little screw thing
here<00:02:23.130> too<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:24.030> then<00:02:24.090> there's<00:02:24.330> like<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> little

attach<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.610> here<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.600> that's<00:03:31.410> pretty<00:03:31.590> much<00:03:31.650> it

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
attach it here so that's pretty much it

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.199 
attach it here so that's pretty much it
then<00:03:32.070> you<00:03:32.160> can<00:03:32.310> bend<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.640> whatever<00:03:32.970> way<00:03:33.150> you

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
then you can bend it whatever way you

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.360 
then you can bend it whatever way you
want<00:03:33.540> like<00:03:33.690> this<00:03:33.900> so<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:34.920> way<00:03:35.040> it's<00:03:35.130> just<00:03:35.190> a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
want like this so that way it's just a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.259 
want like this so that way it's just a
couple<00:03:35.700> inches<00:03:36.150> away<00:03:36.989> like<00:03:37.260> that

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
couple inches away like that

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.050 
couple inches away like that
simple<00:03:39.269> zap<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:41.040> yeah<00:03:41.760> really

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
simple zap so yeah really

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.910 
simple zap so yeah really
self-explanatory<00:03:42.510> I<00:03:43.200> mean<00:03:43.350> just<00:03:43.560> take<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.739> look

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
self-explanatory I mean just take a look

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.330 
self-explanatory I mean just take a look
at<00:03:44.100> it<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.430> figure<00:03:45.420> out<00:03:45.450> how<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:45.720> hooked<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.109> up

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
at it and figure out how I hooked it up

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.000 
at it and figure out how I hooked it up
and<00:03:47.989> then<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.049> cool<00:03:49.230> thing<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.560> when<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.799> sit

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
and then the cool thing is when you sit

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.099 
and then the cool thing is when you sit
down<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.489> know<00:03:50.609> then<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:50.940> can<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:51.269> grab<00:03:51.989> it

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
down you know then you can just grab it

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.039 
down you know then you can just grab it
anywhere<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:52.829> just<00:03:52.859> pull<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.430> forward<00:03:54.049> pull

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
anywhere and just pull it forward pull

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.500 
anywhere and just pull it forward pull
it<00:03:55.170> back<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.799> usually<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:56.850> just<00:03:57.060> keep<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.390> up

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
it back so usually I just keep it up

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.020 
it back so usually I just keep it up
like<00:03:57.660> this<00:03:57.870> out<00:03:58.140> of<00:03:58.290> my<00:03:58.380> way

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
like this out of my way

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.670 
like this out of my way
and<00:04:00.030> then<00:04:00.150> what<00:04:00.359> I'm<00:04:00.450> about<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:00.780> do<00:04:00.900> webinar<00:04:01.350> or

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
let's pull it out like like that right

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.180 
let's pull it out like like that right
there

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
there

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.560 
there
so<00:04:08.190> I'll<00:04:08.250> just<00:04:08.459> sit<00:04:08.700> down<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.209> comes<00:04:09.390> right

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
so I'll just sit down and it comes right

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.340 
so I'll just sit down and it comes right
and<00:04:09.780> right<00:04:10.320> in<00:04:10.410> front<00:04:11.239> so<00:04:12.239> really<00:04:12.930> cool<00:04:13.140> too

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
and right in front so really cool too

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.500 
and right in front so really cool too
and<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:14.340> great<00:04:14.519> thing<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.760> if<00:04:15.120> there's<00:04:15.299> noise

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
and the great thing is if there's noise

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.520 
and the great thing is if there's noise
from<00:04:15.840> behind<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:18.630> won't<00:04:19.169> really<00:04:19.289> get

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
from behind you it won't really get

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.529 
from behind you it won't really get
picked<00:04:19.859> up<00:04:20.070> as<00:04:20.250> much<00:04:20.459> from<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:20.970> microphone

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
picked up as much from this microphone

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:23.960 
picked up as much from this microphone
so<00:04:22.019> very<00:04:22.770> little<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.159> that<00:04:23.310> come<00:04:23.550> through<00:04:23.729> so

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
so very little of that come through so

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.219 
so very little of that come through so
if<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.060> got<00:04:24.240> kids<00:04:24.510> screaming<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.080> other

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.760 
there so little heart-shaped thing right
there<00:05:50.699> and<00:05:50.870> then<00:05:51.870> you<00:05:51.960> just<00:05:52.139> play<00:05:52.289> around<00:05:52.469> the

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
there and then you just play around the

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.649 
there and then you just play around the
game<00:05:52.949> so<00:05:53.219> the<00:05:53.310> heart-shaped<00:05:53.759> one<00:05:53.849> is<00:05:54.180> bass<00:05:54.389> I

don't know what it's called but it just

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:58.129 
don't know what it's called but it just
basically<00:05:56.940> means<00:05:57.270> that<00:05:57.630> you're<00:05:57.750> trying<00:05:58.020> to
