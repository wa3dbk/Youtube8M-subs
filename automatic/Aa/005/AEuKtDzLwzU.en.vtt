00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:14.179
 tension emotions 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.680
 and an overpriced purchase price that is 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.760
 it was a really good formula 1 game 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.290
 makes 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:34.650
 and here is codemasters new game f1 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:41.090
 2013 more realism an even better 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.090
 Graphics and there is no gravity 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.920
 fuck you not 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.080
 otherwise everything is the same 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.620
 like a f1 2012 10 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:58.699
 and the community goes with theirs 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.699
 suggestions for improvement at the past 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:09.570
 oh just fun of course we have a lot 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:12.060
 positive changes to such example 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.909
 frustrations due to inappropriate 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.729
 Players will avoid the player 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.670
 in front of each new lobby one of the 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.160
 special classes assigned so that you 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.400
 drive online only against his peers 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.400
 can 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:35.950
 in f1 2013 we also offer new modes like 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.280
 san siro mark roach ears beat her 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.710
 is a record from 2012 in the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.130
 category other people from the race 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:58.100
 throw and the best thing is gonna get 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:02:00.979
 even points in contrast to 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 Real formula 1, we wanted to hear the team 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.520
 not remove but logically 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.920
 we did not have a template like a hc 2013 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:20.570
 could look 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:22.250
 So we have just commissioned them to hate 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.920
 the useless comments of her 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.380
 underpaid race engineer like today 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.840
 There are many cars on the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.510
 route then this mode is just that 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.720
 right for you 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.680
 Give your teammates proper or 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:44.189
 incorrect instructions are made 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.189
 should be okay if you say 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.060
 fun guaranteed you became idiot now 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.060
 disqualified 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.760
 besides, we have the pathetic one 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:04.769
 punishment system from f1 2012 as well as 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:09.640
 every little back so imaginable 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:12.299
 corrected so f1 2013 the games 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.739
 sensation of the year will be and 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:20.739
 moment is that here is something grid 2 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.459
 I'm so sorry God already points 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.459
 available 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.270
