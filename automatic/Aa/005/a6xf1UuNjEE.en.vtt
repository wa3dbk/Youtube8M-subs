00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.870
 one is the clever one and the other 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.850
 is the stupid one 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.969
 it looks like we have two in the end 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:15.460
 against the bags black has something 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.850
 goes off ndr I am from sketch to 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.430
 procure 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.470
 on the topic the album of the circulation of the 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.230
 destroyed life and everything 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:27.080
 no reason to live without reason 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.530
 and we are huge breeze on the of 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.320
 10 of crises we sink from us 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:37.730
 destroy everything without any reason my task 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.700
 by what is not a typical 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.770
 not as a savior typical 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.570
 web part but also just now 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.989
 from the direction skip sketch so to speak 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.660
 a little bit something creative 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.190
 Do something more in the vocal direction 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.960
 give as far as I if he hurts sketches 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:04.399
 Very often the singer has something to do 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.560
 make a head about it 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:08.450
 better than you know our future 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.359
 unfortunately not better so defend the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.799
 people what politics is doing here 

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:15.649
 responsible for many people's letters 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.030
 its only too much profit for war 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.039
 the unemployed have won 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.049
 you stay on the street 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.060
 for a feeling that the first chances 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.060
 Okay, that's what someone is looking at 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.390
 and for me out of here you give it 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.390
 ghost up 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.000
 because he wants to do it too 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.800
 believe me boy come 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.540
 Yeah, I 'm always like that 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.070
 a bit of the preference for his season 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.480
 you see yourself then did too 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.770
 so a bit in the process of development 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.570
 was there 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.710
 Of course there are others like that 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.760
 Switzerland is not exactly like all of them 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.390
 do not keep loading 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.390
 positive thinking exactly in any case 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.130
 a little later it will be hard 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.590
 Do we want the really happy kid 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.360
 at the end of existence to lose if the 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.140
 day comes perhaps has the weighting 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.700
 I would say and its consequences 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.870
 I think so just think so 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.780
 first things that I heard from him 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:26.920
 that was so i think 2003 did 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:29.620
 all very very plastic and and now 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.360
 There is a completely different direction 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.540
 already a very musical development 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.890
 it is also important for the music to have 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:44.350
 easy to say my plate 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.760
 and shit i sing on that now 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.500
 all the grepl behind me and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.990
 my way further out of the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.360
 cycle of life 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.750
 Everyone is the only one who thinks of himself 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.000
 strive not cycle the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.880
 and the end of time comes who 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.370
 Experience the cycle 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.910
 Everyone thinks only the only one 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.100
 Strive for a cycle of life and the end 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.810
 the time comes to experience 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.710
 it is thanks from rat would definitely 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.320
 stay as you are 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.990
 because that's important because that's exactly how it is 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.950
 everything originated 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:28.280
 and that you just keep it up 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.750
 like videos are trying so far and there 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.010
 always to make your connections 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.980
 important but just not the thought to 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.420
 very mainstream or so wasting 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:45.320
 but mostly works if it is 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.490
 really well received and liked to hear 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.490
 will then by itself
