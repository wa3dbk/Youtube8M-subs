00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.930
 so the next parameter which we are with you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.700
 we study this depth of field in very 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.340
 many sources can be seen 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.030
 the abbreviation which is this called mushroom 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.640
 p h ee depth sharply depicted 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.560
 spaces for greater simplicity and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.020
 speeds you can call it was 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.480
 the sharpness will be so clearer and so 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.080
 depth of field depends on three 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.230
 parameters 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.810
 the first parameter is a diaphragm 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.219
 on we have already said that what is the hole 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.200
 the more the background is forgotten better 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.899
 and in general what is depth 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.600
 sharpness is the distance in which 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.440
 drop out clear objects everything else 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.010
 before and after this distance will be 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.910
 blurred so here so that this distance 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.160
 could regulate 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.199
 we can adjust three parameters 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.480
 the first parameter is the diaphragm that is 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.899
 what is the hole open more so 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.309
 space is narrowing and subject to clear 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.250
 falls into this distance 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.800
 little space 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.290
 than we close the hole this space 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.700
 relatively stretched and clear 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.000
 items falling into this space 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.000
 more than the second parameter is 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.670
 what you need for the second parameter is 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.700
 distance to the object kara parent than 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.520
 closer we come to our subject object 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.009
 depth of field will be smaller ie 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.890
 in order to more blur the back 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.069
 plan we need to shoot a portrait to come up 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.960
 a little closer to our object and better 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.240
 so that the background is relatively 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.579
 us far in this case the background 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.369
 will erode better imagine 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.959
 situation if we remove a person on 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:55.060
 background wall next to the printer we 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:57.099
 grab both man and wall into this 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.979
 space that will be clear then 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.780
 there is no background blur 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.060
 if we leave the person to meters 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.689
 five from this wall let's go man 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.110
 close and take it off then the wall will be 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.690
 blurry yes this is the second parent distance 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.010
 before the object also affects the depth 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.260
 sharpness the closer to the object than to get 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.769
 the closer the distance to the object 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.410
 depth of field will be less and third 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.810
 parameter which depends on the sharpness and 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.160
 then focal length 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.540
 the distance we have n't we talked yet 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.639
 more detailed 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.900
 talk then when we analyze 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.930
 detail lenses 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.810
 but now you can roughly imagine what 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.160
 this is this degree of approximation after 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.350
 focal length if large 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.260
 let's say 150 204 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.790
 it means objects very close 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.130
 approach to that is, zoom 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.880
 roughly speaking and if the focal length 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.140
 small numbers are worth what 2435 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.050
 it means that they will be the opposite 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.430
 moving away from us is considered to be that focal 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.010
 distance how are we your eyes not 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.190
 perceive it 50 millimeters so here 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.380
 if the focal length is large 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.650
 will bring objects closer 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.360
 that depth of field will be less but 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.810
 all this distance is served 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.570
 clear objects will be small if 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.330
 we will reduce the focal length and 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.760
 put it some 24 millimeter 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.680
 then in this case its sharpness will be 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.740
 to increase and things that can 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.940
 it will fall within this distance 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:38.410
 more before these items will be more 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:41.350
 so three options with depth adjustment 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.230
 sharpness and we will now solve one 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.170
 puzzle 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.720
 and so now look at the screen you 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.129
 see the picture that shows 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:56.849
 two options means see we have 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.650
 house and tree and it is worth the first photographer 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.230
 option and second option they are the same 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.799
 only we change the parameters to 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.260
 camera distance from photographer to 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:12.000
 house of 10 meters and in the first and second 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.590
 the case of the diaphragm in the first case will be 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.709
 exhibited 2 and 8 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.370
 and in the second case will be equal to 8 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.620
 and the third parameter is focal 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.380
 focal length in the first variant 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.729
 the distance will be 100 what 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.699
 and in the second version will be equal to 50 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:35.639
 attention experts question where is the depth 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:39.260
 sharpness will be less or in other words 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:43.470
 where the tree will be blurred more 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:47.360
 now pause the video and 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.360
 think and answer this question 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.479
 thought answered let's figure it out 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.389
 did you answer correctly so the first 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.250
 the parameter is the distance to the object in 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.729
 first and second case they will 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:07.050
 equal 10 meters means no way 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:10.949
 will not change blurry will be a tree or 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:14.039
 more clearly the second is our aperture a 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.770
 we remember that with the discovery 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.199
 aperture the depth of field will be 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.220
 less means the tree we will have 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:26.550
 blurred more there us 2 and 8 1 option 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:29.580
 here we have 8 second variant that is 2 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.680
 and 8 is a big hole than eight means 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.860
 in the first version the tree will be blurred 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:39.630
 more the last parameter that we have 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.710
 there is this distance to objects there is no 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.380
 focal length 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.360
 i 'm wrong focal length in the first 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.460
 option is 100 in the second version this 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.139
 50 and we remember that focal length 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:54.419
 how does depth of field affect 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.169
 if we have objects closer 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:00.599
 the date is blurred in our background more 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.130
 100 and 50 if we compare something 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.409
 worth as the focal length which 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.840
 run more means a breaker on 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:10.320
 will the background mean more with us in 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.870
 the first option and the diaphragm blurs 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.000
 more background and focal length 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.469
 also blurs the background more 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.930
 therefore we have in the first version 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.060
 background 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:26.039
 the tree will break more correct 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.039
 answer option 1
