00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.530
 Hello my name is Sergey Bondarenko 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.209
 and today we will work the first phase 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.520
 such exercises as push 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.820
 classic namely taking the barbell on 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.820
 chest 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.810
 everyone knows that the push is classic 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.029
 consists of two phases 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.840
 it's taking the barbell on the chest and push 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.580
 chest bars 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.550
 then shapsugs from the chest can be performed 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.180
 both in a different way and step now we 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.580
 dwell on 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.160
 taking on the chest and analyze exercises 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.320
 which will help better movement of this 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.100
 exercise today will be taking a raid 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.810
 weightlifter groin taking on the chest from among 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.850
 hips plus from the knees plus below the knees and 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.520
 taking a barbell on his chest standing on a stand 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.129
 it eliminates such a problem 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.690
 kind of like a bully lower back and pelvis 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.550
 up at start 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.410
 Now I will show you how to exercise 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.570
 taking cleans from the groin if you 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.210
 watched the previous video about jerk there 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.170
 there is a similar exercise jerk barbell 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.880
 from the groin 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.729
 performed as well as on taxes with a jerk 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.110
 with the legs we put shoulders about 5 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.140
 centimeters someone can a little more 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:23.410
 less from the projection 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:27.220
 shoulder inside is performed with straight legs 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.220
 with a lot of scatter 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.340
 many completely straight back arched 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.340
 perform please 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.180
 also another kind of it 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.110
 exercise especially who cannot on 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.619
 first properly perform with on 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.520
 chest out bye loading backs also we 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.350
 legs apart and straight 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.729
 the broadest break the bar to him and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.080
 leaning about 30 45 degrees 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.679
 someone a little more a little less 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.740
 then powerfully back up but to the corner 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:11.250
 90 degrees relative to the floor 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.019
 that is, you cannot deflect back 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.310
 unbend again need to end if 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.450
 we will deal with the court before such a situation 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.430
 not quite until the end of it to be 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.430
 wrong will come about like this 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.930
 you are happy taking on the chest bar 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.050
 smell will let you work out 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.420
 active ending and work good 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.680
 quick care that we are still managing 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.900
 who want to show you this take 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.780
 bars on the chest and in the middle of the thigh plus 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.200
 from the knees plus below the knees I'm in my 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.600
 workouts use this exercise 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.150
 as follows that is 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.010
 we lead from the top down take from the strong 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.790
 hips for 1 from knee once below knee once 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.790
 when we get to weight 80 85 percent 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.360
 from the limit of the coward again conditionally 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.980
 plus or minus 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.600
 then three times already hard to take here 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.800
 times here 1 and here times therefore and 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.500
 leave 1 or 2 movements 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.150
 usually leaving to take from the hip plus 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.100
 lower knee better 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.340
 to work on the limit 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.170
 Approaches your weaknesses are very important 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.630
 correctly set the knees is typical 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.420
 mistake when athletes displays knees 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.340
 forward especially not experienced athlete 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.530
 knees need to be carried back loins 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.540
 bend the pelvis should be behind 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.050
 also your knees should be a little 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.540
 turned out but turned out 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.940
 they must be on the same line as the 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.790
 foot, that is, how many we have deployed 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.220
 about 20 degrees if you take from 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.440
 straight lines also knees unfolded in 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.239
 this side is about two play then 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.430
 there is if the leg is worth it as an alliance we 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.660
 turned too this too 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.160
 wrong 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:06.350
 back arched tass laid back knees 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.480
 means back loaded projection shoulders 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.610
 covers the neck projection and funny 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.430
 approximately from the project of knees we replenish 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:22.760
 then a powerful blast and go down 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:29.060
 pouch like this then 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:31.630
 performed to take and from his knees and hanging 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.630
 below the knees 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.240
 as the barbell rests on the front on 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.610
 hands then our natural center of gravity 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.729
 shifts a little forward therefore thought 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.129
 you have to try yourself on your own 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:50.189
 shift on the heels if we let u 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.020
 just hold the barbell and do nothing 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.729
 then our singularity will move forward 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.860
 you just drag us on the mask 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.699
 even with the proper setting of the shoulder and 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.919
 back and pelvis when taking the barbell on the chest 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.289
 from hanging below the knees either from the platform 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.580
 that is, from this lower phase you need 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:10.110
 put your knees back a little bit because 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.990
 that typical river mistakes we have 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.729
 either your knees stayed ahead and we 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.219
 broadest upon ourselves we stretch and touch 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:20.009
 just your knees that is to yourself for them 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:23.279
 a blow like that 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:26.009
 either the second moment is one of the typical 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:28.560
 mistakes we just circle this knees 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.810
 also disrupted the trajectory of the effort will 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.050
 not in that direction not so powerful 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.080
 You can do the following: 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.949
 we do not pull the bar over 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.460
 bully and pelvis take away your knees 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.039
 took away 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.750
 there she passes tangential knees 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:47.879
 taking the rod on the steering wheel to mid-thigh 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.969
 plus about the knee snowball tapes one of 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:53.509
 basic exercises for practicing taking 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.509
 barbell on chest 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.510
 one more exercise which than today 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:08.230
 strands are taking a barbell on your chest standing on 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:10.900
 the stand is a very common problem when 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.750
 taking the chest rips the pelvis up here 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.350
 this exercise to get it right 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.150
 make a tass have to let go below but 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.670
 help work out work exactly 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.210
 a good start is also made 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.550
 thrust 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.580
 standing on a stand but that's another 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.580
 story 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:38.849
 take the starting position back 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:42.869
 bend the pelvis is in the hall 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:45.740
 you go eat went on went 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:45.740
 from afar weights on chest 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:57.050
 management allows us to work out 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.050
 good active removal of the rod from the platform 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.080
 thank you for subscribing with us 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.940
 there will be a lot more on our channel 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.440
 interesting and next video we 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.539
 analyze the second part of the push 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.600
 classic namely push rod with 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:10.600
 chest
