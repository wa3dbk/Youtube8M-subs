00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
because of the mac address i'm assuming

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.680 
because of the mac address i'm assuming
if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.520> don't<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.760> what<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> mac<00:00:51.120> address<00:00:51.480> is

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
it's basically the profile the kind of

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.639 
it's basically the profile the kind of
that<00:00:54.090> your<00:00:54.239> computer<00:00:54.930> logs<00:00:55.199> into<00:00:55.469> the

that your computer logs into the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.680 
that your computer logs into the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
internet under at like a certain

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.270 
internet under at like a certain
location<00:00:57.809> now<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.500> my<00:00:58.649> school<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> way<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
location now at my school the way the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
location now at my school the way the
security<00:00:59.760> setup<00:01:00.120> i<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.510> sign<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
security setup i have to sign in and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.740

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
computers so basically it's like my the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.660 
computers so basically it's like my the
internet<00:01:06.600> thinks<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.010> computer

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
internet thinks that this is my computer

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
trying to get really good grades this

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.870 
trying to get really good grades this
semester<00:01:40.049> figured<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.890> could<00:01:41.070> stream<00:01:41.430> each<00:01:41.610> day

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
semester figured I could stream each day

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.120 
semester figured I could stream each day
that<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.659> upload<00:01:42.899> because<00:01:43.350> even<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
that I don't upload because even on the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.350 
that I don't upload because even on the
days<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.369> don't<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.610> what<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> play<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.149> little

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.969 
days I don't know what I play a little
bit<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.720> trying<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.049> grind<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.560> clips<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
bit just trying to grind for clips and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.260 
bit just trying to grind for clips and
stuff<00:01:47.159> figured<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.549> it'd<00:01:47.759> be<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> good<00:01:48.090> way<00:01:48.149> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
stuff figured out it'd be a good way to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.850 
stuff figured out it'd be a good way to
maintain<00:01:48.659> activity<00:01:49.320> I'm<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.649> going<00:01:49.829> to
