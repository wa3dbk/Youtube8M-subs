Shannon manages energy more effectively
is<00:01:48.360> by<00:01:48.479> adding<00:01:48.720> energy<00:01:49.020> restoration<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.829> key

therefore<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.750> Shen<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.619> there<00:02:01.829> and

we make it so that she can't have
infinite<00:03:16.440> mana<00:03:16.590> anymore<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.250> therefore

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
actually meaningful the upside to this

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.820 
actually meaningful the upside to this
is<00:03:21.209> that<00:03:21.330> infuse<00:03:21.720> now<00:03:21.870> restores<00:03:22.290> more<00:03:22.590> mana

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
is that infuse now restores more mana
