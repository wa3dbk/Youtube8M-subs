00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
tall creation I made this is potentially

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.700 
tall creation I made this is potentially
the<00:00:16.890> endless<00:00:17.279> stairs<00:00:17.750> from<00:00:18.750> super<00:00:19.170> mario<00:00:19.470> 64

the endless stairs from super mario 64
game<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> lot<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.150> out<00:00:21.300> there<00:00:21.330> probably

game a lot of you out there probably
know<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.939> I<00:00:23.939> recreated<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.779> Minecraft<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.890> you

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
know and I recreated in Minecraft as you

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.660 
know and I recreated in Minecraft as you
can<00:00:26.910> see<00:00:27.180> will<00:00:27.570> walk<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.990> here<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.670> suddenly

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
can see will walk up here and suddenly

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.700 
can see will walk up here and suddenly
we<00:00:29.849> can't<00:00:30.090> see<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.720> kind<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:30.990> goes<00:00:31.170> dark<00:00:31.500> like

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
we can't see it kind of goes dark like

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.860 
we can't see it kind of goes dark like
it<00:00:31.859> did<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.009> Super<00:00:32.369> Mario<00:00:32.550> 64<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.590> see

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
it did on Super Mario 64 as you can see

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.110 
it did on Super Mario 64 as you can see
we<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.739> anytime<00:00:38.100> soon<00:00:41.120> and

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
we are not going up anytime soon and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.049 
we are not going up anytime soon and
just<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.320> game<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:44.040> go<00:00:44.190> back<00:00:44.370> down<00:00:44.730> it's

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
just like the game we go back down it's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.900 
just like the game we go back down it's
like<00:00:45.149> nothing<00:00:45.750> even<00:00:45.930> happened<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.920> only<00:00:47.730> have

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
like nothing even happened I only have

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
like nothing even happened I only have
the<00:00:48.000> milk<00:00:48.210> bucket<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.840> inventory<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the milk bucket in my inventory so that

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.650 
the milk bucket in my inventory so that
I<00:00:50.789> could<00:00:51.480> get<00:00:51.629> rid<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.100> actually

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
I could get rid of this this is actually

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.709 
I could get rid of this this is actually
this<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.899> bunch<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.350> redstone<00:00:55.680> leading<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
this is a bunch of redstone leading to a

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.119 
this is a bunch of redstone leading to a
blindness<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.289> effect<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.879> blindness<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:01.129> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
blindness to effect the blindness to is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
blindness to effect the blindness to is
what<00:01:02.340> dark<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> carrion<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.270> should<00:01:03.510> have

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
what dark is the carrion I should have

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.270 
what dark is the carrion I should have
made<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.960> blindness<00:01:04.409> one<00:01:04.650> because<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.100> can

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
made it a blindness one because you can

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.640 
made it a blindness one because you can
hardly<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.700> anything<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.810> actually<00:01:07.229> like

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
hardly see anything but I actually like

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
hardly see anything but I actually like
the<00:01:07.860> result<00:01:08.220> better<00:01:09.830> uh<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.630> main

feed the beast you have no idea how much

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.469 
feed the beast you have no idea how much
of<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:29.970> I've<00:01:30.090> been<00:01:30.240> playing<00:01:30.570> recently<00:01:32.479> it's

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
of it I've been playing recently it's

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.010 
of it I've been playing recently it's
kind<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.840> laggy<00:01:34.170> right<00:01:34.380> now<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> don't<00:01:35.189> know<00:01:35.520> why

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
kind of laggy right now I don't know why

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
kind of laggy right now I don't know why
especially<00:01:37.020> since<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.799> all<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> high

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
especially since I have all the high

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
especially since I have all the high
performance<00:01:39.119> settings<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.869> because

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
performance settings on it's because

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.270 
performance settings on it's because
we're<00:01:40.320> far<00:01:40.590> away<00:01:41.990> basically<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.740> isn't<00:01:44.220> a

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
we're far away basically this isn't a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.940 
we're far away basically this isn't a
little<00:01:44.460> repeater<00:01:45.030> clock<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
little repeater clock as you can see it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.010 
little repeater clock as you can see it
teleported<00:01:47.670> me<00:01:47.700> away<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.299> teleports<00:01:48.899> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
teleported me away this teleports you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.980 
teleported me away this teleports you
like<00:01:49.409> four<00:01:50.189> blocks<00:01:50.399> down<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.659> four<00:01:52.649> blocks

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
like four blocks down and four blocks

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.810 
like four blocks down and four blocks
this<00:01:54.990> way<00:01:55.380> which<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.340> believe

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.080 

that<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.950> those<00:02:02.950> are<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.240> x-coordinates

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
that is the those are the x-coordinates

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.969 
that is the those are the x-coordinates
basically<00:02:07.090> for<00:02:07.480> down<00:02:07.930> on<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.259> y-coordinates

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
basically for down on the y-coordinates

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.470 
basically for down on the y-coordinates
for<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:10.140> guess<00:02:11.140> backwards<00:02:11.920> on<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.790> negative

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
for I guess backwards on the negative

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.470 
for I guess backwards on the negative
coordinates<00:02:14.220> which<00:02:15.220> depending<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:16.060> which<00:02:16.300> the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
coordinates which depending on which the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.210 
coordinates which depending on which the
what<00:02:16.810> way<00:02:16.960> this<00:02:17.170> based<00:02:17.500> I'd<00:02:17.830> have<00:02:18.040> to

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
what way this based I'd have to

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.380 
what way this based I'd have to
configure<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.820> differently

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
configure it differently

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.190 
configure it differently
basically<00:02:20.320> it<00:02:20.500> teleports<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.130> four<00:02:21.490> blocks

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
basically it teleports you four blocks

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.660 
basically it teleports you four blocks
backwards<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.470> four<00:02:23.770> blocks<00:02:24.040> down<00:02:24.160> from<00:02:24.550> your

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
backwards and four blocks down from your

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.000 
backwards and four blocks down from your
current<00:02:24.970> position<00:02:28.200> let<00:02:29.200> me<00:02:29.320> just<00:02:29.560> see<00:02:29.740> if<00:02:29.890> I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
current position let me just see if I

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.710 
current position let me just see if I
can<00:02:30.040> get<00:02:30.340> close<00:02:30.820> enough<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:34.270> can<00:02:34.450> trick

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
can get close enough to I you can trick

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.780 
can get close enough to I you can trick

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
just show you the okay this is saw step

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.670 
just show you the okay this is saw step
this<00:02:43.270> is<00:02:43.450> simple<00:02:44.310> slash<00:02:45.310> test<00:02:45.640> for<00:02:45.940> at<00:02:46.180> P

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
this is simple slash test for at P

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.820 
this is simple slash test for at P
radius<00:02:47.680> equals<00:02:48.040> nine

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.340 

now<00:02:52.370> if<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:52.670> want<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.180> really<00:02:53.660> hide<00:02:53.990> these

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
now if you want to really hide these

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.190 
now if you want to really hide these
command<00:02:54.740> blocks<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.430> could<00:02:55.640> like<00:02:55.900> go<00:02:56.900> crazy

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
command blocks you could like go crazy

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.530 
command blocks you could like go crazy
technical<00:02:57.920> but<00:02:58.100> that<00:02:58.520> never<00:02:58.730> works<00:02:59.060> for<00:02:59.240> me

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
technical but that never works for me

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.610 
technical but that never works for me
but<00:03:00.050> this<00:03:00.260> does<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:01.360> by<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.420> way<00:03:02.600> this<00:03:05.350> has<00:03:06.350> to

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
but this does and by the way this has to

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.380 
but this does and by the way this has to
be<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.800> repeater<00:03:07.280> clock<00:03:07.670> if<00:03:07.850> you<00:03:07.940> want<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.210> try

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
be a repeater clock if you want to try

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.800 
be a repeater clock if you want to try
and<00:03:08.570> build<00:03:08.990> this<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:10.510> these<00:03:11.510> are<00:03:11.690> the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
and build this and these are the

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.740 
and build this and these are the
teleportation<00:03:12.470> things<00:03:13.010> see<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:14.300> X<00:03:14.510> is

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
teleportation things see the X is

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.660 
teleportation things see the X is
negative<00:03:15.140> for<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.530> Y<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.710> negative<00:03:16.040> for

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
negative for the Y is negative for

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.850 
negative for the Y is negative for
I<00:03:16.700> let<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.120> Z<00:03:17.300> alone<00:03:17.540> just<00:03:17.870> left<00:03:18.050> at<00:03:18.170> 0<00:03:18.530> and

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
I let the Z alone just left at 0 and

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.800 
I let the Z alone just left at 0 and
this<00:03:19.400> little<00:03:19.670> squiggly<00:03:20.150> line<00:03:20.390> basically

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
this little squiggly line basically

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.130 
this little squiggly line basically
means<00:03:21.460> from<00:03:22.460> the<00:03:22.610> relative<00:03:23.390> position<00:03:23.930> you're

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
means from the relative position you're

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.990 
means from the relative position you're
at<00:03:25.720> that's<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:28.100> is<00:03:28.130> it<00:03:30.220> well<00:03:31.220> thank<00:03:31.880> you
