00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.570
 psv has played 58 times 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.650
 competition in the cockpit 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.000
 Rotterdam 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.070
 the victory went to ten times 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.420
 eindhoven the cap ended twenty times 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.150
 undecided 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 last season lost PSV with three one 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 if he really adam the adam people 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.490
 well ahead there is but that 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.220
 is good but it's in it 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.220
 [Applause] 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.960
 earlier this season, PSV won in Eindhoven 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.060
 in a crazy match with 4 3 of 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.220
 feyenoord now the boy scored three times 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.110
 but the winning goal only came in 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.110
 injury time yes 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.820
 and with that psv gets the chance to go for it 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.550
 both duels in one for the first time since 2008 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.020
 season of the rotterdammers 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.910
 but that wo n't be the easy one 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.380
 last time that psv in the map of 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.050
 feyenoord managed to win is already five 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.400
 seasons ago on September 20, 2009 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.780
 psv won with three an argument while this one 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.600
 journey to that cake band those two 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.310
 material for such a set with koevermans 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.920
 would score him again 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.660
 just like otman bakkal for the largest 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.440
 We must win PSV in the cockpit 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:27.070
 many years back on January 27, 1980 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:32.710
 over 35 years ago , psv won with 3 0 with 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.040
 had three hits from postuma post on 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.750
 you 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.030
 [Applause] 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.820
 almost thirty players has one 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.350
 past at both feyenoord and psv 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.090
 the three that we really have this week 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.700
 highlighting is not the least 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.590
 ruud gullit defend nielsen and 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.550
 Ronald Koeman who also as 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.960
 trainer at both clubs 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.700
 georginio wijnaldum obviously has one 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.680
 past at feyenoord and he is 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.360
 currently with 10 goals not only 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 the most accurate supplier of all 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.450
 premier league teams 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.240
 if wine balance scores this season wins 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.160
 psv so far at least 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.750
 [Music] 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.250
 willy van der kuijlen is top scoring in 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.250
 duels between psv and feyenoord 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.320
 exchange it so that in the language against 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.630
 do feyenoord 12 times 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.470
 this is the score after round 27 in the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.720
 Premier League 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.730
 we find feyenoord in place 3 rd 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.489
 team of old PSV coach Fred Rutten 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.280
 collected 51 points so far 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.260
 few 19 less than PSV and as PSV 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.489
 Sunday is at least the same 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.410
 no longer traceable by the 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.820
 Rotterdam residents and therefore already assured of 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.870
 a place in the preliminary round of the djembe 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.280
 sleek 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.380
