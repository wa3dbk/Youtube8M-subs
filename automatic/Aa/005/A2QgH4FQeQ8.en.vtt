00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.799 
about something I recently bought now
obviously<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.790> not<00:00:08.820> an<00:00:09.090> unboxing<00:00:09.420> video

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
obviously this is not an unboxing video

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.009 
obviously this is not an unboxing video
I've<00:00:10.260> already<00:00:11.000> unboxed<00:00:12.000> this<00:00:12.420> product<00:00:12.929> I

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
I've already unboxed this product I

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.230 
I've already unboxed this product I
actually<00:00:13.259> needed<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.830> use<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.190> really<00:00:15.000> badly

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
actually needed to use it really badly

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.760 
actually needed to use it really badly
and<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:15.929> top<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.470> would<00:00:16.560> have<00:00:16.650> been

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and on top of that it would have been

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.320 
and on top of that it would have been
really<00:00:17.010> clunky<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.490> try<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:17.850> pull<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.119> out<00:00:18.180> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
really clunky to try and pull it out of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.870 
really clunky to try and pull it out of
the<00:00:18.390> box<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.810> camera<00:00:19.380> because<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.550> huge

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the box on camera because it's so huge

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.019 
the box on camera because it's so huge
but<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.439> course<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:23.029> multifunction

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
but it is of course a multifunction

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.390 
but it is of course a multifunction

so many of them now

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.030 
so many of them now
you<00:00:36.420> know<00:00:36.510> they're<00:00:36.690> practically<00:00:37.230> disposable

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040

the<00:00:38.190> quality<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.850> normally<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.570> crap<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.170> terms

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the quality is normally so crap in terms

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.920 
the quality is normally so crap in terms
of<00:00:40.620> construction<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.180> decided<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.840> know

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
of construction that I decided you know

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.440 
of construction that I decided you know
what<00:00:43.050> it's<00:00:43.860> time<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.340> some<00:00:44.670> some<00:00:45.030> decent

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
what it's time to get some some decent

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.720 
what it's time to get some some decent
quality<00:00:45.570> spend<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.200> few<00:00:46.350> bucks<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.700> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
quality spend a few bucks on one that I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.459 
quality spend a few bucks on one that I
can<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> little<00:00:48.510> while<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.200> I'm

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
can have for a little while and I'm

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.740 
can have for a little while and I'm
hoping<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.420> until

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
hoping that this can be the one up until

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.869 
hoping that this can be the one up until
this<00:00:51.870> point<00:00:51.960> I'm<00:00:52.469> pretty<00:00:53.039> happy<00:00:53.340> with<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.760> of

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
this point I'm pretty happy with it of

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.970 
this point I'm pretty happy with it of
course<00:00:54.090> I've<00:00:54.570> only<00:00:54.750> used<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.289> for<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.800> couple

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
course I've only used it for a couple

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.700 
course I've only used it for a couple
days<00:00:56.370> now<00:00:56.670> I've<00:00:57.629> done<00:00:57.840> quite<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.469> bit<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
days now I've done quite a bit of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.170 
days now I've done quite a bit of
scanning<00:00:58.949> probably<00:00:59.399> more<00:00:59.520> scanning<00:01:00.030> than

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
scanning probably more scanning than

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.770 
scanning probably more scanning than
printing<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.320> been<00:01:01.500> really<00:01:02.039> convenient

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
printing and it's been really convenient

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.700 
printing and it's been really convenient
mostly<00:01:03.780> because<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.470> wireless

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
mostly because of the wireless

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.149 
mostly because of the wireless
functionality<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.790> how<00:01:06.140> easy<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.409> was<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.650> set

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
functionality and how easy it was to set

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.320 
functionality and how easy it was to set

that and boom straight away I can start

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.719 
that and boom straight away I can start
scanning<00:03:37.169> documents<00:03:37.340> whether<00:03:38.340> they<00:03:38.669> be

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
scanning documents whether they be

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.830 
scanning documents whether they be
individual<00:03:39.569> or<00:03:40.129> a<00:03:41.129> bunch<00:03:41.879> of<00:03:42.060> pages<00:03:42.299> together

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
individual or a bunch of pages together

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.589 
individual or a bunch of pages together
this<00:03:43.650> will<00:03:43.799> actually<00:03:43.979> do<00:03:44.250> up<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.609> 30<00:03:44.879> pages<00:03:45.180> in

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
this will actually do up to 30 pages in

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.929 
this will actually do up to 30 pages in
the<00:03:45.750> document<00:03:45.930> feeder<00:03:46.439> and<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.519> probably

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:47.939 
the document feeder and this is probably

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.670 
the document feeder and this is probably
my<00:03:48.419> favorite<00:03:48.449> feature<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.290> know<00:03:49.409> it's

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
my favorite feature I know it's

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.679 
my favorite feature I know it's
superficial<00:03:50.430> but<00:03:50.939> a<00:03:51.000> lot<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.329> these<00:03:51.419> things

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
superficial but a lot of these things

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.839 
superficial but a lot of these things
are<00:03:51.840> really<00:03:52.169> ugly<00:03:52.349> these<00:03:53.040> multi<00:03:53.400> functions

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
are really ugly these multi functions

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.119 
are really ugly these multi functions
and<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.090> one<00:03:54.389> I<00:03:54.629> don't<00:03:55.290> think<00:03:55.530> so<00:03:55.739> because

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
and this one I don't think so because

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.099 
and this one I don't think so because
you<00:03:56.370> got<00:03:56.489> this<00:03:56.609> nice<00:03:56.909> sort<00:03:57.569> of<00:03:57.720> curve<00:03:57.959> along

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
you got this nice sort of curve along

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.849 
you got this nice sort of curve along
top<00:03:58.560> here<00:03:58.949> and<00:03:59.099> it<00:04:00.030> sort<00:04:00.389> of<00:04:00.449> hides<00:04:00.859> the

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
top here and it sort of hides the

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.429 
top here and it sort of hides the
document<00:04:02.729> feeder<00:04:02.909> if<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.659> look<00:04:03.810> up<00:04:03.930> top<00:04:03.959> here

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
document feeder if you look up top here

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.259 
document feeder if you look up top here
you're<00:04:05.189> probably<00:04:05.400> wondering<00:04:05.909> where<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.120> hell

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
you're probably wondering where the hell

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.509 
you're probably wondering where the hell
did<00:04:06.359> a<00:04:06.419> pages<00:04:06.900> go<00:04:07.079> right<00:04:07.409> well<00:04:07.949> you<00:04:08.129> flip<00:04:08.370> up

if I can give you a quick look around
back<00:05:21.020> you've<00:05:22.020> obviously<00:05:22.140> got<00:05:22.470> a<00:05:22.530> flatbed

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
back you've obviously got a flatbed

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.930 
back you've obviously got a flatbed
scanner<00:05:23.100> as<00:05:23.670> well<00:05:24.110> built<00:05:25.110> in<00:05:25.350> and<00:05:25.620> then<00:05:26.280> your

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
scanner as well built in and then your

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.250 
scanner as well built in and then your
different<00:05:27.270> ports<00:05:27.540> and<00:05:27.690> whatnot<00:05:27.930> are<00:05:28.050> over

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
different ports and whatnot are over

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.200 
different ports and whatnot are over
here<00:05:28.530> so<00:05:29.220> you<00:05:29.250> got<00:05:29.580> you<00:05:29.880> know<00:05:30.000> regular

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
here so you got you know regular

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.990 
here so you got you know regular
Ethernet<00:05:30.810> if<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:31.020> choose<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.440> use<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.650> I<00:05:32.400> think

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
Ethernet if you choose to use it I think

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.160 
Ethernet if you choose to use it I think
it<00:05:33.060> has<00:05:33.180> a<00:05:33.210> fax<00:05:33.600> built-in

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
it has a fax built-in

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.560 
it has a fax built-in
-<00:05:34.320> yeah<00:05:34.500> it<00:05:34.620> does<00:05:34.830> not<00:05:35.670> that<00:05:35.820> anyone<00:05:36.090> uses<00:05:36.390> that

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
- yeah it does not that anyone uses that

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.740 
- yeah it does not that anyone uses that
anymore<00:05:36.780> and<00:05:37.050> of<00:05:37.110> course<00:05:37.350> regular<00:05:38.310> USB<00:05:39.150> so

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
anymore and of course regular USB so

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.870 
anymore and of course regular USB so
anyway<00:05:40.140> as<00:05:40.320> you<00:05:40.410> guys<00:05:40.530> can<00:05:40.710> tell<00:05:40.860> it's<00:05:41.640> hard<00:05:41.820> to

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
anyway as you guys can tell it's hard to

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.300 
anyway as you guys can tell it's hard to
get<00:05:42.000> excited<00:05:42.270> about<00:05:42.600> a<00:05:43.260> multi-function<00:05:44.010> but<00:05:44.280> I

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310
