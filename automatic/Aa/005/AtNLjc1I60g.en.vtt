00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.260 

once<00:02:23.560> they're<00:02:23.740> back<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.100> their<00:02:24.250> snow<00:02:24.550> they're

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
once they're back in their snow they're

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.500 
once they're back in their snow they're
not<00:02:25.420> going<00:02:25.660> anywhere<00:02:26.100> they're<00:02:27.100> upright<00:02:27.510> easy

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
not going anywhere they're upright easy

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.650 
not going anywhere they're upright easy
to<00:02:28.720> find<00:02:28.960> easy<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.500> keep<00:02:29.680> track<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:31.510> also

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
to find easy to keep track of and I also

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.840 
to find easy to keep track of and I also
found<00:02:32.140> out<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:33.280> milk<00:02:33.490> crate<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:33.790> a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
found out that the milk crate is a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.540 
found out that the milk crate is a
perfect<00:02:34.270> size<00:02:34.450> for<00:02:34.480> my<00:02:35.050> camera<00:02:35.430> right<00:02:36.430> there

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
perfect size for my camera right there

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.740 
perfect size for my camera right there
and<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.690> flasher<00:02:38.140> goes<00:02:38.320> right<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.650> top

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
and then the flasher goes right on top

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.350 
and then the flasher goes right on top
so<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:40.870> actually<00:02:41.080> going<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.440> maximize<00:02:41.800> space

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
so it's actually going to maximize space

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.990 
so it's actually going to maximize space
in<00:02:43.360> my<00:02:43.630> sled<00:02:43.990> because<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.440> always<00:02:44.940> would<00:02:45.940> have

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
in my sled because I always would have

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.810 
in my sled because I always would have
these<00:02:46.680> sitting<00:02:47.680> next<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.950> each<00:02:48.070> other<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.820> so

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
these sitting next to each other and so

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.000 
these sitting next to each other and so
now<00:02:52.050> everything<00:02:53.050> is<00:02:53.140> compact<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:55.570> know<00:02:55.690> I

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
now everything is compact and you know I

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.710 
now everything is compact and you know I
can<00:02:57.010> put<00:02:57.190> my<00:02:57.310> creepers<00:02:57.700> down<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.120> side<00:02:58.330> or

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
can put my creepers down the side or

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.680 
can put my creepers down the side or
pair<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.470> gloves<00:02:59.710> or<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.460> lot<00:03:01.270> of<00:03:01.300> things<00:03:01.570> I

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
pair of gloves or a lot of things I

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.060 
pair of gloves or a lot of things I
could<00:03:01.840> probably<00:03:02.050> fit<00:03:02.320> in<00:03:02.350> there<00:03:02.560> if<00:03:02.680> I<00:03:02.770> wanted

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
could probably fit in there if I wanted

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.330 
could probably fit in there if I wanted
to<00:03:03.150> for<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.240> set<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:06.720> little<00:03:07.720> setup

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
to for that set a little setup

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.670 
to for that set a little setup
customized<00:03:09.780> I'm<00:03:10.780> going<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.110> take<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.410> out<00:03:11.500> and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
customized I'm going to take it out and
