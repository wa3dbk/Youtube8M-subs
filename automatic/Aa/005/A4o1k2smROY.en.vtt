00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.679
 hello let's make a bracelet with 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.630
 cardboard and yarn or wool and I will use 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:14.290
 this thing that was halfway there are like 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.030
 a kind of the thick ones well I 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.670
 I'm using a cord a cardboard that 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.019
 I already had but you can cut it 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.820
 size of the wrist and a little 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.900
 rounded tips and before I got 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.699
 forget that you have to do some 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.920
 Holes at each end to achieve 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.320
 the strands that will be used to tie 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.699
 the tail bracelet as you have put a 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.310
 little stick glue for both 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.680
 sides 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.090
 Now I take the end of the thread and start 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.890
 to roll up so that I have a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.370
 thread pegadito the other leaving no 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.079
 white hole 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.059
 I'm going to do it in various colors 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.260
 two I'm going to do a centimeter 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.539
 centimeter and a half of each color 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.129
 when I finish short and I hit the part 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.809
 from behind on the same side where started 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.309
 so that all the cut strands we 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.660
 remain in the same part in the part of 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.670
 behind 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 I'm going with the next color in this case 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.770
 the green as you see in the back 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.510
 I hit the little bit the ideal is to leave the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.519
 strand a little rotated so that in the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.490
 first round I caught her moss and left 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.930
 also subject I do not know if I explain it to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.930
 see if I show you a little bit better 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.990
 I'm still 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.060
 short so that it is in the part of 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.790
 back and I put it diagonally this I want 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.759
 say now when I do the following that 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.730
 court is going to be pressured by the 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.680
 next turns of thread 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.030
 Well, I'm reaching the end and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.870
 then I'm going to stop right before 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.450
 get to the little hole 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.840
 short I make the same system the same 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.840
 process 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.820
 and as I say I was just pegadito al 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.780
 hole now what will I do then 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.700
 Well, I'm going to continue with the same 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.020
 thread with the same color at the ends 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.580
 and what I'm going to do is to be able to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.990
 go through the hole so you do not 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.900
 I opened it put a little bit of zeal 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.450
 at the tip 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.680
 so it's a kind of needle you see 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.340
 this is easier, if not almost impossible 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.380
 pass and so on and now let's go as 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.770
 if we were sewing he came to the 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.840
 final I do the same I paste the last part 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.399
 in the cardboard in the back and 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.130
 now as if we were sewing a 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.540
 Step button and adjusted again happen in 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.060
 this case I'm going to do it from below 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.640
 above it went under it stretched and I leave 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.340
 milito stuck to the previous one so all the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.530
 little while 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.590
 all the time we go turning spinning up 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.870
 cover the entire rounded part 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.310
 I think the process is very similar to 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.620
 sew a button 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.940
 and when I reach the end do not cut 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.440
 because you have to leave a long piece 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.380
 so that it can be used to tie the bracelet 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.090
 to the wrist 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.530
 and I'm going to do the same thing on the other side 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.420
 with the same color so that I stayed 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.920
 symmetric here already in taste the colors 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.050
 You can make it all the same color 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.690
 a kind of rainbow or a flag 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.190
 for example flag of spain or the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.420
 ikurriÃ±a what you want that of your 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.920
 country 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.920
 Well, here I do the same 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.460
 I'm passing the threads that send you 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.590
 juntitos every time is more difficult because 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.640
 the hole will fill and it will be every 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.380
 smaller time 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.500
 you can expand it a little bit with a 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.480
 ballpoint pen for example 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.490
 Well, I have my bracelet here 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.190
 all the feet all the cuts in the 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.990
 back so you can not see each other 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.610
 and now I just cut to size 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.380
 that you need and I'm going to tie a knot in 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.570
 the end so that we do not open 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.830
 threads do not let go if you have any 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.450
 bracelet closure you can also 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.860
 I just put my'll give to 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.290
 a good knot in this case I'm going to 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.250
 give to daniela that she is so happy with 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.250
 Your bracelet is new
