in<00:02:16.049> terms<00:02:16.200> for<00:02:16.530> domination<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.220> I'm<00:02:17.280> typically

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
in terms for domination so I'm typically

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.699 
in terms for domination so I'm typically
a<00:02:17.670> domination<00:02:18.120> player<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.659> that<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.530> map

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
a domination player is that the map

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.800 
a domination player is that the map
itself<00:02:19.920> has<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.400> triangle<00:02:21.000> pattern<00:02:21.150> when<00:02:21.720> it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
itself has a triangle pattern when it

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.570 
itself has a triangle pattern when it
comes<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.319> flag<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.040> think<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.340> most

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
comes to the flag so you think of most

man<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.120> essentially<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.840> guess<00:02:43.379> that's<00:02:43.530> a

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
man so essentially I guess that's a

triangle<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.129> very<00:02:44.370> close<00:02:44.670> bna<00:02:45.180> or<00:02:45.329> very

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
triangle it's very close bna or very

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.050 
triangle it's very close bna or very
close<00:02:45.660> together<00:02:46.160> there's<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.310> walkway<00:02:47.609> that

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
close together there's this walkway that

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.089 
close together there's this walkway that
I've<00:02:48.180> just<00:02:48.329> died<00:02:48.569> in<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.959> kind<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.799> connects

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
I've just died in that kind of connects

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.500 
I've just died in that kind of connects
the<00:02:50.220> two<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:50.609> those<00:02:50.819> two<00:02:51.000> can<00:02:51.209> go<00:02:51.269> back<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the two so those two can go back and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.759 
the two so those two can go back and
forth<00:02:51.900> back<00:02:52.049> and<00:02:52.079> forth<00:02:52.260> try<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.650> take<00:02:52.739> the
