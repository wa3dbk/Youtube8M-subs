I'm going to slap in an integrated video
card<00:01:58.040> or<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.220> one<00:01:59.640> included<00:02:00.060> obviously<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
card or the one included obviously and

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.650 
card or the one included obviously and
that's<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> geforce<00:02:01.650> 6100<00:02:02.370> here<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.479> frame

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
that's the geforce 6100 here the frame

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.060 
that's the geforce 6100 here the frame
rates<00:02:03.870> are<00:02:03.990> only<00:02:04.110> five<00:02:04.350> frames<00:02:04.530> per<00:02:04.710> second

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
rates are only five frames per second

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.280 
rates are only five frames per second
and<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.520> graphics<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.000> resolutions<00:02:06.750> are<00:02:06.930> set

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and the graphics and resolutions are set

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.100 
and the graphics and resolutions are set
to<00:02:07.380> lowest<00:02:08.270> so<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.420> pretty<00:02:09.600> clear<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
to lowest so it's pretty clear that the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.450 
to lowest so it's pretty clear that the
integrated<00:02:10.500> graphics<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:11.040> that<00:02:11.250> computer

integrated graphics in that computer

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.600 
integrated graphics in that computer
were<00:02:11.670> not<00:02:11.850> fast<00:02:12.180> enough<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:14.160> play<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.460> game

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
were not fast enough to play the game

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.080 
were not fast enough to play the game
now<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.660> just<00:02:16.470> want<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.800> show<00:02:16.950> you<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.910> in-game

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
now I just want to show you the in-game

plugging about 10 frames per second with

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
so to sum things back up we first looked

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.660 
so to sum things back up we first looked
at<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.500> computer<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:31.920> had<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> quad<00:02:32.400> core

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
graphics quality settings and get 45

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.810

on<00:06:39.130> starcraft<00:06:39.550> 2<00:06:39.850> i<00:06:40.030> did<00:06:40.720> play<00:06:40.900> through<00:06:41.110> the

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
on starcraft 2 i did play through the

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.930 
on starcraft 2 i did play through the
single-player<00:06:41.560> campaign<00:06:42.130> and<00:06:42.550> I<00:06:42.670> thought<00:06:42.820> it

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
single-player campaign and I thought it

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.850 
single-player campaign and I thought it
was<00:06:43.000> actually<00:06:43.360> pretty<00:06:43.390> good<00:06:43.720> the<00:06:44.560> ending<00:06:44.770> of

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
was actually pretty good the ending of

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.740 
was actually pretty good the ending of
the<00:06:44.920> game<00:06:44.950> was<00:06:45.250> actually<00:06:45.880> where<00:06:46.510> I<00:06:46.540> had<00:06:46.630> the

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
the game was actually where I had the

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.690 
the game was actually where I had the
most<00:06:46.900> fun<00:06:47.290> I<00:06:47.500> thought<00:06:48.250> they<00:06:48.400> could<00:06:48.610> have

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
most fun I thought they could have

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.400 
most fun I thought they could have
pushed<00:06:48.970> a<00:06:49.180> little<00:06:49.300> bit<00:06:49.480> more<00:06:49.690> not<00:06:49.930> everything

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
pushed a little bit more not everything

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.580 
pushed a little bit more not everything
was<00:06:50.620> as<00:06:51.490> spectacular<00:06:51.850> as<00:06:52.360> I<00:06:52.510> hoped<00:06:52.780> in<00:06:53.020> terms

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
was as spectacular as I hoped in terms

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.710 
was as spectacular as I hoped in terms
of<00:06:53.680> graphics<00:06:53.890> but<00:06:54.340> if<00:06:55.330> they<00:06:55.420> made<00:06:55.570> it<00:06:55.660> the

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
of graphics but if they made it the

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.330 
of graphics but if they made it the
graphics<00:06:55.870> any<00:06:56.200> more<00:06:56.500> intense<00:06:56.800> you<00:06:57.070> would<00:06:57.220> not

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
graphics any more intense you would not

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.370 
graphics any more intense you would not
have<00:06:57.490> been<00:06:57.580> able<00:06:57.640> to<00:06:57.820> play<00:06:57.970> that<00:06:58.210> came<00:06:58.420> on<00:06:58.660> most

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
have been able to play that came on most

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.910 
have been able to play that came on most
average<00:06:59.710> computers<00:07:00.370> so<00:07:01.320> it's<00:07:02.320> not<00:07:02.440> so<00:07:02.680> bad<00:07:02.860> I

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:02.920 
average computers so it's not so bad I

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.730 
average computers so it's not so bad I
guess<00:07:03.540> most<00:07:04.540> my<00:07:04.660> friends<00:07:04.840> have<00:07:05.110> starcraft<00:07:05.350> 2

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
guess most my friends have starcraft 2

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.140 
guess most my friends have starcraft 2
now<00:07:05.890> which<00:07:06.010> is<00:07:06.040> pretty<00:07:06.280> awesome<00:07:06.490> i<00:07:06.730> can<00:07:06.880> play

dollars at getting a popular game that
still<00:07:18.280> was<00:07:18.460> just<00:07:19.210> as<00:07:19.330> much<00:07:19.510> fun<00:07:19.750> as<00:07:19.900> starcraft

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.350 
still was just as much fun as starcraft

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.250 
still was just as much fun as starcraft
one<00:07:21.360> probably<00:07:22.360> even<00:07:22.450> a<00:07:22.630> little<00:07:22.750> more<00:07:23.020> fun

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:23.260 
one probably even a little more fun

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.200 
one probably even a little more fun
because<00:07:23.740> they<00:07:24.070> did<00:07:24.250> update<00:07:24.520> everything<00:07:24.970> now
