faith mote move Anna he's got he's got
some<00:00:56.789> upgrade<00:00:57.149> our<00:00:57.360> nose<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.809> something

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
some upgrade our nose this is something

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
some upgrade our nose this is something
called<00:00:58.289> her<00:00:58.469> II<00:00:58.739> got<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.640> eagle<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.660> is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
called her II got was it eagle so it is

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.689 
called her II got was it eagle so it is
but<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:02.070> those<00:01:02.160> objectives

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
but it's like one of those objectives

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.880 
but it's like one of those objectives
things<00:01:03.149> was<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> eagle<00:01:05.960> evil<00:01:06.960> node<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.439> think<00:01:07.650> he

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
things was it eagle evil node I think he

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.890 
things was it eagle evil node I think he
said<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.310> early<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.540> basically<00:01:09.780> that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
said it was early so basically that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.359 
said it was early so basically that
allows<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.290> do<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> whole<00:01:10.979> team<00:01:11.189> I

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
allows you to do for the whole team I

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.250 
allows you to do for the whole team I
think<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.420> really<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.750> cool<00:01:12.960> other

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
think which is really really cool other

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.660 
think which is really really cool other
guard<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.650> walk<00:01:13.830> past<00:01:14.100> obviously<00:01:14.490> got<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
guard here walk past obviously got the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.240 
guard here walk past obviously got the
hay<00:01:14.880> bale<00:01:15.150> assassination<00:01:15.920> which<00:01:16.920> are<00:01:17.070> really

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
hay bale assassination which are really

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.800 
hay bale assassination which are really
really<00:01:17.400> cool<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.729> hay<00:01:17.880> bales<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.450> look<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> bit

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
really cool the hay bales do look a bit

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.330 
really cool the hay bales do look a bit
out<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.110> place<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.799> do<00:01:19.860> think<00:01:20.189> like

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
out of place in this I do think like

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.859 
out of place in this I do think like
something<00:01:20.610> about<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.060> hay<00:01:21.180> bales<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.540> unity

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
something about the hay bales and unity

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.830 
something about the hay bales and unity
kind<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.110> look<00:01:22.580> slightly<00:01:23.580> unrealistic<00:01:24.270> but

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
kind of look slightly unrealistic but

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.420 
kind of look slightly unrealistic but
obviously<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.920> difficult<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.250> do

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
obviously it's really difficult to do

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.640 
obviously it's really difficult to do
hey<00:01:26.670> without<00:01:27.390> allowing<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.869> use<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.380> hell

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
hey without allowing to use like a hell

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.649 
hey without allowing to use like a hell
of<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.799> lot<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> consoles<00:01:30.119> power<00:01:30.360> because

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
of a lot like the consoles power because

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.520 
of a lot like the consoles power because
it's<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> take<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> lot<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> have

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
it's going to take a lot to have

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's going to take a lot to have
realistic<00:01:31.890> looking<00:01:32.220> hey<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.579> still<00:01:33.079> like<00:01:34.079> I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290

kind<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.060> reward<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:49.940> let's<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:51.060> here<00:02:51.209> uses

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
kind of reward and let's see here uses

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.500 
kind of reward and let's see here uses
the<00:02:51.630> phantom<00:02:51.959> blade<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:53.310> reward<00:02:53.849> depends

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
the phantom blade and the reward depends

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.270 
the phantom blade and the reward depends
on<00:02:54.599> so<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.530> bested<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.920> was<00:02:56.040> stealth

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
on so like this bested it was stealth

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.740 
on so like this bested it was stealth
because<00:02:56.579> if<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.730> get<00:02:56.910> detected<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.540> more<00:02:57.690> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
because if you get detected the more you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.870 
because if you get detected the more you
get<00:02:57.810> detected<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.739> more<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.160> reward<00:02:59.549> goes

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
get detected the more the reward goes

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.780 
get detected the more the reward goes
down<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.569> you're<00:03:01.110> not<00:03:01.260> gonna<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:02.340> much

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
down so you're not gonna have as much

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.300 
down so you're not gonna have as much
money<00:03:03.090> if<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.530> get<00:03:04.680> detected<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.160> lot

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
money if you if you get detected a lot

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.559 
money if you if you get detected a lot
and<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.640> was<00:03:05.730> really<00:03:05.849> cool<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.209> was<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.450> like

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
and I was really cool that was the like

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.089 
and I was really cool that was the like
the<00:03:06.750> double<00:03:06.989> assassination<00:03:07.620> thing<00:03:07.799> going<00:03:08.010> on

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
the double assassination thing going on

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.860 
the double assassination thing going on
there<00:03:08.280> which<00:03:08.670> is<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.849> obviously<00:03:09.690> he<00:03:09.750> doesn't

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
there which is a obviously he doesn't

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.539 
there which is a obviously he doesn't
have<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.140> hidden<00:03:10.349> players<00:03:10.530> even<00:03:10.650> as<00:03:10.829> one<00:03:11.069> so

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
have to hidden players even as one so

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.590 
have to hidden players even as one so
you<00:03:11.609> got<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.790> do<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.000> lot<00:03:12.120> differently<00:03:12.450> which

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
you got to do it a lot differently which

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.479 
you got to do it a lot differently which
it<00:03:12.810> does<00:03:13.049> look<00:03:13.200> really<00:03:13.350> really<00:03:13.530> good<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.220> now

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
it does look really really good so now

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.180 
it does look really really good so now
he's<00:03:14.790> got<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.090> now<00:03:15.540> he's<00:03:15.660> got<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.870> reward

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
he's got the now he's got the reward

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.949 
he's got the now he's got the reward
they've<00:03:17.190> got<00:03:17.340> actually<00:03:17.609> escape<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.329> without

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
they've got actually escape and without

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.080 
they've got actually escape and without
without<00:03:19.200> being<00:03:19.410> detected<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.950> course<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.549> how

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
without being detected of course so how

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.129 
without being detected of course so how
he<00:03:21.150> climbs<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.450> ladder<00:03:21.480> here<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.810> just<00:03:21.989> think

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
he climbs the ladder here I just think

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.750 
he climbs the ladder here I just think
was<00:03:22.230> really<00:03:22.560> satisfying<00:03:22.739> how<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.609> climb

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
was really satisfying how I just climb

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.309 
was really satisfying how I just climb
every<00:03:24.060> single<00:03:24.299> ladder<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:24.660> sight<00:03:24.870> because<00:03:25.109> i

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
every single ladder in sight because i

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.860 
every single ladder in sight because i
think<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.590> animation<00:03:26.100> looks<00:03:26.190> really<00:03:26.430> cool<00:03:26.870> up

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
think the animation looks really cool up

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.870 
think the animation looks really cool up
here<00:03:27.930> glitched<00:03:28.920> up<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.280> thing<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.639> was<00:03:29.730> like

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
here glitched up that thing I was like

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.000 
here glitched up that thing I was like
long<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:31.200> if<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:31.440> were<00:03:31.530> gonna<00:03:31.650> do<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.769> demo

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.559

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
you'd think you'd make it perfect but it

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.849 
you'd think you'd make it perfect but it
just<00:03:33.660> allows<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.290> player<00:03:34.470> just<00:03:34.650> kind<00:03:34.829> of

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
just allows the player just kind of

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.349 
just allows the player just kind of
glitch<00:03:35.280> up<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.670> thing<00:03:35.850> they're<00:03:36.060> like<00:03:36.180> yeah
