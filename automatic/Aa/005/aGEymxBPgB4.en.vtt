28.5<00:02:50.550> time<00:02:51.550> for<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.849> focus

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.770 

it's<00:02:57.710> really<00:02:58.130> surprising<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.880> this<00:02:59.030> Focus

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
it's really surprising that this Focus

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.320 
it's really surprising that this Focus
RS<00:02:59.990> is<00:03:00.350> ten<00:03:00.680> years<00:03:00.980> younger<00:03:01.430> than<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.940> Kazi

RS is ten years younger than the Kazi

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.809 
RS is ten years younger than the Kazi
but<00:03:02.990> it's<00:03:03.140> not<00:03:03.320> more<00:03:03.650> power

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
but it's not more power

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.550 
but it's not more power
even<00:03:05.150> quicker<00:03:05.510> from

even quicker from
Allen<00:03:07.980> do<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.160> think<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.550> without<00:03:08.670> the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
Allen do you think that without the

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
wing it would be lighter but it's not

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.360 
wing it would be lighter but it's not
however<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.600> does<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:16.140> an<00:03:16.290> engine<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:17.069> is

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
however it does have an engine that is

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.970 
however it does have an engine that is
an<00:03:17.700> excitable<00:03:18.450> one<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.050> one<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.590> just

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
an excitable one and one that you just

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.360 
an excitable one and one that you just

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.910 
want to thrash it's got a limited slip
diff<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.970> try<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.330> stop<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:28.290> tires<00:03:28.590> from

diff to try and stop the tires from

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.309 
diff to try and stop the tires from
spinning<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.489> does<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.910> pretty<00:03:30.239> good<00:03:30.420> job

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
spinning and it does a pretty good job

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.100 
spinning and it does a pretty good job
it's<00:03:31.920> very<00:03:32.190> keen<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.790> move<00:03:33.180> around<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.780> bends

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
it's very keen to move around the bends

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.930 
it's very keen to move around the bends
but<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.380> doesn't<00:03:34.770> do<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.069> in<00:03:35.280> that's<00:03:35.700> a

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
but it doesn't do it in that's a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.600 
but it doesn't do it in that's a
beautiful<00:03:36.750> fashion<00:03:37.050> that<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.500> escort<00:03:37.920> does

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.750 

so<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.850> big<00:03:42.239> question<00:03:42.739> can<00:03:43.739> it<00:03:43.800> beat<00:03:44.160> its<00:03:44.400> cult

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
so the big question can it beat its cult

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.260 
so the big question can it beat its cult
hero<00:03:45.090> brother<00:03:45.480> start<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.590> clock

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.140 

really<00:03:51.080> having<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.530> fight

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
really having to fight

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.170 
really having to fight
whereas<00:03:53.780> with<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.019> cozy<00:03:54.440> I<00:03:54.650> just<00:03:55.250> planted<00:03:55.879> the

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.520 
whereas with the cozy I just planted the
throttle<00:03:56.629> and

throttle and

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.350 
throttle and
controlled<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.220> so

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
controlled and so

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.290
