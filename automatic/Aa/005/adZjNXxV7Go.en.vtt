00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:15.969
 And coupled with the progress of the recent years the human genome to try to decipher all of the dna sequence of the human plan 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.969
 The research field of bioinformatics attracts attention 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:26.910
 It can be made by combining the bio- and bio-informatics representing biology and life sciences 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 The 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:38.860
 This new field of research represented by the word bioinformatics is computer and information 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:46.720
 Science technology is used as a mere tool to advance life science research 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:52.360
 It has been expected to have a major impact on the concept itself in the life science not only that 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:57.520
 The most important feature is analyzing the life using a computer 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.260
 For example, in the performing arts 6 we to the people Toka Well, all of the organisms in the dna of the game 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.059
 Information is written 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:10.570
 Because a large amount of information is written , I say that it is actually Sequence's actually recently 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:12.350
 After that, I analyze it using a computer , and pursue the envy of life by turning it. 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.600
 Is up to eight times more 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:21.320
 It is insurance payment 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.400
 The system developed at the Kashihara Lab is called " Bio-subjectively preserved anchor" to calculate 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.759
 Array 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:31.600
 When the genome is regarded as one long document, it is considered that the equivalent of a word is an anchor 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.600
 You can 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:41.030
 Genomic sequence is changed by mutation with evolution of the organism 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.149
 Furthermore, it is called reorganization at the genome level 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.690
 Mutations such as inverted 10-fold duplication 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.840
 It happens on the genome 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:54.880
 I am not only a person but also a salmatine pansy 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:02:00.880
 Depth if we have bought those under the earlier said bacteria Tokama various organisms 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:05.890
 The first method best of how to analyze how do the genome 's at that time speech back of the other organisms 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.710
 By the bottom compared with that where where is it different the same depending on the comparison to the game 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 The contents of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.429
 It is in the form you are using the computer and get to that going to pirate by love 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.880
 The 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:22.160
 We we're called the purple against it, but to develop that kind of er software 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:24.460
 By comparing the comparison other organisms 8 data of large genomic also become line that going to the analysis 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.660
 I am 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:33.370
 The Ebara Lab was introduced to Keio University 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.970
 Bankrupted hundreds of next-generation sequencers and cpu 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:43.069
 Cause cancer using cluster machines 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:46.909
 We perform analysis of genome mutation and genome analysis of Bacillus subtilis natto 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:53.239
 So far, genome analysis is only at the national project level 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:57.520
 More one on the development of next-generation sequencer in but has been considered not advanced the research today 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:02.800
 One laboratory can also decode the genome 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:09.190
 At Kashihara laboratory, genome analysis using next-generation sequencer 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:14.170
 The world's first decoding of the natto bacteria genome, which produces natto by fermentation 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.510
 Possibly biology or the view of life itself is almost the future in the computer science of Edd 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.940
 I think I will become 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:32.600
 For example, in the medical field of standing in the role 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:37.340
 It says little or Ati's ak red Oh Oh individuals here watermelon Ako life 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.930
 It can be predicted that it is prone to habitual diseases, so by that it 's 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.140
 While making effective use of that person's part 1 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.819
 The life of the first phase eh door Well think about it and timer 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.569
 And what it was likely to help things Tsu get to not Kakare fee Toka ask them to live longer 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.569
 I wonder if it comes out 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.360
 Bioinformatics with only 20 years of history 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:08.370
 In the field where the unexplained area is still large 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:08.370
 The challenge of Professor Ebara, who has been involved in research since Genesis, will continue from now on
