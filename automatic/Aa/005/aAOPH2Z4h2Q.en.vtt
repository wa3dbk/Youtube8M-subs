00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 speak personal but a good tone in the kitchen 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.930
 getting my name is Luiz Henrique and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:11.849
 today we will teach you how to make the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.179
 shrieks of pineapple screams is a dessert 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.590
 of Italian origin and is nothing more than 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.930
 a scratch card 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.410
 but instead of being made with ice avaÃ­ 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.560
 made only with water the scream is 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.769
 made with fruit in case here we did 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.470
 with pineapple with pineapple pulp 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.730
 It was delicious, it's really delicious. 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.730
 it's super refreshing 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.780
 better just go some our stayed aside 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.210
 only a few ingredients of the one 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.940
 bit of work because you have 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.570
 in the freezer and take several 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.969
 but yields much then in the end the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.489
 result is surprising 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.690
 I guarantee you'll like it so let's go 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.260
 there for the recipe 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.760
 We'll start by preparing our 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.310
 That pineapple is already cut in 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.340
 cubes without that crumb remaining in the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.619
 center and you can already 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.450
 blender all calls Cachia 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.000
 remembering that all our 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.400
 ingredients are always described here 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.490
 beneath the video in the video description 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.920
 you will then add to the water and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.840
 will also add the sugar in this 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.840
 recipe only goes a little sugar 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.970
 then a healthy recipe and also 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.909
 cool because of this you're going 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.369
 then hit his maxixe and when he already 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.460
 you have liquid well you can finally 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.649
 add mint leaves Portela 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.750
 It's going to be a special touch here. 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.439
 gremista is an ingredient worth the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.439
 worth putting 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.200
 this is the consistency you want 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.390
 is much thicker than simply a 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.649
 pineapple juice because we put it 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.350
 much less water 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.229
 now you will put us refractory and 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.740
 Ideally you should put a layer well 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.019
 thin more or less on the figure of a finger 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.179
 You do not want a thick layer and from here 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.860
 A little while you'll understand why you 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.920
 now you will leave a freezer for 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.650
 approximately one hour after a 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.700
 time you will take out your refractory and 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.160
 with a fork 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.590
 You're going to start shaving your granite. 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.890
 you are noticing that the consistency 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.049
 It's not the one we want, but it's 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.239
 so we will form the 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:34.420
 final consistency of a scratch card 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.790
 so we're scraping now to 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.190
 then go back in the freezer and do this 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.569
 many times until we get to the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.030
 final consistency 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.299
 Then you go back to the freezer for 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.079
 one more hour you take your one more 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.739
 little 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.420
 shave all your container remembering 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.630
 that you do not need to take out of the freezer 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.730
 You can go there and do it quickly and 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.920
 in there we are even taking it out here 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.160
 to make it easier to film to 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.829
 You, then, for the last time, you come back. 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.630
 to the freezer for another hour or 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.989
 You want to leave overnight. 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.090
 it may also be that in the end this is 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.000
 hence the consistency you will have 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.389
 always shaving with a fork at the end 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.220
 this is the consistency of scratch card and a 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.310
 supernatural dessert 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.269
 as I said super refreshing and super 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.790
 cold 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.560
 it's worth doing now you can always 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.599
 let your large customers in 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.720
 freezer and every time you go 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.880
 serve just put in a pot to 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.810
 serving people as if it were a 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.739
 ice cream 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.790
 always impose individual sanctions and 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.220
 To finish 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.970
 You can put a sheet of 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.430
 mint 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.880
 just to give an improvement in its great 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.980
 goal 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.930
 This is how it was today's recipe. 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.200
 I hope you have enjoyed it if you 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.800
