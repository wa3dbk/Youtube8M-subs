denture appliance to a fixed appliance

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
denture appliance to a fixed appliance
that's<00:00:41.430> screwed<00:00:41.790> into<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.210> implants<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.260> that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that's screwed into the implants so that

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.750 
that's screwed into the implants so that
it's<00:00:43.649> not<00:00:43.770> removable<00:00:44.129> anymore

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it's not removable anymore

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.459 
it's not removable anymore
so<00:00:45.090> we'll<00:00:45.300> start<00:00:45.539> by<00:00:45.629> drilling<00:00:45.989> through<00:00:46.289> the

down on to the implants and trim off all
of<00:02:23.360> this<00:02:23.420> extra<00:02:23.780> tissue<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.500> we'll<00:02:25.340> convert

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
of this extra tissue and we'll convert

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.570 
of this extra tissue and we'll convert
this<00:02:25.820> to<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.950> ten<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:28.130> thirty<00:02:28.580> --ss<00:02:28.820> fixed<00:02:30.580> first

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.760 
this to a ten to thirty --ss fixed first
before<00:02:31.820> we<00:02:32.030> fuse<00:02:32.450> this<00:02:32.690> bar<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
before we fuse this bar to the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.730 
before we fuse this bar to the
prosthesis<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:35.510> have<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.840> sandblast<00:02:36.530> a

prosthesis we have the sandblast a

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.000 
prosthesis we have the sandblast a
polished<00:02:37.130> metal<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:38.030> we'll<00:02:38.150> do<00:02:38.270> that<00:02:38.300> next<00:02:39.010> as

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
polished metal so we'll do that next as

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.640 
polished metal so we'll do that next as
you<00:02:40.190> can<00:02:40.310> say<00:02:40.520> we're<00:02:41.270> at<00:02:41.390> sandblasting<00:02:42.050> with

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
you can say we're at sandblasting with

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.710 
you can say we're at sandblasting with
metal<00:02:43.160> here

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.070 

it'll<00:02:48.720> become<00:02:48.840> highly<00:02:49.290> retentive

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.590 

okay<00:02:53.070> now<00:02:53.280> we<00:02:53.340> know<00:02:53.490> Samba<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.120> inside<00:02:54.480> of

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
okay now we know Samba is the inside of

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.980 
okay now we know Samba is the inside of
the<00:02:54.720> appliance<00:02:55.310> leave<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.430> out<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:57.570> get<00:02:57.810> more

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
the appliance leave it out and get more

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:12.800 
the appliance leave it out and get more
retention<00:03:11.000> so<00:03:12.000> what<00:03:12.150> we<00:03:12.240> want<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.450> do<00:03:12.510> here<00:03:12.750> is

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
retention so what we want to do here is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.680 
retention so what we want to do here is
use<00:03:13.260> metal<00:03:13.890> bonding<00:03:15.170> acrylic<00:03:16.250> bonding<00:03:17.250> liner

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
use metal bonding acrylic bonding liner

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.360 
use metal bonding acrylic bonding liner
this<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.960> metal<00:03:19.530> primer<00:03:19.860> which<00:03:20.040> allows

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
this is a metal primer which allows

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.660 
this is a metal primer which allows
acrylic<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.930> fuse<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.830> metal<00:03:23.100> so<00:03:23.520> we'll

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
acrylic to fuse to the metal so we'll

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.870 
acrylic to fuse to the metal so we'll
coat<00:03:23.910> this<00:03:24.770> entire<00:03:25.770> frame<00:03:26.190> with<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.640> metal

we'll<00:06:22.240> torque<00:06:22.570> it<00:06:22.720> to<00:06:22.930> its<00:06:23.110> final<00:06:23.670> strength

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
we'll torque it to its final strength

we'll torque it to its final strength
protecting<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:26.710> then<00:06:26.920> we'll<00:06:27.100> cover<00:06:27.310> the

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.470 
implants on and we're using impression
material<00:06:40.930> because<00:06:41.860> it's<00:06:42.070> soft<00:06:42.400> and<00:06:42.700> we<00:06:43.300> can

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
material because it's soft and we can

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.670 
material because it's soft and we can
retrieve<00:06:44.580> the<00:06:45.580> access<00:06:46.480> to<00:06:46.870> the<00:06:47.110> screw<00:06:47.440> holes

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
retrieve the access to the screw holes

00:06:47.680 --> 00:07:10.070
