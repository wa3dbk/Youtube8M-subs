00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
does at the offensive end the issue for

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.620 
does at the offensive end the issue for
us<00:04:58.230> has<00:04:58.500> always<00:04:58.800> been<00:04:58.950> you<00:04:59.850> know<00:04:59.880> he's<00:05:00.390> usually

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
us has always been you know he's usually

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.560 
us has always been you know he's usually
inconsistent<00:05:01.620> he's<00:05:01.890> very<00:05:02.130> quiet<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.970> a<00:05:03.030> surfer

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
inconsistent he's very quiet of a surfer

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.870 
inconsistent he's very quiet of a surfer
so<00:05:04.290> half<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.620> time<00:05:05.010> we<00:05:05.310> don't<00:05:05.340> really<00:05:05.669> know

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
so half the time we don't really know

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.140 
so half the time we don't really know
where<00:05:06.090> he's<00:05:06.300> at<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:07.169> that's<00:05:07.350> a<00:05:07.440> problem

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
where he's at and that's a problem

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.400 
where he's at and that's a problem
that's<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.300> problem<00:05:09.330> when<00:05:09.870> you're<00:05:10.020> playing<00:05:10.230> in

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
that's a problem when you're playing in

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.200 
that's a problem when you're playing in
left<00:05:10.650> fullback<00:05:10.860> so<00:05:11.850> he<00:05:12.360> has<00:05:13.580> you<00:05:14.580> know<00:05:14.700> he's

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
left fullback so he has you know he's

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.730 
left fullback so he has you know he's
kept<00:05:15.450> improving<00:05:15.780> he<00:05:16.050> plays<00:05:16.260> against<00:05:16.590> good

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
kept improving he plays against good

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.409 
kept improving he plays against good
players<00:05:16.860> every<00:05:17.400> single<00:05:17.730> game<00:05:17.880> you<00:05:18.180> know<00:05:18.270> every

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
players every single game you know every

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.530 
players every single game you know every
single<00:05:18.660> practice<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.730> so<00:05:20.730> I'm<00:05:21.060> not<00:05:21.210> surprised

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
single practice and so I'm not surprised

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.180 
single practice and so I'm not surprised
about<00:05:21.720> him<00:05:21.870> going<00:05:22.050> forward<00:05:22.470> it's<00:05:22.590> when<00:05:22.890> we<00:05:23.010> see

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
about him going forward it's when we see

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.430 
about him going forward it's when we see
at<00:05:23.280> practice<00:05:23.700> all<00:05:23.820> the<00:05:23.880> time<00:05:24.120> in<00:05:24.750> our<00:05:24.990> issue<00:05:25.200> is

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
at practice all the time in our issue is

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.630 
at practice all the time in our issue is
whether<00:05:25.590> or<00:05:25.710> not<00:05:25.830> he<00:05:25.979> could<00:05:26.130> defend<00:05:26.280> well

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
whether or not he could defend well

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.310 
whether or not he could defend well
enough<00:05:26.880> to<00:05:27.000> play<00:05:27.090> left<00:05:27.360> fullback<00:05:27.570> yeah<00:05:28.080> and

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
enough to play left fullback yeah and

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.690 
enough to play left fullback yeah and
he's<00:05:28.770> certainly<00:05:28.979> doing<00:05:29.190> that<00:05:29.430> and<00:05:29.669> he's

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
he's certainly doing that and he's

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.640 
he's certainly doing that and he's
getting<00:05:29.880> better<00:05:30.060> in<00:05:30.240> every<00:05:30.360> game<00:05:30.600> I<00:05:30.810> thought

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650
