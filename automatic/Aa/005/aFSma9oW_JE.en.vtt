00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
gonna make it probably much past the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.380 
gonna make it probably much past the
fourth<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.890> July<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.910> were<00:00:51.030> hoping<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> get

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
fourth of July we were hoping to get

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.840

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
past the fourth of July weekend and then

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.160 
past the fourth of July weekend and then
probably<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.539> deal<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.809> putting<00:00:55.079> her

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170

have<00:02:08.250> been<00:02:08.399> painting<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:09.149> painted<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.869> her

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
have been painting it I painted on her

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.410 
have been painting it I painted on her
gumline<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:12.170> I<00:02:13.170> also<00:02:13.260> used<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.739> treat<00:02:14.040> her<00:02:14.420> her

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
gumline and I also used to treat her her

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.990 
gumline and I also used to treat her her
nasal<00:02:15.629> passage<00:02:16.290> with<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> smaller<00:02:17.069> upper<00:02:17.700> nasal

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
nasal passage with a smaller upper nasal

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.780 
nasal passage with a smaller upper nasal
passage<00:02:18.599> with<00:02:18.840> because<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.440> tumor<00:02:19.980> had<00:02:20.519> gone

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
passage with because the tumor had gone

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.509 
passage with because the tumor had gone
up<00:02:21.420> into<00:02:21.660> her<00:02:21.810> nasal<00:02:22.019> passage<00:02:22.620> her<00:02:22.890> nose<00:02:23.250> was

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
up into her nasal passage her nose was

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.640 
up into her nasal passage her nose was
actually<00:02:23.910> canted<00:02:24.750> off<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.170> side<00:02:25.410> like

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
actually canted off to the side like

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.370 
actually canted off to the side like
this<00:02:25.680> was<00:02:26.459> completely<00:02:26.940> dry<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.840> was<00:02:28.140> getting

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
this was completely dry and was getting

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.860 
this was completely dry and was getting
ulcerated<00:02:28.890> inside<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.670> not<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> good<00:02:30.660> situation

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
ulcerated inside so not a good situation

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.259 
ulcerated inside so not a good situation
that<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.680> alone<00:02:31.950> was<00:02:32.640> probably<00:02:33.090> going<00:02:33.209> to

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
that that alone was probably going to

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.960 
that that alone was probably going to
cause<00:02:33.450> her<00:02:33.660> death<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:35.340> bleeding<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.940> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
cause her death just bleeding in the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.800 
cause her death just bleeding in the
nasal<00:02:36.209> cavity<00:02:36.840> there's<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.860> many<00:02:38.390> there's<00:02:39.390> so

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
nasal cavity there's so many there's so

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.699 
nasal cavity there's so many there's so
much

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
much

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.370 
much
somebody<00:02:41.310> blood<00:02:41.489> vessels<00:02:41.910> up<00:02:42.090> there<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:43.019> once

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
somebody blood vessels up there so once

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.020

father both have some skin cancer issues
so<00:03:27.630> this<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.109> benign<00:03:28.500> tumor<00:03:28.530> but<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.280> was

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
so this is a benign tumor but it was

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.740 
so this is a benign tumor but it was
large<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.910> was<00:03:30.030> probably<00:03:30.299> gonna<00:03:30.420> kill<00:03:30.630> her

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
large it was probably gonna kill her

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.509 
large it was probably gonna kill her
just<00:03:30.900> by<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.109> size<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.799> was<00:03:32.099> cutting<00:03:32.370> off

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
just by the size of it was cutting off

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.490 
just by the size of it was cutting off
her<00:03:32.730> for<00:03:33.359> breathing<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:33.989> stout<00:03:34.319> of<00:03:34.410> her

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
her for breathing that stout of her

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.309 
her for breathing that stout of her
mouth<00:03:34.650> but<00:03:34.829> also<00:03:34.919> in<00:03:35.160> her<00:03:35.220> nasal<00:03:35.510> passage<00:03:36.510> and

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
mouth but also in her nasal passage and

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.440 
mouth but also in her nasal passage and
