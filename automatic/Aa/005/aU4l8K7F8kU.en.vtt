00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:02.350
 certain artists 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.130
 n seek in art a way of a personal search a discipline 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.949
 I was looking for individual expression 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.799
 they do this through the landscape 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.160
 The weighing does not seem like a natural scenario are extracted literally but as 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.439
 an idealization interpretation of one's own individual expression is 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.439
 as a vehicle of expressions and feelings 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.989
 if the first time to make an exposition of this trend in 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.710
 out of china are not spain but in europe 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.660
 not in what is one of the most substances is one of the artistic sentences that 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.100
 be 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.910
 that have been happening is not the most representative thing maybe 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.710
 I think that it is an opportunity to see this more alternative line of 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.110
 plastic china 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.760
 fortunate to present both in this exposition contextualize when they were 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.800
 made these these parties were made after 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.500
 a very strong official pressure 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.010
 of art art 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.730
 with which by the way there was a great freedom liberty gillette 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.730
 powers to express oneself freely 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.850
 this willow zoom box that happens -1 77 ciama testimony of the years 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.280
 represent 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.580
 with this image of the eyes represents the different visions of history 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.580
 of the time that has passed in China 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.850
 is happy 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.960
 the international art market that is 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.210
 They sew from china some way 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.400
 Awesome 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.430
 a lot of market in the biggest international collectors in Iran 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.270
 china as one of those then you read characters to explore 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.220
 but this sense this exhibition represents a trend that maybe not 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.070
 is the most mercantilist wave most 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.270
 percent and its halo the most known china 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.470
 we have more beauty of Chinese art this idea more cynical pop john's pn oki 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.360
 if this combination between what it would be to discover this displaced modernity 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.820
 is discovery of the attraction that for them is the runoff in this 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.740
 sense encouraged more freedom conti squeezes started in china
