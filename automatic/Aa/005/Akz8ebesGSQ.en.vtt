standing<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.200> huge<00:01:49.470> angle<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.990> you<00:01:51.990> can

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
standing at this huge angle and you can

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
standing at this huge angle and you can
see<00:01:52.290> down<00:01:52.500> at<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.740> bottom<00:01:52.890> there<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.399> red

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
see down at the bottom there it's red

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.969 
see down at the bottom there it's red
now<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.720> may<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.619> that

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
now what I think this may be is that

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.530 
now what I think this may be is that
there's<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.280> lava<00:01:56.790> down<00:01:57.119> below<00:01:57.390> this

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
there's actually lava down below this

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.510 
there's actually lava down below this
building<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:58.079> course<00:01:58.320> during<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.009> teaser

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
building of course during the teaser

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.980 
building of course during the teaser
trailer<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:01:59.969> see<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> bus<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.750> going

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
trailer you can see the bus was going

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.080 
trailer you can see the bus was going
over<00:02:01.290> some<00:02:01.530> cracks<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.250> had<00:02:02.399> love<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.670> them

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
over some cracks that had love in them

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.300 
over some cracks that had love in them
while<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.020> could<00:02:04.320> see<00:02:04.500> areas<00:02:04.860> where<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> map

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
while we could see areas where the map

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.069 
while we could see areas where the map
literally<00:02:05.790> has<00:02:05.939> lava<00:02:06.210> running<00:02:06.719> running

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
literally has lava running running

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.690 
literally has lava running running
beneath<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.710> course<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> lighting<00:02:08.580> in

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
beneath and of course the lighting in

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.309 
beneath and of course the lighting in
this<00:02:08.819> definitely<00:02:09.360> suggests<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.899> there<00:02:10.170> is

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
this definitely suggests that there is

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.680 
this definitely suggests that there is
something<00:02:10.709> very<00:02:10.890> very<00:02:11.370> bright<00:02:11.760> down<00:02:12.480> beneath

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
something very very bright down beneath

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.559 
something very very bright down beneath
the<00:02:13.110> Zhan

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
the Zhan

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.809 
the Zhan
here<00:02:13.810> then<00:02:14.379> of<00:02:14.499> course<00:02:14.739> up<00:02:14.980> top<00:02:15.249> directly

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
here then of course up top directly

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.270 
here then of course up top directly
behind<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.540> zombie's<00:02:17.049> head<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.859> the<00:02:18.010> big

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
behind the zombie's head this is the big

this is the big thing this here is

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.039 
this is the big thing this here is
actually<00:02:23.799> a<00:02:23.829> tombstone<00:02:24.639> now<00:02:25.450> I'm<00:02:25.749> not

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
actually a tombstone now I'm not

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.379 
actually a tombstone now I'm not

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
left of this thing there's actually a

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.360 
left of this thing there's actually a
cartoon<00:02:40.870> tombstone<00:02:41.469> that<00:02:41.650> says<00:02:41.859> rest<00:02:42.189> in

peace r.i.p across it and then following

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.830 
peace r.i.p across it and then following
the<00:02:46.209> shape<00:02:46.659> of<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.650> r.i.p<00:02:48.030> logo<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:49.239> actually

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
the shape of that r.i.p logo is actually

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.009 
the shape of that r.i.p logo is actually
stone<00:02:50.409> st<00:02:51.219> 0<00:02:51.250> NE<00:02:51.549> which<00:02:52.150> we<00:02:52.299> can<00:02:52.449> assume<00:02:52.719> the

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
stone st 0 NE which we can assume the

rest as tombstone so right behind this

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.229 
rest as tombstone so right behind this
zombie's<00:02:56.230> head<00:02:56.469> is<00:02:56.799> some<00:02:57.189> type<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.430> tombstone

up<00:02:58.540> on<00:02:58.719> this<00:02:58.840> railing<00:02:59.109> so<00:02:59.459> what<00:03:00.459> do<00:03:00.519> you<00:03:00.579> guys

up on this railing so what do you guys
think<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.299> new<00:03:01.419> type<00:03:01.599> of<00:03:01.629> perk<00:03:02.079> system

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
think is it's a new type of perk system

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.170 
think is it's a new type of perk system
whatever<00:03:02.919> I<00:03:03.219> know<00:03:03.400> there's<00:03:03.760> some<00:03:03.939> things

course<00:03:33.250> his<00:03:33.430> eyes<00:03:33.579> are<00:03:33.759> blue<00:03:33.939> too<00:03:34.120> and<00:03:34.299> he

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
course his eyes are blue too and he

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.210 
course his eyes are blue too and he
looks<00:03:34.599> to<00:03:34.720> be<00:03:34.840> just<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:35.139> casual<00:03:35.530> citizen<00:03:36.009> maybe

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
looks to be just a casual citizen maybe

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.550 
looks to be just a casual citizen maybe
a<00:03:36.310> repairman<00:03:37.079> something<00:03:38.079> along<00:03:38.169> those<00:03:38.470> lines

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
a repairman something along those lines

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.860 
a repairman something along those lines
then<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.639> right<00:03:39.669> you<00:03:40.120> get<00:03:40.239> this<00:03:40.419> really

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
then to the right you get this really

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.979 
then to the right you get this really
really<00:03:41.019> nice<00:03:41.319> shot<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:42.159> bus<00:03:42.720> first<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.900> all

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
really nice shot of the bus first of all

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.839 
really nice shot of the bus first of all
you<00:03:44.049> can<00:03:44.319> notice<00:03:44.530> on<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:44.949> front<00:03:44.979> actually<00:03:45.699> has

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
you can notice on the front actually has

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.789 
you can notice on the front actually has
like<00:03:45.879> a<00:03:46.090> train<00:03:46.479> great<00:03:46.840> on<00:03:47.079> it<00:03:47.349> you<00:03:47.590> know<00:03:47.680> how

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
like a train great on it you know how

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.379 
like a train great on it you know how
the<00:03:47.859> trains<00:03:48.220> have<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.639> thing<00:03:48.879> to<00:03:49.120> block

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
the trains have that thing to block

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.420 
the trains have that thing to block
stuff<00:03:49.870> my<00:03:50.769> guess<00:03:51.009> is<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.250> can<00:03:51.400> actually

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
stuff my guess is you can actually

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.479 
stuff my guess is you can actually
upgrade<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.239> bus<00:03:52.419> so<00:03:53.169> in<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:53.799> image<00:03:54.009> the<00:03:54.159> bus

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
upgrade the bus so in this image the bus

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.069 
upgrade the bus so in this image the bus
has<00:03:54.699> been<00:03:54.729> upgraded<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:55.629> retrofitted<00:03:56.469> with<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
has been upgraded and retrofitted with a

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.209 
has been upgraded and retrofitted with a
grade<00:03:59.079> on<00:03:59.259> the<00:03:59.379> front<00:03:59.650> which<00:03:59.889> will<00:04:00.040> push

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:00.219 
grade on the front which will push

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:01.619 
grade on the front which will push
zombies<00:04:00.639> out<00:04:00.759> of<00:04:00.879> the<00:04:00.939> way<00:04:01.030> do<00:04:01.239> more<00:04:01.419> damage

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
zombies out of the way do more damage

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.140 
zombies out of the way do more damage
maybe<00:04:01.959> actually<00:04:02.530> kill<00:04:02.829> them<00:04:03.099> that<00:04:03.909> type<00:04:04.120> of

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
maybe actually kill them that type of

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.780 
maybe actually kill them that type of
thing<00:04:04.419> and<00:04:04.599> then<00:04:05.079> actually<00:04:05.439> inside<00:04:06.189> the<00:04:06.250> bus

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
thing and then actually inside the bus

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.569 
thing and then actually inside the bus
you<00:04:07.120> can<00:04:07.299> see<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.719> bus<00:04:07.930> driver<00:04:08.199> who<00:04:08.680> front<00:04:09.400> on

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
you can see the bus driver who front on

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.409 
you can see the bus driver who front on
we<00:04:09.879> can<00:04:10.060> tell<00:04:10.329> is<00:04:11.400> not<00:04:12.400> a<00:04:12.430> zombie<00:04:12.729> essentially

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
we can tell is not a zombie essentially

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.939 
we can tell is not a zombie essentially
a<00:04:13.449> lot<00:04:13.629> of<00:04:13.719> people<00:04:13.840> think<00:04:14.169> he's<00:04:14.439> a<00:04:14.469> zombie<00:04:14.739> I

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
a lot of people think he's a zombie I

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.640 
a lot of people think he's a zombie I
completely<00:04:15.519> disagree<00:04:15.930> look<00:04:16.930> at<00:04:17.049> this<00:04:17.169> zoom<00:04:17.409> in

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
completely disagree look at this zoom in

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.529 
completely disagree look at this zoom in
here<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:18.159> can<00:04:18.280> see<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.699> zombie<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.329> left

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
here you can see the zombie to the left

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.420 
here you can see the zombie to the left
has<00:04:19.750> blue<00:04:20.019> eyes<00:04:20.049> of<00:04:20.440> course<00:04:20.650> all<00:04:20.859> zombies<00:04:21.310> in

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
has blue eyes of course all zombies in

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.950 
has blue eyes of course all zombies in
this<00:04:21.519> one<00:04:21.669> will<00:04:21.820> have<00:04:21.880> blue<00:04:22.120> eyes<00:04:22.150> at<00:04:22.570> least<00:04:22.719> in

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
this one will have blue eyes at least in

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.390 
this one will have blue eyes at least in
the<00:04:23.080> first<00:04:23.229> map<00:04:23.469> because<00:04:23.740> Richthofen<00:04:24.310> is

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
the first map because Richthofen is

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.519 
the first map because Richthofen is
controlling<00:04:25.000> them<00:04:25.120> at<00:04:25.240> this<00:04:25.360> point<00:04:25.630> however

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:26.529 
controlling them at this point however

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:27.379 
controlling them at this point however
the<00:04:26.770> bus<00:04:27.010> draw

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
the bus draw

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.989 
the bus draw
has<00:04:27.629> green<00:04:28.050> eyes<00:04:28.280> so<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:29.400> is<00:04:29.490> a<00:04:29.520> different

00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:29.999 
has green eyes so this is a different

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:32.570 
has green eyes so this is a different
type<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.349> color<00:04:31.349> a<00:04:31.499> different<00:04:31.860> type<00:04:32.009> of<00:04:32.039> entity

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
type of color a different type of entity

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.790 
type of color a different type of entity
and<00:04:32.699> i<00:04:32.789> think<00:04:33.060> he<00:04:33.389> is<00:04:33.419> actually<00:04:33.539> a<00:04:33.990> robot<00:04:34.590> you

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
and i think he is actually a robot you

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.279 
and i think he is actually a robot you
can<00:04:34.919> see<00:04:35.069> on<00:04:35.189> his<00:04:35.249> face<00:04:35.599> it's<00:04:36.599> very<00:04:36.749> robot-like

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
can see on his face it's very robot-like

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.170 
can see on his face it's very robot-like
and<00:04:38.189> then<00:04:38.340> of<00:04:38.460> course<00:04:38.490> during<00:04:38.819> the<00:04:38.969> teaser

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
and then of course during the teaser

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.339 
and then of course during the teaser
trailer<00:04:39.539> you<00:04:39.659> know<00:04:39.749> when<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.960> door<00:04:40.139> is<00:04:40.169> open

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:40.349 
trailer you know when the door is open

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.170 
trailer you know when the door is open
you<00:04:40.590> hear<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:40.830> robotic<00:04:41.279> voice<00:04:41.490> talking<00:04:41.849> so<00:04:42.120> i

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
you hear that robotic voice talking so i

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.179 
you hear that robotic voice talking so i
believe<00:04:42.419> he's<00:04:42.629> actually<00:04:42.810> a<00:04:43.050> robot<00:04:43.409> she<00:04:44.069> can

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
believe he's actually a robot she can

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:45.709 
believe he's actually a robot she can
upgrade<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.639> bus<00:04:44.819> the<00:04:45.150> bus<00:04:45.180> driver<00:04:45.539> is<00:04:45.629> a

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:45.719 
upgrade the bus the bus driver is a

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:47.959 
upgrade the bus the bus driver is a
robot<00:04:46.139> also<00:04:47.009> on<00:04:47.159> the<00:04:47.310> right<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.789> can<00:04:47.939> see

top of the bus and one guys climbing
through<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.580> front<00:05:05.849> window<00:05:06.180> there<00:05:06.330> on<00:05:06.509> the

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:06.689 
through the front window there on the

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:08.779 
through the front window there on the
bus<00:05:06.870> so<00:05:07.439> they're<00:05:07.560> attacking<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.129> bus<00:05:08.370> we<00:05:08.669> can

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
bus so they're attacking the bus we can

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:10.939 
bus so they're attacking the bus we can
assume<00:05:08.969> the<00:05:09.180> players<00:05:09.419> are<00:05:09.599> on<00:05:09.719> there<00:05:09.930> so<00:05:10.439> two

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
assume the players are on there so two

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.589 
assume the players are on there so two
types<00:05:11.219> of<00:05:11.340> zombies<00:05:11.759> maybe<00:05:12.210> not<00:05:12.389> necessarily

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:12.599 
types of zombies maybe not necessarily

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.839 
types of zombies maybe not necessarily
types<00:05:13.229> more<00:05:13.650> so<00:05:13.770> behavioral<00:05:14.430> differences

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
types more so behavioral differences

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.600 
types more so behavioral differences
between<00:05:15.029> these<00:05:15.389> two<00:05:15.659> types<00:05:16.500> of<00:05:16.620> guys<00:05:16.740> also<00:05:17.370> to

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
between these two types of guys also to

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.879 
between these two types of guys also to
the<00:05:18.180> bottom<00:05:18.629> left<00:05:18.839> beneath<00:05:19.169> our<00:05:19.319> main<00:05:19.500> zombie

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
the bottom left beneath our main zombie

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.320 
the bottom left beneath our main zombie
I<00:05:19.919> want<00:05:19.979> to<00:05:20.159> point<00:05:20.310> out<00:05:20.430> something<00:05:20.699> kind<00:05:21.270> of

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
actually photoshopped him in and they

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.730 
actually photoshopped him in and they
just<00:05:29.759> did<00:05:29.879> a<00:05:29.909> goddamn<00:05:30.300> horrible<00:05:30.779> job<00:05:30.960> he's

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
tried to do was try and match the tile

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.119 
tried to do was try and match the tile
of<00:05:35.819> this<00:05:36.300> screenshot<00:05:36.599> with<00:05:36.930> the<00:05:37.050> tile<00:05:37.349> in<00:05:37.620> the

of this screenshot with the tile in the
background<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.639> this<00:05:38.729> one<00:05:38.939> but<00:05:39.180> it's<00:05:39.389> just

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:39.629 
background of this one but it's just

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.659 
background of this one but it's just
it's<00:05:39.810> a<00:05:39.930> fucking<00:05:40.680> horrible<00:05:40.949> horrible

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
left you can actually see through that

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.499 
left you can actually see through that
zombie<00:05:51.779> so<00:05:51.899> you<00:05:51.990> can<00:05:52.110> see<00:05:52.319> through<00:05:52.680> to<00:05:53.639> the<00:05:53.909> to

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
zombie so you can see through to the to

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:57.079 
zombie so you can see through to the to
the<00:05:54.539> back<00:05:54.839> to<00:05:55.500> the<00:05:55.680> the<00:05:56.279> tile<00:05:56.550> on<00:05:56.789> the<00:05:56.879> side<00:05:57.060> of

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:57.089 
the back to the the tile on the side of

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.510 
the back to the the tile on the side of
this<00:05:57.240> wall<00:05:57.360> up<00:05:57.719> into<00:05:58.589> the<00:05:58.710> sky<00:05:58.949> you<00:05:58.979> can<00:05:59.370> see

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
this wall up into the sky you can see

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.059 
this wall up into the sky you can see
some<00:05:59.729> Lightning<00:06:00.240> going<00:06:00.569> off<00:06:00.719> with<00:06:01.050> the<00:06:01.199> Sun<00:06:01.529> up

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
some Lightning going off with the Sun up

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.459 
some Lightning going off with the Sun up
there<00:06:02.300> or<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.449> moon<00:06:03.629> something<00:06:04.139> like<00:06:04.289> that

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
there or the moon something like that

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:05.959 
there or the moon something like that
there's<00:06:04.800> this<00:06:04.889> orange<00:06:05.250> ball<00:06:05.520> in<00:06:05.729> the<00:06:05.849> middle

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 
there's this orange ball in the middle

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:07.459 
there's this orange ball in the middle
we're<00:06:06.240> not<00:06:06.360> sure<00:06:06.629> what<00:06:06.750> that<00:06:06.779> could<00:06:07.050> be<00:06:07.110> and

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469 
we're not sure what that could be and

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.170 
we're not sure what that could be and
then<00:06:07.800> to<00:06:07.949> the<00:06:08.039> right<00:06:08.069> you<00:06:08.430> have<00:06:08.460> what<00:06:08.909> looks<00:06:08.939> to

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
then to the right you have what looks to

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.179 
then to the right you have what looks to
be<00:06:09.300> tree<00:06:09.719> branches<00:06:10.259> which<00:06:10.529> which<00:06:10.889> pretty<00:06:11.099> much

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:11.189 
be tree branches which which pretty much

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:12.889 
be tree branches which which pretty much
our<00:06:11.430> tree<00:06:11.669> branches<00:06:12.060> and<00:06:12.180> another<00:06:12.479> lightning

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:12.899 
our tree branches and another lightning

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:14.990 
our tree branches and another lightning
strike<00:06:13.139> there<00:06:13.349> behind<00:06:13.589> the<00:06:13.740> tree<00:06:13.979> branches<00:06:14.129> on

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
strike there behind the tree branches on

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.639 
strike there behind the tree branches on
some<00:06:15.360> clouds<00:06:15.689> in<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:15.960> sky<00:06:16.199> so<00:06:16.409> there's<00:06:16.560> some
