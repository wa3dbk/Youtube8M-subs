00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
SteriPEN Adventure and what this is is a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.420 
SteriPEN Adventure and what this is is a
really<00:01:10.020> cool<00:01:10.170> piece<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.530> gear<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.979> really

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
really cool piece of gear that I really

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.950 
really cool piece of gear that I really
have<00:01:11.550> not<00:01:11.700> heard<00:01:11.940> much<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.509> all<00:01:12.660> and<00:01:12.690> I'm

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
have not heard much about it all and I'm

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.700 
have not heard much about it all and I'm
I'm<00:01:13.200> really<00:01:13.290> surprised<00:01:14.009> by<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.310> because

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
I'm really surprised by that because

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710 
I'm really surprised by that because
look<00:01:16.710> how<00:01:16.860> small<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.509> this<00:01:18.509> thing

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
look how small this is this thing

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.800 
look how small this is this thing
totally<00:01:18.990> replaces<00:01:19.649> a<00:01:19.680> water<00:01:19.890> filter<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:21.479> does

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
totally replaces a water filter it does

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.300 
totally replaces a water filter it does
have<00:01:21.960> drawbacks<00:01:22.850> but<00:01:23.850> overall<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.270> prefer<00:01:24.690> this

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
have drawbacks but overall I prefer this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.330 
have drawbacks but overall I prefer this
much<00:01:26.310> more<00:01:26.610> than<00:01:26.910> a<00:01:26.970> water<00:01:27.149> filter<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:28.310> why<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
much more than a water filter and why I

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
much more than a water filter and why I
prefer<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.300> because<00:01:30.860> number<00:01:31.860> one<00:01:31.979> it's

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
prefer it is because number one it's

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.120 
prefer it is because number one it's
small<00:01:32.479> number<00:01:33.479> two<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.930> no<00:01:34.080> filters<00:01:34.500> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
small number two you have no filters to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.630 
small number two you have no filters to
replace<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.930> number<00:01:36.930> three<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.640> totally

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
replace and number three it totally

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.980 
replace and number three it totally
filters<00:01:39.259> an<00:01:40.259> entire<00:01:40.649> liter<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.009> water<00:01:41.160> in<00:01:41.990> 60

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
filters an entire liter of water in 60

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.480 
filters an entire liter of water in 60
seconds<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.500> half<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.520> liter<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.970> 30<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
seconds and half a liter in 30 and the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.199 
seconds and half a liter in 30 and the
way<00:01:47.789> it<00:01:47.910> works<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:49.080> has<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:52.610> small<00:01:53.610> UV<00:01:53.970> bulb

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
way it works is it has a small UV bulb

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.389 
way it works is it has a small UV bulb
and<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:55.590> uses<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.280> adult<00:01:56.640> about<00:01:56.880> light<00:01:57.119> to

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
and it uses the adult about light to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.690 
and it uses the adult about light to
manipulate<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.759> DNA<00:01:59.940> in<00:02:01.039> in<00:02:02.039> bacteria<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
manipulate the DNA in in bacteria and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.419 
manipulate the DNA in in bacteria and
size<00:02:02.940> so<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.179> it<00:02:03.390> can't<00:02:03.600> replicate<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
size so that it can't replicate and

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.669 
size so that it can't replicate and
because<00:02:05.429> of<00:02:05.459> that<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:06.330> blends<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> water<00:02:07.050> now

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
because of that it blends the water now

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.370 
because of that it blends the water now
the<00:02:07.740> drawbacks<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.700> are<00:02:09.140> when<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.229> have

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
the drawbacks to that are when you have

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.690 
the drawbacks to that are when you have
water<00:02:10.560> like<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.099> see<00:02:11.250> right<00:02:11.400> here<00:02:11.459> that

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
water like you can see right here that

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.690 
water like you can see right here that
I'm<00:02:11.970> about<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.209> drink<00:02:12.450> actually

I'm about to drink actually

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.870 
I'm about to drink actually
it<00:02:14.700> stays<00:02:14.970> gross<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:16.170> doesn't<00:02:16.440> taste<00:02:16.560> good<00:02:16.880> it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
it stays gross it doesn't taste good it

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.860 
it stays gross it doesn't taste good it
looks<00:02:18.630> nasty<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:19.740> it's<00:02:20.390> it's<00:02:21.390> clean<00:02:21.690> and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
looks nasty but it's it's it's clean and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.559 
looks nasty but it's it's it's clean and
that<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.170> won't<00:02:22.260> make<00:02:22.410> you<00:02:22.590> sick<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.940> I'm<00:02:24.180> gonna

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
oh but by the way these come in all

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.750 
oh but by the way these come in all
kinds<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.620> different<00:02:28.770> models<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.430> have<00:02:29.459> the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
kinds of different models I have the

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.010 
kinds of different models I have the
adventurer<00:02:30.270> this<00:02:30.540> was<00:02:30.660> about<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.840> hundred

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
adventurer this was about a hundred

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.290 
adventurer this was about a hundred
dollars<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.760> reason<00:02:33.000> I<00:02:33.060> got<00:02:33.180> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
dollars and the reason I got the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.880 
dollars and the reason I got the
adventure<00:02:33.720> was<00:02:33.900> because<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.319> was<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.770> was<00:02:34.860> a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
adventure was because it was it was a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.220 
adventure was because it was it was a
lot<00:02:35.069> smaller<00:02:35.300> than<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.390> normal<00:02:36.690> one<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:36.959> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
lot smaller than the normal one and the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.680 
lot smaller than the normal one and the
battery<00:02:37.830> life<00:02:37.980> was<00:02:38.190> better<00:02:38.370> now<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.300> can<00:02:39.569> go

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
battery life was better now you can go

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.420 
battery life was better now you can go
buy<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.900> original<00:02:40.560> SteriPEN<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.340> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
buy the original SteriPEN and it's a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.300 
buy the original SteriPEN and it's a
little<00:02:42.180> bit<00:02:42.300> larger<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.920> uses<00:02:43.920> double-a

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
little bit larger and uses double-a

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.610 
little bit larger and uses double-a
batteries

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
batteries

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.680 
batteries
the<00:02:45.920> battery<00:02:46.250> life<00:02:46.400> isn't<00:02:46.760> as<00:02:46.910> great<00:02:47.209> but

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
the battery life isn't as great but

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.630 
the battery life isn't as great but
finding<00:02:48.560> doublea's<00:02:48.980> are<00:02:49.160> a<00:02:49.190> lot<00:02:49.310> easier<00:02:49.340> to

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
finding doublea's are a lot easier to

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.210 
finding doublea's are a lot easier to
find<00:02:49.790> then<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.360> batteries<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.870> use<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.590> this

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
find then the batteries this use is this

find then the batteries this use is this
uses<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.670> think<00:02:53.770> cr123<00:02:54.770> something<00:02:55.220> like<00:02:55.340> that

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
uses I think cr123 something like that

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.089 
uses I think cr123 something like that
you<00:02:57.050> can<00:02:57.170> find<00:02:57.410> them<00:02:57.530> at<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.739> know<00:02:57.860> Walmart

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
you can find them at you know Walmart
