borax<00:02:19.070> that<00:02:19.340> comes<00:02:19.520> out<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.820> ground<00:02:19.970> so<00:02:20.209> I

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
borax that comes out of the ground so I

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.850

guess<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.510> can<00:02:20.660> go<00:02:20.810> back<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.260> ground<00:02:21.440> salt

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
guess you can go back in the ground salt

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.120 
guess you can go back in the ground salt
