we're finding the fork making a bike
that's<00:00:33.870> faster<00:00:34.320> when<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:34.830> started<00:00:35.250> with<00:00:35.340> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
that's faster when we started with the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.660 
that's faster when we started with the

slate a clean canvas and we decided

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
slate a clean canvas and we decided
let's<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.970> this<00:00:42.120> bike<00:00:42.330> right<00:00:42.629> let's<00:00:42.960> start<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
let's do this bike right let's start and

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.600 
let's do this bike right let's start and
learn<00:00:44.570> every<00:00:45.570> aspect<00:00:45.769> about<00:00:46.769> aerodynamics<00:00:47.070> in

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
learn every aspect about aerodynamics in

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
learn every aspect about aerodynamics in
each<00:00:47.729> part<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> bike<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> damage<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.019> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
each part of the bike the damage of the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.770 
each part of the bike the damage of the
seat<00:00:49.409> tube<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.799> stays<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.430> fork<00:00:50.780> everything

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
seat tube the stays the fork everything

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.469 
seat tube the stays the fork everything
that<00:00:51.960> contributes<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.650> overall<00:00:53.239> drag<00:00:54.239> on

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
that contributes to the overall drag on

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.380 
that contributes to the overall drag on
the<00:00:54.600> bike<00:00:54.750> itself<00:00:55.140> main<00:00:56.010> goal<00:00:56.220> was<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
the bike itself main goal was the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.820 
the bike itself main goal was the
aerodynamic<00:00:58.049> performance<00:00:58.229> and<00:00:58.739> then

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
aerodynamic performance and then

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.130 
aerodynamic performance and then
stiffness<00:00:59.339> and<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.390> third<00:01:00.629> one<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
stiffness and then the third one was the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
stiffness and then the third one was the
weight<00:01:01.290> by<00:01:01.769> the<00:01:01.799> time<00:01:02.159> we<00:01:02.430> ever<00:01:02.729> went<00:01:03.089> into<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
weight by the time we ever went into the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.539 
weight by the time we ever went into the
wind<00:01:03.600> tunnel<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.470> had<00:01:04.619> used<00:01:04.890> CFD

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
wind tunnel on this we had used CFD

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.760 
wind tunnel on this we had used CFD
software<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.330> design<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.960> optimize<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> tube

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
software to design and optimize the tube

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.310 
software to design and optimize the tube
shapes<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.510> see<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.869> seed<00:01:10.140> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
shapes then we actually see in seed a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.340 
shapes then we actually see in seed a
plastic<00:01:10.860> bike<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> lot<00:01:12.450> more<00:01:12.689> from<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
plastic bike this is a lot more from the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.960 
plastic bike this is a lot more from the
computer<00:01:13.740> stuff<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.159> learned<00:01:14.340> from<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.610> bike

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
computer stuff we learned from that bike

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.620 
computer stuff we learned from that bike
in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.479> computer

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
in the computer

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.459 
in the computer
this<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.290> all<00:01:18.469> from<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:18.920> CFD<00:01:19.310> CFD<00:01:19.969> is

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
this is all from the CFD CFD is

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.990 
this is all from the CFD CFD is
computational<00:01:21.469> fluid<00:01:21.590> dynamics<00:01:22.189> it

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
computational fluid dynamics it

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.969 
computational fluid dynamics it
basically<00:01:23.299> lets<00:01:23.539> us<00:01:23.780> simulate<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.799> wind

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
basically lets us simulate the wind

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.710 
basically lets us simulate the wind
tunnel<00:01:25.189> on<00:01:25.310> our<00:01:25.399> computers<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.539> run

tunnel on our computers and you run

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.420 
tunnel on our computers and you run
different<00:01:27.049> analysis<00:01:27.530> finding<00:01:27.890> out<00:01:27.979> what<00:01:28.189> tube

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
different analysis finding out what tube

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.219

how the fork interacts with the down
tube<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.880> you<00:01:34.970> start<00:01:35.179> building<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.689> more<00:01:35.869> and

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
tube and you start building it more and

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.620 
tube and you start building it more and
more<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:36.380> is<00:01:36.439> actually<00:01:37.210> cut<00:01:38.210> off<00:01:38.240> of<00:01:38.390> the

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
more this is actually cut off of the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.559 
more this is actually cut off of the
same<00:01:39.200> files<00:01:39.470> of<00:01:39.679> use<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.039> make<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.220> too<00:01:40.340> lean

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
same files of use and make it too lean

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.719 
same files of use and make it too lean
so<00:01:41.569> one<00:01:41.869> last<00:01:42.130> validation<00:01:43.130> if<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.340> will<00:01:43.520> to

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
so one last validation if you will to

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.760 
so one last validation if you will to
make<00:01:43.850> sure<00:01:44.030> everything<00:01:44.360> is<00:01:44.450> perfect<00:01:44.770> before

make sure everything is perfect before

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.380 
make sure everything is perfect before
they<00:01:46.009> go<00:01:46.189> ahead<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.490> cut<00:01:46.610> steel<00:01:46.789> tools<00:01:47.090> and

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
they go ahead and cut steel tools and

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.260 
they go ahead and cut steel tools and
start<00:01:47.960> making<00:01:48.500> some<00:01:48.530> final<00:01:48.770> samples<00:01:49.250> for<00:01:49.429> the

our<00:02:10.229> first<00:02:10.770> prototype<00:02:11.720> master<00:02:12.720> sample<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.410> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
our first prototype master sample of the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.970 
our first prototype master sample of the
new<00:02:13.740> 2011<00:02:14.370> dat<00:02:15.240> T<00:02:15.420> bike<00:02:15.630> we're<00:02:16.500> here<00:02:16.740> to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
new 2011 dat T bike we're here to

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.450 
new 2011 dat T bike we're here to
validate<00:02:17.610> our<00:02:17.820> design<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:19.130> we'll<00:02:20.130> see<00:02:20.310> what

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
validate our design and we'll see what

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:40.380 
validate our design and we'll see what
happens

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.140 

we've<00:02:41.390> done<00:02:41.570> a<00:02:41.600> new<00:02:41.950> integrated<00:02:42.950> stem<00:02:43.280> that's

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
we've done a new integrated stem that's

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.850 
we've done a new integrated stem that's
more<00:02:44.600> integrated<00:02:45.050> into<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.290> top<00:02:45.440> tube<00:02:45.650> than

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
more integrated into the top tube than

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.560 
more integrated into the top tube than
the<00:02:45.980> previous<00:02:46.340> version<00:02:46.670> we've<00:02:47.000> done<00:02:47.240> a

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
the previous version we've done a

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.290 
the previous version we've done a
smaller<00:02:47.990> diameter<00:02:48.230> headset<00:02:48.830> narrower<00:02:49.730> narrow

tubes and everything to perform well in
crosswinds<00:03:48.170> it's<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.709> not<00:03:48.830> aerodynamics

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
crosswinds it's just not aerodynamics

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.070 
crosswinds it's just not aerodynamics
it's<00:03:49.610> also<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.970> structure<00:03:50.360> of<00:03:50.420> the<00:03:50.480> bicycle

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
it's also the structure of the bicycle

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.479 
it's also the structure of the bicycle
you<00:03:51.320> know<00:03:51.380> how<00:03:51.500> well<00:03:51.709> is<00:03:51.800> it<00:03:51.860> perform<00:03:52.280> as<00:03:52.430> a

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
you know how well is it perform as a

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.550 
you know how well is it perform as a
bicycle<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:53.420> not<00:03:53.600> just<00:03:53.959> again<00:03:54.290> going

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
bicycle it's not just again going

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.490 
bicycle it's not just again going
straight<00:03:55.239> against<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.300> wind<00:03:56.600> it's<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.050> angle

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
straight against the wind it's the angle

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.890 
straight against the wind it's the angle
of<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.800> wind<00:03:58.040> it's<00:03:58.700> when<00:03:59.300> they<00:03:59.420> need<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.720> put

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
of the wind it's when they need to put

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.680 
of the wind it's when they need to put
power<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.920> rear<00:04:01.100> wheel<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:02.390> bottom

power to the rear wheel the bottom

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.170 
power to the rear wheel the bottom
brackets<00:04:03.080> gonna<00:04:03.260> flex<00:04:03.620> less<00:04:03.890> when<00:04:04.850> they<00:04:04.970> go

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
brackets gonna flex less when they go

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.910 
brackets gonna flex less when they go
into<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.510> corner<00:04:06.019> they're<00:04:06.170> gonna<00:04:06.290> be<00:04:06.530> able<00:04:06.650> to

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
into a corner they're gonna be able to

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.680 
into a corner they're gonna be able to
go<00:04:07.100> into<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.580> corner<00:04:07.970> without<00:04:08.239> that<00:04:08.420> front

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
go into that corner without that front

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.170 
go into that corner without that front
wheel<00:04:08.840> chattering<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:10.400> we<00:04:10.850> thought<00:04:11.120> about

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
wheel chattering and so we thought about

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.690 
wheel chattering and so we thought about
all<00:04:11.630> of<00:04:11.810> those<00:04:11.959> details<00:04:12.290> obeying<00:04:13.100> that<00:04:13.160> system

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
all of those details obeying that system

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.640 
all of those details obeying that system
the<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.360> front<00:04:14.570> of<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:14.810> fork<00:04:15.080> is<00:04:15.260> actually

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
the the front of the fork is actually

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.440 
the the front of the fork is actually
the<00:04:15.739> steer<00:04:15.980> tube<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.729> when<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:16.940> start<00:04:17.180> talking

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
the steer tube so when you start talking

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.180 
the steer tube so when you start talking
about<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.630> very<00:04:17.810> narrow<00:04:17.870> head<00:04:18.350> tube<00:04:18.590> your<00:04:18.979> steer

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
about a very narrow head tube your steer

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.469 
about a very narrow head tube your steer
tube<00:04:19.340> gets<00:04:19.459> considerably<00:04:19.940> smaller<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.419> you

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
tube gets considerably smaller and you

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.210 
tube gets considerably smaller and you
lose<00:04:20.600> a<00:04:20.630> lot<00:04:20.780> of<00:04:20.840> stiffness<00:04:21.140> so<00:04:21.739> by<00:04:21.859> moving<00:04:22.130> the

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
lose a lot of stiffness so by moving the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.719 
lose a lot of stiffness so by moving the
steer<00:04:22.460> tube

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
steer tube

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.370

having that narrow cross section it's

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.469 
having that narrow cross section it's
got<00:04:27.680> two<00:04:27.830> things<00:04:28.070> working<00:04:28.340> inside<00:04:29.030> out<00:04:29.090> and

got two things working inside out and

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:32.620 
got two things working inside out and
the<00:04:30.410> modular<00:04:30.800> monocoque<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.669> basically<00:04:32.419> the

internal mold the internal mold is what

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.460 
internal mold the internal mold is what
actually<00:04:40.700> needs<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.210> come<00:04:41.419> out<00:04:41.540> once<00:04:42.200> you<00:04:42.320> make
