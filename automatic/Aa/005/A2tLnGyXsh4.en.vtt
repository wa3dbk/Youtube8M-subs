00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.920 
was really exciting to see we basically
turned<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.310> very<00:01:46.640> experienced<00:01:47.420> Mavericks

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
turned that very experienced Mavericks

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.710 
turned that very experienced Mavericks
defense<00:01:48.610> inside<00:01:49.610> out<00:01:49.790> we<00:01:49.940> made<00:01:50.120> them<00:01:50.360> think

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
defense inside out we made them think

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.720 
defense inside out we made them think
and<00:01:51.020> actually<00:01:51.380> for<00:01:51.650> a<00:01:51.710> good<00:01:52.100> part<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.520> that

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
and actually for a good part of that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.300 
and actually for a good part of that
quarter<00:01:53.120> we<00:01:53.240> were<00:01:53.390> winning<00:01:53.620> and<00:01:54.620> still<00:01:55.130> had

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
quarter we were winning and still had

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.820 
quarter we were winning and still had
opportunity<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.200> pinch<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.290> at<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.650> end

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
opportunity to pinch that at the end

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.380 
opportunity to pinch that at the end
there<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:58.250> at<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.460> end<00:01:58.490> of<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.760> game<00:01:58.790> we<00:01:59.120> felt

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
there so at the end of the game we felt

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.200 
there so at the end of the game we felt
as<00:01:59.480> if<00:01:59.510> we'd<00:01:59.720> actually<00:01:59.840> really<00:02:00.380> won<00:02:00.650> something

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
as if we'd actually really won something

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:11.570 
as if we'd actually really won something
despite<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.360> overall<00:02:02.720> result

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.640
