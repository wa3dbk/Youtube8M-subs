 I will also give you the reference doses 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:47.730
 then for the stuffing 200 g of mushrooms 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.030
 sautéed 100 g of dried quinoa 30 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.460
 grams of grated Parmesan cheese 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.850
 100 g of brambles or a pinch of salt 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.960
 clearly 20 grams of flaxseed e 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.930
 30 grams of sunflower seeds after having 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.540
 prepared our light brisè pasta ho 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.400
 put the sheet on a sheet of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.470
 baking paper and then the most has 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.680
 positioned above a base of one 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.229
 zipper pan with a diameter of 24 cm 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.930
 very well now we proceed with the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.549
 the quinoa filling is dried 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.130
 to speed things up 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.470
 I 've already cooked it after rinsed file 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.990
 to remove all the saponins then the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.479
 substances that would also confer a 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.350
 Amarostic flavor to the final dish then 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.409
 cooked in water with a goccino of oil 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.009
 and then clearly lohan salt to taste 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.390
 now let us proceed that peace of yours 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.520
 we prepared in sautéed mushrooms 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.280
 also for this recipe I will put the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.189
 link at the end of the video and now I have paid them 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.049
 inside a becker and with a mixer 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.740
 by immersion of three I love you so 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.470
 coarse 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.070
 once the mushrooms are chopped we can 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.659
 also combine with quinoa and in the meantime yes 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.240
 is clearly warmed up a 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.729
 important precaution considering that the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.069
 quinoa should cook for which indexes 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.950
 maximum 20 minutes but considering that 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.510
 then we go to cook our cake 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.130
 salty at the bottom I recommend you 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.420
 hold the queen or some back 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:26.230
 cooking then ten minutes are 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:29.739
 enough now we also join the 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.519
 robiola you can also use 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.110
 lean ricotta 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.819
 if you don't particularly like the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.140
 taste of this cheese and mix 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.390
 once mixed with ingredients 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.989
 we can also add cheese 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.360
 grated parmesan about 30 grams if la 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.239
 consistency seems too fluid 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.670
 you can also add some bread 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.130
 grated a spoon or two in the base 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.130
 in short, the consistency of your mix 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.900
 we have finished mixing it too 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.549
 adjust the salt and this is the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.350
 ideal consistency 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.859
 now we can pour ours 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:13.320
 compound in the center of the sheet of 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.320
 brisè pasta like this 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:24.320
 let's level the surface with 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:29.050
 the wooden ladle and then close the 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.050
 villages inland as well 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.920
 that's why I told you before 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.500
 arrange the brisè pasta sheet 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.690
 directly on the base of the pan a 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:46.160
 hinge to facilitate the putting in short 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:48.600
 in the form of the cake we can now 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.360
 sprinkle the surface also with gods 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:56.390
 flaxseed however give a touch of 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:03.440
 crunchiness even if then the pasta 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.440
 directly and with sunflower seeds 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:21.410
 now we just have to trap the 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:24.840
 our pie and bake at 180 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.639
 maximum 200 degrees for about 50 minutes 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.440
 until the whole if it will be 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:33.660
 perfectly dried after 50 minutes 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.850
 this is the result of cooking 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.800
 a first course disguised as a cake 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.030
 salty this is an example of how in 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.639
 cook and be able to transform 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.760
 easily a simple ingredient too 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.139
 like quinoa in a light explosion 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.650
 of truth to try 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.650
 undoubtedly
