00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.940
 just hello my friends are your 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.610
 friends of the guanches and today we are 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.500
 we will teach an accordion not 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.150
 we still play but we finish it 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.490
 to buy more to advise the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.340
 people this accordion on ebay costs like 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.980
 450 dollars some do not come with scraps 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.820
 but we find it in guitar 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.630
 center for 400 closed with everything and 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.699
 Italian extras a book looks very good 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.700
 to start it to start learning 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.040
 it sounds pretty good the truth is not not 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.170
 the great thing but, but I think that 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.920
 a good musician can get good at 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.219
 this or the sound is called 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.589
 accordion panthers are the plants is 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.589
 as a cheap edition that they did 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.240
 for the people and the truth many many 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:59.540
 They are using them and it is 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.830
 and these are made in Chinese in China not 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.930
 They are German but they are good of the tone 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.340
 Sun 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.940
 I imagine they have the other tone 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.390
 so that's where the sound of 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.250
 a little bit slow here we are 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.010
 doing a little review we are not 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.530
 professionals but let's keep going 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.940
 to upload this virus of things that we go 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.470
 buying for you to leave 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.470
 giving an idea because sometimes 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.539
 over gunners 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.390
 sounds very good putting the basses of the 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.530
 plant 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.540
 but many of them 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.670
 you can deactivate it in the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.920
 comments please do not put me 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.540
 they do not work because we do not serve 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.530

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.530

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.119
 Well, I guess this guy is easier 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.190

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:12.569
