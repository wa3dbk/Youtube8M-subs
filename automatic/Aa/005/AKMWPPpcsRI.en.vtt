00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.000
 the large amounts of a remote district no longer 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.860
 I am loading many players 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 that will not hurt easily 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.330
 you think about it 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.410
 in our house as the fivefold 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.560
 halle / Westphalia 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.260
 right back after halftime 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.260
 the farmers expect 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.650
 to the other subject 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.629
 in some other countries 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.039
 and that is her and all that nothing can not hear anything in the world 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.770
 you just have to solve the problem Ernst Axmann 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.710
 the rents are no longer 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.940
 do not stop at the moment 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.930
 the three friends at Rax do not do a apprenticeship this one 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.400
 decision 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.310
 because it's not my family anymore 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.100
 the problems can be exactly that the devices would have to grow 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.090
 many names 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.820
 Kroos was not only allowed to do it 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.020
 of course you have never been to his house pick 1 no one sees the pacific 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.120
 a student is that these now catch up to spend 7 billion 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.590
 On Saturday the players took place and Hannah Arendt Mark Braun 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.930
 more 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.190
 we both meet with OPEC equal to each other years he perceives them 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.460
 but at first it is nothing more than an uncertain one 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.850
 of course I have no control 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.930
 were welcome 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.620
 that is of course a very extraordinary person approx 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
 like 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 but that was not when he said that 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.190
 unfortunately it is often easy 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.890
 from their class teachers also went through the hair 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.630
 he is going to change dramatically if anyone knows

 Fritzen this commercial exist 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.049

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.560
 Raich is fourth 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.379
