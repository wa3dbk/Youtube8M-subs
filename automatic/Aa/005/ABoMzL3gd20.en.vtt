00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.790 
amazing okay and the cinemas are good so
but<00:00:21.630> if<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.140> see<00:00:22.290> here<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
but if you can see here this is the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200 
but if you can see here this is the
controller<00:00:23.220> scheme<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.640> can<00:00:23.790> choose<00:00:24.000> between

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
controller scheme you can choose between

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.600 
controller scheme you can choose between
a<00:00:24.630> B<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.290> C<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> have<00:00:25.650> no<00:00:25.830> idea<00:00:26.099> what<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.400> says

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
a B and C I have no idea what that says

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:41.119 
a B and C I have no idea what that says
yeah<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:29.689> I'm<00:00:30.689> going<00:00:31.079> with<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.259> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.220 

so<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:42.090> load<00:00:42.359> times<00:00:42.629> are<00:00:42.750> actually<00:00:43.019> pretty

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
so the load times are actually pretty

00:00:43.230 --> 00:01:04.369 
so the load times are actually pretty
long<00:00:46.940> but<00:00:48.199> use<00:00:49.199> the<00:00:49.350> Simla<00:01:02.239> now<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.229> know

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
long but use the Simla now if you know

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.560 
long but use the Simla now if you know
what<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.559> says<00:01:04.920> what<00:01:05.789> that<00:01:05.940> means<00:01:06.149> let<00:01:06.539> me

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
what that says what that means let me

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:28.100 
what that says what that means let me
know<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.470> translation<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.750> look<00:01:27.929> at<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
know or do translation you look at the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.980 
know or do translation you look at the
graphics<00:01:28.530> are<00:01:28.619> amazing<00:01:28.860> there<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:30.690> camera

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
graphics are amazing there so the camera

00:01:30.990 --> 00:02:29.110 
graphics are amazing there so the camera
doesn't<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.319> it<00:01:31.440> justice

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.089 

it<00:02:30.120> looks<00:02:30.269> like<00:02:30.359> a<00:02:30.420> mattress<00:02:31.099> episode

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
it looks like a mattress episode

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:45.220 
it looks like a mattress episode
actually<00:02:32.310> looks<00:02:32.849> really<00:02:33.090> good

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:54.459 

all<00:02:46.230> right<00:02:46.379> so<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> guess<00:02:46.739> play<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.159> game<00:02:47.310> now

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:54.469 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:03:05.539 

it<00:02:55.469> actually<00:02:55.620> looks<00:02:55.859> really<00:02:56.459> good<00:03:02.269> so<00:03:04.549> I

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
it actually looks really good so I

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.729 
it actually looks really good so I
played<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.000> mat<00:03:06.419> cross<00:03:06.629> ace<00:03:06.870> frontier<00:03:07.439> so

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
played the mat cross ace frontier so

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:16.420 
played the mat cross ace frontier so
whole<00:03:07.889> plates<00:03:08.129> the<00:03:08.280> same<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.549> boost

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:30.930 

Rissa<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.670> lock<00:03:21.020> here<00:03:22.020> we<00:03:22.110> go

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.120 

so<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.060> d-pad<00:03:32.450> controls<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:33.380> attorney<00:03:34.040> of

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
so the d-pad controls the attorney of

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.309 
so the d-pad controls the attorney of
the<00:03:34.220> plane<00:03:34.630> this<00:03:35.630> controls<00:03:36.170> your

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
the plane this controls your

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.740 
the plane this controls your
transformations<00:03:37.069> and<00:03:37.520> this<00:03:38.270> is<00:03:38.450> just<00:03:38.660> your

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
transformations and this is just your

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:55.470 
transformations and this is just your
camera<00:03:39.080> view<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:40.160> other<00:03:40.250> analog<00:03:40.700> stick

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.920 

and<00:03:55.989> that<00:03:56.349> wasn't<00:03:56.500> me

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.360 

there<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:04.920> go

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:05:00.000 

where<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.489> go

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:15.320 

now

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.610 

looks<00:05:15.960> like<00:05:16.110> I'm<00:05:16.229> going<00:05:16.500> up<00:05:16.590> against<00:05:16.860> that<00:05:16.919> guy

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
looks like I'm going up against that guy

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:29.980 
looks like I'm going up against that guy
lock<00:05:19.620> on

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.420 

the<00:05:30.990> L<00:05:31.320> trigger<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:31.770> think<00:05:32.100> makes<00:05:32.280> your

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
the L trigger I think makes your

00:05:32.430 --> 00:06:05.600 
the L trigger I think makes your
pinpoint<00:05:32.730> barrier<00:05:33.300> system

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:41.919 

so<00:06:06.120> like<00:06:06.300> is

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:41.929 

00:06:41.929 --> 00:07:31.190
