00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
got for the garage which is just about I

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.589 
got for the garage which is just about I
think<00:00:24.750> it's<00:00:24.930> five<00:00:25.140> rolls<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:26.390> screen<00:00:27.390> material

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
think it's five rolls of screen material

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.279 
think it's five rolls of screen material
and<00:00:28.550> did<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.640> pretty<00:00:29.849> decent<00:00:30.029> job<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.510> keeping

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
and did a pretty decent job of keeping

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.150 
and did a pretty decent job of keeping
bugs<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.210> dust<00:00:33.210> out<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.780> even<00:00:34.710> catches<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
bugs and dust out and even catches a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.240 
bugs and dust out and even catches a
little<00:00:35.430> bit<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.610> overspray<00:00:36.500> which<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.890> don't

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
little bit of overspray which I don't

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.209 
little bit of overspray which I don't
know<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.640> see<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:38.969> anymore<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:40.219> it's

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
know if you can see it anymore but it's

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.709 
know if you can see it anymore but it's
easier<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.579> see<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.910> during<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.180> night<00:00:43.250> but<00:00:44.719> let

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
easier to see it during a night but let

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.640 
easier to see it during a night but let
me<00:00:45.780> show<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.230> got<00:00:46.410> here

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.150 

but<00:00:51.220> I<00:00:51.280> think<00:00:51.520> I<00:00:51.610> did<00:00:51.760> a<00:00:51.790> pretty<00:00:52.000> decent<00:00:52.690> job

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
but I think I did a pretty decent job

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.640 
but I think I did a pretty decent job
spraying<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.310> fenders<00:00:54.760> I<00:00:55.170> had<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.200> couple<00:00:56.470> of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
spraying the fenders I had a couple of

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.670 
spraying the fenders I had a couple of
little<00:00:56.800> snags<00:00:58.980> spraying<00:00:59.980> them<00:01:01.290> such<00:01:02.290> as<00:01:02.500> this

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
little snags spraying them such as this

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.180 
little snags spraying them such as this
right<00:01:02.980> here<00:01:04.080> probably<00:01:05.080> wasn't<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.740> best<00:01:05.980> way

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
right here probably wasn't the best way

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.060 
right here probably wasn't the best way
to<00:01:06.220> spray<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:08.110> bolting<00:01:08.440> up<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.680> fenders

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
to spray it just bolting up the fenders

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.180 
to spray it just bolting up the fenders
and<00:01:09.100> having<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:09.910> plastic<00:01:10.180> next<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:11.190> because

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
and having a plastic next to because

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.520 
and having a plastic next to because
there's<00:01:12.970> this<00:01:13.180> spot<00:01:13.450> here<00:01:13.780> that<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:14.050> got<00:01:14.200> into

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.280 

but<00:02:34.720> they<00:02:35.230> came<00:02:35.410> out<00:02:35.560> pretty<00:02:35.740> nice<00:02:36.150> for<00:02:37.150> a

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
but they came out pretty nice for a

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:47.430 
but they came out pretty nice for a
cheap<00:02:38.290> paint

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.240 

the<00:02:47.770> gun<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.010> used<00:02:48.160> was<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:49.560> Harbor<00:02:50.560> Freight<00:02:50.590> I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
the gun I used was a Harbor Freight I

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.840 
the gun I used was a Harbor Freight I
think<00:02:54.250> was<00:02:54.370> like<00:02:54.400> 35<00:02:54.820> bucks<00:02:56.460> here<00:02:57.460> it<00:02:57.520> is<00:02:57.640> right

a purple Harbor Freight gun anyways it
worked<00:03:03.580> pretty<00:03:03.700> good<00:03:03.900> pretty<00:03:04.900> decent<00:03:05.350> I<00:03:05.760> set

it<00:03:06.880> at<00:03:07.350> 45<00:03:08.350> psi<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:09.370> spray<00:03:09.640> everything<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.930> it

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
it at 45 psi to spray everything and it

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.710 
it at 45 psi to spray everything and it
came<00:03:11.230> out<00:03:11.410> pretty<00:03:11.590> nice<00:03:11.860> and<00:03:12.190> here's<00:03:12.370> the

summit<00:03:13.720> paint<00:03:13.990> I<00:03:14.320> think<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.340> was<00:03:15.430> about<00:03:15.550> 80

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270

summit paint I think it was about 80
bucks<00:03:16.600> for<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:18.070> gallon<00:03:18.990> for<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.050> hugger

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
anyways is pretty inexpensive and

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.090 
anyways is pretty inexpensive and
sprayed<00:03:28.690> out<00:03:28.870> pretty<00:03:29.140> good<00:03:29.410> you<00:03:29.770> can<00:03:29.860> see<00:03:29.980> the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.390 
sprayed out pretty good you can see the
mess<00:03:30.520> that<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.790> made<00:03:30.820> here<00:03:31.500> but<00:03:32.500> let<00:03:32.920> me<00:03:33.010> move<00:03:33.160> on

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
mess that I made here but let me move on

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
mess that I made here but let me move on
to<00:03:33.670> some<00:03:34.240> of<00:03:34.300> these<00:03:34.390> other<00:03:34.630> fenders<00:03:36.360> so<00:03:37.360> you

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
to some of these other fenders so you

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.930 
to some of these other fenders so you
can<00:03:37.540> just<00:03:37.660> kind<00:03:37.900> of<00:03:37.960> see<00:03:38.140> how<00:03:38.640> they<00:03:39.640> came<00:03:39.880> out

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
can just kind of see how they came out

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.270 
can just kind of see how they came out
but<00:03:40.600> they're<00:03:40.750> looking<00:03:40.870> pretty<00:03:41.050> good<00:03:41.530> there's

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
but they're looking pretty good there's

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.260 
but they're looking pretty good there's
you<00:03:42.550> can<00:03:42.670> see<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.880> SAG<00:03:43.980> right<00:03:44.980> there<00:03:45.340> we'll

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
you can see a SAG right there we'll

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.940 
you can see a SAG right there we'll
still<00:03:46.450> have<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.870> sand<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.380> out<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.770> then

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
still have to sand that out and then

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.240 
still have to sand that out and then
there's<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.670> little<00:03:48.910> bit<00:03:49.210> of<00:03:49.620> paint<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.920> came

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
there's a little bit of paint that came

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.910 
there's a little bit of paint that came
off<00:03:51.490> because<00:03:51.760> of<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.810> plastic<00:03:53.050> touched<00:03:53.620> it

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
off because of the plastic touched it

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.380 
off because of the plastic touched it
but

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
but

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.210 
but
nothing<00:03:56.110> a<00:03:56.170> little<00:03:56.260> bit<00:03:56.470> of<00:03:56.590> touching<00:03:57.100> up

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
nothing a little bit of touching up

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.690 
nothing a little bit of touching up
can't<00:03:57.550> fix<00:03:58.290> but<00:03:59.290> this<00:03:59.740> is<00:03:59.800> my<00:03:59.890> first<00:04:00.190> time<00:04:00.400> to

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
can't fix but this is my first time to

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.110 
can't fix but this is my first time to
spray<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:02.950> think<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:03.520> came<00:04:03.700> out<00:04:03.880> pretty

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
spray and I think that came out pretty

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.990 
spray and I think that came out pretty
nice

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.210 

so<00:04:08.570> what<00:04:08.870> I'm<00:04:08.960> going<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.170> do<00:04:09.350> is<00:04:09.680> just<00:04:09.950> hit<00:04:10.160> it

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
so what I'm going to do is just hit it

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.180 
so what I'm going to do is just hit it
with<00:04:10.310> some<00:04:10.700> 400<00:04:11.450> grit<00:04:11.600> sandpaper<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:13.040> get

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
with some 400 grit sandpaper to get

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.500 
with some 400 grit sandpaper to get
those<00:04:13.370> sags<00:04:13.640> out<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.740> it's<00:04:15.740> really<00:04:15.950> not<00:04:16.160> much

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
those sags out and it's really not much

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.140

dust here and there

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.810 
dust here and there
I'll<00:04:45.260> have<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.560> cleanest<00:04:45.980> garage<00:04:46.750> so

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.390 

that's<00:04:51.390> why<00:04:51.540> there's<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.870> crap<00:04:52.110> in<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.470> paint<00:04:53.370> I

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
that's why there's a crap in the paint I

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.940 
that's why there's a crap in the paint I
think<00:04:54.210> this<00:04:54.420> fender<00:04:54.810> here<00:04:55.140> had<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.770> most

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
think this fender here had the most

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.940 
think this fender here had the most
problems<00:04:56.460> you<00:04:57.300> can<00:04:57.450> see<00:04:57.630> some<00:04:58.370> sag<00:04:59.660> sagging

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
problems you can see some sag sagging

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.290 
problems you can see some sag sagging
going<00:05:01.950> on<00:05:02.040> right<00:05:02.280> there<00:05:02.310> so<00:05:02.730> I'll<00:05:02.820> have<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.090> fix

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
going on right there so I'll have to fix

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.659 
going on right there so I'll have to fix
that

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.770 

we<00:05:07.030> all<00:05:07.210> in<00:05:07.389> off<00:05:07.509> came<00:05:07.780> out<00:05:07.930> pretty<00:05:08.110> good

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.980 

I<00:05:11.810> think<00:05:12.260> there's<00:05:12.440> a<00:05:12.530> little<00:05:12.710> more<00:05:12.800> sag<00:05:13.990> right

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
I think there's a little more sag right

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.180 
I think there's a little more sag right
there<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:17.120> I<00:05:17.480> guess<00:05:17.690> that's<00:05:17.870> a<00:05:18.170> little<00:05:19.040> piece

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
there and I guess that's a little piece

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.130 
there and I guess that's a little piece
of<00:05:19.400> trash<00:05:19.640> right<00:05:19.850> there<00:05:20.210> you<00:05:20.390> can<00:05:20.540> kind<00:05:20.870> of<00:05:20.930> see

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
of trash right there you can kind of see

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.930 
of trash right there you can kind of see
it<00:05:21.290> in<00:05:21.530> the<00:05:22.490> light<00:05:22.670> over<00:05:22.940> here

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940
