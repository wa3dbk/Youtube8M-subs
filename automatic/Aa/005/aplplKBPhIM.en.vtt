00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
one right here this model is very

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.930 
one right here this model is very
similar<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.230> 19<00:00:10.650> kV<00:00:11.099> which<00:00:11.250> we<00:00:11.400> also<00:00:11.580> have

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
similar to the 19 kV which we also have

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.570 
similar to the 19 kV which we also have
here<00:00:12.179> both<00:00:12.630> were<00:00:12.929> two<00:00:13.230> wireless<00:00:13.620> microphones

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
the only difference is that this one you

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.700 
the only difference is that this one you
can<00:00:17.400> lay<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> mic<00:00:17.940> down<00:00:18.270> or<00:00:18.600> have<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.380> sitting

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
upright like this as well but there's

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.840 
upright like this as well but there's
really<00:00:21.810> two<00:00:22.230> other<00:00:22.470> differences<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.430> are

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
really two other differences that are

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.179 
really two other differences that are
very<00:00:24.600> interesting<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.529> model<00:00:25.920> for<00:00:26.039> instance
