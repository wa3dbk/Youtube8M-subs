Volkswagen bus camper version so many
people<00:00:08.880> ask<00:00:09.059> me<00:00:09.210> about<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:11.120> some<00:00:12.120> other<00:00:12.269> people

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
people ask me about it some other people

people ask me about it some other people
ask<00:00:12.780> me<00:00:12.960> about<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.380> pictures<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.309> engine

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
ask me about the pictures of the engine

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.849 
ask me about the pictures of the engine
and<00:00:14.880> underneath<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.809> car<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.289> realize

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
and underneath of the car so I realize

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.859 
and underneath of the car so I realize
it's<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.520> probably<00:00:17.730> easier<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.359> just

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
it's going to be probably easier to just

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.689 
it's going to be probably easier to just
shoot<00:00:19.830> some<00:00:20.390> movie<00:00:21.390> about<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.490> this<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.550> how

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
shoot some movie about it so this is how

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.410 
shoot some movie about it so this is how
the<00:00:23.910> engine<00:00:24.420> looks<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:26.119> 1.6<00:00:27.119> turbo

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the engine looks like is 1.6 turbo

the engine looks like is 1.6 turbo
diesel<00:00:28.640> this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:31.219> turbo<00:00:32.219> for<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.640> I

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
diesel this is the turbo for it I

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.900 
diesel this is the turbo for it I
believe<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.960> some<00:00:34.950> oil<00:00:35.219> cooler<00:00:35.700> down<00:00:36.270> there

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
believe and some oil cooler down there

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.780 
believe and some oil cooler down there
alternator<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.510> battery

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
alternator and the battery

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.799 
alternator and the battery
that's<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> spirit<00:00:42.270> talk<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> coolant

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
that's the spirit talk for the coolant

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.940 
that's the spirit talk for the coolant
solenoid<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.280> let's<00:00:47.910> see<00:00:48.180> how<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:49.289> inside<00:00:49.800> of

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
solenoid and let's see how the inside of

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.709 
solenoid and let's see how the inside of
the<00:00:50.100> car<00:00:50.309> looks<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:52.670> pretty<00:00:53.670> nuts<00:00:53.969> pretty

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the car looks like pretty nuts pretty

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.560 
the car looks like pretty nuts pretty
much<00:00:55.500> needs<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.309> restoration<00:00:57.090> but<00:00:57.120> it

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
much needs like the restoration but it

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.470 
much needs like the restoration but it
doesn't<00:00:57.899> look<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.079> bad<00:00:59.059> got<00:01:00.059> some<00:01:00.270> rust

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
doesn't look that bad got some rust

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.830 
doesn't look that bad got some rust
spots<00:01:02.030> but<00:01:03.030> some<00:01:03.329> shafts<00:01:08.479> there<00:01:09.479> are<00:01:09.630> some

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
spots but some shafts there are some

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.590 
spots but some shafts there are some
coatings<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.430> they're<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.909> origin<00:01:12.420> also

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
coatings are so they're like origin also

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.170 
coatings are so they're like origin also
I<00:01:13.189> believe<00:01:14.189> there<00:01:14.400> are<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.520> little<00:01:14.670> bit<00:01:14.820> Sun

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
I believe there are a little bit Sun

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
I got some spare lights for it too I

I got some spare lights for it too I
have<00:01:33.750> those<00:01:37.460> mark<00:01:38.460> signals<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.450> somewhere<00:01:40.020> I

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
have those mark signals to somewhere I

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:54.190 
have those mark signals to somewhere I
believe<00:01:41.840> here<00:01:42.840> are<00:01:45.830> sliding<00:01:46.830> doors

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.690 

like<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.380> said<00:01:55.790> canvas<00:01:56.790> for<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.590> pop-up<00:01:58.700> who

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
like I said canvas for the pop-up who

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.300 
like I said canvas for the pop-up who
needs<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.330> be<00:02:00.450> replaced

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.449 

more<00:02:52.400> rust<00:02:53.260> around<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:54.890> here<00:02:55.130> is<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
more rust around it and here is the

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.040 
more rust around it and here is the
radiator<00:02:57.099> originally<00:02:58.099> there<00:02:58.310> was<00:02:58.489> a<00:02:58.550> fun

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050

radiator originally there was a fun
there<00:03:00.050> was<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.200> fan<00:03:00.500> like<00:03:00.830> behind<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.489> but<00:03:02.470> the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
there was a fan like behind it but the

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.339 
there was a fan like behind it but the
radiator<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:04.489> big<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.180> guy<00:03:05.390> who<00:03:05.989> built

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
radiator is so big and the guy who built

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.520 
radiator is so big and the guy who built
that<00:03:06.650> said<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:08.239> fan<00:03:08.450> never<00:03:08.720> never<00:03:09.200> really

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
that said the fan never never really

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
that said the fan never never really
liked<00:03:09.680> turn<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.130> on<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:10.670> he<00:03:11.450> just<00:03:11.660> removed<00:03:12.110> it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
liked turn it on so he just removed it

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.320 
liked turn it on so he just removed it
didn't<00:03:13.550> need<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.850> anymore<00:03:15.850> let's<00:03:16.850> see<00:03:17.150> the

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
didn't need it anymore let's see the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:27.600 
didn't need it anymore let's see the
other<00:03:17.540> side<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.290> car

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.960 

the<00:03:28.610> tires<00:03:28.910> are<00:03:29.650> actually<00:03:30.650> good<00:03:31.340> but<00:03:31.730> they're

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
the tires are actually good but they're

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.770 
the tires are actually good but they're
like<00:03:32.209> pretty<00:03:32.450> old<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:34.090> got<00:03:35.090> some<00:03:35.390> cracks

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
like pretty old and got some cracks

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.250 
like pretty old and got some cracks
around<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:36.470> especially<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:38.390> here<00:03:38.840> close<00:03:39.230> to

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
around it especially like here close to

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.440 
around it especially like here close to
the<00:03:39.620> threat<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.400> would<00:03:40.580> replace<00:03:40.970> them<00:03:41.299> if

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
the threat so I would replace them if
