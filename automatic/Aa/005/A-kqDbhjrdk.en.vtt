has<00:01:29.079> sort<00:01:29.229> of<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.380> plastic<00:01:30.869> edge<00:01:31.869> to<00:01:32.619> it<00:01:34.439> you

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
has sort of a plastic edge to it you

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.279 
has sort of a plastic edge to it you
guys<00:01:35.740> did<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:35.979> right<00:01:36.340> there<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.109> same

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
guys did that right there do the same

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.899 
guys did that right there do the same
thing<00:01:38.469> over<00:01:38.619> here

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.920 

so<00:01:44.909> what<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.060> did<00:01:45.120> there<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.510> that<00:01:45.600> it's<00:01:45.750> made<00:01:45.900> a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
so what I did there is that it's made a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.260 
so what I did there is that it's made a
little<00:01:46.080> shelf<00:01:46.580> and<00:01:47.580> you<00:01:47.670> take<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> back<00:01:48.240> part

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
little shelf and you take the back part

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.570 
little shelf and you take the back part
here<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.380> bend<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> out<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.550> that

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
here and you just bend it out like that

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.670 
here and you just bend it out like that
so<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:52.050> can<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.610> how<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.729> looks<00:01:53.880> there<00:01:54.680> from

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
so you can see how it looks there from

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.180 
so you can see how it looks there from
all<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.979> sides<00:01:56.780> all<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.100> might

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
all the sides all right so you might

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.249 
all the sides all right so you might
have<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> know<00:02:00.000> finagle<00:02:00.690> it<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:01.050> bit

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
have to you know finagle it a little bit

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.430 
have to you know finagle it a little bit
but<00:02:02.570> in<00:02:03.570> general<00:02:04.820> that<00:02:06.320> there's<00:02:07.320> your

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
but in general that there's your

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.630 
but in general that there's your
horizontal<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:10.350> then<00:02:10.590> test<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.220> does<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
horizontal and then test is does the

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.479 
horizontal and then test is does the
vertical<00:02:12.000> work<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.950> vertical<00:02:14.310> works

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
vertical work and the vertical works

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.430 
vertical work and the vertical works
there<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.239> your<00:02:15.900> vertical

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
there you go your vertical

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.500 
there you go your vertical
so<00:02:17.010> there's<00:02:17.400> your<00:02:17.520> iPad<00:02:17.850> stand<00:02:18.680> for<00:02:19.680> two<00:02:19.830> bucks

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
so there's your iPad stand for two bucks

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.910 
so there's your iPad stand for two bucks
