00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
about those two Venn diagrams it's got

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.000 
about those two Venn diagrams it's got
to<00:02:41.310> be<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> tiny<00:02:42.239> sliver<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.019> middle<00:02:43.290> there

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
to be a tiny sliver in the middle there

footage of this once you have it I

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.699 
footage of this once you have it I
really<00:02:47.940> want<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.209> what<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> big<00:02:48.720> deal<00:02:49.019> is

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
really want to see what the big deal is

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.400 
really want to see what the big deal is
what<00:02:50.640> getting<00:02:50.879> back<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.299> PES<00:02:51.510> specifically

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
what getting back to PES specifically

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.589 
what getting back to PES specifically
and<00:02:52.560> how<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.860> stacks<00:02:53.220> up<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.940> more

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
and how it stacks up to the more

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.430 
and how it stacks up to the more
prevalent<00:02:55.470> FIFA<00:02:55.980> 15<00:02:57.079> apparently<00:02:58.079> people<00:02:58.349> are

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
prevalent FIFA 15 apparently people are

in<00:02:59.250> two<00:02:59.459> different<00:02:59.489> camps<00:02:59.849> some<00:03:00.180> surprise

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
in two different camps some surprise

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.809 
in two different camps some surprise
think<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.349> gameplay<00:03:02.129> in<00:03:02.250> PES<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.610> better

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
think that the gameplay in PES is better

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.970 
think that the gameplay in PES is better
tighter<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.720> little<00:03:03.870> bit<00:03:04.079> more<00:03:04.170> responsive<00:03:04.739> a

tighter a little bit more responsive a
little<00:03:05.190> more<00:03:05.310> fair<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.239> then<00:03:07.049> some<00:03:07.290> people

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
little more fair and then some people

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.759 
little more fair and then some people
are<00:03:07.709> fifa<00:03:08.250> stalwarts<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.060> say<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:09.630> know<00:03:09.769> good

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
are fifa stalwarts and say you know good

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.550 
are fifa stalwarts and say you know good
effort<00:03:10.920> PES<00:03:11.519> but<00:03:11.790> once<00:03:11.970> again<00:03:12.090> i<00:03:12.480> prefer<00:03:13.200> fifa

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
effort PES but once again i prefer fifa

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.470 
effort PES but once again i prefer fifa
I<00:03:13.709> think<00:03:14.069> that<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.459> highly<00:03:14.790> subjective<00:03:14.970> and

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
I think that is highly subjective and

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.670 
I think that is highly subjective and
depends<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.840> what<00:03:15.959> you're<00:03:16.109> looking<00:03:16.139> for<00:03:16.560> out

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
that is a little bit more black and

did<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.889> comparison<00:03:26.250> video<00:03:26.730> where<00:03:27.239> he<00:03:27.269> does<00:03:27.810> a

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
did a comparison video where he does a

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.020 
did a comparison video where he does a
split<00:03:28.079> screen<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.410> he<00:03:28.470> shows<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.950> fifa<00:03:29.730> and

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
split screen and he shows you fifa and

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.300 
split screen and he shows you fifa and
he<00:03:30.150> shows<00:03:30.389> you<00:03:30.510> PES<00:03:30.720> running<00:03:31.079> side<00:03:31.260> by<00:03:31.290> side<00:03:31.680> I

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
he shows you PES running side by side I

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.199 
he shows you PES running side by side I
think<00:03:33.000> both<00:03:33.150> games<00:03:33.389> look<00:03:33.599> really<00:03:33.900> good<00:03:34.079> I

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209

think both games look really good I
would<00:03:36.209> that<00:03:36.989> would<00:03:37.109> venture<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.530> say<00:03:37.709> that

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
would that would venture to say that

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.000 
would that would venture to say that
FIFA<00:03:38.730> does<00:03:39.090> look<00:03:39.480> better<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.680> effort

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
FIFA does look better and the effort

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.650 
FIFA does look better and the effort
that<00:03:41.040> they<00:03:41.160> put<00:03:41.250> into<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.849> new<00:03:41.970> player<00:03:42.209> models

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660
