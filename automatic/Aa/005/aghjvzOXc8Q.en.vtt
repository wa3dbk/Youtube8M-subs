00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:05.753
If YOU are experiencing an ongoing problem
with a slow charging phone or device, have

00:00:05.753 --> 00:00:10.494
you ever considered that the problem might
be that your device is not getting, what it

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:19.134
needs?

00:00:19.134 --> 00:00:23.473
These days more than ever people are experiencing
the problem of having a slow charging phone

00:00:23.473 --> 00:00:24.544
or device.

00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:29.494
Now nearly all new devices out there at this
point in time, are using a 5 volt charging

00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:33.924
system with a cord that has an end that looks
just like this.

00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:38.834
Because this is a standard male end of a USB
cord, it can be plugged into many places to

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:40.244
receive a charge!

00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:47.244
For example, charging adapters either for
home or car, laptops, desktop PC's and Mac's,

00:00:47.244 --> 00:00:50.723
media players, TV's... the list goes on!

00:00:50.723 --> 00:00:55.624
For older or smaller phones and devices this
was the perfect way to easily charge your

00:00:55.624 --> 00:01:00.483
device almost anywhere, provided, you had
a USB cord.

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:02.093
Now here comes the problem.

00:01:02.093 --> 00:01:07.424
Newer LARGER phones and devices out there
require more electrical current than many

00:01:07.424 --> 00:01:09.644
of these ports can produce!

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:16.404
For example, a standard Laptop USB port can
produce an output current of 500 milliamps.

00:01:16.404 --> 00:01:19.314
This is sufficient to charge something that
is small.

00:01:19.314 --> 00:01:26.304
But for my Galaxy note 2 for example, it requires
a 2000 milliamp charge adapter to charge in

00:01:26.304 --> 00:01:28.314
a reasonable time.

00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:32.504
As a test, I ran my phone down to a 50 % state
of charge.

00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:37.494
To ensure there were no excessive loads on
at the time of the test, I shut off the WIFI,

00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:41.014
Bluetooth, and data, and kept the screen off
as well.

00:01:41.014 --> 00:01:46.874
I plugged my cord into another phone charger
rated at 1000 milliamperes of output, which

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:53.104
is double the output capacity for most USB
ports, and then let the phone charge for exactly

00:01:53.104 --> 00:01:54.954
1 hour.

00:01:54.954 --> 00:02:00.534
At the end, the phone's state of charge went
from 50% up to 62%.

00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:03.494
This is of course a very slow charge rate!

00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:07.844
If I was to have anything on my phone powered
up like the screen or WIFI, it would have

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:09.654
been even slower!

00:02:09.654 --> 00:02:14.454
Now by contrast when this test was repeated
using the supplied 2000 milliampere charger

00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:21.334
that came with my phone, the battery charge
state went from 50 % up to 91% in the same

00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:23.824
1 hour charge time!

00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:30.044
Now 1 of 2 things will happen when a low output
charger or USB port is used to charge a larger

00:02:30.044 --> 00:02:31.234
device.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:37.544
1 - If the charger or adapter cannot keep
up with the charge current the device is requesting,

00:02:37.544 --> 00:02:40.024
it may shut down all together.

00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:42.934
I have experienced this myself.

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:47.684
Or 2- If the phone or device senses that that
there isn't a sufficient supply of current

00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:52.414
coming up the charge cord, it will throttle
back the current draw to a safe, but very

00:02:52.414 --> 00:02:54.654
low amount.

00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:59.084
This is done to protect all chargers and USB
ports from damage if they can't handle the

00:02:59.084 --> 00:03:00.454
load.

00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:04.884
The one draw back is your battery will take
forever to charge!

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:05.884
So there you have it!

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:11.444
If you are experiencing a slow charge, check
to see the charge requirements of YOUR device!

00:03:11.444 --> 00:03:16.034
An easy way to do this is to take a look at
the output of the charge adapter that was

00:03:16.034 --> 00:03:21.834
supplied with your device, or look at your
manufacturer's website.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:26.574
One last note, I have encountered problems
even charging smaller phones with those cheap

00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:32.693
retractable charge adapter cords, so be weary
if you are considering the purchase of one.

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:37.464
The problem with those is that the wire is
so thin on some of them, that the charge current

00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:42.164
will be lost in the cord resulting in a very
slow charge.

00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:46.594
Hopefully this video has helped you in some
way, and, once again, thanks for watching!
