00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 see hello everyone welcome in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.450
 this new tutorial so there is a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.160
 subscriber who asked me a question he told me 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.809
 basically says how do you do for m 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.059
 registration and online connection 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.639
 on the internet which means how to do 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.130
 to send his site on a plot 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.380
 so it's simple of a you need a 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.630
 web host so I will put in 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.150
 description of the video sites that 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.789
 will allow you to house his 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.130
 content you have to know that hosting 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.990
 is not free certainly there are 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.320
 websites in hosted mode your site 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.670
 free in exchange for a few ads 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.820
 on the site 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.530
 so there is even one who offers you a 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.710
 free domain 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.750
 sazy represents the point free.fr that makes 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.760
 not very professional so the names of 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.390
 field for example points as point 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.210
 net and point fr are paying it costs 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.219
 not very expensive so nowadays it is 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 practically free so I will put 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.440
 in video media two sites 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.170
 so the first one that allows you to host 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:08.760
 free and the other pay for the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.430
 pea I advise you to swings and the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.799
 second thing you do not care is a line 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.689
 transfer protocol stand software so 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.130
 which will allow to transfer 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.220
 files on the web 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.960
 so for my part I use faizi in 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.540
 so I will also put in segments 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.360
 of the video the link so if you want 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.430
 everything is downloaded so is time 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.610
 web host your give the name of 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.409
 high so identifier and a word of 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.299
 past 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.460
 we will do a little test that we will create 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.140
 a page here we will say for example at 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.049
 pose that of the geeks and so you 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.280
 connected with the identifiers provides 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.680
 yet host you click on 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.460
 connection he went to get you so much 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.570
 files so you do doubleclick so 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.659
 we are ironed test.php here I am 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.149
 heads of dossi tutorial I created 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.610
 beforehand so you do double 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.430

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.630

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:17.660
 so if we go online Thursday on my 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.180

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.989
