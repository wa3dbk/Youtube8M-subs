a<00:02:25.930> question<00:02:26.170> for<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.650> yeah

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
a question for you yeah

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.310 
a question for you yeah
I<00:02:27.250> think<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:27.640> probably<00:02:27.850> this<00:02:28.030> matchup<00:02:28.570> in

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
I think it's probably this matchup in

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.290 
I think it's probably this matchup in
for<00:02:30.100> me<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.250> really<00:02:30.760> think<00:02:30.940> it's<00:02:31.030> gonna<00:02:31.120> be

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
for me I really think it's gonna be

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.020 
for me I really think it's gonna be
something<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.930> when<00:02:32.500> Tony<00:02:32.770> turns<00:02:33.070> for<00:02:33.910> the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
something like when Tony turns for the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.240 
something like when Tony turns for the
Sugar<00:02:34.750> Ray<00:02:34.900> Leonard<00:02:35.260> back<00:02:35.470> in<00:02:35.650> those<00:02:35.830> days<00:02:35.860> you
