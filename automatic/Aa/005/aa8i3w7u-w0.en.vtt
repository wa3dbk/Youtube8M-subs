 this paper on the ground what is this drawing 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.260

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.260
 go hunting for fireflies 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.030

 second form this cast 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.690
 I think we're not in the right place 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.849
 I think we've been too far 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.370
 impossible fireflies should be here 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.069
 at least maybe we can see 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.239
 monsters of the forest we see a moment 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:14.239
 I do not really like heaps 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:17.390
 is watched that it's delicious 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.390

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:38.180

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:38.180

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.740
 love agreement 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.049
 yeah 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.730
 yes I'll be spooked I'm surprised by you 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.710
 driving you know though that you have to 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.270
 slow down the night he was polite 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.410
 but I drove fast because I was 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.090
 member remains i'm sorry this is 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.459
 important to be very vigilant when 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.350
 you are driving in the dark 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.930
 when it's dark pedestrians and 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.730
 drivers do not see each other very well 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.020
 when you walk in the evening it's 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.360
 good to wear colored clothes 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.610
 clear or a reflective vest that the 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.450
 drivers will see if a 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.480
 car approaches 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.460
 do not panic stop you put yourself 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.860
 on the side and let the car pass 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.540
 before continuing it is the best 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.230
 way for you and the driver to be 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.780
 safe 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.850

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.480

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.260
 a street that you are not familiar with 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.670
 seemed very different at night and you 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.590

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.600
