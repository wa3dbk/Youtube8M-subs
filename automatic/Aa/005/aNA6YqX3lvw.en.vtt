pre-emerge pre-emergent on it and what

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.799 
pre-emerge pre-emergent on it and what
it<00:00:30.220> really<00:00:30.460> does<00:00:30.640> is<00:00:31.119> when<00:00:31.270> you<00:00:31.300> put<00:00:31.390> down<00:00:31.689> the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
fertilizer and it's got the pre-emergent

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.030 
fertilizer and it's got the pre-emergent
on<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:34.000> and<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.840> water<00:00:35.140> it<00:00:35.350> in<00:00:35.500> that's<00:00:35.770> really

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
on it and you water it in that's really

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.590 
on it and you water it in that's really
important<00:00:36.490> you<00:00:36.580> end<00:00:36.880> up<00:00:37.030> creating<00:00:37.270> this

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
important you end up creating this

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.650 
important you end up creating this
barrier<00:00:37.870> underneath<00:00:38.590> the<00:00:39.340> soil<00:00:39.580> and<00:00:39.940> these

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
barrier underneath the soil and these

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.050 
barrier underneath the soil and these
weed<00:00:40.900> seeds<00:00:41.230> as<00:00:41.500> they<00:00:42.040> try<00:00:42.310> to<00:00:42.340> emerge<00:00:42.790> they

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
weed seeds as they try to emerge they

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.090 
weed seeds as they try to emerge they
hit<00:00:43.270> this<00:00:43.450> chemical<00:00:43.810> barrier<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.530> they<00:00:44.950> die

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
hit this chemical barrier and they die

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.720 
hit this chemical barrier and they die
before<00:00:45.370> they<00:00:45.670> can<00:00:45.850> before<00:00:46.780> they<00:00:46.900> can<00:00:47.050> sprout<00:00:47.260> a

the way that that chemicals taken up it

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.510 
the way that that chemicals taken up it
doesn't<00:01:05.619> take<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:05.979> up<00:01:06.070> through<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.310> roots

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
doesn't take it up through the roots

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.640 
doesn't take it up through the roots
it's<00:01:06.759> got<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:07.060> go<00:01:07.149> through<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.450> leaves<00:01:07.630> so<00:01:08.620> a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
it's got to go through the leaves so a

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.070 
it's got to go through the leaves so a
couple<00:01:08.890> important<00:01:09.340> things<00:01:09.370> to<00:01:09.700> note<00:01:10.030> first<00:01:10.900> of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080

couple important things to note first of
all<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.320> want<00:01:11.500> to<00:01:11.620> make<00:01:11.740> sure<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:12.100> you<00:01:12.280> water

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
all you want to make sure that you water

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.660 
all you want to make sure that you water
just<00:01:13.780> lightly<00:01:14.470> prior<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.310> applying<00:01:15.490> the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
just lightly prior to applying the

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.950 
just lightly prior to applying the
product<00:01:16.030> so<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.390> leaves<00:01:16.570> are<00:01:16.750> wet<00:01:16.780> and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
product so that the leaves are wet and

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.719 
product so that the leaves are wet and
the<00:01:17.260> product<00:01:17.620> will<00:01:17.740> stick<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.220> leaves<00:01:18.430> and

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
the product will stick to the leaves and

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.910 
the product will stick to the leaves and
then<00:01:19.659> you<00:01:19.750> also<00:01:19.930> want<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.350> make<00:01:20.500> sure<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.830> you

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
then you also want to make sure that you

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.320 
then you also want to make sure that you
shut<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.310> irrigation<00:01:21.670> off<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.180> it<00:01:22.270> doesn't

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
shut the irrigation off so it doesn't

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.420 
shut the irrigation off so it doesn't
get<00:01:22.600> washed<00:01:22.840> off<00:01:23.080> it<00:01:23.229> has<00:01:23.320> time<00:01:23.560> to<00:01:23.770> be

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
get washed off it has time to be

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.399 
get washed off it has time to be
absorbed<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.299> taken<00:01:25.510> down<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.110> roots

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
absorbed and taken down to the roots

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.899 
absorbed and taken down to the roots
that's<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.890> way<00:01:27.010> that<00:01:27.190> it<00:01:27.280> carries<00:01:27.580> down<00:01:27.760> the

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
that's the way that it carries down the

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.960 
that's the way that it carries down the
chemical<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:29.770> another<00:01:30.040> common<00:01:30.880> mistake

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
chemical and then another common mistake

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.910 
chemical and then another common mistake
is<00:01:31.479> that<00:01:31.630> folks<00:01:31.870> will<00:01:32.140> think<00:01:32.619> that<00:01:32.680> they

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
is that folks will think that they

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.340 
is that folks will think that they
should<00:01:33.610> mow<00:01:34.119> the<00:01:34.299> lawn<00:01:34.450> prior<00:01:34.780> to<00:01:35.049> that

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
should mow the lawn prior to that

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.080 
should mow the lawn prior to that
that'll<00:01:35.560> be<00:01:35.590> better<00:01:35.890> though<00:01:36.159> they'll<00:01:36.790> get<00:01:36.970> the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
that'll be better though they'll get the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.490 
that'll be better though they'll get the
weeds<00:01:37.240> partially<00:01:37.750> mowed<00:01:37.930> down<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.380> then

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
weeds partially mowed down and then

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.649 
weeds partially mowed down and then
apply<00:01:38.770> it<00:01:38.799> but<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.159> problem<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.700> if<00:01:40.330> you<00:01:40.450> come

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
apply it but the problem is if you come

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.710 
apply it but the problem is if you come
in<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:40.990> chop<00:01:41.200> these<00:01:41.940> weeds<00:01:42.940> off<00:01:43.240> you've

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
in and chop these weeds off you've

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.330 
in and chop these weeds off you've
gotten<00:01:44.049> rid<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.409> lot<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.799> surface<00:01:44.979> area

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
gotten rid of a lot of the surface area

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.130 
gotten rid of a lot of the surface area
of<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:46.090> leaves<00:01:46.299> that's<00:01:46.600> going<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:46.810> take<00:01:46.990> up

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
of the leaves that's going to take up

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.810 
of the leaves that's going to take up
the<00:01:47.260> chemical<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:47.890> your<00:01:48.070> chemical<00:01:48.460> actually

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
the chemical so your chemical actually

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.020 
the chemical so your chemical actually
works<00:01:49.060> not<00:01:49.930> as<00:01:50.110> well<00:01:50.350> so<00:01:51.189> again<00:01:51.460> just<00:01:51.610> make

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
works not as well so again just make

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.990 
works not as well so again just make
sure<00:01:52.180> you<00:01:52.299> water<00:01:52.510> it<00:01:52.689> first<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.400> product

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
sure you water it first have the product

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.280 
sure you water it first have the product
stick<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.360> leaf<00:01:55.540> turn<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.900> irrigation

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
stick to the leaf turn the irrigation

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.990 
stick to the leaf turn the irrigation
off<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.770> doesn't<00:01:57.010> get<00:01:57.100> washed<00:01:57.340> off<00:01:57.549> for<00:01:57.760> 24

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
off so it doesn't get washed off for 24

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.050 
off so it doesn't get washed off for 24
hours<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:58.720> try<00:01:59.409> to<00:01:59.470> not<00:01:59.680> mow<00:01:59.950> for<00:01:59.979> about<00:02:00.759> two

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
hours and try to not mow for about two

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.880 
hours and try to not mow for about two
days<00:02:01.210> before<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.960> two<00:02:02.110> days<00:02:02.259> after<00:02:02.290> applying
