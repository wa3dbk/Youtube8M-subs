00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.109
 I prayed here with you, you feel today 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.410
 we are here to review hogan one of the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.480
 three warriors that I believe are together 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.150
 in fandral what surely goes 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.640
 used more before starting the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.210
 review I want to specifically tell you 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.920
 which I will never consider today or have 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 flanked by a character who is not 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.869
 another fighter another warrior 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.210
 consequently in this review I 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.180
 I will talk about hogan or hang 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.040
 al cuoa volstagg predictably fandral 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.739
 and in a little while I will explain you the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.660
 because the reason why he had to use 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.050
 this character certainly his 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.730
 passive the hogan liabilities more 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.920
 important is called the way of the warrior 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.710
 that is whenever 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.289
 will be attacked fandral or volstagg 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.109
 one of the two characters and worsens one 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.780
 Hogan attack will join this attack 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.909
 against will attack with a braid that 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.890
 besides having a very very high damage 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.250
 what was pain and concentration on 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.380
 target and if any of you use 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.689
 still union jack will understand how many they are 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.740
 important these counterattacks or 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:18.020
 anyway coordinated attacks where I would like 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.509
 you can apply the maximum three times e 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.310
 the damage inflicted by oar 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.340
 to the opponent room will be increased dell 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.100
 8 percent and therefore three times 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.649
 24 percent more concentration on the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.869
 target will increase damage 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.179
 always on which the target we start a 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.399
 talk about class or better classes 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.440
 of hogan governs the possibility of both 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.750
 make consecutive attacks against 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.119
 spies but even against 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.500
 attack like a real spy after 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.060
 obviously acquired the reflections in 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.310
 combat 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.860
 I wouldn't underestimate this last bonus 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.200
 of the spy class because as well 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.090
 you know besides giving donations and 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.969
 make him stealth attacks increases the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.829
 give 30 percent because of me 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.159
 stop to talk about this 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.509
 a wedding provocative shot a 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.200
 attack he has from his beyond 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.630
 to the high give nothing good 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.090
 basically it does not inflict any 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.730
 manus forgives two bonuses from organs on 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.340
 next attack will be one hundred percent critical 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.680
 percent and will run 25 percent of the 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.390
 give more imagine when you make them 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.180
 meets a spy as he enjoys himself 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.280
 will inflict 25 percent more damage 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.380
 also having the spies bonus 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.940
 active will inflict another 30 percent 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.670
 of the damage more than joined to the next 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.280
 attack inflicts a critical hit well 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.319
 let's say it really hurts like that 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.720
 especially to presence spies 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.500
 crushing and before he lived ed 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.880
 excited I absolutely have to inform you 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.470
 who will have to pass a shift 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.880
 before our warrior can 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.180
 use it 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.620
 the 15 in fact awaits two rounds in each 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.359
 case is a quick attack which therefore does not 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.099
 consume shift just does not cause 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.280
 against attacks and affects all 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.170
 enemies or donating two mouse mar two manus 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.299
 not to be underestimated because it is true that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.330
 it lasts not just one turn but they are 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.440
 really important to the narrow that there 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.780
 will therefore allow to have that 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.120
 fantastic consecutive attack of which 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.190
 we talked a little while ago and branko lamento 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.049
 or the attacks of the adversaries 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.120
 at least single target cause 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.549
 always a counterattack unless these 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.860
 attacks are not attacks for tv or 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.650
 mental attacks or kick treats are said 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.080
 so basically this character does it 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.860
 you will also see 10 attack 15 times in 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.530
 a fight 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.659
 for this I recommend you already now 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.370
 ISO accuracy and attack 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.290
 accuracy is not missing I have to tell a 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.760
 but this character increases that 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.159
 definitely the attack because it is a 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.019
 counterattack and hogan character 16 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.480
 to different attacks especially like 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.769
 said in the presence of fandral that I 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:55.280
 advice and why it will go slightly more 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.200
 offensive to volstagg elixir del 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.810
 recovery on the third attack is there to say 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.769
 which expresses the maximum of potential 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.920
 together with the other warriors and with 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.920
 the occasion 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.570
 what you hear I show you a weapon 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.880
 can be equipped by the people who unfortunately 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.560
 I missed my mug practically 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.750
 a copy of the third attack of warriors 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.100
 and also makes the same agent a 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.140
 warrior with all the bonuses 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.360
 they also obtain boca alla 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.450
 unlike the third elixir attack of the 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.040
 recovery of the three warriors unlocks all 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.290
 the warrior class bonus 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.510
 therefore consider that all of them are 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.060
 in double classes then you will get ad 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.770
 example close combat with 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.460
 hoover the reflection in combat 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.550
 both in one turn 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.070
 can you imagine how much this thing relieves 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.010
 well at the time he didn't take the mug 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.120
 because I thought it a little music we say 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.740
 these three characters don't me 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.780
 they didn't seem too excited 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.120
 competitive at least for me 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.560
 but after having tried them I am 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.660
 harshly changed his mind for this reason 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.820
 kids never did not 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.560
 will never happen that I review a 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.740
 marvel avengers alliance character 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.320
 without first finding it carefully 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.780
 up to at least level 9 then talking 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.520
 of elixir of recovery donates to all 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.919
 allies patrol soldiers then 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.340
 all damage from contracted attacks 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:18.550
 consecutive ones have increased unlike 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.530
 of fandral and his of recovery siri 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.480
 and allows allies to take damage 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.120
 reduced by counterattacks from attacks 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:30.160
 while the elixir instead 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.270
 of gold star recovery is back from by 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.230
 suffered from the weakening that 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.120
 they inflict damage over time, of course 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.610
 I think I find it much more useful 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.940
 residues of hogan recovery because it is 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.160
 an offensive recovery also here says 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.830
 which however obviously extends 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.360
 to all elixir warriors of recovery 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.090
 then restore a large amount of 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.880
 health force and then removes all 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.350
 weakening from the targets 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.710
 returning to us we talk about the fourth 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.080
 attack than to tell the truth 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.330
 you are smau but after trying it I have to 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.910
 say that I really found it 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.550
 really important because it is 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.590
 basically the strong attack 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.470
 the attack of a bystander of hogan now 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.480
 the play has not accustomed us that all 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.060
 characters in season 21 and 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.520
 devastating, well, meteoric crash and 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.290
 hogan attack for inflicting 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.060
 daniel layer of dvd shots and they are also 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.680
 high enough the miur has a good part 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.210
 of the effects of evasions therefore the cube 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.060
 prototype and all the effects of 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.130
 evasion are canceled then 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.770
 the attack almost always goes to sign e 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.900
 ignore the defense statistic well guys 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.340
 say to conclude the video here 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.280
 if you liked it, remember to leave 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.860
 you like a comment and let me know that 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.870
 think of this new method of 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.930
 reviews of reviews and 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.700
 any advice is welcome either 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.080
 tweet on the marvel avengers page 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.760
 to the challenge 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.970
 a special thanks to clear 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.860
 lions preparing the new one 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.050
 cover and the good name image of 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.940
 profile and having said this I greet you and 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.720
 we'll see you at the next video 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.720
 searched 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.510
 there was a time when the attacks 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:19.440
 coordinated did not even exist e 

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.210
 no one could ever imagine them 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.340
 well 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.340
 that time ends now
