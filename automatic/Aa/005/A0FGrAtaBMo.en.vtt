yourself to you only use the weight

yourself to you only use the weight
through<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.470> part<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.070> range<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.370> motion

through the part of the range of motion

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.310 
through the part of the range of motion
you're<00:02:43.820> going<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:44.030> get<00:02:44.180> weaker<00:02:44.360> not<00:02:44.810> develop

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
you're going to get weaker not develop

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.130 
you're going to get weaker not develop
strength<00:02:45.850> usually<00:02:46.850> beyond<00:02:47.150> about<00:02:47.360> 15<00:02:47.780> degrees

strength usually beyond about 15 degrees
from<00:02:48.320> where<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.650> stopped<00:02:48.950> you're<00:02:49.220> not<00:02:49.340> going

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
from where you stopped you're not going

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.160 
from where you stopped you're not going
to<00:02:49.550> develop<00:02:49.730> any<00:02:50.090> strength<00:02:50.480> through<00:02:50.930> there

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
to develop any strength through there

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.410 
to develop any strength through there
and<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.130> you're<00:02:52.250> not<00:02:52.400> only<00:02:52.550> tightening<00:02:53.150> up<00:02:53.270> all

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
and so you're not only tightening up all

of that the connective tissue in the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
range of motion you're actually not

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.820 
range of motion you're actually not

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
going to strength you there so if

something goes wrong because you're

than you're actually capable of lifting
something<00:03:14.390> goes<00:03:14.540> wrong<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:15.500> weight<00:03:15.680> gets

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
something goes wrong the weight gets

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.040 
something goes wrong the weight gets
pushed<00:03:16.220> down<00:03:16.340> you're<00:03:17.209> too<00:03:17.450> tight<00:03:17.660> from<00:03:17.870> not

strength through it and you end up
snapping<00:03:20.780> something<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.709> then<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.400> go<00:03:22.490> back

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
snapping something and then you go back

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.970 
snapping something and then you go back
to<00:03:22.730> point<00:03:23.060> number<00:03:23.360> one<00:03:23.600> of<00:03:24.170> being<00:03:24.470> one<00:03:24.830> of<00:03:24.860> the

can't<00:03:30.020> do<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.290> anymore<00:03:30.560> they<00:03:30.860> messed<00:03:31.130> up<00:03:31.310> at

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
can't do it anymore they messed up at

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.340 
can't do it anymore they messed up at
some<00:03:31.640> point<00:03:31.750> what<00:03:32.750> you're<00:03:32.870> going<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:33.110> find

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
some point what you're going to find

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.780 
some point what you're going to find
though<00:03:33.500> is<00:03:33.530> that<00:03:33.650> with<00:03:33.890> any<00:03:34.040> exercise<00:03:34.370> what

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
though is that with any exercise what

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.250 
though is that with any exercise what
people<00:03:35.060> forget<00:03:35.209> is<00:03:35.570> that<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:35.959> not<00:03:36.080> always

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
people forget is that it's not always

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.680 
people forget is that it's not always
about<00:03:36.440> how<00:03:36.680> much<00:03:36.860> weight<00:03:37.610> you<00:03:37.940> move<00:03:38.240> it's<00:03:38.540> how

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
about how much weight you move it's how

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.420 
about how much weight you move it's how
far<00:03:39.140> more<00:03:39.380> range<00:03:39.620> of<00:03:39.740> motion<00:03:39.800> up<00:03:40.130> while<00:03:40.280> you

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
far more range of motion up while you

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.830 
far more range of motion up while you
move<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.880> that<00:03:41.000> determines<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.510> lot<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:41.750> your

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
move it that determines a lot of your

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.690 
move it that determines a lot of your
development<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.500> strength<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.100> your

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
development and strength and your

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.449 
development and strength and your
function<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:44.510> if<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:45.110> are<00:03:45.440> using<00:03:46.280> a

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
function and so if you are using a

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.990 
function and so if you are using a
heavier<00:03:46.910> weight<00:03:47.150> at<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.600> expense<00:03:48.440> of<00:03:49.000> full

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
heavier weight at the expense of full

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.310 
heavier weight at the expense of full
range<00:03:50.240> of<00:03:50.390> motion<00:03:50.570> you're<00:03:50.959> not<00:03:51.110> always

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
range of motion you're not always

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.620 
range of motion you're not always
getting<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.920> development<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:52.790> strength<00:03:53.360> and

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
getting the development and strength and

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.210 
getting the development and strength and
function<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.350> should<00:03:54.709> be<00:03:54.860> getting<00:03:54.980> from

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
function that you should be getting from

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.770 
function that you should be getting from
an<00:03:55.370> exercise<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.120> overhead<00:03:56.330> press<00:03:56.660> is

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
an exercise and the overhead press is

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.199 
an exercise and the overhead press is
definitely<00:03:57.290> one<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.470> those<00:03:57.650> and<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.910> thing<00:03:59.090> to

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
definitely one of those and the thing to

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.670 
definitely one of those and the thing to
remember<00:03:59.270> if<00:03:59.600> you<00:03:59.630> want<00:03:59.930> to<00:04:00.050> actually<00:04:00.170> get

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
remember if you want to actually get

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.949 
remember if you want to actually get
just<00:04:01.220> focus<00:04:01.550> upon<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.030> top<00:04:02.570> part<00:04:02.870> of

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
just focus upon the the top part of

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.810 
just focus upon the the top part of
movement<00:04:03.350> more<00:04:03.530> while<00:04:03.800> maintaining<00:04:04.040> the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
movement more while maintaining the

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.030 
movement more while maintaining the
strength<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:06.050> mobility<00:04:06.320> at<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.740> bottom

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
strength and the mobility at the bottom

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.560 
strength and the mobility at the bottom
that<00:04:07.160> turned<00:04:07.340> it<00:04:07.520> into<00:04:07.610> an<00:04:07.760> explosive<00:04:08.180> power

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
that turned it into an explosive power

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.360 
that turned it into an explosive power
movement<00:04:09.170> with<00:04:09.410> using<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:09.800> heavier<00:04:10.190> weight

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
movement with using a heavier weight

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.790 
movement with using a heavier weight
that<00:04:10.520> you<00:04:10.640> can<00:04:10.790> use<00:04:10.970> strictly<00:04:11.560> then<00:04:12.560> that's

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
that you can use strictly then that's

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.290 
that you can use strictly then that's
where<00:04:12.950> the<00:04:13.040> push<00:04:13.250> press<00:04:13.459> comes<00:04:13.760> in<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.000> push

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
where the push press comes in the push

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.110 
where the push press comes in the push
press<00:04:14.750> shines<00:04:15.739> at<00:04:16.010> that<00:04:16.160> it<00:04:16.370> does<00:04:16.549> everything

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
press shines at that it does everything

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.180 
press shines at that it does everything
that<00:04:17.330> you<00:04:17.780> would<00:04:17.959> want<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.320> do<00:04:18.530> from<00:04:18.739> doing<00:04:19.040> the

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
that you would want to do from doing the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.830 
that you would want to do from doing the
partial<00:04:19.430> overhead<00:04:20.000> press<00:04:20.270> but<00:04:20.540> it<00:04:20.630> still

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
partial overhead press but it still

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.710 
partial overhead press but it still
allows<00:04:21.109> you<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:21.620> develop<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.970> strength<00:04:23.479> and

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
allows you to develop the strength and

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.870 
allows you to develop the strength and
the<00:04:23.830> mobility<00:04:24.830> through<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:25.190> full<00:04:25.430> range<00:04:25.460> of

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
the mobility through the full range of

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.620 
the mobility through the full range of
motion<00:04:26.060> while

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
motion while

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.600 
motion while
still<00:04:26.840> overloading<00:04:27.620> the<00:04:27.800> top<00:04:28.160> part<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.520> the

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
still overloading the top part of the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.310 
still overloading the top part of the
movement<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.150> you're<00:04:29.720> going<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:29.960> get<00:04:30.050> a<00:04:30.080> lot

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
movement and you're going to get a lot

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.290 
movement and you're going to get a lot
better<00:04:30.560> results<00:04:30.650> from<00:04:31.520> doing<00:04:31.760> a<00:04:31.820> push<00:04:32.030> press

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
better results from doing a push press

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.370 
better results from doing a push press
and<00:04:32.450> you're<00:04:32.510> going<00:04:32.690> to<00:04:32.750> get<00:04:32.900> from<00:04:33.050> doing<00:04:33.290> these

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
and you're going to get from doing these

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.220 
and you're going to get from doing these
partials<00:04:33.950> with<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.490> overhead<00:04:34.820> press<00:04:35.060> so<00:04:35.690> yeah

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
partials with the overhead press so yeah

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.660 
partials with the overhead press so yeah
there's<00:04:36.470> no<00:04:36.620> real<00:04:36.830> reason<00:04:37.010> for<00:04:37.190> people<00:04:37.370> to<00:04:37.520> be

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
there's no real reason for people to be

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.370 
there's no real reason for people to be
doing<00:04:37.910> partials<00:04:38.360> on<00:04:38.450> this<00:04:38.570> exercise<00:04:39.020> do<00:04:39.260> the

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
doing partials on this exercise do the

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.160 
doing partials on this exercise do the
full<00:04:39.590> range<00:04:39.800> of<00:04:39.980> motion<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.610> if<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:41.720> want<00:04:42.050> to

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
full range of motion and if you want to

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.710 
full range of motion and if you want to
focus<00:04:42.440> more<00:04:42.710> upon<00:04:43.340> overloading<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.150> top<00:04:44.390> part
