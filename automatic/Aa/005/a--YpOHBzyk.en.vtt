you<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.510> i'm<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:12.869> weird<00:01:13.229> scenario<00:01:13.650> after

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
you know i'm like weird scenario after

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.820 
you know i'm like weird scenario after
facing<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.580> an<00:01:14.820> AP<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.990> could<00:01:16.350> run<00:01:16.619> like

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
facing like an AP you could run like

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.710 
facing like an AP you could run like
four<00:01:17.100> level<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.700> that's<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.060> weird<00:01:18.240> so

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
four level but that's really weird so

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.570 
four level but that's really weird so
armor<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> easiest<00:01:19.799> bet<00:01:20.990> then<00:01:21.990> for

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
armor is like the easiest bet then for

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.390 
armor is like the easiest bet then for
blues<00:01:23.580> i<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> mix<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.869> mr<00:01:25.470> per<00:01:25.680> level<00:01:25.950> and

the<00:02:03.290> only<00:02:04.040> changes<00:02:04.550> i<00:02:04.700> would<00:02:04.850> have<00:02:05.030> here<00:02:05.300> is

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
the only changes i would have here is

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.730 
the only changes i would have here is
like<00:02:06.190> our<00:02:07.190> append<00:02:07.610> possibility<00:02:08.390> for<00:02:08.630> rats<00:02:09.560> and

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
like our append possibility for rats and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.760 
like our append possibility for rats and
clint's<00:02:10.039> she<00:02:10.190> just<00:02:10.399> came<00:02:10.580> out<00:02:10.819> so<00:02:11.209> I'm<00:02:11.770> still

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
clint's she just came out so I'm still

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.080 
clint's she just came out so I'm still
kind<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.010> testing<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.459> by<00:02:13.610> looking<00:02:13.760> at<00:02:13.970> her

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
kind of testing it by looking at her

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.240 
kind of testing it by looking at her
ratios<00:02:14.569> she<00:02:14.840> definitely<00:02:15.110> scales<00:02:15.470> nicely<00:02:15.980> and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
ratios she definitely scales nicely and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.430 
ratios she definitely scales nicely and
she<00:02:16.490> would<00:02:16.610> use<00:02:16.880> attack<00:02:17.360> damage<00:02:17.570> nicely<00:02:18.200> and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
she would use attack damage nicely and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.550 
she would use attack damage nicely and
attack<00:02:18.709> damage<00:02:18.860> is<00:02:19.190> always<00:02:19.430> good<00:02:19.640> for<00:02:19.940> laning

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
attack damage is always good for laning

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.110 
attack damage is always good for laning
alright<00:02:21.560> we'll<00:02:21.890> go<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.040> masteries<00:02:22.880> now

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
alright we'll go to masteries now

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.300 
alright we'll go to masteries now
