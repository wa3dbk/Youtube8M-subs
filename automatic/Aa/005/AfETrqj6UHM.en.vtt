00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.580
 and in this video I want to give you some 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.040
 tips to lubricate some parts of your 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.840
 bicycle applies especially in time of 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.269
 rains that is when the bike has 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.519
 rust more that dye will serve to 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.499
 preserve some parts to avoid the 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.970
 rust and to prevent this part from 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.490
 break because not being well 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.919
 lubricated is easier than your levers 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.689
 your chain or some other part breaks 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.260
 well something that I use very often is this 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.270
 oil is oil 301 lubricates clean and 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.430
 prevents rust and is true is 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.230
 pretty good and it's an oil that carries 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.390
 many years in the market you 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.370
 I recommend having one at home the way 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 apply it is the following when you 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.340
 applies the chain is usually from 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.600
 this way 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.600
 giving them blocks 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.310
 when you apply it in this way 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.550
 then you turn 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.430
 and the oil starts to be distributed to 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.230
 through the star throughout the chain 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.740
 and it's a way of doing it to not have 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.740
 spills 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.480
 this oil penetrates very quickly by 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.550
 what I recommend you use small 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.440
 quantities the parts that there are always 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.420
 that essentially lubricate is the chain 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.730
 followed by the grinding levers 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.980
 I highly recommend that if you are very 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.470
 full of rust their levers uncover them 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.930
 clean them with diesel and put them something 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.100
 of fat if you do not have many and can 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.100
 add some oil to you 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.820
 can be in this part here in this 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.820
 part of here 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.280
 and that's all, do not forget that 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.260
 could use the oil anywhere 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.479
 of your bicycle but the most recommendable 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.610
 is to use it only in this part the other 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.740
 parts as courageous and in the direction 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.080
 the bearing of the center thousand etcetera 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.270
 they carry fat can use it temporarily 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.640
 but I recommend you always 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.990
 well greased and this was all I hope 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.670
