00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
of the puzzle it moves quite nicely

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.130 
of the puzzle it moves quite nicely
and<00:02:13.280> as<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.459> can<00:02:14.580> see<00:02:14.850> here<00:02:15.240> that<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.810> spins

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and as you can see here that it spins

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.160 
and as you can see here that it spins
off<00:02:16.470> axis<00:02:16.950> which<00:02:17.310> evil<00:02:17.730> twins<00:02:18.000> do<00:02:18.480> because<00:02:18.930> of

off axis which evil twins do because of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.710 
off axis which evil twins do because of
the<00:02:19.680> fusion<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.760> two<00:02:20.790> three<00:02:21.270> by<00:02:21.390> three<00:02:21.600> by

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
the fusion of the two three by three by

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.710 
the fusion of the two three by three by
three<00:02:21.959> quarters<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:29.030> for<00:02:30.030> those<00:02:30.209> of<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.510> who

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
three quarters and for those of you who

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.110 
three quarters and for those of you who
have<00:02:30.870> not<00:02:31.020> used<00:02:31.350> an<00:02:31.530> evil<00:02:31.800> twin<00:02:31.920> before<00:02:32.489> this

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
have not used an evil twin before this

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.660 
have not used an evil twin before this
center<00:02:33.510> layer<00:02:33.720> does<00:02:34.140> not<00:02:34.350> turn<00:02:34.739> together

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
center layer does not turn together

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.120 
center layer does not turn together
because<00:02:36.270> this<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.440> internal<00:02:37.890> portion

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
because this is in the internal portion

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.890 
because this is in the internal portion
this<00:02:38.550> is<00:02:38.670> where<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.030> two<00:02:39.209> three<00:02:39.510> by<00:02:39.630> threes

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
this is where the two three by threes

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.250 
this is where the two three by threes
are<00:02:40.170> fused<00:02:40.560> together<00:02:41.180> when<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.780> scrambled

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
are fused together when it is scrambled

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.070 
are fused together when it is scrambled
up<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.590> two<00:02:43.920> three<00:02:44.130> threes<00:02:44.489> do<00:02:44.700> move<00:02:45.080> very

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
up the two three threes do move very

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.460 
up the two three threes do move very
nicely<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:48.000> I'll<00:02:48.239> just<00:02:48.420> scramble<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:49.050> here

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
nicely and I'll just scramble it up here

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.660 
nicely and I'll just scramble it up here
just<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.920> little<00:02:50.250> bit<00:02:50.370> for<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:52.640> hopefully<00:02:53.640> I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
just a little bit for you hopefully I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.640 
just a little bit for you hopefully I
won't<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:54.090> use<00:02:54.209> my<00:02:54.420> spot<00:02:54.810> because<00:02:55.140> once<00:02:55.380> this

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
won't to use my spot because once this

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.640 
won't to use my spot because once this
guy<00:02:55.890> gets<00:02:56.130> scrambled<00:02:56.370> up<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.540> be

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
guy gets scrambled up it can be

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.750 
guy gets scrambled up it can be
definitely<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.769> little<00:02:59.010> bit<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.370> challenge

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
definitely a little bit of a challenge

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:12.380 
definitely a little bit of a challenge
to<00:02:59.910> get<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.180> back<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.290> turning<00:03:02.220> again<00:03:11.390> instead

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
to get it back and turning again instead

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.260 
to get it back and turning again instead
to<00:03:12.510> make<00:03:12.600> sure<00:03:12.780> was<00:03:12.900> nice<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.260> lined<00:03:13.470> up

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
to make sure was nice and lined up

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.900 
to make sure was nice and lined up
so<00:03:15.870> as<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.140> can<00:03:16.260> see<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:17.160> is<00:03:17.370> only<00:03:17.610> after

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
so as you can see that is only after

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.320 
so as you can see that is only after
four<00:03:18.900> turns<00:03:19.580> so<00:03:20.580> once<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:20.910> guy<00:03:21.090> gets

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
four turns so once this guy gets

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.690 
four turns so once this guy gets
