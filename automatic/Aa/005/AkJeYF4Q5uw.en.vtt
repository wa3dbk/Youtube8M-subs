at<00:00:57.380> this<00:00:57.650> stage<00:00:57.980> of<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.340> test<00:00:58.610> which<00:00:59.060> has<00:00:59.239> been

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
at this stage of the test which has been

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.689 
at this stage of the test which has been
running<00:01:00.010> for<00:01:01.010> about<00:01:01.090> 35<00:01:02.090> minutes<00:01:02.140> as<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:04.430> can

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
running for about 35 minutes as you can

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.680 
running for about 35 minutes as you can
see<00:01:05.000> on<00:01:05.479> these<00:01:06.440> two<00:01:07.010> that<00:01:07.970> they<00:01:08.180> have<00:01:08.360> burnt

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
see on these two that they have burnt

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.430 
see on these two that they have burnt
all<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.410> way<00:01:09.560> through<00:01:09.950> this<00:01:10.670> one<00:01:11.030> is<00:01:11.330> not<00:01:11.720> the

panel coating in Internet in fact has a
huge<00:01:15.080> char<00:01:15.740> in<00:01:16.280> front<00:01:16.610> of<00:01:16.700> it

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
huge char in front of it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.890 
huge char in front of it
this<00:01:17.300> is<00:01:17.510> insulating<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:19.550> the<00:01:19.869> substrate<00:01:20.869> of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
this is insulating the the substrate of

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.620 
this is insulating the the substrate of
wood<00:01:21.350> in<00:01:21.500> this<00:01:21.650> case<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.670> preventing<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.600> from

wood in this case and preventing it from
burning

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.970 

what<00:01:49.700> is<00:01:49.910> happening<00:01:50.360> at<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.660> back<00:01:50.870> is<00:01:51.320> that

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
what is happening at the back is that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.150 
what is happening at the back is that
that<00:01:52.250> there<00:01:52.460> is<00:01:52.610> moisture<00:01:53.420> being<00:01:54.160> released

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
that there is moisture being released

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.070 
that there is moisture being released
from<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.610> wouldn't<00:01:56.090> eat<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.420> wood<00:01:56.570> is<00:01:56.720> drying

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
from the wouldn't eat the wood is drying

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.680 
from the wouldn't eat the wood is drying
out<00:01:57.320> because<00:01:58.070> there<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.730> hate<00:01:59.030> source<00:01:59.360> on

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
out because there is a hate source on

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.970 
out because there is a hate source on
the<00:02:00.140> other<00:02:00.320> side

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.920 
the other side
however<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:03.140> interessant<00:02:04.130> coating<00:02:04.640> is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
however the interessant coating is

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.260 
however the interessant coating is
insulating<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.080> wood<00:02:06.230> itself<00:02:07.270> and

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
insulating the wood itself and

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.760 
insulating the wood itself and
preventing<00:02:08.960> any<00:02:09.490> transgression<00:02:10.490> of<00:02:10.870> H<00:02:11.870> fill

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
preventing any transgression of H fill

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.160 
preventing any transgression of H fill
to<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:12.950> substrate<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:14.060> consequently<00:02:14.870> not

to the substrate and consequently not
allowing<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:15.740> burn<00:02:17.740> after<00:02:18.740> thirty<00:02:19.130> minute

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
allowing it to burn after thirty minute

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.110 
allowing it to burn after thirty minute
test<00:02:19.910> as<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.180> can<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:22.190> there<00:02:22.850> isn't<00:02:22.940> a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
test as you can see that there isn't a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.840 
test as you can see that there isn't a
great<00:02:23.360> deal<00:02:23.420> happening<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.590> front<00:02:24.920> but

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
great deal happening that the front but

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.890 
great deal happening that the front but
at<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.150> back<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:28.520> is<00:02:28.730> starting<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.270> get<00:02:29.540> warm

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
at the back it is starting to get warm

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.850 
at the back it is starting to get warm
yes<00:02:30.830> but<00:02:31.670> there<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.000> no<00:02:32.270> charring<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.260> there's

yes but there is no charring and there's

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:42.449 
yes but there is no charring and there's
no<00:02:34.040> burn<00:02:34.340> through

exposed to the burner for approximately
45<00:02:48.400> minutes<00:02:48.609> you'll<00:02:49.569> see<00:02:49.659> the<00:02:50.079> char<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.530> still

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
45 minutes you'll see the char is still

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.300 
45 minutes you'll see the char is still

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.420 
in the case of the inch machine coated
panel<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.660> will<00:03:42.840> see<00:03:43.080> when<00:03:43.290> half<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.620> charas

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430

been removed the central burn area has

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.800 
been removed the central burn area has
penetrated<00:03:48.780> into<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.800> wood<00:03:50.240> that<00:03:51.240> is<00:03:51.450> the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
penetrated into the wood that is the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.050 
penetrated into the wood that is the
hottest<00:03:52.200> part<00:03:52.470> of<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.650> flame<00:03:52.860> which<00:03:53.610> runs<00:03:53.910> at

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
hottest part of the flame which runs at

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.060 
hottest part of the flame which runs at
about<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.330> thousand<00:03:54.930> degrees<00:03:55.080> centigrade<00:03:55.950> and

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
about a thousand degrees centigrade and

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.560 
about a thousand degrees centigrade and
the<00:03:57.060> burn<00:03:57.300> has<00:03:57.840> penetrated<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.860> water<00:03:59.040> level

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
the burn has penetrated the water level

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.570 
the burn has penetrated the water level
slightly<00:04:00.570> out<00:04:01.020> of<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.530> burn<00:04:01.770> area<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.370> can

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
slightly out of that burn area you can

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.050 
slightly out of that burn area you can
see<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.570> it<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:03.720> not<00:04:04.200> real<00:04:05.190> it<00:04:05.430> is<00:04:05.490> charred

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
see that it is not real it is charred

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.390 
see that it is not real it is charred
but<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.750> not<00:04:06.990> penetrated<00:04:07.800> into<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.130> wooden

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
but is not penetrated into the wooden

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.000 
but is not penetrated into the wooden
surface<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.600> a<00:04:09.750> bit<00:04:09.930> further<00:04:10.230> out<00:04:10.500> there<00:04:10.890> is

surface and a bit further out there is

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.820 
surface and a bit further out there is
no<00:04:11.220> charring<00:04:11.760> at<00:04:11.910> all<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:13.020> char<00:04:13.320> itself

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
no charring at all so the char itself

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.940 
no charring at all so the char itself
has<00:04:13.950> insulated<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.910> wood<00:04:15.120> surface<00:04:15.950> substrate
