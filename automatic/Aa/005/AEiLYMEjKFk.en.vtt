00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
today and that question is how much

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.140 
today and that question is how much

122<00:00:56.550> pounds<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.970> dry<00:00:57.150> muscle<00:00:57.510> per<00:00:57.659> month<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
122 pounds of dry muscle per month and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.009 
122 pounds of dry muscle per month and
it<00:00:58.890> doesn't<00:00:59.220> sound<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.640> much<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.839> you

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
it doesn't sound like much but if you

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.009 
it doesn't sound like much but if you
consider<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.580> two<00:01:02.729> pounds<00:01:03.089> of<00:01:03.180> dry<00:01:03.449> muscle

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
consider one or two pounds of dry muscle

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
consider one or two pounds of dry muscle
on<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.290> monthly<00:01:04.739> basis<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> course<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.940> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
on a monthly basis for the course of the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.840 
on a monthly basis for the course of the
next<00:01:06.210> year<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.590> 12<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> 24<00:01:08.460> freakin

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
next year you can have 12 to 24 freakin

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.969 
next year you can have 12 to 24 freakin
pounds<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.210> muscle<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.600> your<00:01:09.630> body<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
pounds of muscle on your body so this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.230 
pounds of muscle on your body so this
kind<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.280> shows<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> importance<00:01:12.150> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
kind of shows you the importance of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.740 
kind of shows you the importance of
consistency<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.250> remember<00:01:14.360> every<00:01:15.360> time<00:01:15.600> you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
consistency and remember every time you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.600 
consistency and remember every time you
add<00:01:15.900> one<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> two<00:01:16.380> pounds<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.770> dry<00:01:17.070> muscle<00:01:17.520> when

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
add one to two pounds of dry muscle when

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
add one to two pounds of dry muscle when
I<00:01:17.640> say<00:01:17.850> dry<00:01:18.060> muscle<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:18.450> talking<00:01:18.869> rock<00:01:19.080> hard

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
I say dry muscle I'm talking rock hard

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.469 
I say dry muscle I'm talking rock hard
solid<00:01:19.830> muscle<00:01:20.159> you're<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> increase

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
solid muscle you're going to increase

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.440 
solid muscle you're going to increase
storage<00:01:21.750> space<00:01:22.260> for<00:01:22.590> glycogen<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:24.240> water

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
storage space for glycogen and for water

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.359 
storage space for glycogen and for water
so<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.260> happens<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.740> all<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.010> sudden

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
so what happens is all of a sudden

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.070 
so what happens is all of a sudden
you're<00:01:26.490> gaining<00:01:26.790> around<00:01:27.000> five<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> six<00:01:27.659> pounds

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
you're gaining around five to six pounds

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.260 
you're gaining around five to six pounds
of<00:01:28.200> lean<00:01:28.409> muscle<00:01:28.439> mass<00:01:28.979> per<00:01:29.460> month<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.939> that's

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
of lean muscle mass per month and that's

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
of lean muscle mass per month and that's
actually<00:01:30.600> exactly<00:01:30.960> what<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.799> want<00:01:32.039> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
actually exactly what you want you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
actually exactly what you want you
should<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.060> aiming<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.659> gain<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:34.020> least<00:01:34.049> five

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
should be aiming to gain at least five

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.580 
should be aiming to gain at least five
to<00:01:35.219> six<00:01:35.460> pounds<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.119> lean<00:01:36.630> muscle<00:01:36.659> mass<00:01:37.200> each

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
to six pounds of lean muscle mass each

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.340 
to six pounds of lean muscle mass each
month<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:39.119> yourself<00:01:39.539> at<00:01:39.780> home<00:01:40.020> you're

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
month so for yourself at home you're

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.450 
month so for yourself at home you're
probably<00:01:40.469> thinking<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.009> need<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.249> set<00:01:41.429> some

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
probably thinking I need to set some

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.310 
probably thinking I need to set some
goals<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:42.119> need<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.600> figure<00:01:42.780> out<00:01:42.990> how<00:01:43.140> much

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
goals I need to figure out how much

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.109 
goals I need to figure out how much
weight<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.920> gain<00:01:44.130> if<00:01:44.399> you're<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:45.090> just

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
weight can I gain if you're going just

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.599 
weight can I gain if you're going just
for<00:01:45.479> weight<00:01:45.689> gain<00:01:46.219> you<00:01:47.219> could<00:01:47.399> probably

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
for weight gain you could probably

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.580 
for weight gain you could probably
gained<00:01:47.939> 10<00:01:48.359> and<00:01:48.539> 15<00:01:48.869> pounds<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.229> month<00:01:49.259> but

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
gained 10 and 15 pounds a month but

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.660 
gained 10 and 15 pounds a month but
realize<00:01:49.859> you're<00:01:50.009> going<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.189> gain<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.369> lot<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
realize you're going to gain a lot of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
realize you're going to gain a lot of
fat<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:51.270> guessing<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.109> want<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.439> focus<00:01:52.649> on

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
fat I'm guessing you want to focus on

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.090 
fat I'm guessing you want to focus on
building<00:01:53.509> lean<00:01:54.509> muscle<00:01:54.539> mass<00:01:54.929> so<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.890> should

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
building lean muscle mass so you should

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.770 
building lean muscle mass so you should
aim<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.249> build<00:01:56.549> five<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.999> six<00:01:57.179> pounds<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.569> lean

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
aim to build five to six pounds of lean

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.289 
aim to build five to six pounds of lean
muscle<00:01:57.810> mass<00:01:58.229> each<00:01:58.590> month<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.310> there<00:02:00.179> you<00:02:00.270> have

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
muscle mass each month so there you have

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.090 
muscle mass each month so there you have
it<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.869> know<00:02:01.140> how<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.560> muscle<00:02:01.859> is

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
it now you know how much muscle is

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.520 
it now you know how much muscle is
realistic<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.939> gain<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.359> monthly<00:02:03.719> basis<00:02:04.229> aim

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
realistic to gain on a monthly basis aim

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.319 
realistic to gain on a monthly basis aim
for<00:02:04.560> one<00:02:04.979> or<00:02:05.100> two<00:02:05.130> pounds<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.609> dry<00:02:05.819> muscles

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
for one or two pounds of dry muscles
