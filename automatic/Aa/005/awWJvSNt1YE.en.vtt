larger than yours Michael and this is a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.119 
larger than yours Michael and this is a
very<00:00:38.280> large<00:00:38.579> tonsil<00:00:39.180> here<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.590> a

what we do I wish it were this simple we

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.790 
what we do I wish it were this simple we
just<00:00:48.239> take<00:00:48.420> out<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> console<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.350> there's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
is one of the oldest procedures in

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.359 
is one of the oldest procedures in
history<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.200> newest<00:01:16.619> technology<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
history the newest technology is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.340 
history the newest technology is
something<00:01:17.700> called<00:01:17.880> coblation<00:01:18.360> which<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.320> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
something called coblation which is a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.830 
something called coblation which is a
radiofrequency<00:01:20.070> very<00:01:20.700> cold<00:01:21.119> temperature

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
radiofrequency very cold temperature

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.190 
radiofrequency very cold temperature
more<00:01:22.770> advanced<00:01:23.189> than<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.549> laser<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.869> can

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
more advanced than a laser and you can

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.749 
more advanced than a laser and you can
see<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:25.860> we're<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.159> taking<00:01:26.430> out<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
see here that we're just taking out a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.240 
see here that we're just taking out a
tonsil<00:01:27.270> very<00:01:27.780> gently<00:01:28.229> there's<00:01:28.560> no<00:01:28.829> bleeding

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
tonsil very gently there's no bleeding

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.960 
tonsil very gently there's no bleeding
during<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.790> procedure<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.990> very<00:01:31.380> quick

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
during the procedure it is very quick

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.700 
during the procedure it is very quick
the<00:01:32.970> instrument<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:33.900> see<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.470> is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the instrument that you can see is is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.520 
the instrument that you can see is is
giving<00:01:35.159> off<00:01:35.310> some<00:01:35.640> cold<00:01:36.000> salt<00:01:36.780> water<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.380> it's

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
giving off some cold salt water so it's

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830 
giving off some cold salt water so it's
cooling<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.070> tissues<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.909> tonsillectomy

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
cooling the tissues the tonsillectomy

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.260 
cooling the tissues the tonsillectomy
itself<00:01:40.170> takes<00:01:40.470> several<00:01:40.740> seconds<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.880> do<00:01:42.030> less

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
itself takes several seconds to do less
