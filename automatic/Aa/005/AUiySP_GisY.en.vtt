flight scope tells you that it has to be
this<00:00:56.820> way

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
this way

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.180 
this way
and<00:00:57.660> then<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.079> want<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.770> take<00:00:58.980> the

and then what you want to do is take the
camera<00:00:59.789> which<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.750> side<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> put<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
camera which is on this side and put it

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.760 
camera which is on this side and put it
exactly<00:01:03.090> over<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.880> here

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
exactly over you can see this here

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.130 
exactly over you can see this here
there's<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.010> camera<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.939> position<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> right

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
there's the camera and position it right

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.120 
there's the camera and position it right
on<00:01:10.290> top<00:01:12.140> okay<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:13.890> aligned<00:01:15.710> both<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
on top okay and then aligned both at the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.160 
on top okay and then aligned both at the
target<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.490> actually<00:01:17.880> using<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> e6<00:01:18.659> true

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
target and actually using the e6 true

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.859 
target and actually using the e6 true
golf<00:01:19.409> simulator<00:01:20.009> golf<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.570> put<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.810> on

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
golf simulator golf so if you put it on

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.390 
golf simulator golf so if you put it on
top<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.680> actually<00:01:23.040> aim<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
top like that you can actually aim to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.179 
top like that you can actually aim to
your<00:01:23.520> target<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.900> slide<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.590> side<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.979> side

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
your target just slide it side to side

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.340 
your target just slide it side to side
right<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.030> there's<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.630> zoom<00:01:27.900> button<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
right in there there's a zoom button you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.649 
right in there there's a zoom button you
can<00:01:28.500> zoom<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.700> need<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.509> right

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
can zoom in if you need to to go right

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.870 
can zoom in if you need to to go right
on<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.189> flagstick<00:01:32.189> there's<00:01:32.490> easier<00:01:32.729> than

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
on that flagstick there's easier than

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.210 
on that flagstick there's easier than
actually<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:33.329> more<00:01:33.570> zoom<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.100> get

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
actually one more zoom so you can get

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.469 
actually one more zoom so you can get
right<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.790> get<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.119> really

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
right in there and get it really

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.499 
right in there and get it really
specific<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:38.520> back<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:39.150> once<00:01:39.329> it's

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
specific and then back then once it's

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.950 
specific and then back then once it's
aligned<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.590> press<00:01:40.770> continue<00:01:41.899> now<00:01:42.899> I'd

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
aligned you can press continue now I'd

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.090 
aligned you can press continue now I'd
like<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.170> show<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.439> couple<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.829> shortcuts

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
