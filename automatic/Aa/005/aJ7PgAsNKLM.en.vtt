and<00:01:25.250> you<00:01:26.250> see<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.920> he<00:01:28.920> didn't<00:01:29.280> drive

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and you see it's not he didn't drive

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.270 
and you see it's not he didn't drive
just<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.810> edges<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:31.950> early

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.840 

so<00:01:41.170> now<00:01:42.170> you're<00:01:42.470> going<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.920> take<00:01:43.159> this<00:01:43.400> all<00:01:43.670> at

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
so now you're going to take this all at

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.490 
so now you're going to take this all at
once<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.479> then<00:01:45.409> just<00:01:45.860> like<00:01:47.049> just<00:01:48.049> like<00:01:48.110> this

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
once and then just like just like this

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.620 
once and then just like just like this
once

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:08.860 

first<00:01:53.630> we<00:01:53.840> cut<00:01:54.080> here<00:01:58.119> kind<00:01:59.119> of<00:01:59.240> in<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.450> half

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:08.870 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:17.920 

we're<00:02:09.870> done<00:02:10.490> Natasha<00:02:11.490> personal<00:02:12.270> dimension

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.830 

and<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.050> see<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.680> looks<00:02:20.370> like<00:02:20.720> when<00:02:21.720> you're

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
and you see this looks like when you're

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.560 
and you see this looks like when you're
sitting<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.950> Hat<00:02:23.180> because<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.360> looks

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
sitting in the Hat because it looks

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:36.040 
sitting in the Hat because it looks
weird<00:02:28.220> doesn't<00:02:29.220> look<00:02:29.340> natural<00:02:30.300> at<00:02:30.930> all

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.920 

okay

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.440 

and<00:02:40.470> although<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:41.069> not<00:02:41.189> natural<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:42.090> looks<00:02:42.299> a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
and although it's not natural it looks a

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.869 
and although it's not natural it looks a
little<00:02:42.599> bit<00:02:42.870> better<00:02:43.220> when<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.370> cut<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
little bit better when you cut the

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:54.610 
little bit better when you cut the
leaves<00:02:45.409> like<00:02:46.409> this<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:52.769> delish

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
leaves like this so delish

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.480 
leaves like this so delish
looks<00:02:55.190> more<00:02:55.879> anxious

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:09.720 

oh<00:03:05.610> let's<00:03:06.610> start<00:03:07.000> with<00:03:07.360> this<00:03:07.510> one
