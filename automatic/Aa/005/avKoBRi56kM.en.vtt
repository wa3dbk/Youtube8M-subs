always difficult leaving home I think

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.660 
always difficult leaving home I think
it's<00:02:00.560> important<00:02:00.950> especially<00:02:01.100> if<00:02:01.370> you<00:02:01.430> do<00:02:01.580> the

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
it's important especially if you do the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.210 
it's important especially if you do the
PhD<00:02:02.150> because<00:02:02.330> you're<00:02:02.720> independent<00:02:03.260> so<00:02:03.500> you

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
PhD because you're independent so you

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.160 
PhD because you're independent so you
need<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.030> talk<00:02:05.180> to<00:02:05.300> other<00:02:05.450> people<00:02:05.480> sometimes

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
need to talk to other people sometimes

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.870 
need to talk to other people sometimes
so<00:02:06.409> yeah<00:02:06.710> it's<00:02:07.010> really<00:02:07.070> good

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
so yeah it's really good

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.170 
so yeah it's really good
from<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.300> point<00:02:08.599> of<00:02:08.750> view<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:09.140> maths<00:02:09.440> PhD

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
from the point of view of a maths PhD

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.089 
from the point of view of a maths PhD
specifically<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:12.430> opens<00:02:13.430> up<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:14.050> massive

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
specifically it opens up a massive

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.520 
specifically it opens up a massive
number<00:02:16.099> of<00:02:16.370> graduate<00:02:16.849> and<00:02:17.060> careers<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:18.349> you

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
number of graduate and careers to you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.000 
number of graduate and careers to you
that<00:02:18.860> may<00:02:19.099> not<00:02:19.400> necessarily<00:02:20.379> come<00:02:21.379> directly

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
that may not necessarily come directly

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.120 
that may not necessarily come directly
out<00:02:22.159> of

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
out of

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.370 
out of
out<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.550> an<00:02:24.730> undergraduate<00:02:25.150> maths<00:02:25.540> degree<00:02:25.810> I'm

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
out of an undergraduate maths degree I'm

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.460 
out of an undergraduate maths degree I'm
in<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.860> applied<00:02:27.070> side<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:28.120> can<00:02:29.020> go<00:02:29.140> work<00:02:29.320> for

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
in the applied side so I can go work for

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.960 
in the applied side so I can go work for
an<00:02:29.530> engineering<00:02:29.860> company<00:02:30.040> as<00:02:30.370> one<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.730> my

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
an engineering company as one of my

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.600 
an engineering company as one of my
previous<00:02:31.570> colleagues<00:02:31.750> has<00:02:32.050> done<00:02:32.610> several

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
previous colleagues has done several

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.670 
previous colleagues has done several
have<00:02:33.700> gone<00:02:33.970> into<00:02:34.090> actuary<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.900> accountancy

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
have gone into actuary and accountancy

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.100 
have gone into actuary and accountancy
so<00:02:36.070> it's<00:02:36.760> quite<00:02:36.910> varied<00:02:37.240> what<00:02:37.360> we<00:02:37.480> can<00:02:37.600> do<00:02:37.720> the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
so it's quite varied what we can do the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.440 
so it's quite varied what we can do the
fact<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.590> matter<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:39.070> that<00:02:39.490> almost

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
fact of the matter is that almost

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.690 
fact of the matter is that almost
everyone<00:02:41.110> applying<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.860> these<00:02:41.950> high-end<00:02:42.400> jobs

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
everyone applying to these high-end jobs

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.100 
everyone applying to these high-end jobs
now<00:02:42.970> has<00:02:43.300> an<00:02:44.340> undergraduate<00:02:45.340> degree<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.360> a

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
now has an undergraduate degree and a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.160 
now has an undergraduate degree and a
PhD<00:02:47.140> as<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.830> way<00:02:48.070> of<00:02:48.100> further<00:02:49.170> differentiating

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
yourself from from everyone else who'll
