chew<00:01:48.440> and<00:01:48.619> eat<00:01:48.860> is<00:01:49.040> a<00:01:49.070> lot<00:01:49.520> more<00:01:50.180> dramatic<00:01:50.420> for

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
chew and eat is a lot more dramatic for

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.920 
chew and eat is a lot more dramatic for
me<00:01:50.899> for<00:01:51.290> daily<00:01:51.740> every<00:01:52.070> day<00:01:52.399> we're<00:01:52.700> into<00:01:53.360> 18<00:01:53.720> is

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
me for daily every day we're into 18 is

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.350 
me for daily every day we're into 18 is
probably<00:01:54.350> more<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:55.130> clubbing<00:01:55.610> outgoing

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
probably more of a clubbing outgoing

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.130

wear<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:57.640> also<00:01:58.640> with<00:01:58.790> number<00:01:59.090> 38<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.899> think

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
wear and also with number 38 I think

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.070 
wear and also with number 38 I think
these<00:02:00.290> two<00:02:00.590> are<00:02:00.670> more<00:02:01.670> dramatic<00:02:02.180> so<00:02:02.420> I<00:02:02.630> really

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
these two are more dramatic so I really

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.180 
these two are more dramatic so I really
really<00:02:03.289> like<00:02:03.410> these<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.770> I<00:02:03.830> think<00:02:04.070> these

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
really like these and I think these

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.630 
really like these and I think these
