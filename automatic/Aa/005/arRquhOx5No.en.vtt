00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
linear flex technology board pretty much

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.260 
linear flex technology board pretty much
what<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.550> mean<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:38.940> gonna<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
what that mean it's gonna have the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.030 
what that mean it's gonna have the
springer<00:00:39.780> down<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.050> middle<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.620> doesn't<00:00:40.680> go

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
springer down the middle it doesn't go

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.580 
springer down the middle it doesn't go
all<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.550> way<00:00:41.579> through<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> other<00:00:42.329> side

all the way through to the other side

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.500 
all the way through to the other side
but<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.860> does<00:00:44.070> add<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.460> extra<00:00:44.640> pop<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.329> keep

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
but it does add that extra pop to keep

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.900 
but it does add that extra pop to keep
that<00:00:45.660> new<00:00:45.899> board<00:00:46.140> feeling<00:00:46.710> always<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.610> the

definitely<00:00:51.000> will<00:00:51.210> love<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.899> Evo<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.469> an

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
definitely will love that the Evo is an

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.229 
definitely will love that the Evo is an

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.720 
L ft and the name the Evo evolution
this<00:00:57.510> board<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.079> evolving<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.039> modern

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
this board is evolving the modern

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.880 
this board is evolving the modern
planing<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.870> bit<00:01:01.079> tunnel<00:01:01.590> actually

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
planing a little bit tunnel actually

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280 
planing a little bit tunnel actually
used<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.219> his<00:01:02.399> boards<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.120> evolving<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
used with his boards is evolving it's a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.719 
used with his boards is evolving it's a
little<00:01:04.500> bit<00:01:04.619> different<00:01:04.830> than<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.309> has<00:01:05.339> been<00:01:05.670> in

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
little bit different than it has been in

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.789 
little bit different than it has been in
the<00:01:05.909> past<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.990> gonna<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:07.619> bit

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the past it's gonna be a little bit

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.590 
the past it's gonna be a little bit
shorter<00:01:08.189> than<00:01:08.340> normal<00:01:08.369> that's<00:01:09.150> gonna<00:01:09.330> have

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
shorter than normal that's gonna have

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.969 
shorter than normal that's gonna have
some<00:01:09.860> more<00:01:10.860> narrow<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:12.030> easy<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> eyes

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
some more narrow or easy on the eyes

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.010 
some more narrow or easy on the eyes
like<00:01:13.979> rounded<00:01:14.520> edges<00:01:14.850> makes<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.720> board

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
like rounded edges makes this board

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.429 
like rounded edges makes this board
great<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.100> because<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.299> did<00:01:18.659> evolve<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
great for it because it did evolve and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.499 
great for it because it did evolve and
Tama<00:01:19.799> did<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.220> great<00:01:20.490> thing<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.270> board

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
Tama did a great thing that this board

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.120 
Tama did a great thing that this board
is<00:01:21.750> fired<00:01:23.630> well<00:01:24.630> don't<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.740> thought<00:01:25.920> bringing

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
is fired well don't I thought bringing

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.760 
is fired well don't I thought bringing
out<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> softer<00:01:26.909> edges<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.780> one<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
out the softer edges it's one of the

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.530 
out the softer edges it's one of the
newer<00:01:28.979> things<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.670> has<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.240> modern

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
newer things that has the modern

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.850 
newer things that has the modern
planting<00:01:30.930> hole<00:01:31.110> been<00:01:31.320> changing<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.740> also

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
planting hole been changing but it also

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.060 
planting hole been changing but it also
is<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.130> wider<00:01:32.900> center<00:01:33.900> point<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.350> where<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
is a wider center point of where the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.210 
is a wider center point of where the
Vader<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> Vanguard<00:01:36.360> even<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.619> Nano<00:01:37.890> had

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
Vader and the Vanguard even the Nano had

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
Vader and the Vanguard even the Nano had
starting<00:01:38.729> off<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> original<00:01:39.630> modern

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
starting off with the original modern

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.130 
starting off with the original modern
planting<00:01:40.350> hole<00:01:40.530> technology<00:01:41.360> but<00:01:42.360> going<00:01:42.869> in

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
planting hole technology but going in

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.080 
planting hole technology but going in
there<00:01:43.350> we're<00:01:43.950> going<00:01:44.220> with<00:01:44.549> these<00:01:44.700> softer

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
there we're going with these softer

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.490 
there we're going with these softer
edges<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.509> gonna<00:01:45.600> make<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.960> board<00:01:46.259> work

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
edges it's gonna make this board work

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.520 
edges it's gonna make this board work
best<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.189> weights<00:01:47.670> under<00:01:48.060> head<00:01:48.509> high<00:01:48.689> however

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
best and weights under head high however

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.550 
best and weights under head high however
as<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> other<00:01:50.720> Tom<00:01:51.720> Awards<00:01:52.200> it's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
as with all the other Tom Awards it's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.100 
as with all the other Tom Awards it's
gonna<00:01:52.740> hold<00:01:52.950> its<00:01:53.189> own<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.759> maybe<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.750> foot

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
gonna hold its own and maybe a foot

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.840 
gonna hold its own and maybe a foot
double<00:01:55.530> overhead<00:01:55.829> it'll<00:01:56.100> still<00:01:56.369> hold<00:01:56.640> which

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
double overhead it'll still hold which

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.440 
double overhead it'll still hold which
is<00:01:57.030> super<00:01:57.390> nice<00:01:57.540> definitely<00:01:58.350> love<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:59.450> it's

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
is super nice definitely love that it's

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.969 
is super nice definitely love that it's
very<00:02:00.719> symmetrical<00:02:01.380> throughout<00:02:01.770> you'll

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
very symmetrical throughout you'll

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:02.890 
very symmetrical throughout you'll
definitely<00:02:02.399> notice

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
definitely notice

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.420 
definitely notice
you<00:02:02.960> lift<00:02:03.170> through<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.500> board<00:02:03.860> you'll

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
you lift through the board you'll

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.280 
you lift through the board you'll
definitely<00:02:05.060> see<00:02:05.300> that<00:02:05.330> all<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.870> edges<00:02:06.170> are

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
definitely see that all the edges are

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.499 
definitely see that all the edges are
symmetrical<00:02:06.860> even<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.520> concave<00:02:07.970> doesn't<00:02:08.450> go

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
symmetrical even the concave doesn't go

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.480 
symmetrical even the concave doesn't go
over<00:02:08.690> momentarily<00:02:08.840> or<00:02:09.470> very<00:02:09.740> symmetrical<00:02:10.369> as

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
over momentarily or very symmetrical as

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.760 
over momentarily or very symmetrical as
well<00:02:11.050> all<00:02:12.050> right<00:02:12.110> this<00:02:12.410> is<00:02:12.500> going<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.680> be<00:02:12.740> a

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
well all right this is going to be a

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.660 
well all right this is going to be a
mouthful<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.660> firewire<00:02:15.380> Evo<00:02:15.800> is<00:02:16.040> rocking

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
mouthful but the firewire Evo is rocking

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.470 
mouthful but the firewire Evo is rocking
a<00:02:16.880> double<00:02:17.600> inside<00:02:18.140> single<00:02:18.770> concave<00:02:19.450> into<00:02:20.450> a

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
a double inside single concave into a

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.530 
a double inside single concave into a
split<00:02:20.960> quad<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:22.040> concave<00:02:22.520> let<00:02:23.060> me<00:02:23.180> see<00:02:23.360> if<00:02:23.450> I

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
split quad and concave let me see if I

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.970 
split quad and concave let me see if I
can<00:02:23.660> give<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.930> guys<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.260> able<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.680> show<00:02:24.920> you

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
can give you guys that able to show you

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.550 
can give you guys that able to show you
exactly<00:02:25.490> what<00:02:25.820> it's<00:02:25.940> looking<00:02:26.210> like<00:02:26.560> but

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
exactly what it's looking like but

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.030 
exactly what it's looking like but
pretty<00:02:28.130> much<00:02:28.190> what<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.180> board<00:02:29.450> is<00:02:29.540> doing

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
pretty much what this board is doing

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.410 
pretty much what this board is doing
channeling<00:02:31.040> all<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.550> water<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.120> go<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.240> the

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
channeling all the water and go to the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.810 
channeling all the water and go to the
front<00:02:32.710> slowly<00:02:33.710> dispersing<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.610> back

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
front slowly dispersing it to the back

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.090 
front slowly dispersing it to the back
making<00:02:35.510> this<00:02:35.750> board<00:02:35.990> super<00:02:36.500> light<00:02:36.680> almost

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
making this board super light almost

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.560 
making this board super light almost
like<00:02:37.220> it's<00:02:37.430> levitating<00:02:37.640> on<00:02:38.030> top<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.390> water

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
like it's levitating on top of the water

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.840 
like it's levitating on top of the water
but<00:02:39.170> as<00:02:39.320> soon<00:02:39.500> as<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:39.650> late<00:02:40.070> or<00:02:40.340> dig<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.820> that

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
but as soon as you late or dig in that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.620 
but as soon as you late or dig in that
rail<00:02:41.209> it's<00:02:41.450> gonna<00:02:41.540> turn<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.170> pop<00:02:42.440> just<00:02:43.340> like

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
rail it's gonna turn and pop just like

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.300 
rail it's gonna turn and pop just like
just<00:02:44.630> like<00:02:44.750> your<00:02:44.930> normal<00:02:45.020> forward<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.160> there

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
just like your normal forward so there

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.010 
just like your normal forward so there
really<00:02:46.459> isn't<00:02:46.760> anywhere<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.390> go<00:02:47.600> wrong<00:02:47.840> with

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
really isn't anywhere to go wrong with

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.360 
really isn't anywhere to go wrong with
this<00:02:48.170> board<00:02:48.410> it's<00:02:48.620> gonna<00:02:48.740> hold<00:02:49.040> up<00:02:49.160> pretty

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
this board it's gonna hold up pretty

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.120 
this board it's gonna hold up pretty
well<00:02:49.490> on<00:02:49.880> mushy<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.450> even<00:02:50.720> steeper

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
well on mushy that even steeper

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.530 
well on mushy that even steeper
condition<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> definitely<00:02:52.550> recommend<00:02:52.790> all

I'm stoked to add the addition to my

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.320 
I'm stoked to add the addition to my
quiver<00:03:06.250> when<00:03:07.250> you're<00:03:07.459> buying<00:03:07.670> or<00:03:08.000> if<00:03:08.180> you're

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
quiver when you're buying or if you're

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.900 
quiver when you're buying or if you're
looking<00:03:08.600> into<00:03:08.720> buying<00:03:08.900> movies<00:03:09.320> on<00:03:09.500> your<00:03:09.590> own

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
looking into buying movies on your own

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.460 
looking into buying movies on your own
definitely<00:03:10.910> use<00:03:11.390> volumes<00:03:11.930> as<00:03:12.170> your

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
definitely use volumes as your

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.380 
definitely use volumes as your
guidelines<00:03:13.130> of<00:03:13.340> where<00:03:13.519> you<00:03:13.640> use<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.209> write

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
guidelines of where you use so you write

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.390 
guidelines of where you use so you write
it<00:03:14.420> but<00:03:14.930> try<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.230> write<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.650> as<00:03:15.830> small<00:03:16.220> as

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
it but try to write it as small as

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.890 
it but try to write it as small as
possible<00:03:16.580> you're<00:03:17.090> not<00:03:17.269> going<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.510> want<00:03:17.690> a

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
possible you're not going to want a

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.140 
possible you're not going to want a
giant<00:03:17.930> clunker<00:03:18.920> board<00:03:19.130> out<00:03:19.280> there<00:03:19.310> because

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
giant clunker board out there because

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.610 
giant clunker board out there because
it's<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.480> little<00:03:20.660> bit<00:03:20.780> thicker<00:03:21.019> than<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.320> lot<00:03:21.500> of

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
it's a little bit thicker than a lot of

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.020 
it's a little bit thicker than a lot of
work<00:03:21.800> so<00:03:22.040> it's<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.190> little<00:03:22.400> bit<00:03:22.489> harder<00:03:22.730> to<00:03:22.760> turn

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
work so it's a little bit harder to turn

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.410 
work so it's a little bit harder to turn
but<00:03:23.840> it's<00:03:24.310> amazing<00:03:25.310> if<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.880> can<00:03:26.000> get<00:03:26.300> the

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
but it's amazing if you can get the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.970 
but it's amazing if you can get the
right<00:03:26.570> size<00:03:26.810> get<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.200> right<00:03:27.350> volume<00:03:27.530> you'll

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
right size get the right volume you'll

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.790 
right size get the right volume you'll
feel<00:03:28.370> how<00:03:28.790> easily<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.450> board<00:03:29.690> flows<00:03:30.050> through

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
feel how easily this board flows through

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.100 
feel how easily this board flows through
the<00:03:30.980> softer<00:03:31.760> sections<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.330> just<00:03:32.480> carries<00:03:32.840> and

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
the softer sections it just carries and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.800 
the softer sections it just carries and
it's<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.470> great<00:03:33.620> feature<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:34.040> does<00:03:34.810> my

and<00:03:39.890> models<00:03:40.550> I<00:03:40.760> use<00:03:41.300> a<00:03:41.330> medium<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:42.380> are<00:03:42.590> a

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
and models I use a medium that are a

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.560 
and models I use a medium that are a
little<00:03:42.830> bit<00:03:43.040> thicker<00:03:43.310> which<00:03:43.910> makes<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.330> nice

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
little bit thicker which makes this nice

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.320 
little bit thicker which makes this nice
it's<00:03:44.810> going<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:44.989> be<00:03:45.610> comparable<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.850> Carver

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
it's going to be comparable to a Carver

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.400 
it's going to be comparable to a Carver
the<00:03:48.140> FCS<00:03:48.590> twos<00:03:49.420> generic<00:03:50.420> Carver<00:03:50.810> gonna<00:03:51.290> be

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
the FCS twos generic Carver gonna be

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.380 
the FCS twos generic Carver gonna be
similar<00:03:51.799> to<00:03:51.830> that<00:03:51.980> just<00:03:52.760> because<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.180> sport

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
similar to that just because the sport

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.580 
similar to that just because the sport
is<00:03:53.510> going<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.690> carry<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.049> much<00:03:54.200> speed<00:03:54.410> it'll

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
is going to carry so much speed it'll

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.380 
is going to carry so much speed it'll
slow<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:54.950> down<00:03:55.100> a<00:03:55.190> little<00:03:55.340> bit<00:03:55.549> we<00:03:55.970> let<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:56.269> to

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
slow you down a little bit we let you to

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.240 
slow you down a little bit we let you to
do<00:03:56.480> those<00:03:56.660> long<00:03:56.959> throw<00:03:57.350> line<00:03:57.470> out<00:03:57.590> turns<00:03:57.890> that

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
do those long throw line out turns that

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.880 
do those long throw line out turns that
to<00:03:58.700> do<00:03:58.850> and<00:03:59.120> really<00:04:00.020> really<00:04:00.200> take<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.710> to<00:04:00.740> the

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
to do and really really take it to the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.600 
to do and really really take it to the
next<00:04:01.070> level

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
next level
