00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.370
 hello and welcome to one more time today I 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.680
 I would like to tell you about a 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.690
 very common progression between 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.369
 guitarists the progression is 145 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.429
 each of those numbers refers to 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:26.449
 the different degrees within a 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:29.240
 larger scale let's take for example the note 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.300
 of sun if we go to the scale of the sun 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.720
 older let's see that the four grades 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.760
 and fifth of that scale are the ones that 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.760
 they will be helping us to form this 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:46.489
 progression let's see sun the yes do in this 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.719
 case is a 2 is the fourth grade is a 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.410
 senior grade and rec is the fifth grade 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.320
 it is also a higher degree 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.320
 so if we start singing the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.270
 song or play the song in that sun 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.290
 greater because obviously we are using 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.990
 the major sun scale that fourth degree 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.220
 is making a greater wonder do 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.580
 because it is a higher grade 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.600
 network that is the fifth grade is also 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.260
 and finally we would go back to the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.410
 root that sol greater than we do the 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.320
 example of this progression 145 and 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:33.770
 we go back to the beginning one let's do 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.770
 four four bars 1 2 3 4 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.010
 guard 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.260
 is the fifth we return to the root well 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.850
 you can also exchange the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.000
 order within this progression by 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.460
 example begin at the root in 1 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.310
 there we go to the fourth degree later to 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.179
 fifth we can go back to the fourth grade to the 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.990
 fifth and finally finish for example 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.730
 to the fourth degree 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.910
 do not 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.370
 to the room again 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.639
 at last 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.639
 finally in first or the root if it 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:29.389
 fix this progression is very versatile and 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:33.439
 we can accompany many chants if 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:36.950
 with this basic progression I hope that 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:39.290
 this video will be very helpful if 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.379
