00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.470
 contain you know what is there 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.030
 in it is 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.979
 good question or so the house looks like 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.640
 would have packaging and now we come 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.530
 to the actual yes that is sometimes sweet 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.759
 the amount of new autumn their third 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:13.549
 year goes on and creamy yogurt 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.769
 or pudding understood here now 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.200
 I try to watch yogurt 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:25.220
 So yogurt is sweetened here 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.220
 is a yogurt okay 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.030
 So that's the way you can do it 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.020
 stir then you come this beautiful 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.430
 brown was colored 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.560
 condition and I always try now 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.730
 all my equipment over this 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.730
 to lead spoon without spilling 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.140
 Also tastes of yogurt so tastes good 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.910
 really a yogurt not after pudding 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:59.520
 and now let's get this m &amp; m putin 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.840
 blind to it so ok the couple are enough for 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.150
 the little yogurt i believe that part 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.790
 I do not know 90 cents anymore 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.780
 tasted or something 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.790
 but I just had to try it 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.190
 because the packaging was so appealing 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.080
 I give it to you and now that again 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.600
 stirred and environment has recognized 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.770
 not really much of the m &amp; ms anymore 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.300
 here the color dissolves as you can 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.560
 see this greenish bit 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.800
 So I think if you can do this here 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.520
 lasts longer or bluish greenish 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:30.810
 yes where else more so okay so the 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:46.410
 color would the moment dissolves and 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:49.080
 who is number so it's yogurt yours 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:55.170
 to minimal chocolate tastes with m &amp; ms 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:57.780
 the msm center so you can get the 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.430
 pull yogurt through your teeth as you do 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.240
 that just makes me happy or how I do that 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.240
 just like to do it often 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.280
 and then 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:21.049
 and then you have as a leftover modems 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.280
 but without nuts, m &amp; m chocolate i am 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.770
 I know those things so far only 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.620
 as a user thus, but it must be 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.910
 pure chocolate lenses from ems so nothing with 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.450
 nuts, it's all in here I watch 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.200
 normal 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.919
 Maybe I'm with you too 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.970
 chocolate sauce to stir 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.760
 Well, at least nothing stands here 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.380
 eminems filling ok i 'm just trying 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.530
 tastes somehow clear 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.240
 come 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:53.390
 yes, such a mixture of yogurt and m &amp; ms 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.860
 is definitely yes except marketing idea and 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.050
 strategy , I now understand the meaning 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.090
 and purpose behind it not there is much 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.190
 better yoghurts with some shows 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.979
 lightning then the soft then 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:09.440
 be and then to start 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:11.000
 but dissolve except dye dissolves 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.280
 there is nothing here you see fuller 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.260
 Dye the great the vehicle of the 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.970
 idea certainly very good but pure 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.140
 Tasty if you see the thing you 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.450
 you do not have to get it 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.390
 I give all the flavor 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.850
 4 more it is me the sea ​​is mine 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.100
 really not worth giving out 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.500
 nice approach nice channel this 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.860
 So video design here with these modems 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.740
 Idea but otherwise here is red dissolves 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:44.630
 this is not the spoon but in 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.279
 yes, the burner did not threaten 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:58.080
 do not provide 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:06:00.300
 and the aims to heart yes as I said mine 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.349
 life friend in the car arrived me 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.439

 fallen was helpful to yours 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.800
 bad shopping for the next time 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.650
 you do not need this yogurt 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.270
 necessarily from the mentioned reasons to 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.340
 my right one is there again 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.870
