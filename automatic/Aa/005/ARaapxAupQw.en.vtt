July<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.210> August<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.899> trend<00:00:40.649> started<00:00:41.010> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
July and August is that trend started to

July and August is that trend started to
reverse<00:00:41.430> we<00:00:41.670> closed<00:00:41.969> our<00:00:42.180> long<00:00:42.390> positions<00:00:42.930> and

reverse we closed our long positions and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.020 
reverse we closed our long positions and
now<00:00:43.770> we've<00:00:43.980> started<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.399> benefit<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
now we've started to benefit on the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.389 
now we've started to benefit on the
downside<00:00:45.420> from<00:00:46.200> falling<00:00:46.590> energy<00:00:46.950> prices

downside from falling energy prices

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.910 
downside from falling energy prices
we've<00:00:48.300> also<00:00:48.510> benefited<00:00:49.140> from<00:00:49.260> falling<00:00:49.680> base

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
we've also benefited from falling base

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.650 
we've also benefited from falling base
metals<00:00:50.340> where<00:00:50.550> we've<00:00:50.670> taken<00:00:50.879> short<00:00:51.239> positions

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
metals where we've taken short positions

just making money cheaper money supply
is<00:01:44.159> increasing<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.439> not

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

equity markets so what are you going to

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.980 
equity markets so what are you going to
do<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.759> still<00:01:53.970> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> be<00:01:54.210> short<00:01:54.390> oil<00:01:54.720> and

do is still going to be short oil and
energy<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.890> seeing<00:01:56.219> prices<00:01:56.430> plummet

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180

fifty percent for mr. live record or is

fifty percent for mr. live record or is
that<00:01:59.549> going<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.939> change<00:02:00.119> soon<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:01.049> well<00:02:01.320> it's

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that going to change soon as well it's

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.780 
that going to change soon as well it's
really<00:02:01.770> become<00:02:02.009> cheap<00:02:02.219> at<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.549> point

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
really become cheap at this point

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.910 
really become cheap at this point
basically<00:02:03.329> Cathy<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:03.960> took<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.259> lot<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.439> profits

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
basically Cathy we took a lot of profits

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.039 
basically Cathy we took a lot of profits
in<00:02:05.070> October<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.790> we're<00:02:06.180> largely<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.840> cash

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
in October so we're largely in cash

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.100 
in October so we're largely in cash
position<00:02:07.759> across<00:02:08.759> our<00:02:09.030> funds<00:02:09.300> allocated<00:02:09.810> and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
position across our funds allocated and

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.320 
position across our funds allocated and
as<00:02:10.259> new<00:02:10.770> trends<00:02:11.160> develop<00:02:11.610> either<00:02:11.879> on<00:02:12.209> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
as new trends develop either on the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.880 
as new trends develop either on the
upside

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
upside

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.980 
upside
or<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.310> downside<00:02:13.730> will<00:02:14.300> start<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.810> take

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
or the downside will start to take

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.130 
or the downside will start to take
advantage<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.560> those<00:02:15.710> trends<00:02:16.130> so<00:02:16.670> we're<00:02:16.850> very

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
advantage of those trends so we're very

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.480 
advantage of those trends so we're very
defensively<00:02:18.140> positioned<00:02:18.740> at<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> moment<00:02:19.340> and

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
defensively positioned at the moment and

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.640 
defensively positioned at the moment and
as<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.390> trends<00:02:20.660> develop<00:02:21.050> we'll<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.410> trade

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
as the trends develop we'll just trade

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.320 
as the trends develop we'll just trade
the<00:02:21.770> breakouts<00:02:22.160> what<00:02:22.700> trends<00:02:23.090> are<00:02:23.150> you<00:02:23.209> seeing

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
the breakouts what trends are you seeing

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.600 
the breakouts what trends are you seeing
when<00:02:23.660> it<00:02:23.750> comes<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.140> gold<00:02:24.380> because<00:02:25.010> gold<00:02:25.250> is

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
when it comes to gold because gold is

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.280 
when it comes to gold because gold is
kind<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.090> reversing<00:02:26.569> now<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:26.930> it's<00:02:27.020> going<00:02:27.230> to

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
kind of reversing now and it's going to

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.020 
kind of reversing now and it's going to
be<00:02:27.410> ending<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.830> year<00:02:28.069> with<00:02:28.340> a<00:02:28.550> decline

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
be ending the year with a decline

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.550 
be ending the year with a decline
something<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:29.870> haven't<00:02:30.020> seen<00:02:30.320> in<00:02:30.440> eight

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
something that we haven't seen in eight

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.770 
something that we haven't seen in eight
years<00:02:30.830> well<00:02:31.370> gold<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:31.970> sort<00:02:32.270> of<00:02:32.330> if<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:32.600> look

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
years well gold is sort of if you look

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.840 
years well gold is sort of if you look
from<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:33.020> technical<00:02:33.380> standpoint<00:02:33.800> sort<00:02:34.490> of<00:02:34.580> has

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
from a technical standpoint sort of has

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.080 
from a technical standpoint sort of has
a<00:02:34.880> its<00:02:35.750> forming<00:02:36.140> a<00:02:36.230> triangle<00:02:36.790> sort<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.850> wedge

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
a its forming a triangle sort of wedge

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.720 
a its forming a triangle sort of wedge
and<00:02:38.450> the<00:02:38.690> price<00:02:38.930> is<00:02:38.959> now<00:02:39.320> breaking<00:02:39.650> out<00:02:39.950> above

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
and the price is now breaking out above

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.330 
and the price is now breaking out above
the<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.900> negative<00:02:42.290> sloping<00:02:42.709> moving<00:02:43.010> average

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
the the negative sloping moving average

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.810 
the the negative sloping moving average
so<00:02:43.550> that's<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.910> bullish<00:02:44.750> indicator<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:46.100> the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
so that's a bullish indicator and the

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.699 
so that's a bullish indicator and the
big<00:02:47.030> factor<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:47.959> have<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.260> look<00:02:48.380> for<00:02:48.620> in

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
big factor that you have to look for in

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.130 
big factor that you have to look for in
the<00:02:48.830> gold<00:02:49.040> price<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.580> if<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.480> when<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.690> US

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
the gold price is if and when the US

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.650 
the gold price is if and when the US
dollar<00:02:51.440> corrects<00:02:52.130> from<00:02:52.519> its<00:02:52.670> massive<00:02:53.180> uptrend

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
dollar corrects from its massive uptrend

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.590 
dollar corrects from its massive uptrend
that's<00:02:54.350> going<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.680> send<00:02:54.980> gold<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:56.300> over<00:02:56.570> a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
that's going to send gold to over a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.270 
that's going to send gold to over a
thousand<00:02:57.110> dollars<00:02:57.380> per<00:02:57.560> ounce<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.040> short

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
thousand dollars per ounce in the short

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.100 
thousand dollars per ounce in the short
run<00:02:58.340> but<00:02:58.640> certainly<00:02:59.330> in<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.570> long<00:02:59.750> run<00:02:59.780> we

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
run but certainly in the long run we

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.810 
run but certainly in the long run we
expect<00:03:00.560> that<00:03:00.620> gold<00:03:00.920> could<00:03:01.100> easily<00:03:01.610> double

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
expect that gold could easily double

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.150 
expect that gold could easily double
from<00:03:02.360> its<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:03.200> know<00:03:03.290> level<00:03:03.620> today<00:03:03.860> at<00:03:03.980> around

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
from its you know level today at around

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.060 
from its you know level today at around
seven<00:03:04.550> forty<00:03:04.970> if<00:03:05.269> gold<00:03:06.080> were<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.410> double<00:03:06.680> in

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
seven forty if gold were to double in

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.699 
seven forty if gold were to double in
price<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:08.510> would<00:03:08.690> still<00:03:08.840> be<00:03:08.959> less<00:03:09.320> than<00:03:09.530> its

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
price it would still be less than its

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.790 
price it would still be less than its
inflation-adjusted<00:03:10.310> all-time<00:03:11.000> high<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.470> this

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
inflation-adjusted all-time high so this

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.400 
inflation-adjusted all-time high so this
is<00:03:12.830> I<00:03:13.580> think<00:03:13.910> one<00:03:14.390> of<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.540> best<00:03:14.750> areas<00:03:15.019> that

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
is I think one of the best areas that

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.740 
is I think one of the best areas that
investors<00:03:15.980> can<00:03:16.100> protect<00:03:16.670> their<00:03:16.940> assets<00:03:17.150> by

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
investors can protect their assets by

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.110 
investors can protect their assets by
purchasing<00:03:18.739> real<00:03:18.920> assets<00:03:19.370> like<00:03:19.519> gold<00:03:19.820> and

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
purchasing real assets like gold and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.840 
purchasing real assets like gold and
real<00:03:20.660> estate<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.200> then<00:03:21.739> possibly<00:03:22.220> obtain

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
real estate and then possibly obtain

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.640 
real estate and then possibly obtain
growth<00:03:23.329> in<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.660> portfolio<00:03:23.989> through<00:03:24.620> a

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
growth in the portfolio through a

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.560 
growth in the portfolio through a
diversified<00:03:25.370> managed<00:03:25.640> futures<00:03:25.820> fun<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.450> is

as if it goes up we can benefit on the

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.629 
as if it goes up we can benefit on the
outside<00:04:48.500> if<00:04:48.620> it<00:04:48.710> goes<00:04:48.830> continues<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.490> go<00:04:49.610> down

is<00:04:58.669> particularly<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.270> dollar<00:04:59.569> play<00:05:00.129> yeah<00:05:01.129> i

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159 
is particularly a dollar play yeah i

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:03.100 
is particularly a dollar play yeah i
mean<00:05:01.340> i<00:05:01.580> think<00:05:01.639> that<00:05:01.969> the<00:05:02.120> big<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:03.080> big

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
mean i think that the big the big

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.200 
mean i think that the big the big
question<00:05:03.770> is<00:05:03.860> when<00:05:04.159> if<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.669> when<00:05:04.819> the<00:05:04.849> dollar

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
question is when if and when the dollar

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.360 
question is when if and when the dollar
will<00:05:05.569> correct<00:05:05.990> basically<00:05:06.919> we've<00:05:07.129> seen

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
will correct basically we've seen

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.430 
will correct basically we've seen
systematic<00:05:08.120> deleveraging<00:05:08.509> of<00:05:09.020> all<00:05:09.199> assets
