drove on top gear the Prince carbon was
designed<00:03:33.260> with<00:03:33.380> one<00:03:33.560> purpose<00:03:33.830> it<00:03:34.280> just<00:03:34.610> wants

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
designed with one purpose it just wants

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.570 
designed with one purpose it just wants
to<00:03:35.000> go<00:03:35.180> fast<00:03:35.440> under<00:03:36.440> 20<00:03:36.650> miles<00:03:36.799> per<00:03:36.980> hour<00:03:37.100> it's

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
to go fast under 20 miles per hour it's

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.670 
to go fast under 20 miles per hour it's
harsh<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.420> handling<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.870> just<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.230> touch

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
harsh and the handling is just a touch

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.220 
harsh and the handling is just a touch
sluggish<00:03:40.220> so<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:41.090> stopped<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:41.720> let<00:03:41.840> about<00:03:42.019> 10

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
sluggish so I stopped and let about 10

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.199 
sluggish so I stopped and let about 10
psi<00:03:42.620> out<00:03:42.769> of<00:03:42.860> each<00:03:42.950> tire<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.489> when<00:03:43.850> I<00:03:43.880> picked

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
psi out of each tire and when I picked

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.850 
psi out of each tire and when I picked
it<00:03:44.269> up<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.510> around<00:03:44.630> 22<00:03:45.140> miles<00:03:45.350> per<00:03:45.470> hour<00:03:45.709> I

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
it up to around 22 miles per hour I

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.220 
it up to around 22 miles per hour I
started<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.370> notice<00:03:46.519> something<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.390> bike<00:03:47.720> was

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
started to notice something the bike was

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.710 
started to notice something the bike was
coming<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.709> life<00:03:48.890> so<00:03:49.519> since<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.269> had<00:03:50.420> a<00:03:50.450> few

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
coming to life so since I had a few

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.240 
coming to life so since I had a few
miles<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.080> flat<00:03:51.290> before<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.680> started<00:03:52.040> climbing

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
miles of flat before I started climbing

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.360 
miles of flat before I started climbing
I<00:03:52.610> pinned<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:53.360> held<00:03:54.049> it<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:54.410> held<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.220> and

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
I pinned it and held it and held it and

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.580 
I pinned it and held it and held it and
held<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.330> couldn't<00:03:56.690> believe<00:03:56.810> how<00:03:57.019> easy<00:03:57.200> it

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
held it I couldn't believe how easy it

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.949 
held it I couldn't believe how easy it
was<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:57.890> keep<00:03:58.070> this<00:03:58.220> by<00:03:58.400> going<00:03:58.820> above<00:03:59.299> 25<00:03:59.720> miles

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
was to keep this by going above 25 miles

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:00.400 
was to keep this by going above 25 miles
per<00:04:00.049> hour

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
per hour

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.070 
per hour
and<00:04:00.650> then<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.640> hit<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:01.970> hills<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.510> was<00:04:02.780> feeling

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
and then I hit the hills I was feeling

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.460 
and then I hit the hills I was feeling
good

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
good

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.690 
good
so<00:04:03.590> I<00:04:03.620> punched<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.160> at<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.340> bottom<00:04:04.580> of<00:04:04.640> the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
so I punched it at the bottom of the

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.910 
so I punched it at the bottom of the
first<00:04:04.940> one<00:04:05.120> I<00:04:05.299> got<00:04:05.600> about<00:04:05.810> halfway<00:04:06.080> up<00:04:06.440> in<00:04:06.680> my

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
first one I got about halfway up in my

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.259 
first one I got about halfway up in my
21<00:04:07.549> mind<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.480> had<00:04:09.260> to<00:04:09.500> grab<00:04:09.680> my<00:04:09.709> 23<00:04:10.459> and

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
21 mind you and had to grab my 23 and

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.229 
21 mind you and had to grab my 23 and
that's<00:04:12.079> when<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.920> bike<00:04:13.070> started<00:04:13.519> laughing<00:04:13.880> at

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
that's when the bike started laughing at

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.360 
that's when the bike started laughing at
me<00:04:14.390> it<00:04:14.750> was<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.320> was<00:04:15.410> still<00:04:15.500> rocketing<00:04:16.100> forward

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
me it was it was still rocketing forward

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.729 
me it was it was still rocketing forward
like<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.519> race<00:04:16.760> car<00:04:17.060> but<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.540> simply<00:04:18.290> didn't<00:04:18.530> have

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
like a race car but I simply didn't have

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.710 
like a race car but I simply didn't have
the<00:04:18.769> legs<00:04:19.160> to<00:04:19.280> keep<00:04:19.519> up<00:04:19.669> with<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.910> pace<00:04:20.150> that

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
the legs to keep up with the pace that

the legs to keep up with the pace that
the<00:04:20.840> Prince<00:04:21.080> was<00:04:21.229> demanding<00:04:21.770> so<00:04:22.460> I<00:04:22.729> popped<00:04:23.180> I

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479

trash in a really heavy Italian accent

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.450 
trash in a really heavy Italian accent
as<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.139> limped<00:04:30.560> over<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.889> top<00:04:31.069> of<00:04:31.219> the<00:04:31.280> climb

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.689 
them
I<00:04:41.419> simply<00:04:42.110> let<00:04:42.620> go<00:04:42.800> of<00:04:42.919> the<00:04:42.979> brakes<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.580> let

at<00:04:52.280> speed<00:04:52.669> with<00:04:53.330> no<00:04:53.360> brakes<00:04:53.990> I<00:04:54.379> was<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.400> one

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
at speed with no brakes I was the one

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.439 
at speed with no brakes I was the one
who<00:04:55.639> started<00:04:55.909> screaming<00:04:56.270> like<00:04:56.419> a

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
who started screaming like a

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.050 
who started screaming like a
twelve-year-old<00:04:56.900> girl<00:04:57.080> well<00:04:58.009> not<00:04:58.610> really<00:04:58.789> but

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
twelve-year-old girl well not really but

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.610 
twelve-year-old girl well not really but
on<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.479> inside<00:04:59.779> a<00:04:59.810> little<00:04:59.990> bit<00:05:00.110> I<00:05:00.409> was

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
on the inside a little bit I was

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.830 
on the inside a little bit I was
absolutely<00:05:01.069> floored<00:05:01.610> at<00:05:02.120> how<00:05:02.210> stable<00:05:02.599> the

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
absolutely floored at how stable the

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.019 
absolutely floored at how stable the
bike<00:05:02.990> was<00:05:03.259> at<00:05:03.590> such<00:05:03.770> high<00:05:03.800> speed<00:05:04.370> and<00:05:04.610> how

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:05.029 
bike was at such high speed and how

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:07.269 
bike was at such high speed and how
intuitively<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.409> whipped<00:05:06.830> through<00:05:07.009> the<00:05:07.129> off

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:07.279 
intuitively it whipped through the off

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:09.070 
intuitively it whipped through the off
camber<00:05:07.789> corners<00:05:08.210> at<00:05:08.419> full<00:05:08.629> tilt

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080
