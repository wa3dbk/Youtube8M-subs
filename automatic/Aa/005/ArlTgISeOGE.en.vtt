but you know good to try different

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.140 
but you know good to try different
things<00:02:46.850> see<00:02:47.390> what<00:02:47.540> happens

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.240 

and<00:02:55.150> then<00:02:55.299> white<00:02:55.480> these<00:02:55.599> get<00:02:55.959> races<00:02:56.769> get<00:02:56.950> glued

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
and then white these get races get glued

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.530 
and then white these get races get glued
on<00:02:58.709> could<00:02:59.709> be<00:02:59.829> tape<00:03:00.040> on<00:03:00.250> these<00:03:00.400> faces<00:03:00.969> and<00:03:01.329> then

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
on could be tape on these faces and then

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.449 
on could be tape on these faces and then
tape<00:03:01.810> on<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.170> face<00:03:02.379> so<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.189> glue<00:03:03.370> you

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
tape on the face so that the glue you

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.369 
tape on the face so that the glue you
squeeze<00:03:03.519> is<00:03:03.969> I<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.480> then<00:03:04.629> it<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:07.000> doesn't

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
squeeze is I and then it and it doesn't

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.349 
squeeze is I and then it and it doesn't
it<00:03:08.379> doesn't<00:03:08.590> get<00:03:08.769> onto<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.099> wood<00:03:12.120> okay<00:03:13.120> no<00:03:13.180> I
