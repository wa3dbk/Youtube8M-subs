well<00:01:10.220> well<00:01:11.220> season<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.260> season<00:01:13.260> two<00:01:13.500> was<00:01:13.650> out

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
well well season to season two was out

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.990 
well well season to season two was out
and<00:01:14.100> actually<00:01:14.840> um<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.920> initial<00:01:17.220> stages<00:01:17.430> I

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
and actually um in the initial stages I

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640 
and actually um in the initial stages I
think<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.420> first<00:01:18.479> seven<00:01:18.930> episodes<00:01:19.110> it

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
think for the first seven episodes it

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.499 
think for the first seven episodes it
was<00:01:19.740> called<00:01:20.009> pixelmon<00:01:20.490> adventure<00:01:20.909> season<00:01:21.330> two

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
