00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.800 
these up to the E minor remember the bar
is<00:02:06.070> basically<00:02:06.220> like<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:06.910> piece<00:02:07.240> like<00:02:07.570> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
is basically like this piece like the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.950 
is basically like this piece like the
fret<00:02:08.380> nut<00:02:08.890> here<00:02:09.420> when<00:02:10.420> your<00:02:10.510> finger<00:02:10.720> up<00:02:10.840> and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
fret nut here when your finger up and

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.300 
fret nut here when your finger up and
just<00:02:11.080> moving<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.530> everything's<00:02:12.040> moving

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
just moving this everything's moving

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.430 
just moving this everything's moving
with<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.940> so<00:02:13.300> these<00:02:13.420> two<00:02:13.570> fingers<00:02:13.780> are<00:02:14.200> in

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
with it and so these two fingers are in

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.710 
with it and so these two fingers are in
the<00:02:14.530> same<00:02:14.740> twice<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.250> eat<00:02:15.540> there's<00:02:16.540> one

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
the same twice as you eat there's one

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.860 
the same twice as you eat there's one
blank<00:02:17.050> pret<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.710> then<00:02:18.010> then<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:19.300> your<00:02:19.480> bar<00:02:19.750> has

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
blank pret and then then so your bar has

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.630 
blank pret and then then so your bar has
moved<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.560> nut<00:02:20.830> up<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.220> now<00:02:21.340> there's<00:02:21.520> your

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
moved the nut up and now there's your

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.750 
moved the nut up and now there's your
one<00:02:22.260> empty<00:02:23.260> fret<00:02:23.560> nothing<00:02:23.890> on<00:02:24.010> there<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.430> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
one empty fret nothing on there and the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.930 
one empty fret nothing on there and the
new<00:02:24.880> E<00:02:24.910> minor<00:02:25.150> F<00:02:25.740> sharp<00:02:26.740> minor<00:02:26.920> take<00:02:27.760> some

new E minor F sharp minor take some
practice<00:02:28.060> together<00:02:28.380> okay<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:29.440> those<00:02:29.620> are<00:02:29.680> all

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
practice together okay so those are all

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.740 
practice together okay so those are all
the<00:02:30.010> chords<00:02:30.460> key<00:02:30.880> play<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.240> basically<00:02:31.600> the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
the chords key play is basically the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.870 
the chords key play is basically the
same<00:02:31.900> rhythm<00:02:32.260> throughout<00:02:32.770> the<00:02:32.830> song<00:02:33.220> there

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:31.670 
but first let's just blend courts so
let's<00:03:07.260> start<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.650> off

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:39.449 

be<00:03:32.680> down<00:03:37.680> really<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.769> lot<00:03:38.950> of<00:03:39.069> ways<00:03:39.189> to<00:03:39.280> play

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
be down really a lot of ways to play

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:53.120 
be down really a lot of ways to play
this<00:03:39.579> I<00:03:39.760> see<00:03:39.909> people<00:03:40.180> do<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.359> like<00:03:40.450> this

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.190 

and<00:03:53.490> you<00:03:53.700> have<00:03:53.820> to<00:03:53.940> say<00:03:54.180> for<00:03:54.450> both<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:55.020> G

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
and you have to say for both the a the G

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.680 
and you have to say for both the a the G
so<00:03:55.410> again<00:03:55.680> this<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.310> all<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.490> four<00:03:56.850> one<00:03:57.270> two

so again this is all in four one two

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:15.330 
so again this is all in four one two
three<00:03:57.720> four<00:03:58.530> it's

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340
