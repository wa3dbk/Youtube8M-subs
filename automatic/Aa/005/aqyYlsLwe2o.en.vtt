00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.170
 all right 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:17.880
 we attend the presentation of a new 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.880
 vehicle that hyundai incorporates into its range 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.090
 which is the veloster a vehicle with a 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.280
 very particular configuration that goes without 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.410
 no doubt to generate controversy as 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.330
 this one especially I think that the best 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.099
 can you describe the service 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.829
 president of hilda de argentina 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.559
 story first thing you look at the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.929
 vehicle in tain cylinder that aesthetic 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.469
 for him and it is known that he has three doors 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.879
 clarified two and one after no does not have three 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.679
 it was a big one on one side and another one 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.780
 girl from the other and that's where the 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.179
 surprise as the sixth ours as 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.909
 well said the car was designed and 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.890
 thought like a coupe but good 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.539
 obviously hyundai did a study to a 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.699
 market research among 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 users of the coupÃ©s and they 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.799
 they determined that the big problem 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.810
 and the users I occupied was what we do 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.450
 when someone wants to go up to the squares 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.869
 back is to open those giant doors 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.600
 that they have to run the seat and be able to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.280
 access and that's quite cumbersome 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.530
 then hyundai came out with this idea 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.360
 they threw us very well that is to endow 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.549
 driver's side car is a coupe 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.680
 with the big door and the aesthetics of 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.390
 cooper and that of the companion has two 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.310
 smaller doors allowing you 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.899
 good to climb the passenger and go up 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.030
 the rear seats without having to run 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.619
 no seat for you to use for example 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.619
 that there is a thought to be 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.619
 segments of people that are thought to 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.240
 people who want to have a sports car 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.850
 but who wants to have a functional car 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.800
 also a mix that people that out there 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.320
 wants to have a single car that can 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.080
 give both the two benefits 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.690
 I tell them that to put together 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.729
 somehow the model national model 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.850
 that yes it is going to have Argentineans did 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 a kind of consultation through 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.690
 Internet with six thousand users 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.310
 correctable said good you have 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.170
 to spend on the price of the vehicle 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.090
 about thirty thousand dollars if you have 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.580
 five thousand dollars to spend more on 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.950
 accessories within this range of 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.930
 accessories of finally what are the 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.000
 what would you like to have I have 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.370
 understood that one of the things that most 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.110
 people referred to the question of 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.060
 security security so good 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.760
 basically what we did was 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.280
 what the department usually does 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.350
 of marketing product of a company 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.360
 that is about a car put together a 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.239
 configuration based on maybe to the 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.950
 competition at a target price what 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.900
 we decided is that people do 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.209
 directly that people configure the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.489
 car as I wanted it based on a price 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.370
 goal that we had pointed to 35 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.610
 thousand dollars then were these 30 these 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.320
 5 and 20 20 options to choose from with those 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.170
 five thousand dollars could not be not 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.170
 they could choose the sale then there was 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.970
 opt for one and discard another and good 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.099
 it really was very interesting people 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.890
 it ended very well we were three 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:10.170
 months online on the internet and we had six 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.400
 thousand different configurations and on base 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.520
 to those six thousand configurations 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.130
 finally the configuration was decided 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.690
 final based on what the majority chose 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.569
 no more than 50 percent 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.950
 We took it as a parameter and it was 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.290
 configure the veloster as we are 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.000
 selling one of the things that one 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.390
 pretend sometimes of a vehicle 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.519
 sports is a lot of performance aims 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.510
 power though that this vehicle 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.850
 the power that is promoted is 130 hp 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.660
 it's an engine that has all the technology 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:46.230
 current with its emissions in an engine that 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.060
 a good power but 130 hp that can 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.530
 sound little but that is more than 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.000
 enough its but I would also like 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.790
 of why 130 hp and then 180 or 200 or so 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.220
 that it was and surely 130 hp not be 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.750
 very far from what I had one is not yet 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:07.440
 a purchase hopefully at the moment we did not arrive 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.040
 but sports car I think that in this 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.550
 hyundai case chose a modern driver 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.640
 as you said where the focus was on 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.220
 low consumption in low emissions and 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.840
 not so much in power delivery and for 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.010
 what is this because when you analyze 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.160
 we take the work of 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.050
 analyze the market locally and what 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.180
 we could determine is that 80 per 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.900
 percent of the sale that is made in this 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.560
 Type of cars are engines between 85 and 125 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.720
 horses thank you in this since I already 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.280
 we promise that we will do a test 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.930
 so I can take you contact 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.930
 directly with a vehicle 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.160
 plus
