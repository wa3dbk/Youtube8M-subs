00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and us to fine-tune it so he can put

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.709 
and us to fine-tune it so he can put
this<00:00:32.399> on<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> small<00:00:32.969> block<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.450> what<00:00:33.570> we're

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
this on a small block so what we're

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.970 
this on a small block so what we're
gonna<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.079> make<00:00:34.230> sure<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.559> thing<00:00:34.770> is

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
gonna do is make sure this thing is

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.520 
gonna do is make sure this thing is
perfectly<00:00:35.460> balanced<00:00:36.170> whenever<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.260> look<00:00:37.380> at

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
perfectly balanced whenever you look at

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.260 
perfectly balanced whenever you look at
the<00:00:37.649> screen<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.489> see<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.850> inside<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
the screen here you see you inside the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.319 
the screen here you see you inside the
big<00:00:39.420> circle<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.020> radius<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> plane<00:00:41.329> what

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
big circle the radius and the plane what

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.930 
big circle the radius and the plane what
that<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> radius<00:00:43.350> obviously<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.489> half<00:00:44.760> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that is the radius obviously is half a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.049 
that is the radius obviously is half a
diameter<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.770> center<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.219> hub<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
diameter so the center of that hub to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.459 
diameter so the center of that hub to
the<00:00:48.090> outside<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> flower<00:00:48.899> right<00:00:49.410> here

the outside of the flower right here
with<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> ring<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.480> from<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:51.690> into<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
with the ring here is from here into the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500 
with the ring here is from here into the
hub<00:00:52.350> that's<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.920> radius<00:00:53.340> which<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.760> 7<00:00:54.149> inches

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
hub that's the radius which is 7 inches

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.529 
hub that's the radius which is 7 inches

and the plane is from the center of the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.959 
and the plane is from the center of the
stanchion<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:59.250> right<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.789> where

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
stanchion right here to right here where

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.220 
stanchion right here to right here where
we're<00:01:00.120> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.390> drilling<00:01:00.629> inside<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
we're going to be drilling inside the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.619 
we're going to be drilling inside the
flywheel<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.609> that's<00:01:03.090> nine<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> half

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
flywheel so that's nine and a half

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.960 
flywheel so that's nine and a half
inches<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.260> let's<00:01:04.979> turn<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.790> see

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
inches so let's turn it on here and see

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.640 
inches so let's turn it on here and see
how<00:01:06.090> far<00:01:06.330> out<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.260> how<00:01:07.290> much<00:01:07.439> work

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
how far out it is and see how much work

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:17.849 
how far out it is and see how much work
we<00:01:07.710> got<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:07.979> do

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.550 

slide<00:01:18.460> will<00:01:18.640> attorneys<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.210> 500<00:01:19.899> RPM<00:01:20.259> just

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
slide will attorneys that 500 RPM just

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.800 
slide will attorneys that 500 RPM just
like<00:01:20.679> we<00:01:20.859> whenever<00:01:21.579> we<00:01:21.640> balance<00:01:21.969> a<00:01:22.030> crankshaft

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
like we whenever we balance a crankshaft

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:41.819 
like we whenever we balance a crankshaft
returned<00:01:23.140> at<00:01:23.259> 500<00:01:23.799> rpms

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.499 

all<00:01:42.829> right<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.040> just<00:01:43.280> read<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.610> program<00:01:44.060> so

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
all right I just read the program so

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.600 
all right I just read the program so
what<00:01:44.810> it<00:01:44.960> tells<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:45.530> is<00:01:45.740> it's<00:01:46.729> 17<00:01:47.360> grams<00:01:47.689> out

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
what it tells you is it's 17 grams out

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.270 
what it tells you is it's 17 grams out
and<00:01:49.610> if<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.850> follow<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:51.380> dial<00:01:51.649> they<00:01:52.009> are<00:01:52.070> on

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
and if you follow the dial they are on

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.840 
and if you follow the dial they are on
the<00:01:52.399> compass<00:01:52.850> if<00:01:53.119> we<00:01:53.270> bring<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:53.750> up<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:55.130> zero

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
the compass if we bring it up to zero

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.320 
the compass if we bring it up to zero
straight<00:01:56.090> up<00:01:56.240> top

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
straight up top

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.480 
straight up top
top<00:01:59.020> dead<00:01:59.260> center<00:01:59.650> that<00:01:59.800> tells<00:02:00.040> us<00:02:00.220> where<00:02:00.400> we

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
top dead center that tells us where we

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.820 
top dead center that tells us where we
need<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:00.730> drill<00:02:00.970> okay<00:02:01.330> so<00:02:02.200> we<00:02:02.290> can<00:02:02.440> actually

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
need to drill okay so we can actually

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.090 
need to drill okay so we can actually
drill<00:02:03.040> some<00:02:03.250> holes<00:02:03.280> in<00:02:03.880> this<00:02:04.030> area<00:02:04.420> here<00:02:05.100> to

mount the 17 grams to get it right or
what<00:02:09.009> we're<00:02:09.130> going<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.340> do<00:02:09.399> on<00:02:09.520> this<00:02:09.700> one<00:02:09.940> is

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
what we're going to do on this one is

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.710 
what we're going to do on this one is
you<00:02:10.149> rotate<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:10.780> down<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.230> 180<00:02:11.770> degrees<00:02:12.720> and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
you rotate this down to 180 degrees and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.410 
you rotate this down to 180 degrees and
what<00:02:14.020> we'll<00:02:14.200> do<00:02:14.350> then<00:02:14.620> it's<00:02:15.430> an<00:02:15.610> add<00:02:15.790> weight<00:02:16.150> to

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
what we'll do then it's an add weight to

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.900 
what we'll do then it's an add weight to
it<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.290> well<00:02:17.950> if<00:02:18.310> whenever<00:02:18.460> look<00:02:18.760> at<00:02:18.850> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
it so well if whenever look at the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.610 
it so well if whenever look at the
flywheel<00:02:19.120> here<00:02:19.630> it's<00:02:19.780> actually<00:02:19.930> right<00:02:20.350> in<00:02:20.380> the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
flywheel here it's actually right in the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.500 
flywheel here it's actually right in the
holes<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.070> he<00:02:21.190> drilled<00:02:21.490> so<00:02:21.850> what<00:02:22.000> happens<00:02:22.390> it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
holes that he drilled so what happens it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.570 
holes that he drilled so what happens it
gets<00:02:22.600> drilled<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.930> little<00:02:23.140> bit<00:02:23.230> past<00:02:23.580> class

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
gets drilled a little bit past class

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.580 
gets drilled a little bit past class
flush<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.300> flywheel<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:25.840> actually<00:02:26.260> your

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
flush on the flywheel and actually your

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.680 
flush on the flywheel and actually your
drill<00:02:26.890> marks<00:02:27.340> or<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.850> actually<00:02:28.420> drilled<00:02:28.660> a

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
drill marks or the actually drilled a

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.720 
drill marks or the actually drilled a
little<00:02:28.780> but<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.230> got<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.470> light<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:29.950> what

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
little but you got it light so what

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.610 
little but you got it light so what
we're<00:02:30.850> going<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.000> do<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.570> drill<00:02:31.870> well

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
we're going to do is just drill well

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.560 
we're going to do is just drill well
some<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.280> these<00:02:33.370> holds<00:02:33.850> up<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.060> he<00:02:34.300> drilled

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
some of these holds up that he drilled

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.350 
some of these holds up that he drilled
and<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.740> spinning<00:02:36.040> again<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.700> keep<00:02:37.030> doing

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
and it spinning again and keep doing

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.880 
and it spinning again and keep doing
that<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.660> fine<00:02:37.900> tune<00:02:38.170> until<00:02:38.560> we<00:02:38.650> get<00:02:38.770> it

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that and fine tune until we get it

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.240 
that and fine tune until we get it
perfect<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:40.140> that's<00:02:41.140> how<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.470> bounce<00:02:41.920> a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
perfect so that's how you bounce a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.730 
perfect so that's how you bounce a
flywheel<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.000> be<00:02:43.180> perfectly<00:02:43.780> zero<00:02:44.320> internal

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
flywheel to be perfectly zero internal

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.440 
flywheel to be perfectly zero internal
balance<00:02:45.720> thanks<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:46.840> have<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:47.020> good<00:02:47.200> day
