you can see it's like really off I got
the<00:00:21.560> new<00:00:21.710> room<00:00:21.980> on<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:22.400> right<00:00:22.519> hand<00:00:22.730> side<00:00:22.900> the

the new room on the right hand side the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.839 
the new room on the right hand side the
old<00:00:24.140> rims<00:00:24.349> on<00:00:24.560> the<00:00:24.619> left<00:00:24.859> so<00:00:25.220> you<00:00:25.310> can<00:00:25.460> see<00:00:25.609> how

old rims on the left so you can see how

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.300 
old rims on the left so you can see how
it's<00:00:26.660> totally<00:00:26.990> off<00:00:27.169> what<00:00:27.830> we're<00:00:28.009> doing<00:00:28.220> is

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
it's totally off what we're doing is

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.159 
it's totally off what we're doing is
we're<00:00:28.429> going<00:00:28.519> to<00:00:28.640> try<00:00:28.970> to<00:00:29.029> read<00:00:29.330> we're<00:00:30.050> going

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
we're going to try to read we're going

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.380 
we're going to try to read we're going
to<00:00:30.230> cheat<00:00:30.439> we're<00:00:30.619> just<00:00:30.829> going<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.180> relase<00:00:32.180> it

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
to cheat we're just going to relase it

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.180 
to cheat we're just going to relase it
by<00:00:32.540> just<00:00:32.570> picking<00:00:33.290> them<00:00:33.590> together<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:33.980> moving

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
by just picking them together and moving

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.370 
by just picking them together and moving
the<00:00:34.310> spokes<00:00:34.550> over<00:00:34.820> one<00:00:35.000> at<00:00:35.120> a<00:00:35.240> time<00:00:35.420> so<00:00:35.870> it'll

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
the spokes over one at a time so it'll

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.540 
the spokes over one at a time so it'll
just<00:00:36.410> be<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.650> little<00:00:36.739> bit<00:00:36.949> quicker<00:00:37.160> you<00:00:37.399> don't

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
just be a little bit quicker you don't

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.369 
just be a little bit quicker you don't
have<00:00:37.670> to<00:00:37.789> like<00:00:38.000> put<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:38.300> spokes<00:00:38.629> in<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.170> plip

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
have to like put the spokes in and plip

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.139 
have to like put the spokes in and plip
and<00:00:39.410> plop<00:00:39.649> it<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.250> do<00:00:40.460> all<00:00:40.579> that<00:00:40.610> stuff<00:00:40.760> so

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
and plop it and do all that stuff so

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:49.029 
and plop it and do all that stuff so
okay<00:00:42.079> let's<00:00:42.680> see<00:00:42.859> you<00:00:42.980> work<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:48.039> basically

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
okay let's see you work and basically

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.880 
okay let's see you work and basically
I'm<00:00:49.309> gonna<00:00:49.519> I<00:00:50.050> don't<00:00:51.050> have<00:00:51.260> a<00:00:51.289> nipple<00:00:51.559> driver

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
I'm gonna I don't have a nipple driver

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.229 
I'm gonna I don't have a nipple driver
so<00:00:52.219> I'm<00:00:52.309> just<00:00:52.430> going<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:52.670> use<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.789> plain<00:00:53.210> old

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
so I'm just going to use a plain old

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:01.029 
so I'm just going to use a plain old
screwdriver<00:00:54.640> start<00:00:55.640> at<00:00:56.019> one<00:00:57.019> side<00:01:00.039> just

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
screwdriver start at one side just

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.740 
screwdriver start at one side just
unscrew<00:01:02.559> I've<00:01:03.559> already<00:01:03.800> pre<00:01:04.480> unscrewed<00:01:05.480> a<00:01:05.600> lot

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
unscrew I've already pre unscrewed a lot

unscrew I've already pre unscrewed a lot
of<00:01:05.900> us<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:06.290> it's<00:01:06.410> going<00:01:06.530> to<00:01:06.590> look<00:01:06.800> pretty<00:01:06.950> easy

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:21.630 

and<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.230> got<00:01:12.980> a<00:01:13.010> box<00:01:13.190> room<00:01:13.550> pick<00:01:14.090> up<00:01:14.300> right<00:01:14.510> here

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.250 

so<00:01:22.640> just<00:01:22.670> like<00:01:23.060> one<00:01:23.240> of<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.450> easiest<00:01:23.990> ways<00:01:24.230> to

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
so just like one of the easiest ways to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.520 
so just like one of the easiest ways to
kind<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.710> release<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.610> wheel<00:01:25.790> yeah<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.600> if<00:01:27.380> you

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
kind of release the wheel yeah is if you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.500 
kind of release the wheel yeah is if you
don't<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:27.950> have<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:28.190> like<00:01:28.220> put<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.030> rims<00:01:29.300> in

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
don't you have to like put the rims in

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.260 
don't you have to like put the rims in
like<00:01:29.810> a<00:01:29.840> eight<00:01:30.500> pairs<00:01:30.980> at<00:01:31.250> a<00:01:31.280> time<00:01:31.520> or<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:31.910> set

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
like a eight pairs at a time or a set

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.870 
like a eight pairs at a time or a set
some<00:01:32.480> time<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:33.500> a<00:01:33.620> pain<00:01:33.800> but<00:01:34.070> this

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
some time and it's just a pain but this

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.610 
some time and it's just a pain but this
way<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.540> just<00:01:35.750> works

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.560 

so<00:01:43.620> you<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.890> start<00:01:44.160> it<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.820> that's<00:01:45.000> good<00:01:45.270> so

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
so you just start it so that's good so

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.000 
so you just start it so that's good so
you<00:01:45.660> start<00:01:45.900> the<00:01:45.990> next<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.260> I<00:01:46.410> need<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> move<00:01:46.860> on

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
you start the next one I need to move on

00:01:47.010 --> 00:02:16.840 
you start the next one I need to move on
until<00:01:47.220> you're<00:01:47.400> done<00:01:47.490> with<00:01:47.700> all<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.940> nipples

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.170 

so<00:02:17.850> now<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.210> have<00:02:18.270> at<00:02:18.510> least<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.990> very

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
so now that you have at least I very

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.890 
so now that you have at least I very
altruistic<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:23.040> know<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.940> kind<00:02:24.150> of

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.060 

like<00:02:28.250> makes<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.450> go<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.630> better<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.200> less

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
like makes you go in better and less

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:58.649 
like makes you go in better and less
corrosion<00:02:32.610> chances<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.320> lot<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.590> people

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.119 

so<00:02:59.659> what<00:02:59.780> are<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.900> doing<00:03:00.049> now<00:03:00.170> clock<00:03:00.469> so

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
so what are you doing now clock so

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.770 
so what are you doing now clock so
basically<00:03:01.670> now<00:03:01.849> it's<00:03:02.120> called<00:03:02.329> the<00:03:02.450> dishing

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
basically now it's called the dishing

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.349 
basically now it's called the dishing
tool<00:03:02.930> I'm<00:03:03.439> using<00:03:03.499> it<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.129> measure<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:05.150> wheels

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
tool I'm using it to measure the wheels

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.289 
tool I'm using it to measure the wheels
level<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:07.249> hub<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.579> actually<00:03:07.909> in<00:03:07.999> the<00:03:08.060> center

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
level the hub is actually in the center

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.059 
level the hub is actually in the center
of<00:03:08.329> the<00:03:08.510> rim<00:03:08.689> so<00:03:10.810> flip<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.959> over<00:03:12.049> this<00:03:12.500> side<00:03:12.769> you

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
of the rim so flip it over this side you

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.619 
of the rim so flip it over this side you
can<00:03:13.609> see<00:03:13.639> there's<00:03:14.000> about<00:03:14.150> two<00:03:14.359> millimeters

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
can see there's about two millimeters

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.360 
can see there's about two millimeters
difference<00:03:15.409> so<00:03:15.680> what<00:03:15.980> I'm<00:03:16.069> going<00:03:16.159> to<00:03:16.219> have<00:03:16.340> to

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
difference so what I'm going to have to

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.129 
difference so what I'm going to have to
do<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.670> tighten<00:03:16.849> one<00:03:17.180> side<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.629> spokes<00:03:17.900> all

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.139 
do is tighten one side of the spokes all

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:22.750 
do is tighten one side of the spokes all
of<00:03:18.379> them<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:19.669> pulls<00:03:19.909> the<00:03:20.569> hub<00:03:20.810> up<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:22.010> the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
of them so it pulls the hub up to the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.509 
of them so it pulls the hub up to the
same<00:03:22.939> height<00:03:23.150> as<00:03:23.389> the<00:03:23.510> other<00:03:23.629> side<00:03:25.450> that's

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
same height as the other side that's

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.119 
same height as the other side that's
basically<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.849> wheel<00:03:29.239> is<00:03:29.560> up<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.799> millimeters

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
basically the wheel is up to millimeters

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.640 
basically the wheel is up to millimeters
off<00:03:31.519> center<00:03:31.849> so<00:03:32.750> we'll<00:03:32.959> put<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:33.169> out<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.409> truth

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
off center so we'll put it out the truth

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.409 
off center so we'll put it out the truth
yeah<00:03:33.949> just<00:03:34.430> tighten<00:03:34.609> up<00:03:34.760> all<00:03:34.939> the<00:03:35.060> spokes<00:03:35.209> on

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
yeah just tighten up all the spokes on

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:40.270 
yeah just tighten up all the spokes on
one<00:03:35.569> side<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:37.510> check<00:03:38.510> tradition<00:03:39.280> so

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
one side and check tradition so

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.459 
one side and check tradition so
basically<00:03:40.819> wheels<00:03:41.569> kind<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:42.019> true<00:03:42.169> i'm<00:03:42.349> going

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:42.469 
basically wheels kind of true i'm going

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.080 
basically wheels kind of true i'm going
to<00:03:42.560> just<00:03:42.739> go<00:03:42.829> ahead<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:43.069> kind<00:03:43.250> of<00:03:43.430> pretension

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
to just go ahead and kind of pretension

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.039 
to just go ahead and kind of pretension
some<00:03:44.389> just<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:45.560> a<00:03:45.919> couple<00:03:46.099> times<00:03:47.049> flipped

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
some just this a couple times flipped

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.130 
some just this a couple times flipped
over<00:03:48.230> try<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:48.859> tension<00:03:49.730> it

okay if I got from the truing stand and
make<00:03:57.380> sure<00:03:57.440> it's<00:03:57.680> all<00:03:57.770> food<00:04:05.830> that<00:04:06.830> was<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.070> not
