00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
welcome to the first X line tutorial

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.460 
welcome to the first X line tutorial
well<00:00:02.669> I'd<00:00:02.879> like<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.149> show<00:00:03.360> you<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.810> basic<00:00:04.170> idea

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
well I'd like to show you the basic idea

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.369 
well I'd like to show you the basic idea
of<00:00:04.740> our<00:00:05.069> development<00:00:05.730> our<00:00:06.330> motivation<00:00:07.140> was

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
of our development our motivation was

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.650 
of our development our motivation was
driven<00:00:07.950> by<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.130> eggs<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.760> eggs<00:00:08.970> which<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.630> a

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
driven by the eggs and eggs which is a

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.480 
driven by the eggs and eggs which is a
great<00:00:09.900> preprocessor<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:11.219> were<00:00:11.340> always

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
great preprocessor we were always

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.959 
great preprocessor we were always
looking<00:00:11.880> for<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.630> nice<00:00:12.900> floor<00:00:13.320> board<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.580> we

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
looking for a nice floor board and so we

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.370 
looking for a nice floor board and so we
came<00:00:15.210> aligned<00:00:15.599> six<00:00:16.020> who<00:00:16.710> build<00:00:16.980> great<00:00:17.250> boards

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
came aligned six who build great boards

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.900 
came aligned six who build great boards
unfortunately<00:00:19.380> these<00:00:19.980> sports<00:00:20.340> can't<00:00:20.760> be

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
unfortunately these sports can't be

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.939 
unfortunately these sports can't be
connected<00:00:21.330> directly<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> eggs<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.439> Acts

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
connected directly to the eggs of Acts

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.820 
connected directly to the eggs of Acts
because<00:00:23.460> they<00:00:23.760> don't<00:00:23.910> talk<00:00:24.269> meaty<00:00:24.539> they<00:00:25.529> talk

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
because they don't talk meaty they talk

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.400 
because they don't talk meaty they talk
some<00:00:26.160> line<00:00:26.519> six<00:00:26.849> language<00:00:27.330> well<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.170> can

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
some line six language well you can

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.859 
some line six language well you can
connect<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.160> standard<00:00:29.429> MIDI<00:00:30.029> board<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
connect a standard MIDI board to the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.709 
connect a standard MIDI board to the
eggs<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.410> X<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.610> won't<00:00:32.880> get<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.270> preset

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
eggs of X but you won't get the preset

names<00:00:33.960> tuner<00:00:34.829> information<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:36.300> this

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
names tuner information and all this

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.900

fancy stuff on the MIDI board this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.299 
fancy stuff on the MIDI board this
raised<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.600> idea<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:40.200> building<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.829> box<00:00:41.040> being

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
raised the idea of building a box being

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.310 
raised the idea of building a box being
