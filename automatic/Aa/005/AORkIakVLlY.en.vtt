00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
he's got the confidence and I think he

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.590 
he's got the confidence and I think he
has<00:00:31.560> matured<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.189> he's<00:00:32.850> at<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> level<00:00:33.420> work

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
has matured and he's at the level work

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.540

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the ring with Manny already and I think

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.690

isn't it isn't as that make a big

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.280 
isn't it isn't as that make a big
difference<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.329> gonna<00:00:39.870> come<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:40.260> a
