of<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.840> kind<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.320> two<00:01:13.500> pair<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:14.010> he<00:01:14.490> would

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of a kind or two pair because he would

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.490 
of a kind or two pair because he would
have<00:01:14.670> raised<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> turn<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.750> decided<00:01:16.080> he
