transparent<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.280> were<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.780> most<00:00:57.930> important

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
transparent and were the most important

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.349 
transparent and were the most important
was<00:00:58.469> like<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.489> concern<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.850> like<00:01:00.120> they

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
was like the concern is like they

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.479 
was like the concern is like they
started<00:01:00.690> already<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.170> before<00:01:01.530> everything

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
started already that before everything

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.630 
started already that before everything
happened<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.769> iso<00:01:04.769> certification<00:01:05.220> it's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
happened so this iso certification it's

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.640 
happened so this iso certification it's
not<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.360> set<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.530> it

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
not that you set it up and you have it

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.859 
not that you set it up and you have it
in<00:01:07.770> three<00:01:08.040> weeks<00:01:08.189> time<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.659> see

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
in three weeks time it's like you see

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
in three weeks time it's like you see
it's<00:01:10.020> more<00:01:10.200> over<00:01:10.710> year<00:01:10.950> work<00:01:11.159> already<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
it's more over year work already and it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.289 
it's more over year work already and it
will<00:01:12.210> take<00:01:12.420> much<00:01:12.750> more<00:01:12.780> time<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.610> but<00:01:14.610> looks

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
will take much more time and but looks

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.179 
will take much more time and but looks
good<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.049> saw<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.650> course<00:01:17.009> we

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
talked about atoms the water codes and

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.410 
talked about atoms the water codes and
we<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:22.680> came<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.490> our<00:01:23.640> our<00:01:23.939> faults

up everything already in the past to do

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.880 
up everything already in the past to do
everything<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> blood

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
everything you know we have the blood

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.340 
everything you know we have the blood
possible<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.579> no<00:01:47.880> needle<00:01:48.210> policy<00:01:48.659> we

possible we have no needle policy we

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.510 
possible we have no needle policy we
have<00:01:49.500> probably<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> most

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
have probably the most

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.100 
have probably the most
out-of-competition<00:01:51.119> test<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.899> ammo

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
out-of-competition test and ammo

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.500 
out-of-competition test and ammo
testing<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.680> every<00:01:52.860> sport<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.550> that's<00:01:53.820> all<00:01:54.030> all

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
testing in every sport so that's all all

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.490 
testing in every sport so that's all all
in<00:01:54.900> line<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.410> just<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.670> more<00:01:57.350> severe<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
in line it's just to get more severe of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.160 
in line it's just to get more severe of
the<00:01:58.650> problem<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.850> say<00:02:00.090> education<00:02:00.420> quarter

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the problem like say education quarter

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.220 
the problem like say education quarter
riders<00:02:01.530> education<00:02:02.220> of<00:02:02.310> atoms<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:03.570> also

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
riders education of atoms it's also
