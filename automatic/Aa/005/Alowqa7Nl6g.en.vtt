00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 I want to concentrate today's spending 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.090
 on the cotechino which is the typical specialty 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.219
 of the Modena salami but which it is now 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.160
 so appreciated throughout Italy in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.680
 therefore the whole world has passed 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.439
 certainly for many decades the boundaries of 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.279
 this city was already preparing 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.789
 in antiquity and its name derives as 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.890
 you can imagine from the term cotica la 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.630
 tradition wants it to be the dish that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.369
 it is consumed on the last day of the year 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.130
 accompanied by lentils 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.760
 but in short I don't see why we shouldn't 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.710
 for example, enjoy a little all year 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.989
 however the model that covers the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.090
 cotechino can be both natural and 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.550
 most artificial 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.890
 Newspapers have an artificial model 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.789
 which guarantees the consumer a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.949
 better hygiene naturally and then and then 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.460
 one can stellar more easily there is not 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.440
 doubt 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.739
 if you want to go without fail 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.750
 choose the cotechino di modena igp e 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.970
 then naturally prepared then 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.510
 great quality prepared respecting 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.610
 qualitative and productive characteristics 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.979
 absolutely controlled in terms of 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.650
 color and flavor ingredients 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.750
 fat protein content though 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.920
 just buy a non- pgp cotechino 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.659
 then look where you really are 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.430
 open eyes carefully examined 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.650
 the labels 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.380
 if the first ingredient written 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.229
 on the label and pork 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.740
 it means that the meat is predominant 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.530
 slim 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.420
 if instead the first term is cut of 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.460
 poor quality meat 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.040
 the product you can imagine that of 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.040
 consequently it is certainly not good 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.369
 even it's poor is allowed 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.290
 the use of monosodium glutamate for 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.570
 give more flavor 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.130
 but surely therefore this does not lay down a 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.119
 favor of product quality because 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.050
 if a disability increase is needed 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.940
 it means 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.760
 originally the meats are not not 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.010
 They are therefore a much preferred 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.500
 products that are absolutely free of 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.210
 monosodium glutamate always checked 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.150
 the expiry date 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.190
 check that you try to prefer 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.560
 those firms that print well legible 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.740
 so label and therefore do not have 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.720
 nothing to hide at home check 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.660
 that the aluminum casing in which it has 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.750
 wrapped in cotechino both perfectly 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.380
 intact if it has a hole better not 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.280
 cook them and bring them back if anything to 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.080
 shopkeeper 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.300
 you can also choose the ghini accounts 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.810
 fresh artisan production yes 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.750
 can buy in the butcher shop or 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.940
 also in delicatessen or you can find them 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.640
 also in the supermarket refrigerated counters 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.000
 but the preparation requires cooking 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.190
 the sausages are much slower 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.250
 precooked instead they are dipped in water 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.780
 sometimes hot in their silver envelope 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.660
 as you find them in the box 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.870
 carton and believe me they are ready after 25 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.220
 minutes when you open the wrapper 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.450
 remove the jelly around it 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.880
 taking it away with a fork 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.340
 knife blade then cut the 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.190
 affection cotechino is served because no 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.610
 with lots of lentil cash the 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.440
 cotechino and rich in proteins and fats 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.120
 generally industrial products ne 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.670
 contain between 300 develop around 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.040
 at 300 kcal per 100 g 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.970
 but in short it certainly is not a product 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.000
 diet for an absolutely product 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.380
 exquisite good that can not miss in the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.200
 center of San Silvestro 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.569
 because then all the traditions too 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.540
 those 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.670
 Food processing must be respected but how 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.010
 last appeal to be sure 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.889
 I ask you and I tell you and I give you 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.689
 the indication to buy a cotechino 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.180
 by modena igp 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.340
 the price is absolutely not different 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.239
 from others but the guarantee and quality 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.239
 certainly yes
