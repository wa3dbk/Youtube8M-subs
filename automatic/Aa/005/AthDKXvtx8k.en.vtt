hope you're thinking that because that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.539

means<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.259> I've<00:01:28.350> concealed<00:01:28.979> them<00:01:29.189> very<00:01:29.460> well

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
means that I've concealed them very well

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.730 
means that I've concealed them very well

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
them because they are extremely dark I

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.289 
them because they are extremely dark I

cute<00:02:46.360> feet<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.590> did<00:02:47.860> if<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.160> weren't<00:02:48.280> for<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
cute feet if I did if it weren't for the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.520 
cute feet if I did if it weren't for the
fact<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.940> i<00:02:49.209> have<00:02:49.450> really<00:02:49.750> bad<00:02:50.110> circulation

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
fact that i have really bad circulation

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.330 
fact that i have really bad circulation
so<00:02:51.430> my<00:02:52.300> hands<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:52.930> my<00:02:53.019> feet<00:02:53.290> always<00:02:53.680> feel<00:02:54.310> like

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
so my hands and my feet always feel like

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.520 
so my hands and my feet always feel like
ice<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.480> touch<00:02:55.720> no<00:02:55.959> matter<00:02:56.110> how<00:02:56.319> many

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
ice to the touch no matter how many

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.250 
ice to the touch no matter how many
pairs<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.010> socks<00:02:57.220> i<00:02:57.370> have<00:02:57.519> on<00:02:57.670> or<00:02:57.880> whatever

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
pairs of socks i have on or whatever

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.210 
pairs of socks i have on or whatever
along<00:02:59.260> with<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.440> comes<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.860> fact<00:03:00.130> that

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
along with that comes the fact that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.309 
along with that comes the fact that
their<00:03:00.519> color<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.330> kind<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:01.690> different<00:03:01.930> so

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
their color is kind of different so

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.290 
their color is kind of different so
sometimes<00:03:03.069> when<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:03.580> really<00:03:03.880> bad<00:03:04.060> they'll

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
sometimes when it's really bad they'll

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.990 
sometimes when it's really bad they'll
be<00:03:04.420> like<00:03:04.600> blue<00:03:05.200> or<00:03:05.890> they'll<00:03:06.069> be<00:03:06.130> like<00:03:06.370> purple

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
be like blue or they'll be like purple

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.449 
be like blue or they'll be like purple
and<00:03:07.239> splotchy<00:03:07.840> or<00:03:08.319> sometimes<00:03:08.769> red<00:03:09.130> and

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
and splotchy or sometimes red and

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.240 
and splotchy or sometimes red and
splotchy<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:10.410> i<00:03:11.410> probably<00:03:11.560> sounds<00:03:11.920> really

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
splotchy and i probably sounds really

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.650 
splotchy and i probably sounds really
weird<00:03:12.280> but<00:03:12.610> it's<00:03:12.880> just<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.150> fact<00:03:13.329> that<00:03:13.510> they

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
weird but it's just the fact that they

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.080 
weird but it's just the fact that they
don't<00:03:13.900> get<00:03:14.110> enough<00:03:14.290> blood<00:03:15.100> circulation<00:03:15.700> down

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
don't get enough blood circulation down

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.880 
don't get enough blood circulation down
there<00:03:16.570> in<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:16.840> region<00:03:17.110> um<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.690> I've<00:03:20.230> kind<00:03:20.650> of

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
there in that region um so I've kind of

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.800 
there in that region um so I've kind of
noticed<00:03:21.640> over<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.970> years<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.510> sit

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
noticed over the years I sit

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.539 
noticed over the years I sit
cross-legged<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.530> lot<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.799> times<00:03:23.980> or<00:03:24.250> I'll<00:03:24.310> sit

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
cross-legged a lot of times or I'll sit

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.789 
cross-legged a lot of times or I'll sit
with<00:03:24.670> my<00:03:24.790> feet<00:03:25.030> tucked<00:03:25.269> up<00:03:25.480> underneath<00:03:25.989> when<00:03:26.769> I

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
with my feet tucked up underneath when I

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.440 
with my feet tucked up underneath when I
sit<00:03:27.100> down<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.610> feel<00:03:27.790> like<00:03:27.820> it's<00:03:28.120> just<00:03:28.360> uh

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
sit down and I feel like it's just uh

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.530 
sit down and I feel like it's just uh
just<00:03:29.190> kind<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.340> subconscious<00:03:30.850> reaction<00:03:31.209> i

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
just kind of a subconscious reaction i

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.060 
just kind of a subconscious reaction i

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.700 
under the skin so it hurts so bad it
actually<00:05:21.920> really<00:05:22.490> hurts<00:05:22.840> but<00:05:23.840> they're<00:05:24.530> not

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
actually really hurts but they're not

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.800 
actually really hurts but they're not
visible<00:05:25.010> so<00:05:25.460> nobody<00:05:25.790> else<00:05:25.820> can<00:05:26.090> really<00:05:26.450> even

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
visible so nobody else can really even

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.830 
visible so nobody else can really even
tell<00:05:27.140> that<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:28.190> it's<00:05:28.520> there<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.390> I<00:05:29.420> guess<00:05:29.630> I'll

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
tell that I it's there so I guess I'll

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.660 
tell that I it's there so I guess I'll
take<00:05:30.020> that<00:05:30.230> over<00:05:30.290> one<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:31.010> you<00:05:31.190> know<00:05:31.340> the

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
take that over one that you know the

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.430 
take that over one that you know the
world<00:05:31.850> could<00:05:32.090> see<00:05:32.300> so<00:05:32.870> I'm<00:05:33.020> really<00:05:33.230> thankful

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
world could see so I'm really thankful

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.180 
world could see so I'm really thankful
for<00:05:33.800> that<00:05:33.970> another<00:05:34.970> thing<00:05:35.270> that<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.480> think<00:05:35.600> is<00:05:36.050> a

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
for that another thing that I think is a

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.970 
for that another thing that I think is a
good<00:05:37.190> trait<00:05:37.550> of<00:05:37.580> mine<00:05:37.790> that<00:05:38.330> I<00:05:38.450> like<00:05:38.780> as<00:05:39.110> my

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
good trait of mine that I like as my

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.760 
good trait of mine that I like as my
eyes<00:05:40.160> I've<00:05:41.090> always<00:05:41.480> gotten<00:05:41.900> compliments<00:05:42.710> of

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770

eyes I've always gotten compliments of
my<00:05:42.920> eyes<00:05:43.130> and<00:05:43.610> I<00:05:44.480> usually<00:05:44.840> don't<00:05:45.020> want<00:05:45.200> to<00:05:45.260> do

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
my eyes and I usually don't want to do

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.990 
my eyes and I usually don't want to do
my<00:05:45.380> makeup<00:05:45.740> I<00:05:45.890> try<00:05:46.070> to<00:05:46.130> play<00:05:46.340> them<00:05:46.550> up<00:05:46.700> a<00:05:46.730> lot

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
my makeup I try to play them up a lot

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.380 
my makeup I try to play them up a lot
and<00:05:47.920> tone<00:05:48.920> down<00:05:49.160> where's<00:05:49.460> my<00:05:49.670> face<00:05:49.910> but<00:05:50.120> really
