00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
When talking about internet and normal websites...

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
...nobody asks what the people do or how they create them.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But in our case, many times (just for not being something normal)...

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
...people ask us, they want to clear up doubts about what we do exactly.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That is why we wanted to explain it in this video, for both the people that use our page...

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
...and those that want to be part of the things we do, dedÃ­cate themselves to the same thing.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Because as we said this is open to any person that wants to participate with us.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Basically Andinia is the creation of a group of people...

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
...that dedicated ourselves for a long time to exploration.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
...to which we have dedicated exploration for a long time.
...that dedicated ourselves for a long time to exploration.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
...that dedicated ourselves for a long time to exploration.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
To search for places like this one where we are taping, where not many people have been.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Precisely to find places like this one, and explore them from a scientific and geographic point of view.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is the objective that our group still has.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Starting from the meeting of people that had similar interests, including the practice of survival...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
...this group called GEA was created.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and the group GEA, searching for a way to finance us doing these things...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
...created the page that is known as ANDINIA.COM

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The GEA group is made up of people, professionals that dedicate ourselves to all types of outdoor activities.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.000
From mountain guides to airplane pilots, to people that are just interested in...

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
...subjects related to paintball...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
...with any type of practice that allows us to arrive to these places safely...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
...and be able to return, which is the most important thing.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
For that reason we have many methods that are not always normal to train people that want to participate with us.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And this is how all of the content came to be, all of which can be read at ANDINIA.COM.
