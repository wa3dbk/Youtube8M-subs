00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.029
 Hey youtube people, what are you doing late? 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.639
 One more video for you, now I'm coming. 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.500
 show the world the linear I 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.750
 I learned how to actually have been here 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.630
 it's two models and I made a video 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.119
 teaching and doing cilene air that is 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.820
 the correct style this is also a 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.100
 new course model is already preparing a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.439
 video in the middle that looks like it was better 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:32.399
 47 I did it and so I sure did. 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.440
 I'll put all the links under the 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.570
 video if you want to learn why 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.309
 Those are the sound of this one, I took time to 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.570
 learn I will not have my camera 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.000
 it's good enough i think i'm going 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.379
 be able to teach you any questions 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.730
 that you are in yourselves and I do not know where to send 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.530
 a message anything I make a 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.690
 video and if I can make an effort 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.320
 to try to do if they can not 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.570
 ok this here is the other of the same thing 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.370
 of the course and that I here is continuous and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.350
 with nothing in the middle of the show if I can 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.760
 better show better be 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.760
 visualized well I think it's cool 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.770
 it exhibits that it glows in the dark 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.240
 Here I made my brother ok 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.159
 both the keyring his car 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.840
 google still later this cordinha 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.110
 that also shines in the dark if 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.990
 you take the flashlight and put the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.759
 strong flashlight take off soon and you see it 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.710
 that these two here shines in the dark and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:40.909
 This black now, I do not deny it like that. 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.860
 so it stayed in the pocketknife 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.450
 I'm going to put a link below to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.790
 you if you want to learn to 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.329
 make any doubts you have 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.130
 and it's just you send a message to put 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.740
 Anyway, I'll make a video for 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.820
 you to have another where Charlene 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.119
 who is the north-daughter-in-law for 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.119
 end 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.399
 he did but I find it interesting I 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.579
 I find the simplest explanation you have 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.019
 To make this knot. 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:17.980
 the detail that all the videos are 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.319
 english, but what if you walk? 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.500
 A glance at the glass, I think it is. 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.000
 more for the visual than for what the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.829
 dude, he finally said 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.519
 in this case I need help I do 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.450
 A video revealed today I had more 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.099
 speak 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.900
 the video that the guy teaches to do it 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.269
 hence 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.549
 if you do not wake up well Justinho 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.319
 You do not need and come back every 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.840
 Cordinhas that even the guy does not do 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.920
 I did it, I'm fine, I 'm fine, fine. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.930
 firm you do and do well Justinho 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.930
 he and then when you come in the end 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.329
 you cut here and you're not only dilma 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.799
 You do not have to invent it. 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.290
 I understood anything 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.069
 any step thereon from any of the 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.319
 videos 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.859
 that of the linear noia I have not done yet 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.470
 so he did not try to render more 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:12.939
 anyway this is for brt is like 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.699
 teaching you to do some 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:18.099
 linear not necessarily I né mas 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:20.530
 I found to put together the three most 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.500
 simple of that type of energy 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.599
 this is the linear nokia is the node that is 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.299
 simply a chubby né 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.099
 then you see that you find there 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.989
 I hope you liked it, I want it. 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.040
 do it more here I thought it stayed 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.379
 Quite cool, they do not have to be 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.540
 necessarily black and white but I 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.190
 I found it nice, it's still cool then. 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.940
 until the next 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.940
 tactical
