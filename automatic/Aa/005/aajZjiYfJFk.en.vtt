we've<00:00:11.360> got<00:00:11.570> a<00:00:11.599> 2001<00:00:12.349> caddie<00:00:12.650> that's<00:00:12.950> got<00:00:13.250> a<00:00:13.280> 171

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
we've got a 2001 caddie that's got a 171

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.220 
we've got a 2001 caddie that's got a 171
and<00:00:14.090> 174<00:00:14.930> so<00:00:15.350> bank<00:00:15.590> 1<00:00:16.309> and<00:00:16.490> 2<00:00:16.610> both<00:00:17.000> lean<00:00:17.360> as<00:00:17.689> a

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
and 174 so bank 1 and 2 both lean as a

Northstar<00:00:20.720> v8<00:00:21.189> when<00:00:22.189> we<00:00:22.279> look<00:00:22.430> at<00:00:22.460> our<00:00:22.640> DTC

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
Northstar v8 when we look at our DTC

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.490 
Northstar v8 when we look at our DTC
status<00:00:23.720> we<00:00:24.050> have<00:00:24.220> 171<00:00:25.220> 174<00:00:26.059> and<00:00:26.300> a<00:00:26.720> 300<00:00:27.349> which

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
status we have 171 174 and a 300 which

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.920 
status we have 171 174 and a 300 which
is<00:00:27.529> a<00:00:27.710> silver<00:00:28.700> multiple<00:00:29.180> cylinder<00:00:29.540> misfire

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
is a silver multiple cylinder misfire

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.819 
is a silver multiple cylinder misfire
the<00:00:30.529> 174<00:00:31.279> is<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:33.320> one<00:00:33.469> to<00:00:33.620> set<00:00:33.800> the

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
the 174 is the one to set the

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.819 
the 174 is the one to set the
freeze-frame<00:00:34.210> these<00:00:35.210> other<00:00:35.540> three<00:00:36.140> codes<00:00:36.559> are

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
freeze-frame these other three codes are

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:39.069 
freeze-frame these other three codes are
what's<00:00:37.430> called<00:00:37.670> failure<00:00:38.000> records<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.690> GM's

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
what's called failure records and GM's

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.799 
what's called failure records and GM's
got<00:00:39.410> to<00:00:39.620> five<00:00:39.860> of<00:00:39.890> those<00:00:40.160> are<00:00:40.340> concet<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.510> the

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
got to five of those are concet so the

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.300 
got to five of those are concet so the
the<00:00:42.020> one<00:00:42.170> that's<00:00:42.350> got<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.620> light<00:00:42.830> lid<00:00:43.040> is<00:00:43.190> the

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
the one that's got the light lid is the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.720 
the one that's got the light lid is the
174<00:00:44.200> also<00:00:45.200> says<00:00:45.590> here<00:00:45.860> that<00:00:45.890> the<00:00:46.250> mill<00:00:46.580> is

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
174 also says here that the mill is

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.150 
174 also says here that the mill is
requested<00:00:47.240> for<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.630> 300<00:00:48.290> so<00:00:48.770> the

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
requested for the 300 so the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.600 
requested for the 300 so the
freeze-frame<00:00:49.430> is<00:00:50.000> for<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.780> lien<00:00:50.930> code<00:00:51.610> let's

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
freeze-frame is for the lien code let's

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.890 
freeze-frame is for the lien code let's
take<00:00:52.730> a<00:00:52.820> look<00:00:53.000> at<00:00:53.120> that<00:00:53.270> freeze<00:00:53.540> frame<00:00:53.570> and

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
take a look at that freeze frame and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.319 
take a look at that freeze frame and
really<00:00:54.350> what<00:00:54.500> I<00:00:54.530> there's<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.130> lot<00:00:55.280> of<00:00:55.430> data<00:00:55.640> here

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
really what I there's a lot of data here

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.900 
really what I there's a lot of data here
what<00:00:56.690> we<00:00:56.810> did<00:00:57.020> was<00:00:57.230> our<00:00:58.100> capture<00:00:58.400> the<00:00:58.670> freeze

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
what we did was our capture the freeze

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.479 
what we did was our capture the freeze
frame<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.660> from<00:01:00.350> with<00:01:00.680> a<00:01:00.710> tech<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.399> then

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
frame and from with a tech to and then

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.990 
frame and from with a tech to and then
upload<00:01:01.910> it<00:01:01.940> into<00:01:02.290> software<00:01:03.290> on<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.159> PC<00:01:04.339> if

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
upload it into software on the PC if

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.359 
upload it into software on the PC if
you've<00:01:05.239> got<00:01:05.449> just<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.960> web<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:07.009> can<00:01:07.159> do<00:01:07.250> the

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
you've got just the web you can do the

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.069 
you've got just the web you can do the
same<00:01:07.549> thing<00:01:07.850> but<00:01:08.180> basically<00:01:08.689> what<00:01:08.930> we're

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
same thing but basically what we're

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.030 
same thing but basically what we're
looking<00:01:09.110> at<00:01:09.470> here<00:01:09.710> is<00:01:10.060> 2,300<00:01:11.060> rpm<00:01:11.380> we're<00:01:12.380> at

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
looking at here is 2,300 rpm we're at

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.559 
looking at here is 2,300 rpm we're at
about<00:01:13.700> an<00:01:13.999> 18<00:01:14.389> 19<00:01:14.439> %<00:01:15.439> add<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:16.639> know<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.270> short

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:17.569 
about an 18 19 % add I know the short

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.559 
about an 18 19 % add I know the short
terms<00:01:17.840> are<00:01:18.259> at<00:01:18.710> -<00:01:19.159> but<00:01:19.189> I<00:01:19.729> have<00:01:20.030> no<00:01:20.060> idea<00:01:20.420> what

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:20.569 
terms are at - but I have no idea what

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.749 
terms are at - but I have no idea what
they<00:01:20.689> were<00:01:20.749> a<00:01:20.840> second<00:01:21.380> ago<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.280> I'm<00:01:22.369> really<00:01:22.520> not

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
they were a second ago so I'm really not

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.550 
they were a second ago so I'm really not
gonna<00:01:22.969> hang<00:01:23.210> my<00:01:23.389> hat<00:01:23.600> on<00:01:23.630> short<00:01:24.079> term<00:01:24.259> fuel

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
gonna hang my hat on short term fuel

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.859 
gonna hang my hat on short term fuel
trim<00:01:24.799> in<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:24.979> freeze<00:01:25.219> frame<00:01:25.249> so<00:01:26.149> we<00:01:26.420> have<00:01:26.600> a

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
trim in a freeze frame so we have a

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.099 
trim in a freeze frame so we have a
problem<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:27.920> will<00:01:28.039> make<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.999> system<00:01:29.359> lean

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
problem that will make the system lean

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.520 
problem that will make the system lean
on<00:01:30.469> Bank<00:01:30.799> -<00:01:31.100> at<00:01:31.490> cruise<00:01:31.969> rpm<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.079> let's<00:01:33.289> file

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
on Bank - at cruise rpm so let's file

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.069 
on Bank - at cruise rpm so let's file
that<00:01:33.770> piece<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.249> information<00:01:34.369> away<00:01:34.999> and<00:01:35.929> now

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
that piece of information away and now

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.099 
that piece of information away and now
we<00:01:36.139> look<00:01:36.380> at<00:01:36.530> her<00:01:36.590> 300<00:01:37.249> our<00:01:37.520> 300<00:01:38.240> sets<00:01:38.539> and<00:01:38.899> we

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
we look at her 300 our 300 sets and we

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:43.269 
we look at her 300 our 300 sets and we
have<00:01:39.319> a<00:01:39.590> ton<00:01:40.279> of<00:01:40.310> fuel<00:01:40.850> add<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:41.659> note<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:42.979> we

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:43.279 
have a ton of fuel add and note that we

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:46.749 
have a ton of fuel add and note that we
have<00:01:43.579> an<00:01:43.850> idle<00:01:44.329> rpm<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.679> we<00:01:45.889> have<00:01:46.159> a<00:01:46.189> problem

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
have an idle rpm so we have a problem

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.399 
have an idle rpm so we have a problem
that<00:01:46.939> makes<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.389> ang<00:01:47.479> misfire<00:01:48.079> at<00:01:48.709> idle<00:01:50.409> we

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
that makes the ang misfire at idle we

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.660 
that makes the ang misfire at idle we
look<00:01:51.560> at<00:01:51.649> our<00:01:51.770> 171<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:52.899> again<00:01:53.899> we<00:01:54.170> have<00:01:54.409> a<00:01:54.670> idle

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
look at our 171 and again we have a idle

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.739 
look at our 171 and again we have a idle
rpm<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.450> we've<00:01:57.349> got<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.950> super<00:01:58.700> add<00:01:59.029> on<00:01:59.450> fuel

00:01:59.739 --> 00:01:59.749 
rpm and we've got a super add on fuel

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:02.139 
rpm and we've got a super add on fuel
trim<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:00.799> now<00:02:01.009> we<00:02:01.069> see<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:01.729> we<00:02:01.880> have<00:02:01.909> a

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
trim so now we see that we have a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.569 
trim so now we see that we have a
problem<00:02:02.659> that<00:02:02.689> could<00:02:02.990> cause<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.229> misfire<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.099> a

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
problem that could cause a misfire and a

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.999 
problem that could cause a misfire and a
fuel<00:02:05.240> trim<00:02:05.509> code<00:02:05.779> at<00:02:05.959> idle<00:02:06.319> and<00:02:06.499> it<00:02:06.709> can<00:02:06.859> also

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
fuel trim code at idle and it can also

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.430 
fuel trim code at idle and it can also
cause<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.609> fuel<00:02:07.849> trim<00:02:08.119> code<00:02:08.539> at<00:02:08.840> cruise<00:02:09.200> rpm

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
cause the fuel trim code at cruise rpm

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.510 
cause the fuel trim code at cruise rpm
and<00:02:10.310> finally<00:02:11.060> we<00:02:11.240> look<00:02:11.420> one<00:02:11.630> more<00:02:11.660> time<00:02:11.840> at<00:02:12.520> 174

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
and finally we look one more time at 174

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.210 
and finally we look one more time at 174
and<00:02:13.849> we<00:02:14.480> see<00:02:14.690> it<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:14.990> also<00:02:15.170> set<00:02:15.620> at<00:02:15.830> cruise

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
and we see it can also set at cruise

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.940 
and we see it can also set at cruise
with<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> significant<00:02:17.420> amount<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.690> fuel<00:02:17.959> add<00:02:18.230> so

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
with a significant amount of fuel add so

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.160 
with a significant amount of fuel add so
this<00:02:19.129> is<00:02:19.310> kind<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.579> a<00:02:19.730> just<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.269> you<00:02:20.480> know<00:02:20.510> what

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
this is kind of a just a you know what

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.690 
this is kind of a just a you know what
we<00:02:21.290> know<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.709> we<00:02:21.950> have<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.129> problem

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
we know is we have a problem

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.290 
we know is we have a problem
the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.290 
the
affects<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.170> engine<00:02:24.830> both<00:02:25.040> an<00:02:25.280> idle<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.820> at

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
affects this engine both an idle and at

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
affects this engine both an idle and at
cruise<00:02:27.230> rpm<00:02:27.710> so<00:02:28.460> that's<00:02:29.170> important<00:02:30.170> piece<00:02:30.290> of

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
cruise rpm so that's important piece of

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.950 
cruise rpm so that's important piece of
information<00:02:30.650> we<00:02:31.040> can<00:02:31.220> file<00:02:31.430> away<00:02:31.780> also<00:02:32.780> we

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
information we can file away also we

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.800 
information we can file away also we
look<00:02:33.140> at<00:02:33.230> our<00:02:33.350> misfire<00:02:33.770> data<00:02:34.210> and<00:02:35.210> we<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:35.630> that

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
look at our misfire data and we see that

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.920 
look at our misfire data and we see that
every<00:02:36.170> cylinder<00:02:36.530> has<00:02:36.830> history<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.660> we<00:02:38.660> really

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
every cylinder has history and we really

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.750 
every cylinder has history and we really
can't<00:02:39.230> pick<00:02:39.440> out<00:02:39.620> any<00:02:39.830> you<00:02:40.130> know<00:02:40.220> there's<00:02:40.490> I

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
can't pick out any you know there's I

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.820 
can't pick out any you know there's I
guess<00:02:40.790> cylinder<00:02:41.390> number<00:02:41.570> eight<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.560> and

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
guess cylinder number eight and and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.560 
guess cylinder number eight and and
still<00:02:43.100> number<00:02:43.280> six<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.820> highest<00:02:44.210> numbers

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
still number six of the highest numbers

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.110 
still number six of the highest numbers
but<00:02:45.350> you<00:02:45.740> know<00:02:46.340> there's<00:02:46.550> not<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.760> big<00:02:47.000> enough

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
now what he's looking for it well this

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.920 
now what he's looking for it well this

pattern failure on Cadillac so many of
you<00:03:41.270> may<00:03:41.480> have<00:03:41.510> already<00:03:41.810> experienced<00:03:42.620> this

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
you may have already experienced this

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.360 
you may have already experienced this
but<00:03:43.459> the<00:03:43.700> boot<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.330> know<00:03:44.540> looks<00:03:45.260> like<00:03:45.380> you

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
but the boot you know looks like you

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.310 
but the boot you know looks like you
could<00:03:46.520> simply<00:03:46.910> slip<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.330> out<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.630> there<00:03:47.810> but

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
could simply slip it out of there but

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.500 
could simply slip it out of there but
that<00:03:48.620> is<00:03:48.800> really<00:03:48.980> not<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.430> case<00:03:49.670> it's<00:03:50.390> gonna

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
that is really not the case it's gonna

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.240 
that is really not the case it's gonna
take<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.720> little<00:03:50.900> bit<00:03:51.080> of<00:03:51.200> rich<00:03:51.350> forget<00:03:52.070> that

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
wow this is a pattern failure I thought

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.870 
wow this is a pattern failure I thought
it<00:04:14.450> was<00:04:14.540> an<00:04:14.660> important<00:04:15.340> discussion<00:04:16.340> because

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
it was an important discussion because

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.479 
it was an important discussion because
we<00:04:17.660> used<00:04:17.900> our<00:04:18.080> scan<00:04:18.380> data<00:04:18.590> analysis<00:04:19.310> to

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
we used our scan data analysis to

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.340 
we used our scan data analysis to
determine<00:04:19.669> that<00:04:20.120> we<00:04:20.299> had<00:04:20.480> a<00:04:20.510> problem<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.169> was

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
determine that we had a problem that was

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.400 
determine that we had a problem that was
only<00:04:21.680> not<00:04:22.040> only<00:04:22.310> affect<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:23.390> engine<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:23.900> idle

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
only not only affect the engine and idle

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.070 
only not only affect the engine and idle
via<00:04:25.070> a<00:04:25.160> vacuum<00:04:25.730> leak<00:04:25.910> but<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.300> also<00:04:26.450> affected

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
via a vacuum leak but it also affected

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.440 
via a vacuum leak but it also affected
it<00:04:27.230> at<00:04:27.350> higher<00:04:27.560> rpm<00:04:28.100> because<00:04:28.310> we<00:04:29.060> had<00:04:29.210> air

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
it at higher rpm because we had air

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.090 
it at higher rpm because we had air
leaking<00:04:29.870> in<00:04:30.110> that<00:04:30.320> wasn't<00:04:30.620> going<00:04:30.770> through<00:04:31.010> the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
leaking in that wasn't going through the

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.520 
leaking in that wasn't going through the
sensor
