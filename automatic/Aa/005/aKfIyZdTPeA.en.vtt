00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 spices for european and adapted 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.890
 climatic conditions of the Russian land all 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.170
 this allows for a shorter period 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.960
 teach a soldier not only 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.420
 move but also work in conditions 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.220
 melee style offered 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.590
 refers to tough melee style 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.670
 combat although work with the enemy can 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.070
 build and without stiffness everything depends on 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.820
 performer techniques are based on attack 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.620
 on defense and counter attack training 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.710
 action looks like free-style wrestling 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:41.180
 using initiative in attack where 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.940
 used strong accurate shots throws 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.469
 retention effects on joints and 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.590
 vulnerable areas of the human point 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.140
 body in the Siberian fist is present 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.010
 Formal practice their exercises 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.649
 called shadows then there is a fight with shadow 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.020
 there is reliable work with weapons in 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.449
 difference from martial arts in 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.170
 the proposed style is absent wide 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.930
 racks 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.000
 natural movements are used 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.760
 step run jumps 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.890
 from here the body gets more steady 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.890
 position even if you find yourself on 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.570
 slippery surface or knee deep 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 the snow 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.450
 blows of defense are simple and reliable so 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.229
 that the technique of the proposed style can 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.479
 practice being in any clothes and 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.290
 equipment regardless of climatic 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.869
 conditions 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.299
 I want to hope that the Siberian 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.979
 fist like melee style will get 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.250
 wider application and 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.130
 distribution among military personnel 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.380
