cases teachers have also commanded very
good<00:02:06.950> videos<00:02:07.250> on<00:02:07.430> our<00:02:07.580> own<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.300> all<00:02:08.450> of<00:02:08.600> this

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
good videos on our own and all of this

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.600 
good videos on our own and all of this
can<00:02:08.899> be<00:02:09.020> operating<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.770> e-textbook<00:02:10.220> and

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
can be operating to the e-textbook and

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.430 
can be operating to the e-textbook and
then<00:02:11.120> students<00:02:11.540> start<00:02:12.080> reading<00:02:12.350> an

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
then students start reading an

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.229 
then students start reading an
e-textbook<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:13.220> this<00:02:13.459> manner<00:02:13.700> they<00:02:14.000> find

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
e-textbook in this manner they find

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.090 
e-textbook in this manner they find
lessons<00:02:14.870> becoming<00:02:15.380> more<00:02:15.560> APG<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.920> what<00:02:19.069> our

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
lessons becoming more APG so what our

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.800 
lessons becoming more APG so what our
teacher<00:02:19.430> plans<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.910> do<00:02:20.030> is<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.390> he<00:02:20.480> will<00:02:20.600> film

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
teacher plans to do is that he will film

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.479 
teacher plans to do is that he will film
himself<00:02:20.959> teaching<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.650> class<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:22.040> certain<00:02:22.340> topic

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
himself teaching a class a certain topic

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.309 
himself teaching a class a certain topic
and<00:02:22.850> then<00:02:23.209> he<00:02:23.390> will<00:02:23.510> share<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.810> video<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.200> his

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
and then he will share that video of his

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.630 
and then he will share that video of his
other<00:02:24.500> classes<00:02:24.950> who<00:02:25.069> are<00:02:25.160> learning<00:02:25.340> on<00:02:25.550> the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
other classes who are learning on the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.820 
other classes who are learning on the
same<00:02:25.819> topic<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:26.330> this<00:02:26.840> way<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.230> students<00:02:27.560> can

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
same topic so this way the students can

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.590 
same topic so this way the students can
review<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.190> video<00:02:28.430> at<00:02:28.580> home<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.970> then<00:02:29.360> they

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
review the video at home and then they

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.059 
review the video at home and then they
can<00:02:29.750> do<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:29.870> assignments<00:02:30.470> or<00:02:30.530> worksheets<00:02:30.860> on

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
can do the assignments or worksheets on

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:37.900 
can do the assignments or worksheets on
their<00:02:31.340> own

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.760 

basically<00:02:38.570> instead<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.900> using<00:02:39.140> class<00:02:39.440> time<00:02:39.740> to

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
basically instead of using class time to

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.740 
basically instead of using class time to
understand<00:02:40.400> like<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.970> basics<00:02:41.300> which<00:02:41.480> we<00:02:41.570> can

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
understand like the basics which we can

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.810 
understand like the basics which we can
do<00:02:41.870> on<00:02:42.020> our<00:02:42.140> own<00:02:42.380> we<00:02:42.860> will<00:02:42.980> use<00:02:43.160> that<00:02:43.310> time<00:02:43.520> more

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
do on our own we will use that time more

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.730 
do on our own we will use that time more
efficiently<00:02:44.240> by<00:02:44.450> asking<00:02:44.780> questions<00:02:45.140> the

take place in class where students can
