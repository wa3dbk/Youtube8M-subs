going to turn everybody vegetarian which

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.709 
I don't think that's kind of practical
but<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.710> gives<00:00:43.920> people<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.460> option<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.879> not

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
but it it gives people the option to not

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.450 
but it it gives people the option to not
eat<00:00:45.899> meat<00:00:46.079> seven<00:00:46.469> days<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.649> week<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.309> kind

I would have to say this vegetarian
restaurant<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.850> very<00:01:30.210> different<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.509> any<00:01:30.659> ones

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
restaurant is very different to any ones

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.569 
restaurant is very different to any ones
that<00:01:30.990> I've<00:01:31.110> worked<00:01:31.290> with<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.770> past<00:01:31.860> mostly

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
that I've worked with in the past mostly

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.890 
that I've worked with in the past mostly
the<00:01:32.670> ones<00:01:32.700> I've<00:01:32.909> records<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> past<00:01:33.630> have

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the ones I've records in the past have

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.050 
the ones I've records in the past have
pretty<00:01:34.110> much<00:01:34.170> been<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.710> huge<00:01:35.579> vegetarian

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
pretty much been a huge vegetarian

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.399 
pretty much been a huge vegetarian
clientele<00:01:36.509> where<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> think<00:01:37.140> interestingly

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
clientele where I think interestingly

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.410 
clientele where I think interestingly
enough<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.729> i<00:01:38.970> would<00:01:39.150> say<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
enough here it's not i would say it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.640 
enough here it's not i would say it
actually<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.750> opposite<00:01:39.990> way<00:01:40.110> i'd<00:01:40.290> say<00:01:40.439> more

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
actually the opposite way i'd say more

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.390 
actually the opposite way i'd say more
of<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.799> clientele<00:01:41.280> are<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:42.299> vegetarian

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
of a clientele are not vegetarian

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.860 
of a clientele are not vegetarian
say<00:01:43.760> I<00:01:43.790> probably<00:01:44.180> say<00:01:44.270> about<00:01:44.300> thirty<00:01:44.630> percent

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
say I probably say about thirty percent

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.080 
say I probably say about thirty percent
of<00:01:44.990> them<00:01:45.080> are<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.650> which<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.700> interesting

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
of them are and which is interesting

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.520 
of them are and which is interesting
itself<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.540> think<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.750> location<00:01:48.050> brings

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
itself I think the location brings

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.980 
itself I think the location brings
anyone<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:49.190> everyone<00:01:49.250> here<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:49.970> it's<00:01:50.840> good

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
for us that not only vegetarians are

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.100 
for us that not only vegetarians are
coming<00:01:52.850> here<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.180> we<00:01:53.300> are<00:01:53.450> actually<00:01:53.720> stealing

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
coming here so we are actually stealing

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.720 
coming here so we are actually stealing
to<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.380> wider<00:01:54.590> community<00:01:54.710> which<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.400> kind<00:01:55.670> of

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 
to the wider community which is kind of

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.730 
to the wider community which is kind of
the<00:01:55.820> aim<00:01:55.940> of<00:01:55.970> it<00:01:56.240> okay<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:56.780> what<00:01:57.320> would<00:01:57.410> you<00:01:57.560> say

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740
