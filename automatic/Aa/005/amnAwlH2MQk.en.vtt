through the hole or the grommet was put
a<00:01:38.350> slice<00:01:39.350> into<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.680> grommet<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.369> wires

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
a slice into the grommet so the wires

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.859 
a slice into the grommet so the wires
could<00:01:40.790> come<00:01:41.000> through<00:01:43.210> okay<00:01:44.210> go<00:01:44.540> ahead<00:01:44.600> take

the<00:02:04.190> panel<00:02:04.580> across<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.450> threshold<00:02:05.929> and<00:02:06.140> do

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
the panel across the threshold and do

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.020 
the panel across the threshold and do
the<00:02:06.860> same<00:02:07.069> thing<00:02:07.340> that<00:02:07.580> we<00:02:07.700> did<00:02:07.819> on<00:02:07.970> the

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
the same thing that we did on the

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.880 
the same thing that we did on the
driver's<00:02:08.360> side<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.690> get<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.530> passenger

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
driver's side to get it to the passenger

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.010 
driver's side to get it to the passenger
side<00:02:10.069> taillight<00:02:10.510> okay<00:02:11.510> go<00:02:11.660> ahead<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:11.900> make<00:02:11.990> a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
side taillight okay go ahead and make a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.460 
side taillight okay go ahead and make a
slit<00:02:12.290> in<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.380> grommet<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:14.230> go<00:02:15.230> ahead<00:02:15.350> make

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
slit in the grommet and go ahead make

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.620 
slit in the grommet and go ahead make
your<00:02:15.590> connection
