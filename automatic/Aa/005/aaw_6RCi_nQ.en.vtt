00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.799
 hello tankers and as you already understood 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.799
 the name and description of this video 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:20.150
 Now I will tell you how to install hd 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:23.090
 client textures starting at 9 and 3 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.650
 in general, generous bulba she as always 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.039
 surprised everyone 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.660
 or even not all but at least those 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.880
 people who watch a little bit 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.650
 official sites read a little patch 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.770
 Nout means what is the essence since 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.750
 update 9 and 3 all textures hd models 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.750
 tanks as new and existing 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.730
 will be delivered in a separate archive then 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.590
 have you updated the game seems to have appeared 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.480
 new hd tank, only for some reason they do not 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.960
 how about they not hd 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.410
 and all because the long wait textures 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.840
 need to download separately in the form of fashion in the form of 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.360
 archive means this archive is unpacked in 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.939
 res-mods folder 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:08.299
 with a specific version 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.240
 our client means I will throw 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:15.310
 specifically the link in principle is the link 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.299
 will always be active on this link 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.890
 click here here is a button 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.259
 deploy how to set high 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.299
 detailed textures expand and 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:28.659
 here here download hd texture shaking we 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:34.600
 them right straight god how many windows 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:38.509
 we download them directly to our game folder 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.060
 somewhere here should not be here they are hd 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.310
 deed means open this 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.829
 texture pack that we see we see the res folder 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.520
 the brain is essentially if you have not installed 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.979
 no mods yes even if installed 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.090
 just this daddy res-mods 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.310
 unpack in the folder with the game more 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.509
 do nothing need to mean here 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:02.270
 inside we will have a 093 folder with tanks and 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.529
 you can see the cars themselves 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.810
 what are they there updated leaders that's all 

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:11.540
 that's the way it is set 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.090
 HD textures but the most interesting thing is 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.330
 after all these manipulations you need 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.750
 will go to the client and in the settings 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.100
 quality textures deliver us them 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.560
 ball value only then 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.530
 really for get the maximum 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.240
 graphics in this game 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.550
 I hope this video has become useful for you 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.800
 after all, not everyone saw it all 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.080
 know therefore uniquely thumbs up 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.280
