they haven't had a lot of success I

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.990 
they haven't had a lot of success I
think<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.950> big<00:01:32.130> part<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.549> has<00:01:32.640> been<00:01:32.790> el

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
think a big part of it has been el

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.609 
think a big part of it has been el
Davis's<00:01:33.450> approach<00:01:33.750> he's<00:01:33.960> been<00:01:34.110> thinking<00:01:34.439> in

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
Davis's approach he's been thinking in

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.440 
Davis's approach he's been thinking in
the<00:01:34.710> short<00:01:34.920> term<00:01:35.159> trying<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.850> win<00:01:36.030> now<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.360> all

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
the short term trying to win now at all

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.330 
the short term trying to win now at all
costs<00:01:36.899> he's<00:01:36.990> been<00:01:37.140> bringing<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.500> players<00:01:38.070> like

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
costs he's been bringing in players like

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.109

deserve<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.329> put<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.570> guy

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
deserve it and I think if you put a guy

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.289 
deserve it and I think if you put a guy
like<00:01:45.960> Jon<00:01:46.409> Gruden<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.829> place<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.549> guy<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
like Jon Gruden in place a guy that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.300 
like Jon Gruden in place a guy that
understands<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.020> Al<00:01:49.229> Davis<00:01:49.439> way<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:50.159> has<00:01:50.280> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
understands the Al Davis way that has a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.889 
understands the Al Davis way that has a
true<00:01:50.790> respect<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.450> Raiders

true respect for the Raiders

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.569 
true respect for the Raiders
organization<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:52.979> there's<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> chance

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
organization I think there's a chance

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.530 
organization I think there's a chance
that<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:53.820> could<00:01:53.880> rebuild<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.509> organization

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
that they could rebuild the organization

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
that they could rebuild the organization
and<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> me<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.500> looks<00:01:55.740> very<00:01:55.979> similar<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and to me it looks very similar to the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.069 
and to me it looks very similar to the
situation<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:57.270> Washington<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.780> couple<00:01:58.020> of

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
situation in Washington a couple of

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.929 
situation in Washington a couple of
years<00:01:58.140> ago<00:01:58.320> where<00:01:58.920> Jim<00:01:59.159> Zorn<00:01:59.369> was<00:01:59.640> put<00:01:59.850> in

years ago where Jim Zorn was put in

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.370 
years ago where Jim Zorn was put in
place<00:02:00.060> they<00:02:00.780> knew<00:02:00.960> they<00:02:01.079> were<00:02:01.140> gonna<00:02:01.259> hire

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
place they knew they were gonna hire

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
traded to the Washington Redskins as

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.180 
traded to the Washington Redskins as
they<00:02:06.990> were<00:02:07.110> talking<00:02:07.289> at<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> time<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> think<00:02:08.009> he

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
they were talking at the time I think he

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.499 
they were talking at the time I think he
would've<00:02:08.340> saw<00:02:08.520> Mike<00:02:08.880> Shannon<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.360> plays

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
would've saw Mike Shannon and plays

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.240 
would've saw Mike Shannon and plays
sooner<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.050> couldn't<00:02:10.620> happen<00:02:10.740> I<00:02:10.980> think<00:02:11.010> that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
sooner that couldn't happen I think that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.530 
sooner that couldn't happen I think that
you<00:02:11.310> can<00:02:11.460> see<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.610> similar<00:02:11.910> situation<00:02:12.090> there

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
you can see a similar situation there

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.360 
you can see a similar situation there

this move take place he's gonna be a

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.729 
this move take place he's gonna be a
part<00:02:37.359> of<00:02:37.389> the<00:02:37.480> future<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.840> think<00:02:37.959> he's<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> very

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
part of the future I think he's a very

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.530 
part of the future I think he's a very
valuable<00:02:39.010> piece<00:02:39.549> of<00:02:39.579> that<00:02:39.790> organization<00:02:40.000> it

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
valuable piece of that organization it

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.270 
valuable piece of that organization it
was<00:02:40.599> very<00:02:40.810> well<00:02:41.019> respected<00:02:41.260> by<00:02:41.590> Al<00:02:41.829> Davis<00:02:42.010> he

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
was very well respected by Al Davis he

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.860 
was very well respected by Al Davis he
tried<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.549> bring<00:02:42.730> him<00:02:42.849> back<00:02:43.299> to<00:02:43.480> be<00:02:43.599> a<00:02:43.629> GM

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
tried to bring him back to be a GM

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.690 
tried to bring him back to be a GM
several<00:02:44.349> times<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.859> past<00:02:44.889> I<00:02:45.340> think

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
several times in the past I think

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.339 
several times in the past I think
there's<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.120> strong<00:02:46.359> place<00:02:46.719> for<00:02:46.959> him<00:02:47.049> he<00:02:47.200> has<00:02:47.319> a

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
there's a strong place for him he has a

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.690 
there's a strong place for him he has a
relationship<00:02:47.829> with<00:02:47.980> Chang<00:02:48.280> Gruden<00:02:48.579> from

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
relationship with Chang Gruden from

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.339 
relationship with Chang Gruden from
their<00:02:48.819> time<00:02:48.969> together<00:02:49.150> in<00:02:49.419> Green<00:02:49.599> Bay<00:02:49.629> I<00:02:49.989> don't

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
their time together in Green Bay I don't

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.199 
their time together in Green Bay I don't
see<00:02:50.530> Reggie<00:02:50.769> going<00:02:51.069> anywhere<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:51.579> I<00:02:51.609> think

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
see Reggie going anywhere but I think
