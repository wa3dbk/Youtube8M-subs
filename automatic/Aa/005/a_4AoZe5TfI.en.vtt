 windows7 combines the speed and reliability of exp 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.999
 with the low-cost suppliers send design from Whistler 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.969
 to that comes with a very useful features we here 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.939
 have been introduced once 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.599
 for example, if I have several windows open 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.960
 to see them here 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.970
 Can I take the window in the foreground and shake everyone 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 and there you see that all the windows in the background are minimizing 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.009
 also you can 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.150
 and Fence is exempted 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.630
 but pull out of the picture 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.140
 This fixed from if then also is bigger because a larger work million 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.400
 and then when you do that, it pulls it back and it's just like that 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.070
 Brunner 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.250
 very easy to do 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.360
 very helpful 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.010
 also completely new this is the taskbar you are now only 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.110
 in the Boller that reminds a little 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.230
 MacOS 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.640
 sda of certainly also copied 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.410
 The great thing about the year before is a bit of a sacrifice 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.850
 Saw the names of the programs 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.840
 Nevertheless, ours have long since become very well recognizable and which sport it is 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.479
 It is possible to go about it sees year to the program belongs more 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.950
 windows are that 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.050
 you have much more room for something 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.500
 There is also this bad traveled you knew it before 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.920
 Pages own pay- these icons are the BG staff already 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.950
 available 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.120
 that's still there but now there on the Internet Explorer because 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.210
 the always bad place is driven 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.310
 He does not have a little wet anymore and he does it quickly 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.479
 Symbolic effect is white deposited acknowledge van der Heyden 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.970
 Explorers open 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.970
 because Rheine will give a farmer a job 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.800
 the Internet Explorer Windows 7 is the new a8 was 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.980
 that is a 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.250
 20 years ago Internet Explorer already in the previous version 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.250
 the natural degradation and also supports some other useful functions 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.380
 you can install your little one and overall it is one 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.110
 good alternative 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.410
 the Firefox 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.010
 because even the Firefox through its entire mounts of course, peer yet 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.109
 is preferred 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.019
 but as a supplied browser definitely not bad in the 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 Safety significantly improved 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.429
 Overall, only seven made a very good impression because it was very fast 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.929
 running 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:23.849
 I do not want what I should do this time the wishes of the users 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.549
 very much to heart 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.039
 and in a great deal the pictures that we have flowed into this system 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.809
 that's why it's just fun to work with and you can be happy 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:33.859
 also in October in Saarbr√ºcken
