00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
one of the ways that we able to do that

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.340 
one of the ways that we able to do that
was<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.939> add<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> touch<00:01:30.450> screen<00:01:30.689> fatalities

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
was to add the touch screen fatalities

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.100 
was to add the touch screen fatalities
and<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> brings<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.780> coolest

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and it kind of brings the the coolest

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.719 
and it kind of brings the the coolest
part<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.470> MORTAL<00:01:34.710> KOMBAT<00:01:34.740> which<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.369> kind<00:01:35.640> of

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
part of MORTAL KOMBAT which is kind of

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.210 
part of MORTAL KOMBAT which is kind of
doing<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.450> fatality<00:01:36.780> but<00:01:37.170> makes<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.770> easier<00:01:38.070> by

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
