00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.740 
not even a rack and turn that over it
makes<00:02:36.130> feeding<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.000> cleaning<00:02:37.239> them<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.510> lot

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
makes feeding and cleaning them a lot

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.770 
makes feeding and cleaning them a lot
easier<00:02:38.760> they<00:02:39.760> don't<00:02:39.940> seem<00:02:40.150> too<00:02:40.330> jazzed<00:02:40.660> about

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
easier they don't seem too jazzed about

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.360 
easier they don't seem too jazzed about
the<00:02:40.959> PVC<00:02:41.320> pipe<00:02:41.560> thing<00:02:41.799> out<00:02:41.920> like<00:02:42.100> they<00:02:42.190> quite

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
the PVC pipe thing out like they quite

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.410 
the PVC pipe thing out like they quite
figured<00:02:42.670> out<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.000> goes<00:02:43.150> all<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.330> way

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
figured out that it goes all the way

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.009 
figured out that it goes all the way
through<00:02:43.450> but<00:02:45.269> maybe<00:02:46.269> they<00:02:46.390> will<00:02:46.480> someday<00:02:46.810> soon

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
through but maybe they will someday soon

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.310 
through but maybe they will someday soon
and<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:47.920> will<00:02:48.010> wrap<00:02:48.630> plank<00:02:49.630> there<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.049> its<00:02:50.200> up

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
and it will wrap plank there so its up

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.410 
and it will wrap plank there so its up
on<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> computer<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.220> rats<00:02:51.760> can<00:02:52.030> not<00:02:52.239> come

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
on the computer the rats can not come

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.580 
on the computer the rats can not come
visit<00:02:52.690> me<00:02:52.810> as<00:02:52.930> they<00:02:53.739> want<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:55.350> let's<00:02:56.350> see<00:02:56.530> em

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
else I got a 25 feet of dryer hose

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.240 
else I got a 25 feet of dryer hose
turning<00:03:02.709> into<00:03:02.890> toward<00:03:03.190> them

turning into toward them

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.590 
turning into toward them
but<00:03:06.250> I'm<00:03:06.490> thinking<00:03:06.790> about<00:03:07.000> like<00:03:07.209> running<00:03:07.540> this

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
but I'm thinking about like running this

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.500 
but I'm thinking about like running this
all<00:03:07.810> over<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.200> place<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:10.170> letting<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.230> rats

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
all over the place and letting the rats

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.660 
all over the place and letting the rats
come<00:03:13.510> visit<00:03:13.840> me<00:03:13.959> in<00:03:14.080> bed<00:03:14.470> or<00:03:14.620> whatever<00:03:14.740> sounds

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
kind of weird but the rats do like to

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.960
