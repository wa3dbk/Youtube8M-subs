00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
an open world game so he could be

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.020

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
the moment they then went on to say that

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.400 
the moment they then went on to say that
Chicago<00:02:24.300> isn't<00:02:24.510> just<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.990> setting<00:02:25.380> for

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410

watchdogs<00:02:25.740> it's<00:02:26.490> so<00:02:26.760> much<00:02:27.000> more<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.980> I

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
watchdogs it's so much more and I

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.050 
watchdogs it's so much more and I
actually<00:02:29.160> think<00:02:29.490> this<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.760> going<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.940> be<00:02:30.030> a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
actually think this is going to be a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.450 
actually think this is going to be a
major<00:02:30.270> part<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.750> watchdogs<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.860> exploring

the city itself it ever been doing

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.020 
the city itself it ever been doing
missions<00:02:34.260> exploring<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.920> city<00:02:35.160> could<00:02:35.850> give

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
missions exploring the city could give

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.970 
missions exploring the city could give
so<00:02:36.240> many<00:02:36.330> possibilities<00:02:36.630> meeting<00:02:37.470> strangers
