you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.390> was<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> little<00:01:33.720> bit<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
you can go and I was a little bit of a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.170 
you can go and I was a little bit of a
cheapskate<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.470> could<00:01:34.799> take<00:01:35.490> their<00:01:35.700> people<00:01:36.060> etc

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
cheapskate I could take their people etc

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.929 
cheapskate I could take their people etc
etc<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.229> basically<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.220> weight<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.610> i<00:01:38.670> have

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
etc but basically the weight that i have

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.789 
etc but basically the weight that i have
here<00:01:38.970> set<00:01:39.570> up<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:40.110> basically<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> same

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
here set up it's basically the same

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.770 
here set up it's basically the same
thing<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.670> very<00:01:41.939> fast<00:01:42.210> but<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.659> same

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
thing you can go very fast but the same

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.830 
thing you can go very fast but the same
time<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.259> hit<00:01:43.439> people<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:45.270> dose<00:01:45.630> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
time you can hit people that dose you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.819 
time you can hit people that dose you
are<00:01:45.960> very<00:01:46.259> important<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.189> setup<00:01:47.520> um<00:01:48.829> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
are very important to this setup um the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.560 
are very important to this setup um the
two<00:01:50.040> way<00:01:50.220> forward<00:01:50.670> now<00:01:50.909> here's<00:01:51.210> where<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.540> gets

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
two way forward now here's where it gets

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200 
two way forward now here's where it gets
down<00:01:51.930> because<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:53.009> two<00:01:53.159> way<00:01:53.280> forward<00:01:53.700> i<00:01:53.850> found

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
down because the two way forward i found

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.090 
down because the two way forward i found
that<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.570> ìletís<00:01:54.840> ism<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.320> cheaper<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:55.979> it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that the ìletís ism is cheaper for it

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.929 
that the ìletís ism is cheaper for it
