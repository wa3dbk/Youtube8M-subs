00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.400
 the cup 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:24.250
 I got now does not change the benchmarking 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.250
 batman arkham city king 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.170
 the other 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.170
 the colleague 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.650
 for the time being 41 with two average films 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.870
 huh 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.340
 this is the total average we can 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.940
 monitor in real time continue to 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.360
 stretching now 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.470
 the exchange of type day of wake 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.470
 he falls a lot 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.190
 38 cute now can not put there right 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.969
 that part I speak of it to Count 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.829
 another part of marketing focused on low 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:37.829
 but during the game happens 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.580
 arriving at the end of 2011 marks the last 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.580
 part of it, right? 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:00.350
 I was against 39 of the average that is 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:04.280
 excellent and good 40 for this type of 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.140
 resolution and quality I'm using 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.350
 image quality I'm using and 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:16.310
 physically fit fully mark 40 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.140
 frames per second was the mean was 54 and the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.880
 minimum that only this minimum is 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.980
 I do not even want to talk to you, and every time I 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.910
 exchange exchange 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.300
 benchmark right? 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.370
 it falls to send nothing but cool to 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.960
 people can expect that game sold 40 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.270
 frames per second right 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.800
 The meditation overclock the resolution is 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:44.240
 final news 5,760 10,080 maximum quality 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.890
 and physically activated also at most one 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:53.080
 last year according to demarchi that is the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.080
 our initial plan 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.140
 before founding a team that does not have 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.349
 is the quality and the sof 760 full 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.349
 screen 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:34.069
 csa filter at 31 x wife everything and anger 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.940
 He moved in next to it. 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.600
 the step who only what 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.870
 although today this benchmark the boards 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.490
 after not consider myself so heavy my 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.650
 he also had the time of his 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.060
 destroy the video card in but also 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.860
 another thing I'm running on 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:39.880
 making quality with the resolution and 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.880
 also the day of the plates 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.040
 even though it is as strong a board 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:55.949
 we can see that the average of chickens 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:59.180
 my is always there and almost of coconut green with 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.180
 the peaks of 50 nÃ© 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.370
 but is totally and playable with this 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.370
 racing is with this amount of fans 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:24.259
 even so we will depend on the command of the 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:24.259
 campaign also right 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.480
 move near to finish 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.340
 let's see what the average frames were 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.340
 in this benchmark 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.880
 in 2009 with 31 is excellent 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.660
 We can see here by the time 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.580
 logical variation, right? 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.860
 but it is not that they are exaggerated, right? 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.490
 common sense and showed the batman is now the 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.280
 our planet and in the next video I go 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.979
 make a gameplay by playing butterfield 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.360
 all in my chest 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:26.360
 so see you guys there
