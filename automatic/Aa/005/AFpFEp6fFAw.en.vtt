00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.330
 this demonstrative video of 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.320
 adapters ewc she was shooting x100 and some 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.789
 celtics 100 that are visible right there 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.410
 so let's start with the w it's 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.720
 she who is the wide-angle adapter 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.570
 so here what you see in front of you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.689
 it's the fuji x100's back screen is 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.910
 this so I'll ask the adapter 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.470
 right in front of the lens so I'm not going 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.910
 not screw them in and that's just for you 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.550
 show the antin overview rules of this 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.290
 convoy as modifications here then 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.840
 I started by putting this pencil 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.579
 that's something like that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.110
 it's just to give you an order 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.579
 of idea at the framing so you 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.750
 see I'll try to stall him then 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.850
 I'll try not to move already 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.940
 and I'm going to put the pencil all the way down 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.649
 now I'm going to adapt 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.120
 the goal and you see that already there is 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.000
 a much bigger space between the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.500
 pencil and the bottom of the screen 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:07.170
 look yes the difference tac like that 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:09.150
 on the adapter with 100 can see it 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.189
 also on this side 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.500
 curtains look so I put my finger 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.900
 on the border 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.009
 so there we see until then see I 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.350
 remove it and there we see more world 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.210
 yes so it's not it's not 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.220
 exceptional it's not an ultra 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.140
 wide-angle but it helps to win 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.930
 a few millimeters and I think I 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.150
 am having fun with that then we have the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.159
 tcl and who is much more 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.920
 imposing and that is relatively 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.400
 impressive at the level of 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.049
 her size 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.909
 we'll see right away what that 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:54.060
 then gives the same test of the famous 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.530
 pencil here is something like that tac 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.869
 see the difference sees even more the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.180
 parquet floor I will remove the pencil 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.630
 so we can see below that we have 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.530
 parquet I'm going to the adapter is in play 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.530
 it's an idea more to score 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.180
 so as for the w w the death is not 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.680
 not exceptional either in 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.220
 makes us win he makes us pass 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.110
 from a 35mm to a 50mm but that's when 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.970
 even interesting to see a little bit of 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.050
 difference especially that the vix are weary to 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.890
 the base there are no goals 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.570
 interchangeable 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.290
 so we'll say it's something 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.240
 which is still relatively 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.160
 appreciable to have these two adapters 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.360
 then at the waist level because 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.130
 I told you they were pretty 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.530
 consequent but I did not tell you in 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.590
 how far do you look at the difference 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.690
 between the w cl600 and the tcl shoot x100 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:52.560
 it's still pretty impressive 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:58.170
 on the device it will give us that you 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.160
 have something like that here at 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:08.459
 the device 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:09.720
 we slide the w cl so there we have the 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.220
 wsl on the device 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.680
 it gives us something 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.410
 of relatively imposing but this is 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.640
 nothing compared to the tcl that is him 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.640
 truly a mastodon 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.950
 the installation in futsal is 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.019
 relatively simple there is no need 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.480
 of bach of adapting anything 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.900
 you simply need to remove the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.730
 note and pictures of the lens so here 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.019
 there we wonder a little bit is 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.030
 when they photograph us the guy in 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.769
 face when he has it in front of him that's all 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.640
 likewise pretty impressive like like 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.260
 installation on the x100 is this so 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.150
 already first of all I want to thank 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.850
 fujifilm france for giving me this 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.989
 loan of equipment we will all be tested 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.640
 see a little bit of what it looks like on the 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.400
 field for a week with 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.500
 portraits this afternoon and a report 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.019
 complete on the hellfest from Thursday to Monday 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.610
 it's going to be nice enough so here's for 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.690
 this video that lasts about four 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.610
 minutes 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.780
 and to read him forgive the continuation of 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.280
 the article which she is much more 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.340
 complete regarding packaging with 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.380
 the example photos made with these 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.849
 two objectives commanding them to use 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.140
 how to update the firmware for 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.720
 able to adapt them to your device and 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.570
 that's all in the article 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.030
 is available 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.240
