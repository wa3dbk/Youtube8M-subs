00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.590
 good your fingers to a new video the 346 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.960
 What if Jesus comfort these hours is 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.240
 a lot and good months here we go from 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.490
 the stream in a little while ago I 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.139
 I found fatal by the way it's a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.239
 pretty big bitch and good news 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.250
 quite interesting about a charter 4 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:19.349
 and more details remember that I have a 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.609
 mini breakthrough we could say of a 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.130
 charter 4 in which they celebrated 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.449
 many things I will try to put a 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.880
 description also if I do not forget 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.830
 but I do not forget and well basically 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.499
 we are information comes from the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.330
 official pressure of the official magazine of 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.100
 playstation the united kingdom and basically 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.470
 they have given a bit of the new 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.540
 sandbox feature does not enter between 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.930
 quotes because it will not be like that in 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.970
 general have not basically said that going 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.710
 to have open zones is worth the ones 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.840
 we can explore and know something more about the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.780
 history and also open areas 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.180
 we could never say before 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.550
 made by Naughty Dog from from now 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.460
 that three could do well what they have 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.739
 said basically they are going to be similar 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.059
 we could say if I think of you actresses 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.210
 and so on, but good enough 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.100
 wide I imagine that I do not know will not be 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.570
 so big to the best but they say yes 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.500
 that are going to be even bigger 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.299
 that we will see, we will see the truth 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.619
 because I'm looking at several several 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.409
 pages and besides some say that 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.630
 bigger others that appeared and other 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.610
 that a little smaller so nobody 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.140
 it clarifies would like to have the fucking magazine 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.800
 in my hands to read it by myself 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.600
 because you do not see in some occasions in and 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.550
 well basically more things to see 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.220
 good the zambo that we already go 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.140
 very confirmed will not have open areas 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.390
 it is clear we do not know at what level more or 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.030
 less but you'll have them later also in 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.659
 what else will we have a kind of hook 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.610
 and an ax to climb and what else 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.649
 which is going to make the climbing 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.870
 be take another level in fact I think the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.880
 hook we already saw in him 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.430
 in the gameplay they made us another hook 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.030
 different and others and another ax different 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.890
 of what we see in the play and this or that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.650
 they say that climbing will not be easy 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.440
 it's something that in previous a charter was 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.240
 very easy the almost impossible to fall giving 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.590
 jumps and others easily grabbed 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.930
 there seems to be that you can lose the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.610
 balance very easily and you can 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.070
 get to fall with what then the 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.240
 falls will be made or could be habitual 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.710
 and we will have to be careful when 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.310
 to scale something that in previous a 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.210
 it was impossible to fall 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.940
 and else 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.710
 it was very very very difficult about the 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.160
 in front of the frame break developments 30 o 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.820
 60 in the demo ran 30 frames which was 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.820
 showed on the e3 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.909
 and good basically because they are say no 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.200
 it was not in the e3 it was not in the other in 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.590
 another event forgiveness that I missed 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.400
 the pot 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.560
 it was in the precision experience this 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.569
 well your goal as they say is to get to 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.610
 60 but without compromising anything of 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.829
 gameplay or anything like the games 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.989
 that the 60 frames objectives we will see like this 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.280
 they get it or that because if it arrives 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.530
 only 30 people are going to 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.390
 disappoint the truth enough if in 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.940
 some in confidence to have 60 frames 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.590
 and graphics of the host senses then 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.859
 also regarding the textures are going to 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.989
 be four times better than the previous 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.599
 version that uncharted 3 with which 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.220
 we are going to have pretty good textures and 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.230
 especially that graphically because it's going to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.670
 be very very nice that barely 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.840
 Also there is no difference in 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.380
 basically the cuts of the 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.210
 exceptions and others regarding the game and 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.970
 others that there is no difference 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.160
 we could say so good nothing more 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.660
 guys this has been all we go in the 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.660
 next video shows a little
