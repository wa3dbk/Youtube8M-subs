I'm also going to show you a couple of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.860 
I'm also going to show you a couple of
examples<00:00:43.100> set<00:00:43.489> up<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:43.879> might<00:00:44.030> play<00:00:44.210> but

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
examples set up that you might play but

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.080 
examples set up that you might play but
without<00:00:45.290> further<00:00:45.530> ado<00:00:45.920> here<00:00:46.550> is<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.789> review

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
without further ado here is the review

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.540 
without further ado here is the review
so<00:00:48.079> first<00:00:48.350> let's<00:00:48.739> take<00:00:48.860> a<00:00:48.920> look<00:00:49.129> at<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.370> outer

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
so first let's take a look at the outer

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.580 
so first let's take a look at the outer
case<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.270> how<00:00:50.480> it<00:00:50.600> was<00:00:50.750> modified<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.379> fit<00:00:51.530> the

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
case and how it was modified to fit the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.529 
case and how it was modified to fit the
capture<00:00:52.039> card<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.969> first<00:00:53.210> thing<00:00:53.390> you'll

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
capture card the first thing you'll

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.630 
capture card the first thing you'll
notice<00:00:53.719> is<00:00:53.840> that<00:00:54.110> there<00:00:54.469> is<00:00:54.559> an<00:00:54.680> extra<00:00:55.190> micro

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
notice is that there is an extra micro

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.060 
notice is that there is an extra micro
USB<00:00:56.149> port<00:00:56.180> on<00:00:56.480> the<00:00:56.539> back<00:00:56.780> of<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.050> device<00:00:57.320> this

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
USB port on the back of the device this

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.849 
USB port on the back of the device this
is<00:00:58.129> your<00:00:58.460> audio<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.030> video<00:00:59.239> signal<00:00:59.809> output<00:01:00.230> if

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
is your audio and video signal output if

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.410 
is your audio and video signal output if
you<00:01:01.070> are<00:01:01.160> familiar<00:01:01.340> with<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:01.850> all<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:02.300> three

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
you are familiar with the all the three

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.970 
you are familiar with the all the three
DS<00:01:02.600> capture<00:01:02.899> kit<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.289> should<00:01:03.320> probably

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
DS capture kit you should probably

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.889 
DS capture kit you should probably
noticed<00:01:04.309> by<00:01:04.369> now<00:01:04.489> that<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:05.180> time<00:01:05.390> around<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
noticed by now that this time around the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.840 
noticed by now that this time around the
IR<00:01:06.320> port<00:01:06.680> was<00:01:06.890> left<00:01:07.160> intact

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
IR port was left intact

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.359 
IR port was left intact
as<00:01:08.000> opposed<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:08.990> old<00:01:09.020> kit<00:01:09.440> nothing<00:01:10.190> was

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
as opposed to the old kit nothing was

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.219 
as opposed to the old kit nothing was
removed<00:01:10.700> or<00:01:10.940> replaced<00:01:11.119> in<00:01:11.570> order<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.929> make<00:01:12.080> it

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
removed or replaced in order to make it

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.469 
removed or replaced in order to make it
work<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:12.740> no<00:01:13.550> other<00:01:13.700> small<00:01:13.970> fees<00:01:14.240> are

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
work and no other small fees are

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.210 
work and no other small fees are
required<00:01:14.869> to<00:01:15.110> preserve<00:01:15.440> any<00:01:15.770> of<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.039> ports

required to preserve any of the ports

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.030 
required to preserve any of the ports
this<00:01:17.030> is<00:01:17.210> great<00:01:17.600> news<00:01:17.869> for<00:01:17.960> anyone<00:01:18.770> who'd

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
this is great news for anyone who'd

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.130 
this is great news for anyone who'd
rather<00:01:19.280> not<00:01:19.610> sacrifice<00:01:20.360> any<00:01:20.659> of<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.960> three

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
rather not sacrifice any of the three

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.840 
rather not sacrifice any of the three
years<00:01:21.409> features<00:01:21.830> for<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.310> sake<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.670> video

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
years features for the sake of video

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.179 
years features for the sake of video
capturing<00:01:23.479> now<00:01:24.320> let's<00:01:24.560> peek<00:01:24.770> under<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.070> hood

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
capturing now let's peek under the hood

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.859 
capturing now let's peek under the hood
to<00:01:25.610> see<00:01:25.790> what's<00:01:25.970> going<00:01:26.119> on<00:01:26.270> behind<00:01:26.720> the

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
to see what's going on behind the

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.770 
to see what's going on behind the
backplate<00:01:27.350> as<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:28.460> can<00:01:28.610> see<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:29.000> pretty<00:01:29.479> large

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
backplate as you can see a pretty large

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.569 
backplate as you can see a pretty large
hole<00:01:30.170> has<00:01:30.409> been<00:01:30.439> cut<00:01:30.770> out<00:01:30.799> under<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.369> back

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
hole has been cut out under the back

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.370 
hole has been cut out under the back
plate<00:01:31.820> next<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.329> memory<00:01:32.600> card<00:01:32.659> I'm

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
plate next to the memory card I'm

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.050 
plate next to the memory card I'm
guessing<00:01:33.829> is<00:01:34.009> because<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.490> new<00:01:34.670> circuit

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
guessing is because the new circuit

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.760 
guessing is because the new circuit
board<00:01:35.090> wouldn't<00:01:35.720> fit<00:01:35.930> under<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.409> indentation

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
board wouldn't fit under the indentation

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.130 
board wouldn't fit under the indentation
that<00:01:37.189> makes<00:01:37.579> removing<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.180> micro<00:01:38.509> SD<00:01:38.750> card

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
that makes removing the micro SD card

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.719 
that makes removing the micro SD card
easier<00:01:39.530> in<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.829> default<00:01:40.220> who<00:01:40.369> knew<00:01:40.490> three

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
easier in the default who knew three

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.969 
easier in the default who knew three
years<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:42.020> can<00:01:42.170> actually<00:01:42.560> see<00:01:42.740> that<00:01:42.860> the

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
years you can actually see that the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.649 
years you can actually see that the
memory<00:01:43.220> card<00:01:43.490> slot<00:01:43.549> has<00:01:43.909> been<00:01:44.119> raised<00:01:44.479> a

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
memory card slot has been raised a

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.660 
memory card slot has been raised a
little<00:01:44.810> bit<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:45.290> there's<00:01:45.530> barely<00:01:45.950> any<00:01:46.280> space

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
little bit and there's barely any space

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.940 
little bit and there's barely any space

between the SD cards and the circuitry I

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.130 
between the SD cards and the circuitry I
have<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.880> say<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.299> don't<00:01:50.780> feel

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
have to say that I don't feel

have to say that I don't feel

thing<00:03:51.099> worth<00:03:51.280> noting<00:03:51.639> is<00:03:51.819> that<00:03:51.849> if<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.389> want

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
thing worth noting is that if you want

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.390 
thing worth noting is that if you want
to<00:03:52.629> record<00:03:52.900> both<00:03:53.260> of<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.650> three-year<00:03:54.069> screens

to record both of the three-year screens

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.099 
to record both of the three-year screens
is<00:03:54.729> that<00:03:55.000> you<00:03:55.180> need<00:03:55.389> to<00:03:55.540> keep<00:03:55.690> them<00:03:55.930> together

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
is that you need to keep them together

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.349 
is that you need to keep them together
or<00:03:56.470> in<00:03:56.590> one<00:03:56.799> window<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.370> then<00:03:57.819> separate<00:03:58.239> them

later in post-production after that you

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:02.520 
later in post-production after that you
can<00:04:00.909> put<00:04:00.940> them<00:04:01.239> together<00:04:01.359> on<00:04:01.629> a<00:04:01.780> fancy<00:04:02.079> layout

advantage<00:04:19.539> of<00:04:19.720> capturing<00:04:20.139> the<00:04:20.349> analog<00:04:20.709> output

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
advantage of capturing the analog output

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.909 
advantage of capturing the analog output
is<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.699> doesn't<00:04:21.940> have<00:04:22.150> any<00:04:22.419> delay<00:04:23.110> while

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
is that it doesn't have any delay while

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.320 
is that it doesn't have any delay while
the<00:04:24.009> problem<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.430> that<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.729> high<00:04:24.940> transfer

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
the problem is that the high transfer

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.810 
the problem is that the high transfer
rate<00:04:25.419> of<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.840> USB<00:04:26.349> signal<00:04:26.710> generates<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.520> lot

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
rate of the USB signal generates a lot

as you can probably hear it is

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.120 
as you can probably hear it is
