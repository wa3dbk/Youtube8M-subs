lighter weight there is something to be

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.620 
lighter weight there is something to be
said<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:32.640> lighter<00:01:33.030> weight<00:01:33.119> means<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.509> little

said for lighter weight means a little
faster<00:01:34.110> turnover<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.100> we're<00:01:35.340> not

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
faster turnover but we're not

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
faster turnover but we're not
necessarily<00:01:35.640> moving<00:01:36.479> towards<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> support

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
necessarily moving towards the support

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.080 
necessarily moving towards the support
of<00:01:37.530> something<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.920> would<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.400> barefoot

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
