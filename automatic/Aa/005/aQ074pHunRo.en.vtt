them fly up and the keys won't be at

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.720 
them fly up and the keys won't be at
let's<00:00:58.199> saying<00:00:58.440> what<00:00:58.980> happens<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.370> sometimes

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
let's saying what happens is sometimes

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.229 
let's saying what happens is sometimes
the<00:00:59.910> keys<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:01.070> misaligned<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.609> even<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the keys get misaligned and you even and

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.179 
the keys get misaligned and you even and
you<00:01:03.359> might<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> problem<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> is

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
you might have a problem but this is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.340 
you might have a problem but this is
prevents<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.299> important<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
prevents that so it's important that you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.590 
prevents that so it's important that you
know<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.799> when<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.010> get<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> piano<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.909> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
know that when you get the piano and you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.030 
know that when you get the piano and you
want<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> stand<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.110> play<00:01:10.320> you're<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
want to stand a play you're not going to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.399 
want to stand a play you're not going to
be<00:01:11.400> able<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.810> piece<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.170> wood<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
be able to because this piece of wood is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.840 
be able to because this piece of wood is
going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.619> prevent<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.010> from<00:01:14.070> happening<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
going to prevent that from happening so

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
going to prevent that from happening so
there's<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.479> three<00:01:15.750> pieces<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
there's going to be three pieces of

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.740 
there's going to be three pieces of
string<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:17.100> hold<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.430> down<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.000> snip

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
string that hold this down you just snip

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.990 
string that hold this down you just snip
them<00:01:18.960> pull<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> string<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.890> remove<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:23.000> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
them pull the string out remove this and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.399 
them pull the string out remove this and
then<00:01:24.210> you're<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.720> slip<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> action

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
then you're going to slip the action

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.240 
then you're going to slip the action
back<00:01:25.590> into<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.009> piano

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.550 

now<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.520> also<00:01:32.760> important<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.810> when<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
now it is also important that when the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.170 
now it is also important that when the
action<00:01:34.980> gets<00:01:35.220> slipped<00:01:35.550> in<00:01:35.730> and<00:01:35.910> out<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
action gets slipped in and out of the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.960 
action gets slipped in and out of the
piano<00:01:36.410> that<00:01:37.410> the<00:01:37.620> mute<00:01:37.860> system<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.880> immune

that's<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.880> off<00:02:00.060> position<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.690> mute

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
that's the off position of the mute

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.840 
that's the off position of the mute
that's<00:02:01.500> when<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.860> can<00:02:02.040> slip<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.400> action<00:02:02.729> in

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that's when you can slip the action in

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.740 
that's when you can slip the action in
and<00:02:02.970> out<00:02:03.140> when<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.229> move<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.590> lever<00:02:05.750> away

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
and out when you move the lever away

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.340 
and out when you move the lever away
from<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
from you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.530 
from you
onto<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.800> piano<00:02:08.010> the<00:02:08.760> mute<00:02:09.000> system<00:02:09.420> is

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
onto the piano the mute system is

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.340 
onto the piano the mute system is
activated<00:02:10.140> which<00:02:10.500> means<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.730> keys

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
activated which means that the keys

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.590 
activated which means that the keys
won't<00:02:13.350> make<00:02:14.010> any<00:02:14.220> sound<00:02:14.580> they<00:02:15.090> won't<00:02:15.300> play<00:02:15.420> at

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
won't make any sound they won't play at

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.020 
won't make any sound they won't play at
the<00:02:15.750> end<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:17.220> reason<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.000> you

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
the end the reason for that is so you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.310 
the end the reason for that is so you
can<00:02:18.270> practice<00:02:18.420> silently<00:02:18.930> with<00:02:19.140> headphones

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
can practice silently with headphones

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.250 
can practice silently with headphones
but<00:02:20.280> what<00:02:20.400> happens<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.030> there's<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.450> metal

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
but what happens is that there's a metal

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.420 
but what happens is that there's a metal
rod<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:23.250> activates<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:25.070> dampening<00:02:26.070> system

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
rod that activates a dampening system

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.710 
rod that activates a dampening system
that<00:02:26.550> prevents<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> Hammers<00:02:27.360> from<00:02:27.480> hitting

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
that prevents the Hammers from hitting

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.420 
that prevents the Hammers from hitting
the<00:02:27.780> strings<00:02:28.080> what<00:02:28.680> happens<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.040> if<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.250> go<00:02:29.370> to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the strings what happens is if you go to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.610 
the strings what happens is if you go to
pull<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> action<00:02:30.090> out<00:02:30.240> while<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.990> mute<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.410> on

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
pull the action out while the mute is on

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.979 
pull the action out while the mute is on
that<00:02:32.520> metal<00:02:32.820> rod<00:02:33.030> is<00:02:33.420> going<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.780> hit<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
that metal rod is going to hit the

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.690 
that metal rod is going to hit the
Hammers<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.530> again<00:02:34.769> it's<00:02:34.950> always<00:02:35.160> important

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
Hammers so again it's always important

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.479 
Hammers so again it's always important

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
out and put the action back in very

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.270 
out and put the action back in very
important<00:02:44.190> remember<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.360> do<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:46.070> I'm<00:02:47.070> going
