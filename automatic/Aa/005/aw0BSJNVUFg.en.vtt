00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:16.380
 Hello, I am all and today I will explain 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.380
 how to best surf 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.220
 I'm sure you've spent a lot 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.920
 online time is your table in the 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.980
 insulate the holes its thickness its design 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.619
 but take into account that the guides are 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.870
 a fundamental element for which the 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.440
 performance of your table first 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.440
 you have to understand what impact they have 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.110
 the guides on the features in the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.620
 behavior on your surfboard your 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.910
 guides 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.550
 influence the rail of your board the drive 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.239
 it could be translated by capacity 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.430
 acceleration and ability to maintain your 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.280
 dumb button speed with so many 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.350
 the drive they want to power depends 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.470
 directly from the length of the base 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 of the materials and total of the 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.320
 keels to make simple the more 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.610
 long and more base have the most guides 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.010
 life van have generated 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.520
 in playback it could be translated by 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.399
 vision capability 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.549
 the bypass depends on the jcc of the guides 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.280
 and its depth guides with pocollay 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.679
 It is 100 straight lines to throw the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 short games while guides with a lot 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:35.399
 of being lying down that will allow 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.649
 wide curves in alt or release 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.799
 sure then by the ability to 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.219
 grip or otherwise the ability 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:46.439
 slides that you can have the work depends 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:49.439
 of the flex and the general shape of 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.289
 keels if this concept is weird now 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.990
 let's see how based on what criteria 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.600
 they must derive their guides 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.240
 the first criterion the most important is 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.540
 no doubt your level if you are a beginner 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.689
 you will mount the guides in the table type 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.560
 mini malibÃº evolutionary type then then 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.069
 some plastic guides are convenient for you 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.459
 perfectly 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.219
 They are molded guides based on plastic and 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.189
 in pieces of fiberglass with the 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:24.249
 which got a good flex from the 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:26.950
 guides this flex allows you to see some 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:30.310
 rations and make your table easier 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.079
 less technical anyway with your 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.739
 level you have not come much speed 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:38.799
 you're not going to put a lot of pressure on 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.430
 guides so the influence of the 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:45.400
 guides on your table is minimal if you have a 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.959
 intermediate level or advanced level that 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.909
 is starting to make a plan button 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.990
 concrete well what do you do button so 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:54.330
 strong with your vertical 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.570
 based on a lot of speed because you 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.880
 It is very interesting to go to some guides 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.020
 high end in theory 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.240
 the more followed by surgery the more 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:09.360
 performance is going to give you because they vote for us 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.040
 is going to deform less so you 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.680
 you go 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.129
 - and we could understand that the 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.769
 certain easier however how much more 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.950
 track videos and more technical is going to be 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.260
 least remind you of hours with a 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.159
 intermediate level is preferable and this one to 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.829
 a guide that holds true 3 why 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.700
 it can be a construction type like 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.019
 light or type of classes 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.750
 eventually a construction that 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.180
 integrate part of carbon but in the base 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.030
 from here to that for the law to continue being 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.609
 here in your base but keep the flex in 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.280
 the tip your weight this the same element 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:52.310
 fundamental when it comes to viewing your guides 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.040
 manufacturers classify the guides by 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.760
 size and each size is associated with 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.090
 weight mushroom 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.730
 you can adjust this size depending on the 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.610
 size of the waves that you are going to surf in 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.680
 bigger waves to be able to benefit a 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.200
 here a little bigger seeing the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.870
 small can benefit you some guides 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.320
 smaller than you are going to be nothing else 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.769
 short finally takes into account the kind of 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.799
 waves 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.099
 no way 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:25.090
 to surf is not the same one hour and 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:26.919
 put an hour to maneuvers where what 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.479
 you're going to want to do is a lot for so many 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:33.849
 short at one hour pointer hour 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.220
 long with walls where what are you going to 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:39.099
 look and what you're going to need a lot 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:43.780
 speed and a lot of grip for this take 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:45.729
 into account in the dream is to say the angle 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.490
 which forms the leading edge of the 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:53.620
 keel when more lying down the guide 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.169
 how can the fcs you attract be more 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.430
 you're going to have more base speed 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:03.300
 consequently to the contrary 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:07.240
 the more direct how to put the fsc 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.210
 21 sep the bird 0 1 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.690
 easier to have friends short 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:17.169
 our advice is that if you do not want 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.229
 complicate life with several guides in a 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:22.780
 polyvalent model if on the contrary you 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:25.990
 like the technique is sensitive to those 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.630
 small details and you have a good level 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:32.080
 of surfing so you may be interested in having 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:34.770
 several sets of guides at least two for 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.199
 adapt according to the type of works 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:40.930
 we have many guides in history all 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:44.199
 the constructions all sizes john 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:47.199
 part of the fs range almost all of 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:50.919
 The berzins range of magnesia guides 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:54.220
 tv and any doubt you have no doubt 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.830
 to contact us by mail by 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:59.190
