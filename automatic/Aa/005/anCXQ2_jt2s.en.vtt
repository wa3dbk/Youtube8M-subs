super<00:00:14.429> fast<00:00:15.949> the<00:00:16.949> Jetboil<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.449> size

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
super fast the Jetboil is about the size

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.870 
super fast the Jetboil is about the size
of<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.930> standard<00:00:18.990> nalgene<00:00:19.710> bottle<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.310> weighs

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
of a standard nalgene bottle and weighs

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.359 
of a standard nalgene bottle and weighs
probably<00:00:21.390> just<00:00:21.779> under<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.109> pound<00:00:22.439> everything

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
probably just under a pound everything

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.370 
probably just under a pound everything
fits<00:00:23.789> conveniently<00:00:23.970> into<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.810> one<00:00:24.990> liter<00:00:25.170> cup

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
fits conveniently into the one liter cup

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.089 
fits conveniently into the one liter cup
so<00:00:28.380> inside<00:00:28.680> you've<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.130> your<00:00:29.400> actual<00:00:29.880> stove

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
so inside you've got your actual stove

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.870 
so inside you've got your actual stove
you<00:00:32.099> got<00:00:32.250> your<00:00:32.430> gas<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:34.440> even<00:00:35.219> there's<00:00:35.730> an

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
you got your gas and even there's an

attaches to the bottom and there's lines

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.600 
attaches to the bottom and there's lines
for<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.480> one<00:00:42.719> cup

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.400 

it's<00:00:47.610> super<00:00:47.969> simple<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.300> put<00:00:48.480> together<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
it's super simple to put together you

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
it's super simple to put together you
just<00:00:49.440> screw<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> gas<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> stove<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.000> then

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
just screw the gas to the stove and then

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.870 
just screw the gas to the stove and then
snap<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> cup

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.000 

the<00:00:58.880> jetboil<00:00:59.330> utilizes<00:00:59.960> what's<00:01:00.530> called<00:01:00.800> a

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
the jetboil utilizes what's called a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.640 
the jetboil utilizes what's called a
flux<00:01:01.460> ring<00:01:01.790> heat<00:01:02.180> exchanger<00:01:02.810> and<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:03.500> gathers

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
flux ring heat exchanger and it gathers

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.620 
flux ring heat exchanger and it gathers
almost<00:01:04.220> eighty<00:01:04.430> percent<00:01:04.640> of<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.030> heat<00:01:05.210> adding

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
almost eighty percent of the heat adding

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.690 
almost eighty percent of the heat adding
to<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.780> stoves<00:01:06.170> already<00:01:06.860> pretty<00:01:07.490> good

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
to the stoves already pretty good
