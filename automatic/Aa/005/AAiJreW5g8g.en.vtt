I<00:02:45.269> am<00:02:45.630> using<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.080> brush<00:02:46.230> because<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.590> think<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
I am using a brush because I think it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.770 
I am using a brush because I think it
gives<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.459> slightly<00:02:48.060> more<00:02:48.180> precise

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
gives you slightly more precise

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.660 
gives you slightly more precise
application<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.950> mean<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.190> can<00:02:50.400> use<00:02:50.580> your

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
application I mean you can use your

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.180 
application I mean you can use your
finger<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.290> often<00:02:52.290> think<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.680> men<00:02:52.890> are<00:02:52.920> as

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
finger I often think that men are as

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.800 
finger I often think that men are as
delicate<00:02:53.610> as<00:02:53.640> women<00:02:54.060> are<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.480> they<00:02:54.569> can<00:02:54.660> be<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
delicate as women are and they can be a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.960 
delicate as women are and they can be a
little<00:02:54.930> bit<00:02:55.080> heavy-handed<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.519> idea<00:02:56.819> is

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
little bit heavy-handed so the idea is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.280 
little bit heavy-handed so the idea is
that<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.180> looks<00:02:57.329> invisible<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:57.989> if<00:02:58.079> you've<00:02:58.200> got

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
that it looks invisible so if you've got

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.560 
that it looks invisible so if you've got
just<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.890> one<00:02:58.920> tool<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.850> going<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.329> give<00:03:00.450> you

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
just the one tool it's going to give you

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.940 
just the one tool it's going to give you
a<00:03:00.600> really<00:03:00.930> precise<00:03:01.320> application<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:01.920> think

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
a really precise application I think

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.240 
a really precise application I think
it's<00:03:02.280> worth<00:03:02.459> investing<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.750> a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
it's worth investing in so this is a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.599 
it's worth investing in so this is a
little<00:03:05.250> 242<00:03:05.910> brush<00:03:06.709> now<00:03:07.709> when<00:03:08.100> when<00:03:08.489> you're
