00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.600
 when it comes out is not yet complete 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.430
 known but keep you informed 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.840
 and i like when you're excited about it 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.340
 I take my words back that I am 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.750
 once mentioned an apple as 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.910
 just not spiderman 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.070

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.420
 Spiderman already I have a first reaction I 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:43.130
 wrote I laughed here just one 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:43.130
 thing to look like an eye-catching myself 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.080
 well if this is not ilari your ground 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.849
 16 I'll eat my shoe 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.709
 more remarkable post from the film 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.720
 industry because as we know the 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.080
 huge experienced films about small van 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.390
 play-doh and monopoly and goose board 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.819
 not that crazy films but it will come 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.080
 also a film about the candy manufacturer ice cream 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.550
 and sweet and terrible pause 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.730
 something we don't miss but sometimes 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.099
 happened that jane jane group has his back 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.989
 broke exactly the moment he his 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.330
 force and leg broke during recording 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.630
 from the new star wars movie star wars 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.920
 for weeks and that is only now known because 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.720
 Jonah 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.160
 he can be clear but nice number too 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.950
 someone we should leave alone 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.370
 is maria carey because this is maria carey 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.370
 poor now 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.900
 shamelessly she played a lot 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.610
 also in the film splitter global flop 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.490
 In addition, plays is still impressions and 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.050
 in the butter the film from 2013 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.900
 but now she's going to film her own 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.600
 directing and still playing 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.180
 I thought a donkey didn't hit them high 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.250
 twice on the same stone 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.140
 I hope Maria Carey also not so I wish 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.300
 you are very lucky in the film 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.910

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.580

 works on his karma karma 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.780
 yes indeed because he preferred boxes 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.340
 shoes and too much hockey 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.930
 trade there lots of other things 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.010

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.690
