I<00:00:45.380> can<00:00:45.560> turn<00:00:45.770> it<00:00:45.830> you<00:00:46.070> can<00:00:46.220> see<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:47.420> dust<00:00:47.750> fall

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
I can turn it you can see the dust fall

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.370 
I can turn it you can see the dust fall
out<00:00:48.920> of<00:00:48.950> this<00:00:49.130> I'm<00:00:49.940> going<00:00:50.300> to<00:00:50.450> take<00:00:51.200> the

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
out of this I'm going to take the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
out of this I'm going to take the
partial<00:00:51.590> plate<00:00:51.830> off<00:00:51.950> and<00:00:52.100> see<00:00:52.190> what<00:00:52.280> that

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
partial plate off and see what that

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.160 
partial plate off and see what that
looks<00:00:52.460> like<00:00:53.230> all<00:00:54.230> right<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.980> clutch<00:00:55.340> disc

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
looks like all right the clutch disc

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.770 
looks like all right the clutch disc
fresh<00:00:57.170> bleep<00:00:57.500> in<00:00:57.620> remote<00:00:58.480> pressure<00:00:59.480> plate

here<00:01:01.330> once<00:01:02.330> again<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.780> scoring<00:01:03.440> marks<00:01:03.650> there

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
here once again the scoring marks there

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.469 
here once again the scoring marks there
where<00:01:04.160> was<00:01:04.369> grinding<00:01:04.760> into<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.000> transmission

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
where was grinding into the transmission

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.750 
where was grinding into the transmission
because<00:01:06.440> of<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.770> destroy<00:01:07.220> death<00:01:07.490> roll

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
because of the destroy death roll

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.840 
because of the destroy death roll
bearing<00:01:08.119> there<00:01:08.710> you<00:01:09.710> can<00:01:09.890> see<00:01:09.920> on<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.640> surface

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
bearing there you can see on the surface

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.210 
bearing there you can see on the surface
that<00:01:11.270> it's<00:01:11.420> blue<00:01:11.780> meaning<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:12.350> was<00:01:12.410> overheated

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
that it's blue meaning it was overheated

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.840 
that it's blue meaning it was overheated
and<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:13.820> very<00:01:13.940> very<00:01:14.750> terrible<00:01:15.350> shape<00:01:15.850> the

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
and it is a very very terrible shape the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.310 
and it is a very very terrible shape the
clutch<00:01:17.149> disc<00:01:17.479> itself<00:01:17.660> here<00:01:19.720> there's<00:01:20.720> nothing

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
clutch disc itself here there's nothing

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.870 
clutch disc itself here there's nothing
left<00:01:21.590> of<00:01:21.890> it<00:01:21.920> it's<00:01:22.550> completely<00:01:23.479> destroyed

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
left of it it's completely destroyed

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.710 
left of it it's completely destroyed
here's<00:01:25.880> what's<00:01:26.119> left<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.450> one<00:01:26.509> of<00:01:26.660> the

here's what's left of one of the

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.950 
here's what's left of one of the
Ribbit's<00:01:27.050> onyx<00:01:27.979> it<00:01:28.130> or<00:01:28.250> not<00:01:28.750> it's<00:01:29.750> worse

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
Ribbit's onyx it or not it's worse

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.350 
Ribbit's onyx it or not it's worse
unfortunately<00:01:30.740> this<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:31.910> a<00:01:31.940> dual<00:01:32.180> mass

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
unfortunately this is a dual mass

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.060 
unfortunately this is a dual mass
flywheel<00:01:32.660> obviously<00:01:33.560> it's<00:01:33.680> not<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.800> flat

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
flywheel obviously it's not a flat

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.980 
flywheel obviously it's not a flat
design<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.940> have<00:01:35.030> your<00:01:35.149> outer<00:01:35.360> part<00:01:35.690> here<00:01:35.899> and

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
design you have your outer part here and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.780 
design you have your outer part here and
you<00:01:36.050> have<00:01:36.170> an<00:01:36.259> inner<00:01:36.380> part<00:01:36.680> here<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.280> this<00:01:37.729> is

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
you have an inner part here and this is

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.990 
you have an inner part here and this is
designed<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:39.050> you<00:01:39.080> don't<00:01:39.259> feel<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.729> shift<00:01:40.729> of

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
designed so you don't feel the shift of

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:53.180 
designed so you don't feel the shift of
the<00:01:41.270> transmission<00:01:41.840> as<00:01:42.050> much<00:01:42.200> now

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.540 

I<00:01:53.310> don't<00:01:53.820> know<00:01:53.880> if<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.150> see<00:01:54.330> this<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.630> not

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.990 

but<00:02:02.010> you<00:02:03.010> can<00:02:03.160> see<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.340> little<00:02:03.490> bit<00:02:03.610> there<00:02:03.820> see

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
but you can see a little bit there see

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.170 
but you can see a little bit there see
how<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.150> center<00:02:04.510> parts<00:02:04.780> moving<00:02:05.730> the<00:02:06.730> flywheel

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
how the center parts moving the flywheel
