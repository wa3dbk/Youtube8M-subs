attracted you to urbanism was it it was

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.240 
attracted you to urbanism was it it was
congestion<00:00:12.650> it<00:00:12.920> was<00:00:14.230> diversity<00:00:15.230> it<00:00:15.410> was<00:00:15.650> I

are them a kind of city does that was

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.670 
are them a kind of city does that was
totally<00:00:25.670> bought<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.269> there's<00:00:26.510> a<00:00:26.600> rule<00:00:26.810> it<00:00:27.529> was

tropical<00:00:30.769> country<00:00:30.920> that<00:00:31.310> was<00:00:31.490> just

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
tropical country that was just

then simply for me
the<00:00:37.909> callosity<00:00:38.510> was<00:00:39.699> connected<00:00:40.699> to<00:00:40.729> a<00:00:40.820> number

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
the callosity was connected to a number

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.969 
the callosity was connected to a number
of<00:00:41.710> deeply<00:00:42.710> forming<00:00:43.960> experiences<00:00:44.960> all<00:00:45.830> right

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
of deeply forming experiences all right

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.110 
of deeply forming experiences all right
let<00:00:46.129> me<00:00:46.159> take<00:00:46.280> a<00:00:46.339> look<00:00:46.489> at<00:00:46.580> some<00:00:46.729> slides<00:00:46.850> of

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
let me take a look at some slides of

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.160 
let me take a look at some slides of
stuff<00:00:47.299> you're<00:00:47.390> doing<00:00:47.449> it<00:00:47.720> let's<00:00:47.930> talk<00:00:48.049> about

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
stuff you're doing it let's talk about

stuff you're doing it let's talk about
Japan<00:00:48.559> which<00:00:48.739> is<00:00:48.890> sort<00:00:49.070> of<00:00:49.159> all<00:00:49.280> new<00:00:49.549> for<00:00:49.760> me

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
Japan which is sort of all new for me

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.700 
Japan which is sort of all new for me
the<00:00:50.299> first<00:00:50.540> place<00:00:50.750> is<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.080> exterior<00:00:51.530> the

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
the first place is this exterior the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.979 
the first place is this exterior the
Milstein<00:00:52.100> hall<00:00:52.580> at<00:00:52.879> Cornell<00:00:53.330> you<00:00:53.540> can<00:00:53.690> see<00:00:53.869> it

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
Milstein hall at Cornell you can see it

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.100 
Milstein hall at Cornell you can see it
here<00:00:54.610> it's<00:00:55.610> part<00:00:55.879> of<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.119> number<00:00:56.629> of<00:00:56.839> works

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
here it's part of a number of works

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.969 
here it's part of a number of works
we're<00:00:57.559> doing<00:00:57.860> currently<00:00:58.239> that<00:00:59.239> are<00:00:59.979> less

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
we're doing currently that are less

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.109 
we're doing currently that are less
exuberant<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.360> less<00:01:02.659> extravagant<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.119> the

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
exuberant and less extravagant and the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.040 
exuberant and less extravagant and the
current<00:01:05.510> architecture<00:01:05.990> I<00:01:06.350> felt<00:01:06.770> in<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:07.729> past

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
current architecture I felt in the past

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.690 
current architecture I felt in the past
four<00:01:09.050> or<00:01:09.080> five<00:01:09.200> years<00:01:09.350> that<00:01:09.860> there<00:01:10.100> was<00:01:10.340> a<00:01:10.370> kind

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
four or five years that there was a kind

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.510 
four or five years that there was a kind
of<00:01:10.760> exaggerated<00:01:11.600> nature<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.200> architecture<00:01:12.800> so

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
of exaggerated nature to architecture so

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.730 
of exaggerated nature to architecture so
what<00:01:13.700> we're<00:01:13.880> trying<00:01:13.940> to<00:01:14.180> do<00:01:14.300> here<00:01:14.690> is<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:15.410> focus

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
what we're trying to do here is to focus

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.100 
what we're trying to do here is to focus
more<00:01:16.400> on<00:01:16.430> performance<00:01:16.970> of<00:01:17.510> a<00:01:17.630> building<00:01:17.930> than

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
more on performance of a building than

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.650 
more on performance of a building than
on<00:01:18.320> form<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.010> on<00:01:19.220> shape<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.360> this<00:01:20.480> is<00:01:20.600> a

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
on form and on shape so this is a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.980 
on form and on shape so this is a
building<00:01:20.990> that<00:01:21.050> performs<00:01:21.710> in<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.040> very<00:01:22.990> precise

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
building that performs in a very precise

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.200 
building that performs in a very precise
way<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.590> particular<00:01:25.490> role<00:01:25.670> in<00:01:25.910> connecting

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
way a particular role in connecting

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.720 
way a particular role in connecting
three<00:01:26.780> different<00:01:27.410> entities<00:01:28.010> and<00:01:30.490> in<00:01:31.490> this

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
three different entities and in this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.030 
three different entities and in this
connection<00:01:32.120> it<00:01:32.960> also<00:01:33.140> has<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.440> column<00:01:33.740> hidden

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
connection it also has a column hidden

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.620 
connection it also has a column hidden
treasure<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:34.520> see<00:01:34.730> it<00:01:34.820> there<00:01:35.090> can<00:01:35.300> you<00:01:35.390> name

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
treasure you see it there can you name

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.990 
treasure you see it there can you name
it<00:01:35.780> there's<00:01:36.409> a<00:01:36.470> kind<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:36.710> plate<00:01:37.010> that<00:01:37.340> connects

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
it there's a kind of plate that connects

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.580 
it there's a kind of plate that connects
and<00:01:38.150> then<00:01:38.270> underneath<00:01:38.630> it<00:01:39.020> there's<00:01:39.260> a<00:01:39.320> kind<00:01:39.530> of

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
and then underneath it there's a kind of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.380 
and then underneath it there's a kind of
hidden<00:01:39.740> world<00:01:40.100> where<00:01:40.430> we<00:01:42.970> are<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.060> saying

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
hidden world where we are you saying

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.910 
hidden world where we are you saying
that<00:01:44.510> it's<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.870> more<00:01:45.050> emphasis<00:01:45.440> on<00:01:45.620> is

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
that it's the more emphasis on is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.800 
that it's the more emphasis on is
performance<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.850> functionality<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.600> same

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
performance and functionality the same

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.800 
performance and functionality the same
thing<00:01:48.020> no<00:01:48.940> functionality<00:01:49.940> is<00:01:50.210> boring<00:01:50.600> and

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
thing no functionality is boring and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.990 
thing no functionality is boring and
