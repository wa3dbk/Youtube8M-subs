00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.049
 language I'm like a decisive game like arshavin 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.809
 selling it did not live up to my expectations 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.730
 honestly there are a few significant 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.210
 factors that you don't want 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.330
 continue the first this is permanent 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.820
 melteshenie all around constantly flies 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.130
 we rush headlong somewhere absolutely 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.410
 it is not clear why we are running all the time 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.960
 run jump on the roofs picture 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.900
 jerky torn constantly constantly 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.070
 cuts eyes here this is a frame change 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.870
 frame rates are huge and honest 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.910
 be constantly running and 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.239
 mindless jumps on the roofs I personally do not 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.190
 delivers no pleasure ie 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.050
 1 jerky gameplay is very fast 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.879
 which eyes hurt me for him 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.579
 frankly the second 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.379
 absolutely stupid thoughtless plot i don't 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.940
 I remember not a single character in the game because 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.170
 moreover, that we all time somewhere crazy 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.199
 rushing headlong 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.770
 these camps that appear 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.290
 characters that seem to break down 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.720
 are introduced then quickly killed 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.490
 these dozens of warring camps these 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.890
 incomprehensible missions that no matter what 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.470
 affect and it's all in endless mode 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.140
 running somewhere it feels like a game 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.990
 one solid spidran no sense without 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.570
 plot without storytelling honestly i'm not 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.189
 I remember who lives in the tower I do not remember who 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.680
 from whom where has it all separated me 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.229
 reminds Santa Barbara you let 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.150
 fast forward 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.070
 still in the dayland plot was who more 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.990
 fundamental fundamentally what is he 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.340
 was such 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.479
 you could feel it 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.600
 right here 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.700
 constant ideology mindless stupid 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.439
 it is not clear what some permanent 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.049
 stupid tasks from meaningless 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.450
 characters that disappear as soon as 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.979
 we have done this task honestly on 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.899
 my opinion well you could just not 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.960
 enter the plot in this game is not at all 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.520
 enter the plot in this game just let's 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.430
 you know how easy it was to write yourself 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.320
 tasks there do it run there no 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.299
 characters there are no heroes 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.119
 narratives just here on the screen 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.250
 the job is win pick mushrooms ran 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.660
 collected and preferably at the time because 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.500
 that an orphan is running while pressing 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.060
 drama then the third reason why 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.390
 I didn't like this game 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.640
 miserable stupid zombies I always dreamed about 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.920
 the game in which the hero will have 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.490
 real human capabilities and 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.600
 zombies will really inspire horror and 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.210
 the prospect of going out really 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.950
 will inspire fear and horror as they are fan 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.840
 Do you understand a zombie for me? 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.910
 apocalypse horror this game in which 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.730
 you are afraid of a zombie and try to avoid 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.850
 them they and the graph are you the other way around 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.740
 intentionally looking for a meeting with a crowd of zombies 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.230
 to break more skulls because 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.410
 what is fun even if zombies are zombies 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.420
 millions you just can and you are not with them 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.090
 cope you can fly a cat 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.930
 there on the 40 meter tower and run away from 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.700
 I like them but for me in another 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.230
 times the zombies are made a laughing stock 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.910
 clowns are just an object for 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.490
 bullying they don't cause horror 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.820
 someone will say nokia have the same night and 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.450
 night monsters they are stronger 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.840
 terrible answer like a fig when 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.700
 you have and that for 5 kopecks in 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.540
 a million pieces thanks to 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.820
 who can you 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.220
 distract these hordes quietly go on 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.140
 city ​​singing a song whistling 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.060
 favorite joke tossing around 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.490
 thunder crackers no one will suit you 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.920
 in general because they are stupidly distracted 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.340
 then what's the point at all to introduce these 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.500
 creepy zombies what's the point of driving these 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.350
 scary mobs you can 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.260
 put in gnar for three pennies and item 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.650
 for three pennies in my opinion complete nonsense 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.720
 generally goner nonsense that is what I 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.430
 the difference is how strong the monster is 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.340
 how many blows can he kill me 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.770
 if i can't do that so i don't 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.110
 see generally they would still do 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.750
 opportunity as a predator to wear a suit 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.930
 no wine that invisible costume 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.480
 camouflage mom camouflage suit 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.850
 and run in it invisible and 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.760
 but zombies will run around the city 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.230
 who kill you with one blow 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.040
 why if you are still not for 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.250
 you do not pose any danger 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.770
 shorter than three main aspects where organs 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.009
 the gameplay is dumb meaningless plot and 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.470
 humiliation 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:29.289
 over the zombies really i look at the zone but 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.380
 this humiliation is serious this is not a zombie this 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:35.530
 pieces of shit we are just a pear for 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.810
 beating well here's my opinion give me ml 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.830
 oh so and considering that we have this shit 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.990
 passed only 20 percent for 6 streams 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.370
 20 percent of the plot of this shit 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.430
 plot that still can not 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.979
 remember who we are and why we are there with whom and 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.740
 there are fighting why are we fighting there 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.320
 whom we serve who is right who is guilty 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.449
 just have a bunch of camps that are friend with 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.210
 friend how characters interact 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.970
 missions come and go no matter what 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.310
 does not affect well nonsense and this nonsense we 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.560
 passed 20 percent frankly guys well 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.490
 how would the desire to play it I do not have 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:16.509
 absolutely no I do not care how much 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.860
 watching people this shit well if i 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:20.099
 I will not get pleasure from the game 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.099
 play it 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:30.050
 it is compressed 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.599
 view a brief review of the game dying light 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.509
 buy the game on the incentive run 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:39.039
 enjoy this beautiful 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:42.550
 atmospheric zombie apocalypse toy a 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.550
 we continue on
