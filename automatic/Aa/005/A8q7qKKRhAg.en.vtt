you get three rolls of this stuff it's a
very<00:03:41.100> cheap<00:03:41.370> modification<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:43.140> I'm<00:03:43.530> getting

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
very cheap modification and I'm getting

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.699 
very cheap modification and I'm getting
a<00:03:43.890> hell<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.370> lot<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.519> performance<00:03:45.030> out<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.209> it

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
a hell of a lot of performance out of it

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.170 
a hell of a lot of performance out of it
so<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.829> return<00:03:47.190> on<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.489> investment<00:03:47.549> is

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
so the return on that investment is

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.780 
so the return on that investment is
awesome<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.620> far<00:03:49.920> as<00:03:49.950> that<00:03:50.190> Wilson<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:50.730> think

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
awesome as far as that Wilson I think

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.160 
awesome as far as that Wilson I think
it's<00:03:51.030> called<00:03:51.180> an<00:03:51.269> ultra<00:03:51.570> grip<00:03:51.750> tape<00:03:51.959> or

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
it's called an ultra grip tape or

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.780 
it's called an ultra grip tape or
something<00:03:52.350> like<00:03:52.470> that<00:03:55.070> I'll<00:03:56.070> roll<00:03:56.370> Willie<00:03:56.579> and

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
something like that I'll roll Willie and

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.160 
something like that I'll roll Willie and
exactly<00:03:57.209> what<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.600> I'll<00:03:57.959> put<00:03:58.079> an

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
exactly what it is I'll put an

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:42.989

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:42.999 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.639 

there<00:04:43.999> you<00:04:44.089> go<00:04:44.240> little<00:04:44.719> comparison<00:04:45.409> for<00:04:45.589> all

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:45.649 
there you go little comparison for all
