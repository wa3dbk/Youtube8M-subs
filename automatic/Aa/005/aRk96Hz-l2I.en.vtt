00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.709 
distribution but the zine one really
does<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> better<00:01:50.399> job<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:51.380> dvds<00:01:53.299> they<00:01:54.299> both<00:01:54.509> can

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
play them but to my experience is that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.270 
play them but to my experience is that
design<00:01:59.000> version<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.750> better<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:03.030> then

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
design version really is better so then

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.249 
design version really is better so then

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
selected as you can see it is so you

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.260

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
want to close out of that and you would

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.380 
want to close out of that and you would
want<00:04:30.510> to<00:04:30.600> type<00:04:30.870> in<00:04:31.110> sudo<00:04:31.620> or<00:04:32.580> I've<00:04:33.180> actually

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
want to type in sudo or I've actually

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.550 
want to type in sudo or I've actually
learned<00:04:33.720> that<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.990> correct<00:04:34.230> pronunciation

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
learned that the correct pronunciation

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:43.220 
learned that the correct pronunciation
just<00:04:34.950> su<00:04:35.460> do<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.990> sudo<00:04:39.140> apt-get<00:04:40.140> install<00:04:42.230> I'm

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
just su do so sudo apt-get install I'm

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.900 
just su do so sudo apt-get install I'm
kind<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.560> going<00:04:43.740> off<00:04:43.830> memory<00:04:44.220> here<00:04:44.460> but<00:04:44.490> for<00:04:44.850> a

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
kind of going off memory here but for a

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:55.420 
kind of going off memory here but for a
32-bit<00:04:45.690> system<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:46.320> think<00:04:46.770> it's<00:04:48.830> W<00:04:49.830> 32<00:04:51.710> codecs

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.320 

yeah<00:04:56.430> that's<00:04:56.820> right<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:57.360> yeah<00:04:57.980> W<00:04:58.980> 32<00:04:59.460> codecs<00:05:00.030> I

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
yeah that's right so yeah W 32 codecs I

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.740 
yeah that's right so yeah W 32 codecs I
don't<00:05:01.080> know<00:05:01.200> what<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.410> 64-bit<00:05:02.130> is<00:05:02.750> but

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
don't know what the 64-bit is but

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.290 
don't know what the 64-bit is but
there's<00:05:04.170> a<00:05:04.290> guide<00:05:04.620> for<00:05:05.010> this<00:05:05.130> on<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.730> Ubuntu

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
there's a guide for this on the Ubuntu

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.340 
there's a guide for this on the Ubuntu
website<00:05:06.480> so<00:05:08.540> that<00:05:09.540> would<00:05:09.660> be<00:05:09.780> the<00:05:09.900> first<00:05:10.110> place

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
website so that would be the first place

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.950 
website so that would be the first place
I<00:05:10.500> would<00:05:10.650> look<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.250> if<00:05:12.240> you've<00:05:12.390> never<00:05:12.570> been

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
I would look and if you've never been

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:21.790 
I would look and if you've never been
there<00:05:13.200> it<00:05:13.890> is

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.170 

yeah<00:05:22.800> just<00:05:23.100> I<00:05:23.310> thought<00:05:23.490> ubuntu.com

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:46.300 

just<00:05:30.180> out<00:05:30.330> of<00:05:30.360> curiosity<00:05:30.810> I<00:05:37.280> believe<00:05:41.450> that

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.700 

yeah<00:05:47.310> it's<00:05:47.460> not<00:05:47.610> gonna<00:05:47.790> stay<00:05:48.030> on<00:05:48.150> here<00:05:48.360> but

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
yeah it's not gonna stay on here but

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.540 
yeah it's not gonna stay on here but
maybe<00:05:49.710> it's<00:05:51.110> w6t<00:05:52.110> for<00:05:52.320> codex<00:05:52.800> don't<00:05:53.160> quote<00:05:53.400> me

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
maybe it's w6t for codex don't quote me

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.960 
maybe it's w6t for codex don't quote me
on<00:05:53.580> that<00:05:53.700> I<00:05:54.060> don't<00:05:54.150> know<00:05:54.510> what<00:05:54.810> it<00:05:54.900> is<00:05:55.020> for

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
on that I don't know what it is for

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.690 
on that I don't know what it is for
certain<00:05:56.970> but<00:05:57.450> it<00:05:58.140> is<00:05:59.330> it's<00:06:00.330> doable<00:06:01.490> that<00:06:02.490> will

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
certain but it is it's doable that will

have<00:06:17.190> out<00:06:18.060> of<00:06:18.300> the<00:06:18.420> box<00:06:18.660> and<00:06:18.870> that's<00:06:18.960> mostly

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
have out of the box and that's mostly

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.460 
have out of the box and that's mostly
due<00:06:19.380> to<00:06:19.470> copyright<00:06:19.860> issues<00:06:20.250> but<00:06:21.260> what<00:06:22.260> can<00:06:22.380> you

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
due to copyright issues but what can you

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.040 
due to copyright issues but what can you
do<00:06:22.590> when<00:06:23.040> it's<00:06:23.190> open<00:06:23.460> source<00:06:23.700> and<00:06:24.120> kind<00:06:24.960> of

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
do when it's open source and kind of

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.180 
do when it's open source and kind of
limits<00:06:25.320> what<00:06:25.440> you're<00:06:25.590> allowed<00:06:25.740> to<00:06:25.920> get<00:06:26.100> away

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
limits what you're allowed to get away

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.330 
limits what you're allowed to get away
with<00:06:26.540> but<00:06:27.540> anyway<00:06:27.780> that<00:06:27.990> is<00:06:28.230> how<00:06:28.470> you<00:06:29.070> enable

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
with but anyway that is how you enable

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.600 
with but anyway that is how you enable
most<00:06:29.970> multimedia<00:06:30.660> playback<00:06:31.190> if<00:06:32.190> you<00:06:32.400> want<00:06:32.520> to

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
most multimedia playback if you want to

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.600 
most multimedia playback if you want to
encode<00:06:32.970> WMAs<00:06:33.740> you<00:06:34.740> might<00:06:34.920> have<00:06:35.100> to<00:06:35.220> use<00:06:35.340> wine

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
encode WMAs you might have to use wine

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.990 
encode WMAs you might have to use wine

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
installation but other than that I mean

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.880 
installation but other than that I mean
that's<00:06:42.330> really<00:06:42.840> it<00:06:42.990> you<00:06:43.230> should<00:06:43.590> be<00:06:43.710> able<00:06:43.770> to

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
that's really it you should be able to

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.670 
that's really it you should be able to
play<00:06:44.040> just<00:06:44.280> about<00:06:44.400> anything<00:06:44.640> that<00:06:44.940> way<00:06:45.090> and<00:06:45.810> so

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
play just about anything that way and so

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.010 
play just about anything that way and so
