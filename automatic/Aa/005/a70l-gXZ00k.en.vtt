00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:42.749 
sort of seems like a dumb idea from the

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:44.930 
sort of seems like a dumb idea from the
start<00:00:43.289> like<00:00:43.559> maybe<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.399> could<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.609> a<00:00:44.699> little

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.239 
start like maybe it could be a little
imaginative<00:00:45.870> but<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.410> seems<00:00:46.710> more<00:00:46.949> like<00:00:47.129> an

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
imaginative but it seems more like an

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:49.520 
imaginative but it seems more like an
excuse<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.910> make<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.210> popular<00:00:48.719> soundtrack<00:00:49.350> with
