00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.340
 the webcam is recording it but not the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:10.200
 jerk game this lobby looks like a 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.599
 stoned lobby at the Hon 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.400
 this lobby was so disgusted though 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.509
 this lobby is really bad they are 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.850
 too weak 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.840
 look they will still be 4 kg later I don't know 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.730
 how anyway I was thinking and who 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.769
 want to ask I was curious to see e 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.140
 big ass slut son like you have 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.320
 started to get interested in this way 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.170
 this lousy world of white snai 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 on youtube in general it was a lot 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.550
 it's not true that he gets a saw but I was 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.820
 very curious instead is my god brown jax 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.710
 really goodbye 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.539
 this is the best thing that has happened 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.579
 in the last decades on cod 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.770
 how interested you are in this world 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.329
 for example I want to say I mean now vi 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.879
 I tell the common how they are 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.579
 I arrived there because I was n't really 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.109
 sense of knowledge of the word 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.750
 and youtube is there I didn't know that 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.299
 there was also simply one 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.420
 platform to share videos 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.909
 then I went less as obviously 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.790
 happens during the visit to knowledge 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.740
 of certain brand new things such as 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.860
 aware of this cool wire 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.150
 the P 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.770
 but what do you do what to do and I don't 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.690
 I knew and I am in mind there is a youtube 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.970
 there is nothing to think about looking at 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.980
 things on youtube there is kind of a certain ho 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.370
 started is not that someone has me 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.460
 inspired, for example, I was 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.500
 very poorly exploited in one 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.420
 hallucinating way these have been ad 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.020
 example inspires everyone unfortunately from air 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.760
 ips 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.220
 that is me the first contagion I saw 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.320
 actually nyse was dawn of 0 I hope 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.690
 strongly also for you I enjoy with the 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.330
 turkish that you have seen that is 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.310
 know with the assembly because it is a 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.710
 large mounting piece especially for 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.280
 the times and then it seems to me that it was also one 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.410
 of the first montages with a research pvr is 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.660
 beautiful state more than entertained 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.149
 otherwise aidi caserta montages of 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.320
 wedges fact other fact Frischia made 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.320
 galvanize entertained while what 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.410
 He pushed me in a sense to try 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.090
 start playing with sniper up 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.360
 die up on cod 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.420
 it was actually to the reds I never have 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.330
 thought to try putting it to the test 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.580
 my skills and going around with the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.010
 sniper and see how many kills I did 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.870
 to give up some of it I will define these 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.670
 things so I never thought about it 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.730
 my whole life around would have been 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.980
 delayed but I never thought about it e 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.489
 with eclipse I started there 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.739
 bring a little bit to this world is 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.459
 world that obviously has expanded 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.110
 slowly through that is when I have 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.780
 started thinking about bringing when 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.730
 practically the klein trainer from the files 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.450
 clear on ps3 a clan that later 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.300
 they became the knights 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:16.310
 and maybe a name he already had 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:19.010
 more and they are practically accepted 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.620
 he says he remembers what was done 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.890
 all these things there is obviously not one 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.099
 saw, however, begins me in a certain sense 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.500
 to interest you would be cool to do it 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.180
 obviously they pull predatory hardware 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.250
 the cisu christ on the cross when me 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.810
 I arrived, of course, would be cool 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:42.590
 to do so is practically Candiano gone 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.250
 my uncle hit maker fuck you my mom 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.250
 that sucks 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.170
 job came the change the strange weapon 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.450
 with these first ideas I approached a little 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:01.800
 to want to register the best 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:05.450
 described in china and pushed me 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.730
 I bought and therefore it would interest me 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.680
 feel you momentarily feel like you 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.580
 you are interested in this world 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.769
 in general if rates after doing 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.299
 the flanker is not that you expect me to 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.800
 truth then write it in the comments 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:26.790
 here implemented in other comments because 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.860
 don't take it he felt my mother 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.260
 will speak sica so review many ugly 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.710
 the webcams today practically because that 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.650
 hair pulled behind a tactical pigtail for 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.990
 keep it all and fuck off we give of 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.820
 shit anyway I hope it is like 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.350
 in the video leave a layman a comment 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.210
 let me know if you also like having it 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.389
 she of the video and we give each other video
