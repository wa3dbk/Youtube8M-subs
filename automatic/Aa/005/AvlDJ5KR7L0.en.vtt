project<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.510> pitch<00:00:54.750> our<00:00:55.110> ideas<00:00:55.949> of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
project we want to pitch our ideas of

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.830 
project we want to pitch our ideas of
what<00:00:56.309> along<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> dark<00:00:56.879> should<00:00:57.059> be

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.510 

the<00:01:00.840> first<00:01:01.080> proposal<00:01:01.410> have<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.040> concept<00:01:02.370> of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the first proposal have the concept of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.700 
the first proposal have the concept of
the<00:01:02.670> game<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:03.090> maybe<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.199> bit<00:01:04.470> too

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the game was maybe a little bit too

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.140 
the game was maybe a little bit too
ambitious<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:06.230> innovative<00:01:07.230> and<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:08.460> that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
ambitious and to innovative and so that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.110 
ambitious and to innovative and so that
means<00:01:09.390> too<00:01:09.600> risky<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.080> producer<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.550> worked<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
means too risky for producer we worked I

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.400 
means too risky for producer we worked I
think<00:01:12.450> eight<00:01:12.810> month<00:01:13.400> making<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.670> full<00:01:14.970> design

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
think eight month making the full design

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.530 
think eight month making the full design
proving<00:01:16.410> that<00:01:16.619> trying<00:01:17.160> to<00:01:17.280> prove<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:18.270> we

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
proving that trying to prove that we

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.719 
proving that trying to prove that we
worry<00:01:18.990> about<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.290> make<00:01:19.410> it

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.359 

we<00:01:23.729> gave<00:01:23.939> all<00:01:24.210> our<00:01:24.240> hearts<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.990> got<00:01:25.200> Senate<00:01:25.619> in

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
we gave all our hearts and got Senate in

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.800 
we gave all our hearts and got Senate in
the<00:01:26.520> concept<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.119> said<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.450> what<00:01:27.689> we

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the concept and said this is what we

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.240 
the concept and said this is what we
believe<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.530> our<00:01:28.619> vision<00:01:28.890> what

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
believe and this is our vision what

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.520 
believe and this is our vision what
alone<00:01:29.520> should<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.810> such<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> few<00:01:31.259> months

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
alone should be but such a few months

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.859 
alone should be but such a few months
Atari<00:01:32.369> was<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.820> sure<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.240> were<00:01:33.390> able<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.689> make

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
Atari was not sure we were able to make

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.529 
Atari was not sure we were able to make
it<00:01:34.049> because<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.189> ambitious<00:01:35.450> when<00:01:36.450> you

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
it because it was so ambitious when you

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.590 
it because it was so ambitious when you
see<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> game<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.680> was<00:01:37.890> from<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.220> beginning

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
see the game this was from the beginning

original and at a certain time they said
well<00:01:50.520> maybe<00:01:50.670> yeah<00:01:51.509> guys<00:01:51.990> these<00:01:52.229> ideas<00:01:53.009> are

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
well maybe yeah guys these ideas are

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.440 
well maybe yeah guys these ideas are
great<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.459> maybe<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:54.000> bit<00:01:54.119> too<00:01:54.299> ambitious

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
great but maybe it's a bit too ambitious

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.320 
great but maybe it's a bit too ambitious
it's<00:01:55.110> maybe<00:01:55.679> it's<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.100> what<00:01:56.250> we<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:57.119> can

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
it's maybe it's not what we can it can

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.380 
it's maybe it's not what we can it can
be<00:01:57.479> realized<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.229> ice<00:01:58.350> when<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:59.060> actually<00:02:00.060> got

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
be realized and ice when we actually got

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.880 
be realized and ice when we actually got
killed<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.259> project<00:02:01.709> of<00:02:01.860> us

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.960 

the<00:02:05.460> decided<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.030> give<00:02:06.180> us<00:02:06.330> six<00:02:06.960> months<00:02:07.020> to

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
the decided to give us six months to

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.840 
the decided to give us six months to
give<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> try<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:09.810> made<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.289> prototype<00:02:10.950> we

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
give it a try so we made a prototype we

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.440 
give it a try so we made a prototype we
worked<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.300> i'ma<00:02:13.110> put<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:14.610> an<00:02:14.760> exercise<00:02:15.060> of

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
worked on i'ma put on an exercise of

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.000 
worked on i'ma put on an exercise of
making<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.430> small<00:02:17.430> piece<00:02:18.319> what<00:02:19.319> we<00:02:19.470> call<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
making a small piece what we call in the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.490 
making a small piece what we call in the
industry<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.550> vertical<00:02:20.970> slice<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.990> made<00:02:22.170> our

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
industry a vertical slice we made our

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.970 
industry a vertical slice we made our
first<00:02:22.830> prototype<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:24.240> were<00:02:24.390> able<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:25.020> have

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
first prototype and we were able to have

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.500 
first prototype and we were able to have
a<00:02:26.010> hero<00:02:26.610> able<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.570> run<00:02:28.530> jump<00:02:28.980> go<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> car<00:02:30.240> go

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
a hero able to run jump go in the car go

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.110 
a hero able to run jump go in the car go
out<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.020> car<00:02:31.230> use<00:02:31.920> every<00:02:32.489> object<00:02:32.670> around

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
out of the car use every object around

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.430 
out of the car use every object around
and<00:02:33.950> we<00:02:34.950> said<00:02:35.130> okay<00:02:35.310> now<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.000> can<00:02:36.330> be<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.690> food

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
and we said okay now we can be a food

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.250 
and we said okay now we can be a food
adventure<00:02:37.820> we've<00:02:38.820> worked<00:02:39.180> really<00:02:39.420> hard<00:02:39.690> we've
