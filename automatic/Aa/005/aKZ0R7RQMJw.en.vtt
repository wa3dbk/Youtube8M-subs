00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 At the end of July we are expecting a coming of 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.629
 age comedy in german cinemas the 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.220
 nothing to do with about the boy and 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.469
 Nevertheless we would like to look at the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.380
 trailer for bad girl 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.860
 it happened to your head with the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.860
 great thoughts 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:27.760
 did not the world you points in 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.170
 Last time maybe I should 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.170
 for a good idea 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.660
 does it try not to do so 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.190
 Could not you shit me? 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.150
 I did not think so 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.020
 that they have to explain to someone 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.580
 fucking good plan not 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.050
 works you did not want 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.890
 really 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.400
 actually I wanted to be severely disabled 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.260
 to survive 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.730
 My job is to see if yours 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.730
 family in the position is to around you 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.820
 and therefore I'm going to be a friend 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.760
 What's so bad about growing 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.460
 Saxony is infinitely embarrassing 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.130
 the psycho doc was after the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.800
 film music no longer there is dead 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.480
 do you already feel like you are 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.010
 not even you do not even have a minute 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.520
 used to me at least four times 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.520
 lying to 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.750
 hay - are you psycho drg wondering 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.590
 I do not think so at all 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.590
 I am a stupid nerd 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.210
 who already left there 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.710
 if one dies young then stays 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.880
 You can talk me dead forever 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 at least show it 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.070
 not necessarily trailer says extra 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.930
 the first half of it I find relatively 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.860
 lame but as soon as I then the music and 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.900
 there you will be a little bit 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.670
 fluffy has fled a bit more though 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.200
 has the feeling you are doing too much here 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.880
 at school and such comparisons 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.260
 then limp relatively fast though 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.670
 one films from German land 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.160
 but look how he is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.100
 built girl brings us nfp filmverleih 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.690
 expected from 23 july 2015 in 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.370
 German cinemas tell the story 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.780
 schall's story resembles her is 15 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.910
 years old she is aldi could actually 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.890
 be relatively happy but just the one 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.390
 transition from puberty to adult 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.220
 is there the question of the meaning of the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.660
 life and what you are actually there for 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.490
 and she comes quickly to her 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.350
 borders with the very special bond 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.430
 their parents do not really care 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.270
 belong to each other as it actually does 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.860
 should be 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.360
 Is she doing herself relatively hard and so are the 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.860
 Talk to your best friend 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.290
 are getting boring because they are 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.820
 always around the evenly superficial 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.739
 turn themes and that means for sound 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.780
 in a fit going on depressive mood 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.580
 out tries to kill himself but 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.959
 her project fails and she survives 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.320
 and her parents are not just shocked 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.030
 No 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.709
 From now on , she must also be psychiatric 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.720
 treatment while knowing a boy 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.430
 he is actually the ultimate nerd of the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.170
 school is and somehow then it stands there 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.610
 a little more and so gets that 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.500
 whole also a romantic impact 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.750
 and have a dramatic impact in the end 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.010
 We then do a drama if you want out 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.510
 German home where I completely honest 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.260
 The trainer does not have to say that 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.090
 really like 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.739
 but all the praising words and quotes 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.880
 from big pages and magazines 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.140
 ultimately within the trailer 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.459
 maybe also could cause 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.510
 that was different 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.500
 Look, maybe the trailer 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.180
 just so-so 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.799
 and the film can be a lot more because 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.299
 it's actually a relatively good one 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.950
 German character actor populated 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.000
 and especially heike makatsch actually 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.680
 also a fine hand if you 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.269
 In this country, he does not go in 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.370
 which citizen to search for what little say 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.110
 23 the unibody likes to see what 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.070
 you can really do that movie 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.900
 he almost senses that he is the big one 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.120
 Mainstream he will pick up something 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.140
 small fine and how has the film too 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.670
 so a bit is just a bit 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.140
 to leading when he is called bordeaux girl 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.340
 you just watch the movie about the boy 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.570
 exists that I think so then 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.340
 a bit critical if you have already 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.720
 But I see that direction 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.430
 I'm a little bit split over what 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.140
 a trailer likes to see the comments 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.700
 because I 'm through and trader check 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.290
 This thumb is a thumb there 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.299
 If that's the motto, let it stay 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.440
 not otherwise that you know there is 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.180
 a few left around me and 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.790
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course, at the latest 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.660
 a new video and by that time I hope 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.790
 here for weeks again 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.790
 of course on the 3rd
