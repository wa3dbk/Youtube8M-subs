00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.880

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.410

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.420

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.890
 below in the description box 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.140
 The first thing we are going to do is wash and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.870
 to dry the jalapeño peppers very well 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.760
 then we are going to split in half and 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.010
 we are going to remove everything from the center 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.660
 this is if you do not want them spicy 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.950
 but if you want them to be picoso 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.830
 you can leave some seeds 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.730
 then let's mix the cheese 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.010
 Philadelphia and grated cheese 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.430
 when we finish we will fill all the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.430

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:56.059

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.700
 an egg from there we are going to put them in the 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:04.940
 we immediately put them in the flour 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.320
 we were very good once again the 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.320
 let's go back to the egg 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.020
 and finally to the flour 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.880
 we make this my new process with the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.130
 rest of the chiles 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.619
 when we finish we put them in the refrigerator 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.619
 to stand for about 15 minutes 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.900
 remember that if you want your 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.100
 chilies become more spicy you can 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.170
 leave some seeds since they have passed 15 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.780
 minutes let's put the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.820
 chiles in the egg and from there we go to 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.820
 form them in the bread crumbled 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.230

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.750
 chiles with the ground bread we are going to put 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.550

 hairline that always an option for 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.200
