with me because either was too geeky or

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.650 
with me because either was too geeky or
took<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> lot<00:00:59.940> of<00:00:59.969> time<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> learn<00:01:00.300> how<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> fly

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
took a lot of time to learn how to fly

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.939 
took a lot of time to learn how to fly
these<00:01:00.780> things<00:01:01.050> he<00:01:01.170> crash<00:01:01.379> from<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> time

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
these things he crash from all the time

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.320 
these things he crash from all the time
and<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> was<00:01:03.960> really<00:01:04.080> surprised<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:06.030> how

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
quickly the the general consumer was

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.969 
quickly the the general consumer was
adopting<00:01:11.210> quadcopters<00:01:12.210> yes<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.200> there's<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
adopting quadcopters yes and there's a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.030 
adopting quadcopters yes and there's a
viral<00:01:14.549> sort<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.240> growth<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.320> awareness<00:01:16.890> and
