00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.319
 hello virtual studio hauston 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.200
 again with you tatyana general today with 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.170
 them my video again and tailors 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.089
 computer school at sea ​​channel soon 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.340
 it will be possible to call the branch ports 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:19.789
 computer school 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.250
 I get a lot of questions from people 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.939
 who plan to study at this school and 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.910
 think not to go you should not go and 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.519
 one of the main questions is whether it has 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.870
 meaning coming to school and studying there 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:38.600
 live or choose courses online 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.740
 ultimate as an apologist for system optimization 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.860
 learning as just a crazy fan 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.130
 self-study 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:50.600
 as a psychologist himself background as almost not 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:54.230
 held coaches and business coach i'm not 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.120
 I can get around this question side and I 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.010
 perhaps I will tell you my point of view 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:05.990
 for this moment when you drive to 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.910
 california learn you have mass 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.290
 advantages over 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.710
 online training 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.880
 let's start in order it's worth pretty 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:22.310
 significant money self-study and how 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.070
 most people we love to us 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.140
 Something somewhere back there was not pushing 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.020
 only carrot was ahead in sight 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.030
 wonderful new career but also that the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.890
 there that we are just pushing and 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.430
 says let 's let 's stop 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.010
 can't 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.479
 every time when we know that you're on 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.370
 This business has already spent such 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.590
 significant money you will not stop 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.100
 you once again not to leave you with a lecture 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.810
 once again do not yawn you will learn 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.619
 second important point is the effect 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.440
 presence 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.180
 you are there all the time you come to study you 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.310
 nothing distracts you go to lectures 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.950
 free time you read books you 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.320
 communicate with colleagues and you all the time 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.550
 immersed in the process it is much 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.040
 more effectively affects learning you 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.520
 learn the best you learn faster you 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.850
 immersed in the process the third moment is this 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.820
 the very environment in the affiliate school 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.560
 a lot of people are perfect 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.810
 diverse background and besides 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.410
 lectures besides teachers who 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.290
 also wonderful very cool everything 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.350
 offers available clear you can 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.180
 meet a lot of people who know from 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.150
 different areas here a little bit there 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.769
 a little bit and here it is the partnerships here 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.940
 this is mutual aid which 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.250
 present between lectures on lecture i 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.680
 would say that not 50 percent of that 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.019
 what I took out of school for example is 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.019
 just such from the exchange of experience 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.430
 another important point is of course 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.350
 same practice despite the fact that my 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.799
 the practice was not brilliant but how 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.870
 it says itself Masha fool 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.269
 for those especially those who just came to 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.010
 America who has no background 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.400
 and here who does not know how here 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.390
 everything is arranged it's just it's just a song 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.550
 bath nick 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.319
 dreams when you're even in free practice 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.930
 come you see how everything is in america 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.310
 how everything works here 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.940
 elementary some household daily 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.390
 dictionary is very cool and very important well 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.760
 of the minuses of course this is money even if 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.800
 do not say the cost of the most 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.990
 schooling because it's in 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.600
 principle to introduce qi into yourself and standing 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.239
 investment is very expensive to live in 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:41.550
 california or most recently found out 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.680
 about how much it costs now 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.540
 rent an apartment and live for example in 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.940
 one room together with someone there 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.880
 sounded figure 800 700 800 dollars 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.760
 we here for this money in houston have 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.620
 full-fledged good partner 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.090
 own use 1 to be even 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.340
 there it is just a california bed 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.050
 this is probably the only negative no well 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.120
 someone of course if it's a man 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.430
 burdened by family he cannot so 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.570
 probably leave for a long time too 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.460
 significant factor with regard to 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.609
 online learning 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:20.100
 This is only for those people who exactly 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.930
 know that they can motivate themselves 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.570
 they can organize themselves 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.380
 they know where to find the material they are not looking for 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.210
 excuses they are looking for opportunities 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.790
 enough premiere in those who have enough 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.340
 examples of people who pass 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:38.910
 online course perfectly found his job 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.250
 all we are doing well so all is well but I 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.200
 I know enough examples of people who 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.720
 after the online course came all the same 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.840
 still on a live course to california because 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.880
 that online learning again is only 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.940
 for those who know exactly what he rests 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.340
 will learn and will not wait for him 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.560
 everyone razaty put his head in this mess 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.020
 even if you were with me now 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.710
 opportunity and necessity I would again 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.230
 drove 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.260
 I really enjoyed living there 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.500
 months california legally and 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.480
 work not go to work learn by 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.580
 compared with the usual work after all this 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.790
 much more interesting easier and cooler 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.040
 live in california in this beautiful in 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.560
 this beautiful article would you again 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.470

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.320
 online learning or live learning 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.850
 weigh yourself decide yourself if not 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.580
 big money problems with 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.130
 the absence of a family of 6 months, I am all 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.880
 hands and feet for a lively training because 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:41.760
 what is great if there are any 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.230
 obstacles to this tune yourself to 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.010
 hard work 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:49.230
 take an online course everything will turn out in 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:52.200
 Internet is full of information, then,
