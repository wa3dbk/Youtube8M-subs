00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
to be honest is that the connector the

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.639 
to be honest is that the connector the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
towards cables that were compatible with

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.190 
towards cables that were compatible with
every<00:02:07.049> device<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.649> no<00:02:08.489> matter<00:02:08.899> it's<00:02:09.899> got<00:02:10.140> an

every device but no matter it's got an

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.290 
every device but no matter it's got an
awful<00:02:10.410> lot<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.560> other<00:02:10.679> things<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:10.979> make

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
awful lot of other things that make

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.610 
awful lot of other things that make
for<00:02:11.570> it<00:02:11.690> instead<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:14.570> has<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.750> double<00:02:15.110> flash<00:02:15.320> on

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
for it instead it has a double flash on

for it instead it has a double flash on
the<00:02:15.740> back<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.070> another<00:02:16.340> thing<00:02:16.820> that<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.060> wanted

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
the back is another thing that I wanted

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.880 
the back is another thing that I wanted
to<00:02:17.330> highlight<00:02:17.480> actually<00:02:18.020> which<00:02:18.440> should<00:02:18.710> let

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
to highlight actually which should let

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.050 
to highlight actually which should let
you<00:02:19.010> take<00:02:19.160> pictures<00:02:19.490> that<00:02:19.670> have<00:02:19.820> them

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
you take pictures that have them

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.690 
you take pictures that have them
slightly<00:02:20.330> less<00:02:20.600> harsh<00:02:20.870> shadows<00:02:21.140> on<00:02:21.560> them<00:02:21.740> but

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
slightly less harsh shadows on them but

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.670 
slightly less harsh shadows on them but
yeah<00:02:22.820> other<00:02:23.030> than<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.360> almost<00:02:24.200> everything

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
yeah other than that almost everything

lot<00:02:28.250> of<00:02:28.400> cosmetic<00:02:28.640> improvement<00:02:29.600> it<00:02:29.780> is<00:02:29.960> a

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
lot of cosmetic improvement it is a

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.070 
lot of cosmetic improvement it is a
better<00:02:30.290> phone<00:02:30.790> but<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.120> at<00:02:32.300> its<00:02:32.450> core<00:02:32.540> it's

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
better phone but but at its core it's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.260 
better phone but but at its core it's
