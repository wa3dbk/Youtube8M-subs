metal shavings off and then finish any
gouges<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> base<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.220> throw

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
gouges that are in the base so throw

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.070 
gouges that are in the base so throw
that<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.730> but<00:00:30.000> some<00:00:30.330> point<00:00:30.630> while<00:00:30.779> doing

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
that to you but some point while doing

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.479 
that to you but some point while doing
your<00:00:31.140> base<00:00:31.349> repair<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.890> want<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> fix<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
your base repair you want to fix the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.639 
your base repair you want to fix the
edges<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.059> basically<00:00:33.660> there's<00:00:33.930> two<00:00:33.989> steps<00:00:34.410> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
edges and basically there's two steps to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.970 
edges and basically there's two steps to
it<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.610> cleaning<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.930> flat<00:00:37.320> surface

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
it one is cleaning up the flat surface

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.350 
it one is cleaning up the flat surface
that's<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.489> parallel<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.059> your

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that's going to be parallel with your

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.240 
that's going to be parallel with your
base<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.800> we're<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> use

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
base and with that we're going to use

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
base and with that we're going to use
our<00:00:41.399> long<00:00:42.180> metal<00:00:42.510> file<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.460> then<00:00:44.460> create<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
our long metal file and then create a

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.590 
our long metal file and then create a
nice<00:00:45.600> surface<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.070> side<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:48.149> making

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
nice surface on the side that is making

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.450 
nice surface on the side that is making
that<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:48.960> angle<00:00:49.230> making<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.860> sharp<00:00:50.250> edge

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
that right angle making that sharp edge

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.029 
that right angle making that sharp edge
for<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.719> snowboard<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.260> catch<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
for your your snowboard to catch on the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.450 
for your your snowboard to catch on the
surface<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.090> snow<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.690> hardpack<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:55.860> am

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
surface of the snow on the hardpack I am

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.319 
surface of the snow on the hardpack I am
using<00:00:56.670> two<00:00:56.879> dakine<00:00:57.710> edged<00:00:58.710> sharpener<00:00:59.340> this

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
using two dakine edged sharpener this

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.399 
using two dakine edged sharpener this
one<00:01:00.570> supports<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.550> 90-degree<00:01:02.550> edge<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.750> an<00:01:03.930> 88

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
one supports a 90-degree edge or an 88

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.289 
one supports a 90-degree edge or an 88
degree<00:01:04.799> edge<00:01:05.010> basically<00:01:05.729> there's<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
degree edge basically there's just a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.660 
degree edge basically there's just a
little<00:01:06.570> more<00:01:06.780> lift<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:07.860> side<00:01:08.159> or<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
little more lift on one side or the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.450 
little more lift on one side or the
other<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.479> changes<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:10.320> angle<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
other so that it changes the angle that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.700 
other so that it changes the angle that
that<00:01:11.790> file<00:01:12.270> sits<00:01:12.720> against<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.260> edge<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.530> your

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
that file sits against the edge of your

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.550 
that file sits against the edge of your
board<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.250> use<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> 88<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
board I use it on the 88 just so I get a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.640 
board I use it on the 88 just so I get a
little<00:01:17.130> bit<00:01:17.369> more<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.020> little<00:01:19.020> sharper<00:01:19.500> edge

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
little bit more of a little sharper edge

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.149 
little bit more of a little sharper edge
a<00:01:19.680> little<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.189> bite<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.299> as<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.509> set<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> down

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
a little more bite so as I set it down

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.969 
a little more bite so as I set it down
it's<00:01:23.159> gonna<00:01:23.400> hold<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.420> file<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> makes<00:01:25.770> an

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
it's gonna hold this file so it makes an

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.899 
it's gonna hold this file so it makes an
88<00:01:26.520> degree<00:01:27.000> angle<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.950> says<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.340> worked<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
88 degree angle and says I worked that

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.480 
88 degree angle and says I worked that
it's<00:01:30.210> gonna<00:01:30.390> make<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.900> sharp<00:01:31.259> edge<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.890> so

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
it's gonna make that sharp edge and so

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.130 
it's gonna make that sharp edge and so
it's<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.939> two<00:01:33.119> steps<00:01:33.390> flatten<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
it's really the two steps flatten it and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.350 
it's really the two steps flatten it and
then<00:01:34.500> get<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.740> edge<00:01:34.950> I'll<00:01:35.340> move<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> camera

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
then get the edge I'll move the camera

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.359 
then get the edge I'll move the camera
and<00:01:36.659> show<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.229> bit<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.710> how<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:37.950> sharp

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and show you a little bit of how I sharp

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.679 
and show you a little bit of how I sharp
on<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.640> edges<00:01:43.759> all<00:01:44.759> right<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.240> make<00:01:45.509> this

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
on my edges all right so to make this

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.230 
on my edges all right so to make this
flat<00:01:45.960> surface<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.649> want<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.009> hold<00:01:47.159> your<00:01:47.460> file

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
flat surface you want to hold your file

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.289 
flat surface you want to hold your file
about<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.350> parallel<00:01:49.829> as<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
about as parallel as you can get it and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.609 
about as parallel as you can get it and
just<00:01:51.600> work<00:01:51.869> along<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.439> edge<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:54.619> anything

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
just work along that edge and anything

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.450 
just work along that edge and anything
that's<00:01:55.770> lifted<00:01:56.189> up<00:01:57.409> you'll<00:01:58.409> feel<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.070> your

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
that's lifted up you'll feel it you your

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.450 
that's lifted up you'll feel it you your
file<00:02:00.180> will<00:02:00.509> catch<00:02:00.780> against

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
file will catch against

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:32.240 
file will catch against
and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:03:30.930 

[Music]

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.580
