00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.080
 and now the ghosts of percy 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.550
 and every year the day of the accident 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.220
 run again as warning the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.470
 others and dips the opening 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.920
 trembling like a soul 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.540
 to see if what are you talking about the train 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.020
 ghost nor machinist saw it last night 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.540
 they did not ask show anymore and tobey I did not 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.300
 he said and I tremble the wheels of only 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.230
 think it or said thomas you're a 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.230
 small locomotive 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.640
 Tomás did not believe what you told me 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.309
 about the ghost and koppers and the morning 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.560
 next the machinist laughed 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.000
 It was not just a fantastic story about 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:14.380
 ghosts if you felt disillusioned 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.380
 That night he returned from the port 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.500
 to see if he knew where he was even in 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.399
 the darkness the crossing of the farm of 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.399
 crowe and just missing 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.270
 he liked to run the roads at night 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.260
 they went down and the lights of the signals 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 they shone well green 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.540
 but a broken car with sacks was waiting for him 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.350
 of same lime the farmer had gone to 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.350
 seek help 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.070
 if he smashed the car and the sacks 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.659
 they went flying everywhere 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.430
 let's see if he left snorting 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.030
 immediately to the next port 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.030
 of signals 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.990
 Percy's machinist explained what 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.390
 had happened I'll take care of it said the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.270
 saves day but better clean persie or the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.210
 people will think that it is a ghost 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.850
 to see if he laughed let's realize that 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.380
 I am a ghost, we like tomás a 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.670
 see if he keeps saying that I am a 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.470
 small and silly locomotive 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.470
 he did not promise to help us 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.980
 Thomas were not lubricating for the 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.310
 night train 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.970
 so he had a following cry I saw poor 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.220
 locomotive exclaimed tomás or not that 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.019
 means that I'll be late already 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.739
 cleared the tracks so you could 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.690
 happen but something worse happened like this 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.720
 live to the point I can not wait all the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.090
 night I just saw something it seemed like 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.600
 percy's ghost and said he was coming towards 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.700
 here to warn us 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.390
 and who cares do not be afraid 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.390
 toby 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.849
 let me go past the base no 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:35.050
 you will have to go through the smoke of 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:38.790
 my chimney to blow is to blow and push 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.790
 and your ropes knock down 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.160
 my god exclaimed tomás is doing 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.510
 late I had not realized I have to 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.510
 go look for him 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.239
 when you return, it was morning 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.340
 where were you wondering toby good said 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.930
 thomas I thought I would be sad for 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.659
 Chase 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.019
 I did not want to bother you and shed 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.019
 the vans 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.740
 I can not stop, I have to go 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.920
 to see a car for a problem with a 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.920
 train 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.090
 to see if he was not tired after his 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.950
 adventure and he was having fun 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.940
 very much 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.580
 I had heard everything good, good, what did 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.800
 It seems 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.830
 anyone would say that our friend tomás 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.830
 he was just a ghost he laughed 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.560
 yes 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.800

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.720

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.370
 and you take 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.370
 no longer 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.370
 we have 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.180
 songs 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.180

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:10.550
 in brands 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.770
