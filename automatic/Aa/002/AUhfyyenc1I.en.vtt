 Now I want to answer the questions of 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.930
 people is the first question 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:55.729
 asked by many people observes that 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.979

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.960

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.700

 the best place to meet is going to be there 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.560
 and this brings me to the second point that I 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.739
 I wanted to talk to you guys at ms g4. 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.780
 rules of type b hip steal vehicles from 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.160
 enemy none of these rules do 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.060
 you can steal a vehicle 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.060
 enemy 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.130
 you can do rap and everything and it is 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.230
 This is what I just like to play there. 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.510
 only lately you have a lot of player 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.099
 crying throw it when I say cry 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.060
 I want to say that this type of player 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.950
 which complains 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.290
 everything that keeps on calling the others from camp 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.150
 that was called garbage is calling the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.819
 other hackers this is already getting 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.880
 boring man only because because there it is 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.530
 allowed b hip then I stay there from the base 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.480
 the same bush of the helicopter killed 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.640
 pilot already taken fifth at the base the bush 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.950
 farm in the delta who is mad I kill 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.930
 who appeared in my sight the bush but 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.870
 Then the guys start crying. 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.400
 finally with the bec reilly shuai in the inter 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.040
 garbage champ I do not know that I do not know that she 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.330
 It's a damn cry. 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.090
 and that's what I wanted to talk 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.390
 I think the following I play in msg 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.739
 4 because it's my style of play I like 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.230
 to play servers that do not have this 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.940
 rule because I find this rule silly 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.000
 maybe I think this is why 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.220
 listening to bf2 I played in 1942 I played 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.190
 a lot but I've played more clearance 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.950
 f2 and I played a lot there they serve us 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.380
 land and does not serve the land my friend was 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.540
 under this hype it was allowed very ripieno 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.120
 bf2 for those who do not know well when you 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.130
 get into base foe foot on ps3 does not give 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.840
 because when you reach the enemy base it is 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.940
 of the company out of combat 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.320
 but already on the 29th of April afi two of the only thug 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.329
 for both teams 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.070
 that is, the two teams can achieve 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.750
 exactly in the same location 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.700
 so friend who was on the ship 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.560
 freighter you catch a helicopter in the 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.720
 time they were in the head 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.090
 You got a jet saw jackson dropping 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.640
 of dues as will be people within the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.769
 ship hidden there above those 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.470
 wrong in the life of the masts and 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.910
 Nice to discuss antitank of 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.310
 bazooka destroy helicopter discover and 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.019
 destroy the jet destroy everything then 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.609
 student had crying 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.620
 if you had no strategy or you 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.870
 I had to leave the base face 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.180
 I remember that I left the base swimming, I want to 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.709
 leave the ship swimming to be able to arrive 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.840
 until a flag a flag that the team 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.880
 will be because depending on how level 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.350
 the team was much stronger everything 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.239
 get out of the helicopter that does not 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.400
 I could get out of jets is no way 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.810
 which is already scene in the way dying 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.970
 That when they got robbed the vehicles 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.979
 I left it alone in the boat for you, right? 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.080
 He said put your foot base 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.330
 marquinhos being that sometimes until the 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.550
 boat they stole twice then 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.840
 student was a legal tool if 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.320
 you do not play together with their 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.889
 time you saw but in the bf3 guy has like 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.810
 there have been many 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.180
 on good monkey - I think of all the 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.509
 servers that exist 80% of 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.060
 servers do not allow base hype 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:53.639
 So man I try to find server that 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.949
 It's hard though, but I 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.180
 I try when finally to shun in the case 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.800
 From msg 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.199
 Dude, I'm going to play people crying. 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.439
 Complaining of goods rip my opinion 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.509
 People do not like to see this guy hype. 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:08.279
 80% servers do not allow face between 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.529
 others and pain but can enter the 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:12.599
 server that allows goods and staff and 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.490
 keep crying because taking b hip face 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.069
 to me it's the same as you in a 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.590
 show house where you just roll funk you 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.479
 mobile phone that was the one of funk arrives there and stays 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.539
 Complaining to this very bad place only 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.550
 play funk and start rubbish I found that 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.620
 This guy only sings fucking talks seriously 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.710
 I do not even care, then guys 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.719
 vote for you here my opinion 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.919
 for those who think that players should 

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:37.500
 enter this type of server that 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:39.599
 allows br allows everything but do not 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.550
 because if you do at the hub everything is very clear 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.710
 Your opinion will not disagree, I will not. 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.909
 try to explain not your opinion 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.919
 and I respect everybody's opinion 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.110
 That's why I know you guys are 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:52.409
 giving only my opinion and in my 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.969
 bf3 opinion nor should it be almost forbidden 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.800
 replicate because number 3 is easy 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:58.110
 too much to prevent a very rapid era 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.810
 all in an antiaircraft mobile snack bar 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.969
 indestructible fix fucking antiaircraft f2 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.830
 fixed for a little help of jet 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:06.689
 cabot era was already destroyed 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.580
 if they had attacked the boot imagine that 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.139
 that too or before you come in 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.089
 in the helicopter that is saidinha and 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.490
 enter again pretend you are going to enter 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:16.169
 Come in then guys, it's just an opinion. 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.909
 You need to be upset with me, just mine. 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.379
 My opinion is that I would like 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.629
 a lot of sign up being commented 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.430
