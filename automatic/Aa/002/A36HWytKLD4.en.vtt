really close to chyron so in
relationships<00:03:25.520> there's<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.820> lot<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.090> healing

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
relationships there's a lot of healing

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.430 
taking place a lot of figuring out a lot
of<00:03:29.030> going<00:03:29.270> behind<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.660> curtain<00:03:30.050> a<00:03:30.140> lot<00:03:30.320> of

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
of going behind the curtain a lot of

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.430 
of going behind the curtain a lot of
figuring<00:03:30.860> out<00:03:31.010> how<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.250> really<00:03:31.550> feel<00:03:32.000> and

Venus is in a really good placement

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.000 
Venus is in a really good placement
right<00:03:34.910> now<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.390> with<00:03:35.720> Jupiter<00:03:36.320> I<00:03:36.500> think<00:03:36.920> it's

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
right now and with Jupiter I think it's

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.980 
right now and with Jupiter I think it's
important<00:03:37.460> for<00:03:37.580> us<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.730> remain<00:03:38.120> positive<00:03:38.420> to

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
important for us to remain positive to

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.170 
important for us to remain positive to
remain<00:03:39.260> open<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:40.040> all<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.280> options<00:03:40.640> at<00:03:41.090> the

a very hard aspect of a big cardinal

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.320 
a very hard aspect of a big cardinal
cross<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:00.770> it's<00:05:00.919> now<00:05:01.100> really<00:05:01.880> coming<00:05:02.180> off<00:05:02.300> of

cross and it's now really coming off of
its<00:05:02.600> opposition<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.230> Mars<00:05:03.500> so<00:05:04.340> mentally<00:05:04.850> I

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
its opposition to Mars so mentally I

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.290 
its opposition to Mars so mentally I
think

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
think

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.999 
think
today<00:05:05.720> we're<00:05:05.960> going<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.169> get<00:05:06.289> clearer<00:05:06.740> and

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
today we're going to get clearer and

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.379 
today we're going to get clearer and
clearer<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.490> I<00:05:07.550> think<00:05:07.789> our<00:05:07.909> minds<00:05:08.180> are

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
clearer and I think our minds are

getting clearer and I think

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.469 
getting clearer and I think

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
really going deep down and especially

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.459 
really going deep down and especially
the<00:05:46.280> last<00:05:46.430> 48<00:05:46.909> hours<00:05:46.940> and<00:05:47.599> let's<00:05:47.990> actually<00:05:48.199> add

it<00:05:48.590> to<00:05:48.680> 72<00:05:49.190> hours<00:05:49.520> because<00:05:49.669> of<00:05:49.789> the<00:05:49.940> Eclipse<00:05:50.389> I

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:50.629

think that there's been a lot that has

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.610 
think that there's been a lot that has
surged<00:05:52.669> a<00:05:52.940> lot<00:05:53.180> that<00:05:53.389> is<00:05:53.479> breaking<00:05:53.900> up<00:05:54.050> but<00:05:54.590> a
