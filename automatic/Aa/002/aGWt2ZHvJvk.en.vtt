00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
like that the basic idea is this we as

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.679 
like that the basic idea is this we as
youtubers<00:00:22.439> upgrade<00:00:22.949> our<00:00:22.980> systems<00:00:23.689> whenever

we can whenever we can afford to which

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.279 
we can whenever we can afford to which
means<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.090> sometimes<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.960> end<00:00:27.990> up<00:00:28.230> with

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
means that sometimes we end up with

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.640 
means that sometimes we end up with
things<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.720> extra<00:00:30.720> webcams<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.349> we're<00:00:31.470> not

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
wouldn't it be really nice to be able to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.869 
wouldn't it be really nice to be able to
pass<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.989> down<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.920> somebody<00:00:44.280> who<00:00:44.430> could<00:00:44.640> use
