still have that pizza leftover and it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.240 
still have that pizza leftover and it
barely<00:01:41.100> fits<00:01:41.640> me<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.479> I'd<00:01:43.259> used<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:43.680> my

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
barely fits me that I'd used my my

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.240 
barely fits me that I'd used my my
skills<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:46.259> figure<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:46.649> how<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.829> get<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.130> on

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
skills to figure out how to get it on

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.679 
skills to figure out how to get it on
there<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.729> originally<00:01:48.360> headed<00:01:48.600> this

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
there because I originally headed this

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.289 
there because I originally headed this
way<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.140> was<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.649> he'll<00:01:49.890> never<00:01:50.189> work<00:01:50.520> well

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
way I was like he'll never work well

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.819 
way I was like he'll never work well
over<00:01:51.689> work<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.560> way<00:01:52.710> they

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
over work and that was like a way they

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.440 
over work and that was like a way they
can<00:01:52.979> turn<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> sideways<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:54.270> we're<00:01:54.360> gonna

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
can turn it sideways so now we're gonna

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
can turn it sideways so now we're gonna
eat<00:01:54.600> some<00:01:54.750> pizza<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.380> that's<00:01:56.280> not<00:01:56.430> gonna<00:01:56.520> be

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
eat some pizza and that's not gonna be

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.770 
eat some pizza and that's not gonna be
dinner<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.090> should<00:01:57.210> we<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.570> dinner
