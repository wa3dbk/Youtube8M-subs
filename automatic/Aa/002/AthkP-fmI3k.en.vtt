is we've got we've got a dress on at

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.080 
is we've got we've got a dress on at
this<00:01:39.600> end<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.470> western<00:01:41.250> gales<00:01:41.490> down<00:01:41.880> this

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
this end and and western gales down this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.929 
this end and and western gales down this
end<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.840> having<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> hotel<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.460> close<00:01:44.729> to

end I think having the hotel so close to
the<00:01:45.060> town<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.630> also<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.770> important

it's going to be very exciting they're
all<00:05:07.630> sort<00:05:08.139> of<00:05:08.259> finish<00:05:08.560> or<00:05:08.800> we'll<00:05:09.280> be<00:05:09.400> starting

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
all sort of finish or we'll be starting

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.510 
all sort of finish or we'll be starting
and<00:05:10.240> completing<00:05:10.780> around<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.169> same<00:05:11.380> time

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
and completing around the same time

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.430 
and completing around the same time
project<00:05:12.520> like<00:05:12.669> this<00:05:12.699> if<00:05:13.539> from<00:05:13.870> start<00:05:14.259> to

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
project like this if from start to

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.249 
project like this if from start to
finish<00:05:14.770> takes<00:05:15.130> three<00:05:15.580> to<00:05:15.729> four<00:05:15.970> years<00:05:16.270> which

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:17.259 
finish takes three to four years which

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:18.689 
finish takes three to four years which
is<00:05:17.380> a<00:05:17.409> long<00:05:17.710> time<00:05:18.009> a<00:05:18.039> lot<00:05:18.250> of<00:05:18.310> people<00:05:18.580> don't

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
is a long time a lot of people don't

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.999 
is a long time a lot of people don't
really<00:05:18.819> understand<00:05:19.539> you<00:05:20.319> know<00:05:20.349> it's<00:05:20.620> not<00:05:20.740> just

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
really understand you know it's not just

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.790 
really understand you know it's not just
about<00:05:21.130> getting<00:05:21.690> permission<00:05:22.690> or<00:05:23.020> engineers<00:05:23.560> or

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
about getting permission or engineers or

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.439 
about getting permission or engineers or
signing<00:05:24.130> agreements<00:05:24.669> there's<00:05:24.849> a<00:05:24.909> lot<00:05:25.150> of<00:05:25.180> work

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
signing agreements there's a lot of work

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:28.050 
signing agreements there's a lot of work
and<00:05:25.719> it<00:05:25.810> takes<00:05:26.020> a<00:05:26.110> long<00:05:26.289> time<00:05:26.319> and<00:05:26.879> I've<00:05:27.879> been

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
and it takes a long time and I've been

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.850 
and it takes a long time and I've been
through<00:05:28.210> the<00:05:28.330> process<00:05:28.479> before<00:05:28.900> so<00:05:29.319> so<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:29.710> know

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
through the process before so so I know

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.249 
through the process before so so I know
I<00:05:30.219> know<00:05:30.340> that's<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:30.759> case<00:05:30.909> so<00:05:31.599> the

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
I know that's the case so the

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.020 
I know that's the case so the
environment<00:05:32.770> economically<00:05:33.520> will<00:05:33.759> be<00:05:33.849> quite

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
environment economically will be quite

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.610 
environment economically will be quite
different<00:05:34.240> when<00:05:34.479> we<00:05:34.630> complete<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.199> project

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
different when we complete the project

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.620 
different when we complete the project
but<00:05:36.190> now<00:05:36.370> is<00:05:36.550> definitely<00:05:36.729> the<00:05:36.969> time<00:05:37.180> to<00:05:37.210> start

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
but now is definitely the time to start

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.749 
but now is definitely the time to start
it<00:05:37.810> and<00:05:38.069> from<00:05:39.069> what<00:05:39.219> I<00:05:39.250> saw<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.550> other

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
it and from what I saw the other

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.689 
it and from what I saw the other
projects<00:05:40.330> that<00:05:40.479> are<00:05:40.569> going<00:05:40.719> on<00:05:40.960> I<00:05:41.169> think<00:05:42.009> Irvin

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
projects that are going on I think Irvin

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.839 
projects that are going on I think Irvin
Baker<00:05:43.560> in<00:05:44.560> for<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.830> big<00:05:44.979> surprise<00:05:45.009> and<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.699> rest

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
Baker in for a big surprise and the rest

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:46.800 
Baker in for a big surprise and the rest
of<00:05:45.940> heirship<00:05:46.240> could<00:05:46.360> be<00:05:46.449> in<00:05:46.509> for<00:05:46.539> a<00:05:46.690> surprise

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
of heirship could be in for a surprise

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.420 
of heirship could be in for a surprise
when<00:05:47.050> it<00:05:47.319> comes<00:05:47.529> out<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.860> other<00:05:47.889> side<00:05:48.099> of<00:05:48.310> the

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
when it comes out the other side of the

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.420 
when it comes out the other side of the
recession<00:05:48.759> if<00:05:49.659> all<00:05:49.840> of<00:05:49.870> these<00:05:50.139> eggs<00:05:50.650> come<00:05:51.130> to

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
recession if all of these eggs come to

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.630 
recession if all of these eggs come to
hatch<00:05:51.880> at<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.210> same<00:05:52.389> time
