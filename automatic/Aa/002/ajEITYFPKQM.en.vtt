00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
little bit of slack you don't need to

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.880 
little bit of slack you don't need to
you<00:02:42.489> don't<00:02:42.519> need<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:43.019> yank<00:02:44.019> it<00:02:44.170> totally<00:02:44.650> tight

you don't need to yank it totally tight

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.190 
you don't need to yank it totally tight
or<00:02:45.040> anything<00:02:45.250> because<00:02:45.670> it's<00:02:45.970> it's<00:02:46.660> easier<00:02:46.989> to

or anything because it's it's easier to

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.970 
or anything because it's it's easier to
see<00:02:48.150> where<00:02:49.150> your<00:02:49.420> next<00:02:49.630> bar<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.230> where<00:02:50.799> your

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
see where your next bar is where your

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.340 
see where your next bar is where your
next<00:02:51.160> bar<00:02:51.400> to<00:02:51.610> go<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.000> pick<00:02:52.299> up<00:02:52.330> is<00:02:52.660> if<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.140> can

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
next bar to go and pick up is if you can

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.229 
next bar to go and pick up is if you can
see<00:02:53.590> what<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.920> last<00:02:54.100> one<00:02:54.370> was<00:02:54.549> so<00:02:54.790> there's<00:02:55.000> my

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
see what the last one was so there's my

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.130 
see what the last one was so there's my
last<00:02:55.480> one<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.880> next<00:02:58.150> one<00:02:58.390> is<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:58.569> above

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
last one so the next one is just above

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:10.039 
last one so the next one is just above
it<00:02:59.489> pick<00:03:00.489> up<00:03:00.670> that<00:03:00.880> guy<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.860> now<00:03:06.040> over<00:03:06.400> here

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.250 

it's<00:03:11.049> difficult<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.890> see<00:03:12.130> with<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:14.049> same

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
it's difficult to see with the same

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.930 
it's difficult to see with the same
color<00:03:14.530> yarn<00:03:14.769> here<00:03:15.100> but<00:03:15.840> there's<00:03:16.980> my<00:03:17.980> next<00:03:18.430> bar

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
color yarn here but there's my next bar

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.949 
color yarn here but there's my next bar
take<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.170> guy<00:03:20.380> up<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:22.209> basically<00:03:22.690> you're

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
take that guy up so basically you're

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.900 
take that guy up so basically you're
just<00:03:22.989> zigzagging<00:03:23.769> back<00:03:23.950> and<00:03:24.400> forth<00:03:24.640> between

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
just zigzagging back and forth between

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.330 
just zigzagging back and forth between
this<00:03:25.810> bar<00:03:26.109> that<00:03:26.350> bar<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.739> bar<00:03:26.920> that<00:03:26.950> bar<00:03:27.250> you

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
this bar that bar this bar that bar you

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.650 
this bar that bar this bar that bar you
just<00:03:27.640> want<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.820> make<00:03:27.940> sure<00:03:27.970> that<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.359> get<00:03:28.540> the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
just want to make sure that you get the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.530 
just want to make sure that you get the
corresponding<00:03:28.959> bars<00:03:31.290> because<00:03:32.290> if<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:33.540> skip

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
corresponding bars because if you skip

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.599 
corresponding bars because if you skip
some<00:03:34.840> on<00:03:34.989> this<00:03:35.260> one<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:35.859> pick<00:03:36.160> up<00:03:36.310> every

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
some on this one and you pick up every

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.000 
some on this one and you pick up every
one<00:03:36.760> on<00:03:36.880> this<00:03:37.090> one<00:03:37.269> you're<00:03:37.930> knitting<00:03:38.230> you're

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
one on this one you're knitting you're

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.849 
one on this one you're knitting you're
seaming<00:03:39.430> is<00:03:39.549> going<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.820> be<00:03:40.090> off<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.530> this<00:03:41.680> will

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
seaming is going to be off and this will

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.530 
seaming is going to be off and this will
start<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.160> pucker<00:03:42.459> up<00:03:42.579> and<00:03:42.820> it'll<00:03:43.030> be<00:03:43.120> messy

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
start to pucker up and it'll be messy

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.180 
start to pucker up and it'll be messy
and<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.980> once<00:03:45.130> you've<00:03:45.280> got<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.459> few<00:03:45.959> seamed<00:03:47.190> you

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
and so once you've got a few seamed you

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.039 
and so once you've got a few seamed you
can<00:03:48.400> do<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.670> magic<00:03:49.030> which<00:03:49.239> is<00:03:49.390> giving<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.959> a

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
can do the magic which is giving it a

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.460 
can do the magic which is giving it a
little<00:03:50.200> tug<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.829> it<00:03:50.950> zips<00:03:51.430> up<00:03:52.260> just<00:03:53.260> zips

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
little tug and it zips up just zips

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.630 
little tug and it zips up just zips
right<00:03:53.590> zips<00:03:54.310> right<00:03:54.400> up<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.090> closes<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.950> then

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
right zips right up and closes and then

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.490 
right zips right up and closes and then
I<00:03:57.970> usually<00:03:58.540> seem<00:03:58.989> about<00:03:59.230> five<00:03:59.500> or<00:03:59.680> six<00:03:59.859> before

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
I usually seem about five or six before

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.860 
I usually seem about five or six before
before<00:04:02.500> I<00:04:02.530> close<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:03.040> up<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:04.299> then<00:04:04.569> just<00:04:04.600> keep

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
before I close it up and then just keep

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:18.440 
before I close it up and then just keep
going<00:04:05.910> so<00:04:09.000> one<00:04:10.000> bar<00:04:10.380> here<00:04:11.380> one<00:04:11.739> bar<00:04:12.040> there

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:26.900 

then<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:19.600> accidentally<00:04:20.410> lose<00:04:20.650> your<00:04:21.010> needle

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.140 

mmm

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
mmm

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.480 
mmm
once<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.900> get<00:04:29.080> into<00:04:29.260> the<00:04:29.500> swing<00:04:29.680> of<00:04:29.919> it<00:04:30.070> you

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
once you get into the swing of it you

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.670 
once you get into the swing of it you
can<00:04:30.669> see<00:04:30.880> where<00:04:31.090> your<00:04:31.300> where<00:04:31.960> your<00:04:32.139> seeming

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
can see where your where your seeming

can see where your where your seeming
yarn<00:04:32.980> has<00:04:33.250> come<00:04:33.490> out<00:04:33.669> of<00:04:33.940> this<00:04:34.180> guy<00:04:34.419> you<00:04:35.350> can

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
yarn has come out of this guy you can

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.740 
yarn has come out of this guy you can
just<00:04:35.800> go<00:04:35.919> kind<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.460> right<00:04:36.760> above<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.419> with<00:04:37.570> your

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
just go kind of right above it with your

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.810 
just go kind of right above it with your
needle<00:04:38.020> you<00:04:38.110> don't<00:04:38.290> have<00:04:38.470> to<00:04:38.650> bother<00:04:39.340> spending

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
all that time tugging and searching you

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.800 
all that time tugging and searching you
can<00:04:42.370> kind<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.580> just<00:04:42.639> go<00:04:42.910> in<00:04:43.120> right<00:04:43.330> above<00:04:43.630> it

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
can kind of just go in right above it

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.460 
can kind of just go in right above it
and<00:04:44.020> if<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:44.970> dive<00:04:45.970> into<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:47.200> ditch
