for<00:01:03.079> one<00:01:03.229> of<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.379> bearings<00:01:03.739> inside<00:01:03.949> or<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.580> I

00:01:04.779 --> 00:01:04.789 
for one of the bearings inside or the I

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:06.490 
for one of the bearings inside or the I
forget<00:01:05.149> what<00:01:05.269> exactly<00:01:05.750> it<00:01:05.840> does<00:01:05.869> but<00:01:06.200> it's<00:01:06.350> or

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
oil pan underneath open the fill plug to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.900 
oil pan underneath open the fill plug to
let<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:25.970> drain<00:01:27.010> make<00:01:28.010> sure<00:01:28.160> you<00:01:28.700> use<00:01:28.880> a

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
let it drain make sure you use a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.020 
let it drain make sure you use a
screwdriver<00:01:29.270> wide<00:01:29.810> enough<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.580> cover<00:01:31.580> most<00:01:31.850> of

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
screwdriver wide enough to cover most of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:46.730 
screwdriver wide enough to cover most of
it

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.459 

well<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.400> not<00:01:47.550> actually<00:01:47.910> that<00:01:47.940> bad

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:49.469 
well it's not actually that bad

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:51.550 
well it's not actually that bad
looks<00:01:50.039> like<00:01:50.219> it<00:01:50.310> was<00:01:50.429> just<00:01:50.520> recently<00:01:50.729> done

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
looks like it was just recently done

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.910 
looks like it was just recently done
maybe<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:52.740> recently<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:54.469> nevertheless<00:01:55.469> does

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
maybe not recently but nevertheless does

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.270 
maybe not recently but nevertheless does
not<00:01:56.130> look<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.310> bad<00:01:57.590> it's<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:58.950> milky

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
not look that bad it's not really milky

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.870 
not look that bad it's not really milky
or<00:01:59.369> anything

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
or anything

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
or anything
well<00:02:00.810> that's<00:02:00.960> draining<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.560> go<00:02:01.649> ahead

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
well that's draining you can go ahead

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.359 
well that's draining you can go ahead
and<00:02:01.950> open<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.250> top<00:02:02.459> plug<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.920> know<00:02:07.950> say<00:02:08.220> is

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and open this top plug you know say is

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.960 
and open this top plug you know say is
like<00:02:08.549> take<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.879> out<00:02:10.549> it's<00:02:11.549> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> start

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
like take this out it's going to start

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:26.420 
like take this out it's going to start
draining<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.330> faster

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.979 

I'm<00:02:27.030> also<00:02:27.239> gonna<00:02:27.510> tilt<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.959> outboard<00:02:28.379> down

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
I'm also gonna tilt the outboard down

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.270 
I'm also gonna tilt the outboard down
just<00:02:30.989> enough<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.379> collect<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.709> oil<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:32.069> here

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
just enough to collect the oil in here

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.099 
just enough to collect the oil in here
because<00:02:32.400> my<00:02:32.640> drains<00:02:32.969> more<00:02:33.390> towards<00:02:33.689> the<00:02:33.840> front

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
because my drains more towards the front

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.699 
because my drains more towards the front
so<00:02:35.780> I'm<00:02:36.780> gonna<00:02:36.900> go<00:02:36.989> ahead<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.439> got<00:02:37.650> to

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
so I'm gonna go ahead and do that got to

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.449 
so I'm gonna go ahead and do that got to
put<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.890> camera<00:02:38.129> down<00:02:38.159> there<00:02:40.250> now<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.310> can

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
put the camera down there now you can

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.259 
put the camera down there now you can
see<00:02:41.579> when<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.760> have<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.879> draining<00:02:42.269> properly<00:02:44.269> if

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
see when you have a draining properly if

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.789 
see when you have a draining properly if
it's<00:02:45.450> another<00:02:45.659> outboard<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.409> can<00:02:46.530> see<00:02:46.680> all

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
it's another outboard you can see all

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.479 
it's another outboard you can see all
the<00:02:46.889> contaminants<00:02:47.489> coming<00:02:47.909> out<00:02:49.159> it<00:02:50.159> could<00:02:50.370> be

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
the contaminants coming out it could be

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.970 
the contaminants coming out it could be
old<00:02:50.609> gear<00:02:50.969> oil<00:02:51.180> or<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.750> little<00:02:52.409> pieces<00:02:52.709> of

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
old gear oil or just little pieces of

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.209 
old gear oil or just little pieces of
metal<00:02:53.819> shavings<00:02:54.060> or<00:02:54.620> how<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.680> stuff<00:02:56.040> is

lots of metal shavings on the other hand

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.280 
lots of metal shavings on the other hand
is<00:02:59.489> not<00:02:59.519> normal<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.269> we<00:03:00.930> need<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.169> be

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
is not normal that we need to be

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.750 
is not normal that we need to be
rectified<00:03:02.750> but<00:03:03.829> slower<00:03:04.829> unit<00:03:05.189> oil<00:03:05.400> does<00:03:05.609> not

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
rectified but slower unit oil does not

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.170 
rectified but slower unit oil does not
let<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.120> bad<00:03:06.389> I<00:03:07.700> still<00:03:08.700> change<00:03:08.939> them<00:03:09.090> every

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
let that bad I still change them every

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.309 
let that bad I still change them every
year<00:03:11.930> so<00:03:12.930> that's<00:03:13.290> that

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.110 

give<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:16.920> 10<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.190> 15<00:03:17.520> minutes<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:17.910> drink

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
give it 10 to 15 minutes to drink

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.720 
give it 10 to 15 minutes to drink

out of the vent so you go ahead and take

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.880 
out of the vent so you go ahead and take
this<00:04:01.019> the<00:04:01.500> threaded<00:04:01.950> piece

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.780 

and<00:04:06.130> thread<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.120> into<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.450> lower<00:04:07.690> unit
