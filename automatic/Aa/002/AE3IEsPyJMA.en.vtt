00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.410
 left with nothing 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.900
 I liked this taste 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 showing all the letters 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.010
 anyone can throw the arrows to 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.339
 to be able to speak forward me because arrows 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.449
 well we are in minecraft 1.5 points 2 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.489
 to see a mod 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.430
 mod that had appeared quite 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.290
 interesting 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.070
 let's quote as always chain 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.560
 that if I do not look at it I'm not calm 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.880
 is this montage you see this structure so 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.670
 sanchis track if I loaded up on that is my 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.680
 trip tavern only if to add a 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.790
 tavern to minecraft stocks 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.580
 As you can see, when we enter, we have 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.430
 this and just because of this he called I'm going to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.300
 can this save me we also have 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.120
 an oven 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.000
 as if they were tables here to take you 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.870
 a beer 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.310
 and up here we have a warped bed 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.530
 I do not know why it goes exactly like that but 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.200
 good and we see a chest that they give us 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.870
 some resources that is pretty good 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.090
 and in itself what is the building mola egg 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.670
 or he was very much here has a 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.760
 torch I suppose because they would appear 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.460
 bugs here I guess I do not know and also there 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.990
 from a tavern-keeper that I do not know where she has 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.430
 seen veal 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.600
 water for this girl who has made several 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.990
 exchanges that was why he had so much 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.649
 filth 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.329
 what are you supposed to exchange potions 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.850
 but I've seen everything I've seen 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.570
 potions also in other villas I've 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.540
 seen that they gave you cooked potato 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:08.640
 it's pretty good actually 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:11.710
 you want I already have if I have left over 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.210
 you do not do any exchange for me anymore 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.250
 but hey it's pretty good because 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.930
 have been here in when you find 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.140
 a villa because you can pretty much 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.160
 start because you have most of the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.500
 this bed of portions and everything 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.290
 the oven and they give you enough resources that 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.390
 there are not few in all the ways that seen 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.740
 they give you enough we are going to gossip a 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.810
 plus 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.810
 well for knowing 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.190
 but shooting arrows like that I do not get lost 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.490
 so I know where triqui is headed 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.200
 triqui and they passed the arrows to me but 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.740
 interesting this 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.010
 someone 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.510
 I have a luck gave before and be like 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.450
 10 minutes and a control and or gravel 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.210
 I'm lucky, you want normal 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.770
 33 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:07.100
 click and trade for the keyboard this already 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.100
 starts to fail 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.380
 it fails a little bit good go against a 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.530
 mile and if I'm going to be here floating 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.270
 a while to be worth it has been to remove the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.230
 recording has loaded all this at once 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.230
 and it has gone well 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:30.430
 let's see what interesting things 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.790
 We found it was super tavern always 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.790
 lookout 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.499
 let's see another bed shape 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.370
 as you see, they always give us resources but 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:43.680
 they are never there is diamond 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.280
 I do not think I've seen iron either 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.960
 good 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.230
 to see what convinced us is you see here 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.680
 you have potatoes potatoes 32 as if 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.680
 they were few 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.040
 Super good 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.450
 well this is the kenya mode of this 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.450
 sort of very cool tavern 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.280

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.459
