he was part of that solid defense and
yet<00:05:03.250> he<00:05:03.310> definitely<00:05:03.669> deserves<00:05:04.000> a<00:05:04.090> downgrade

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
gone down 1277 5-3 it's partly due to

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.670 
gone down 1277 5-3 it's partly due to
that<00:05:22.419> position<00:05:22.660> change<00:05:23.050> I've<00:05:23.169> given<00:05:23.380> a<00:05:23.470> big

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
that position change I've given a big

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.560 
that position change I've given a big
defense<00:05:24.160> upgrade<00:05:24.580> because<00:05:24.729> for<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.180> right<00:05:25.389> back

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
defense upgrade because for a right back

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.540 
defense upgrade because for a right back
he<00:05:26.080> needs<00:05:26.289> more<00:05:26.440> defensive<00:05:26.889> stats<00:05:27.130> but

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
he needs more defensive stats but

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.100 
he needs more defensive stats but
because<00:05:27.820> of<00:05:27.910> its<00:05:28.060> position<00:05:28.419> change<00:05:28.690> all<00:05:28.930> his

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
because of its position change all his

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.170 
because of its position change all his
stats<00:05:29.440> mean<00:05:30.099> that<00:05:30.400> he's<00:05:30.520> actually<00:05:30.729> gone<00:05:31.120> down

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
stats mean that he's actually gone down

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.730 
stats mean that he's actually gone down
a<00:05:31.479> rating<00:05:31.840> if<00:05:31.930> you've<00:05:32.080> still<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.380> right<00:05:32.530> maybe

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
a rating if you've still the right maybe

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.770 
a rating if you've still the right maybe
you<00:05:32.860> don't<00:05:32.979> need<00:05:33.130> maybe<00:05:33.340> go<00:05:33.550> down<00:05:33.580> by<00:05:33.880> 79-78

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
you don't need maybe go down by 79-78

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.270 
you don't need maybe go down by 79-78
but<00:05:35.260> think<00:05:35.440> you're<00:05:35.530> going<00:05:35.710> to<00:05:35.800> a<00:05:35.830> right<00:05:36.070> back

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
but think you're going to a right back

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.760 
but think you're going to a right back
and<00:05:36.639> you<00:05:36.789> will<00:05:36.970> go<00:05:37.210> down<00:05:37.389> quite<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:37.870> lot<00:05:38.110> because

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
and you will go down quite a lot because

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.290 
and you will go down quite a lot because
of<00:05:39.070> that<00:05:39.250> some<00:05:39.580> reason<00:05:39.909> he's<00:05:40.000> got<00:05:40.120> so<00:05:40.240> many

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
of that some reason he's got so many

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.909 
of that some reason he's got so many
nights<00:05:40.539> to<00:05:40.720> do<00:05:40.870> you<00:05:40.930> ignore<00:05:41.320> that<00:05:41.500> you<00:05:41.740> should

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
nights to do you ignore that you should

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.080 
nights to do you ignore that you should
not<00:05:42.070> have<00:05:42.220> something<00:05:42.490> nice<00:05:42.610> to<00:05:42.669> think<00:05:42.970> that

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
not have something nice to think that

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.540 
not have something nice to think that
was<00:05:43.389> a<00:05:43.419> mistake<00:05:43.539> shooting<00:05:44.440> will<00:05:44.860> also<00:05:45.190> go<00:05:45.340> down

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
was a mistake shooting will also go down

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.950 
was a mistake shooting will also go down
I<00:05:45.610> think<00:05:45.970> you<00:05:46.060> definitely<00:05:46.210> will<00:05:46.599> get<00:05:46.750> down

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.750 
I think you definitely will get down
great<00:05:47.260> and<00:05:47.440> because<00:05:48.070> of<00:05:48.099> the<00:05:48.220> position<00:05:48.340> change

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
great and because of the position change

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.310 
great and because of the position change

him loads last season was not impressed
like<00:06:38.310> I<00:06:38.520> know<00:06:38.640> he's<00:06:38.970> been<00:06:39.150> struggling<00:06:39.420> with

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
like I know he's been struggling with

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.000 
like I know he's been struggling with
injury<00:06:40.020> and<00:06:40.110> he<00:06:40.170> just<00:06:40.350> came<00:06:40.530> back<00:06:40.680> with<00:06:40.860> that

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
injury and he just came back with that

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.250 
injury and he just came back with that
and<00:06:41.160> fitness<00:06:41.490> and<00:06:41.640> stuff<00:06:41.820> he<00:06:42.480> was<00:06:42.630> a<00:06:42.660> massive

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
and fitness and stuff he was a massive

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.740 
and fitness and stuff he was a massive
block<00:06:43.560> for<00:06:43.800> us<00:06:44.120> absolutely<00:06:45.120> massive<00:06:45.300> flock

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
block for us absolutely massive flock

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.750 
block for us absolutely massive flock
he's<00:06:46.140> now<00:06:46.290> moved<00:06:46.560> on<00:06:46.620> loan<00:06:47.010> to<00:06:47.130> Chelsea<00:06:47.610> I

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
he's now moved on loan to Chelsea I

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.550 
he's now moved on loan to Chelsea I
think<00:06:48.210> he<00:06:48.330> deserves<00:06:48.630> quite<00:06:49.050> a<00:06:49.080> big<00:06:49.230> downgrade

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
think he deserves quite a big downgrade

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.680 
think he deserves quite a big downgrade
now<00:06:49.890> he<00:06:50.460> got<00:06:50.640> like<00:06:50.880> four<00:06:51.240> goals<00:06:51.480> in<00:06:51.600> the

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
now he got like four goals in the

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.360 
now he got like four goals in the
Premier<00:06:52.020> League<00:06:52.050> the<00:06:52.530> only<00:06:52.800> reason<00:06:53.040> he's

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
Premier League the only reason he's

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.460 
Premier League the only reason he's

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
getting such a big downward is because

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.950 
getting such a big downward is because
he's<00:06:55.680> so<00:06:55.950> high<00:06:56.220> rated<00:06:56.520> before<00:06:56.760> like<00:06:56.910> 88<00:06:57.390> rated

86 but I think you might just go down
all<00:07:15.480> the<00:07:15.540> way<00:07:15.660> to<00:07:15.780> an<00:07:16.020> 85<00:07:16.530> thing<00:07:16.890> about<00:07:17.100> it

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 
all the way to an 85 thing about it

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.760 
all the way to an 85 thing about it
diego<00:07:18.060> costa<00:07:18.090> started<00:07:18.750> off<00:07:18.870> the<00:07:19.350> year<00:07:19.380> as<00:07:19.650> an

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
diego costa started off the year as an

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.800 
diego costa started off the year as an
85<00:07:20.190> there<00:07:20.850> at<00:07:20.940> the<00:07:21.030> same<00:07:21.180> club<00:07:21.450> is<00:07:21.600> quite<00:07:21.780> easy

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
85 there at the same club is quite easy

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.140 
85 there at the same club is quite easy
to<00:07:22.050> compare<00:07:22.440> like<00:07:23.430> putting<00:07:23.760> them<00:07:23.850> on<00:07:23.910> the<00:07:23.940> same

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:24.150 
to compare like putting them on the same

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.300 
to compare like putting them on the same
level<00:07:24.210> is<00:07:24.750> quite<00:07:25.230> generous<00:07:25.650> so<00:07:25.920> I<00:07:26.190> think

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
level is quite generous so I think

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.790 
level is quite generous so I think
that's<00:07:27.000> just<00:07:27.180> my<00:07:27.300> prediction<00:07:27.870> and<00:07:28.080> is<00:07:28.470> a<00:07:28.500> lot

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
that's just my prediction and is a lot

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.140 
that's just my prediction and is a lot
of<00:07:28.890> people's<00:07:29.190> predictions<00:07:29.310> on<00:07:29.670> Twitter<00:07:29.910> back

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.150 
of people's predictions on Twitter back
