a<00:04:15.370> short<00:04:15.760> video<00:04:15.910> so<00:04:16.750> I'll<00:04:16.900> only<00:04:17.080> cover<00:04:17.380> hashing

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
a short video so I'll only cover hashing

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.470 
a short video so I'll only cover hashing
in<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.070> demo<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:18.940> i'll<00:04:19.060> give<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.390> link

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
in the demo but i'll give you a link

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.659

cryptography<00:04:24.130> features<00:04:24.520> now<00:04:25.330> i'll<00:04:25.480> drag<00:04:25.690> a

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
cryptography features now i'll drag a

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.600 
cryptography features now i'll drag a
text<00:04:26.169> box

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
text box

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.219

and<00:04:26.699> a<00:04:26.789> button<00:04:27.150> onto<00:04:27.300> the<00:04:27.479> screen<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:31.199> user

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
and a button onto the screen the user

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.409 
and a button onto the screen the user
will<00:04:31.949> enter<00:04:31.979> a<00:04:32.189> password<00:04:32.490> in<00:04:32.819> the<00:04:32.849> text<00:04:33.240> box

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
will enter a password in the text box

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.629 
will enter a password in the text box
and<00:04:33.719> then<00:04:34.349> clicking<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.830> button<00:04:35.159> is<00:04:35.280> going<00:04:35.520> to

and then clicking the button is going to

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.059 
and then clicking the button is going to
verify<00:04:36.030> what<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.539> user<00:04:36.719> entered<00:04:37.110> against<00:04:37.949> a

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
verify what the user entered against a

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.640 
verify what the user entered against a
hash<00:04:38.400> that's<00:04:38.939> stored<00:04:39.240> in<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.419> app<00:04:39.569> so<00:04:40.379> first

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
hash that's stored in the app so first

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.990 
hash that's stored in the app so first
I'll<00:04:40.830> double<00:04:41.129> click<00:04:41.159> the<00:04:41.400> button<00:04:41.669> to<00:04:41.759> get<00:04:41.879> the

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
I'll double click the button to get the
