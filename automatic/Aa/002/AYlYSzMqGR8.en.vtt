00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.870
 A computer called 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.389
 For the first time in 1973, we realized windows-like operability 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.280
 How was the operability completed in the future? 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.969
 Let's see 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.969
 How to use Alta is almost the same as current PC 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.579
 Set the BIC containing the software 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.980
 On the screen 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.980
 There is a small suspicion and there is an earthquake and there is an honor by the mouse 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.270
 You can manipulate documents and software freely with 10 unknown people 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.560
 In the case of copy operation, specify the fixed range by mouse 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.560
 Just decide the move one 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.470
 mifaredesigns I'm in charge of software development 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.310
 It was 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.730
 But originally a professional jazz musician 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.030
 I also composed for the musicals and sisters 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.730
 The fact that I think programming has the same price 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:05.360
 What 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.630
 When I am a university student 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.820
 Computer programming nice to meet you rtl but its 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.350
 When I have little interest in computers 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.430
 Programming is just a means to earn kabuki 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.620
 It was only from adults that gradually merged with the lemur 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.130
 Everyone has their own computer in a year until children 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.270
 Now we are interested in a world that can be supplied 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.610
 Conceptual model of personal computer devised by Anran Kei in the 1970s 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.910
 He plans to reform his computer which can be used in February 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.490
 Was 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.090
 The 6 companies Palo Alto Research Institute located in the suburbs of San Francisco 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.870
 Anran Kei 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.020
 Start working here to study personal computers and develop alto 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.040
 I entered a group 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.270
 It is the next era of those days if it is highly successful with a copying machine 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.600
 Thinking about office environment research 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.740
 Brain-gathering new computers urgently from the United States 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 I met when I got the result 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.240
 The Ministry of Defense did not understand the value they were 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770
 I told the night slope 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:15.249
 So Mr. Bay of -03 did not try to commercialize amazon 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:15.509
 is 

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:18.509
 They did not see the possibility of being 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.209
 Free PC operation with mouse 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.480
 It was thought that this technology had been sent 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.639
 A visit by a young man will see the eye of the date of submission 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:35.239
 The billiard beam was placed under the first complex image 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.579
 Pinball on 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.579
 And I was surprised that I use a mouse 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.029
 Designate the line 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:49.540
 Then I listen to being easy to write like a pencil 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:50.799
 Tasted 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:51.779
 And 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:55.489
 One party's Kimkung So far this song is three times the same 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.150
 I was surprised 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.249
 The President was probably overcast 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.509
 From now on, this has been done in the market before 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:04.759
 If you are forced to use a computer of the type 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:08.069
 Is it possible to mix anything you wanted with your greetings? 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.799
 Even without learning the difficult command that came back 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.139
 There is a great potential in the moment I was talking 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:17.539
 I felt that until that 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.479
 Such personal computer software 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.219
 The 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:24.279
 One way to move 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.269
 I have not heard that girl 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.779
 On the keyboard 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.859
 command prompt 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.010
 Engineering also go Kofu every hour in romaji 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.409
 I'm talking about working comfortable by giving a command, but that command 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.440
 You must remember or hit you have to hit asean 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.119
 This is the second time 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:45.709
 It is a boom while watching Lotte 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.219
 You should be able to take it there and fight at this time alone 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.159
 That's why I am totally empty personal 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.519
 It became easier to partner with a computer 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.309
 Seeing the Yankees 23 meter cylinder is immediately there 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.239
 I started a statement of intention with 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.449
 I think I can sell the prefectural assembly 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.529
 Velx did not really try to use it as a raw material 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.340
 It continued, but I did not try to commercialize it myself 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:12.749
 But we receive yearly 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:16.939
 So apple turned negative for 16 days and 

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:19.939
 If reserved, I developed it there 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.740
 So here is Apple's computer 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.610
 A little 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.520
 Just this arrow is 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.639
 This high 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.939
 I will bring it especially after I went 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.080
 There is also a click 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.160
 This is how you see it again at the current Kinsou Festival and other windows well 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.599
 It is similar 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.789
 I wonder why I didn't make such good things 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.800
 Won't you go in this low level frame and you and this company 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.249
 I say that developed for myself and this company 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.469
 I would like to control the future of PC band 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.990
 That's what it sounds like that voice 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.990
 It's not like a chain store 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.279
 After that the 65th place 4 differences 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.769
 It is a problem of management of the manager from the bridge
