00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.840
 the games collection points we make today 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.660
 a sort of retro not so retro boxing 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.660
 or not as old as it could be 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:25.789
 we talk about okamiden for nintendo ds 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:29.640
 game that I would say to be beautiful because 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:33.000
 no he should not know this 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.360
 absolutely to recover it 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.950
 this is the Japanese limited edition 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.440
 I think it's quite common they are 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.559
 was bought two years ago in Japan e 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.170
 I paid very little already 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:52.770
 at the time you see a cardboard box 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:56.370
 with some nice graphics and let's go to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.680
 see inside like that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:05.299
 see the spain card basically 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.960
 that I got up and behind the receipt 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.170
 trader 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.799
 we see the casket inside with one 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.799
 copy of the game 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.409
 own of the game with instructions that 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.850
 now I show you why they deserve not 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.799
 are the instructions we wanted today and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.310
 monochrome but education they had 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:41.229
 obviously his card of the sheepskin 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:47.829
 ds and instructions are in a card 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:49.899
 beautiful and all strictly in color 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.640
 it seems they are now very special stuff 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.100
 made things that instructions 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:01.869
 are in color a time was taken for granted 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:05.970
 now it's really something different 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:16.959
 from the usual having color instructions 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:18.730
 obviously on slightly older games yes 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.700
 they are easier to find on new ones 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:27.250
 a little less let's go and see more 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:33.910
 inside we have a DVD 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:39.700
 video that should contain make up 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:41.739
 and some audio tracks sincerely 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.140
 I have never tried them but it will be 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:49.769
 the opportunity also to find them a lot 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:52.750
 very nice also the graphics 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.850
 I do n't know what 's inside me 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.549
 grips and it will happen that I will also do 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.780
 this is a warning here a booklet 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.790
 with one of his bundles on a span card that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.389
 let's take it so we show it were 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:12.489
 inside and inside this book with 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:15.359
 very few tables but tables 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.359
 beautiful I've seen 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:25.780
 and everything written looks more like a book than 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:29.650
 another very very nice we go to 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.840
 close it carefully 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.260
 or not who doesn't care to close it again 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.250
 after that, we find a crash 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:44.290
 issimo puppet protagonist 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:48.400
 main game and three monkeys 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.069
 from cute to reality done well and finally 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.140
 which I think is the highlight 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.459
 given that with the pre order there was 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.380
 even a possessed a nib with the shape 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.720
 particular with the paw not me 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.400
 I still remember I hadn't done the 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.489
 pre order I took it used in Japan 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.840
 that you actually use is new but it's okay 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.860
 and inside we have headphones 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.530
 sorry excuse me approach 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.450
 because these put so much 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.760
 headphones custom caps 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.880
 personalized with earphones e 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.510
 formal paw that is really trash a 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.960
 To say the least but beautiful that to say boys 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.360
 this unboxing and everything in my opinion is 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.880
 beautiful because a bit of that magic 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.270
 typical of other times of the limited that 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.370
 who were and if you recovered it if you 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.840
 like the game and find it a little there 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.840
 I recommend hello to everyone
