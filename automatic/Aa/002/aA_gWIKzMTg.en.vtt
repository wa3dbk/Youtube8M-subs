00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.240
 hi very good people we are a video 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.190
 more and today we're going to learn how to 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.170
 change a plate is worth what we are going to do 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.510
 with the following tools I have 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.990
 an air kit here is worth this is going to 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.430
 to serve 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.200
 I have a 17 tube wrench if not 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.169
 you carry pecs, it does not need to be help 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.809
 of tube a fixed wrench but if you go to the 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.520
 missing and then a key beyond 8 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.650
 because yesterday's kit our key to the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.820
 8 good to start first we'll do 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.820
 it will loosen the rear wheel 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.940
 and here 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.940
 the normal battle of it 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.820
 good is loose the wheel is the first 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.920
 part for good to start removing 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.220
 the good plate is sometimes loose the wheel 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.300
 let's remove the string ok let's 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.510
 watch 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.650
 the situation and we take it out and now 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.970
 we take the wheels back once 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.860
 let's have the wheel around here taken out 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.860
 what we have to do is remove the 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.840
 chain completely for a good side and 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.510
 now we will need someone's kit if 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.920
 you notice I have that on this side there 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.800
 only one hole I do not have a 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.640
 screw but here follow screws and what 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.610
 what are we going to do is 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.450
 to remove this side is worth with this key 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 which is the 6 mm wrench 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.259
 let's loosen 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.259
 we loosened 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.390
 until it's something completely 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.950
 if you also screw the other 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.329
 side does not need twine and 6-3 what 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.329
 you just want to be here 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.960
 well maybe you need an extractor 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.060
 I do not need myself but to give him 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.200
 will be removed by hand under pressure and if 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.170
 do not do it with a hammer this is from 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.850
 nylon and it goes out that good once 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.260
 be here it is worth now that if we have 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.120
 a hammer and we will push the shaft towards 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.060
 outside so that the other one comes out 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.340
 part of the crank as we will not need 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.020
 something to hit him for the modem or 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.290
 directly a hammer because you can 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.640
 damage the shaft worth we will give it with a 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.640
 piece of methcrilate that you have here 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.110
 good as you see here I have taken the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.489
 stone what we have to have in 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.380
 account is always where we are 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.930
 the washers are worth if there were large 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.000
 here with what I would have here we leave it 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.480
 one side and what's here then what 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.980
 we leave the other voucher so that we are not 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.940
 mix everything and then you will not call us 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.680
 the vice 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.680
 what we have to do now is 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.790
 here 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.140
 what we have to do is loosen this 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.360
 screw here and take out the plate and 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.580
 put a manual plate and put the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.960
 screw the next thing we're going to do 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.310
 is to place all the washers that go 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.310
 on this side and put the crank 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.739
 let's put this asset here too 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.189
 Once this is done we will place the 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.189
 good rod 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.319
 and we'll start as you saw disk is assigned 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.280
 before 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.170
 to hammer him but with the one 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:54.659
 support here so that you do not damage the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:57.060
 Lebanon screw is worth as you are 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.889
 seeing I have the first part mounted 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.720
 now we go with the second part and 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.910
 We have a little washer is 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.120
 and this flag 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.530
 look on this side 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.700
 we pray here 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.700
 but a little 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:19.840
 and we put this other the following 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:23.050
 will place the foot in the other and we will 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.890
 try to place it like this are teeth 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.610
 little ones can be like this or that or if 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.610
 as straight as possible 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.960
 I am to see yes 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.900
 it's worth the same here 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:51.679
 we put this 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.539
 What we have to do is take the 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.539
 screw a little bit too 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.090
 and we will place it 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.090
 we looked for it 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.330
 with the agen kit we are going to 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.330
 to truth 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.840
 we will squeeze a lot because if not 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.270
 the crank will be too tight 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:45.250
 but we will leave it at the moment 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:47.080
 since of collada but not very strong like that 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.310
 how good as ya beis is now spinning 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.700
 all right 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.900
 and it's not very quiet because what 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.420
 next thing we're going to do is place 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.470
 the rear wheel that we do here the 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.470
 chain on the pinion 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:05.019
 and choose back 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:08.409
 and here we also place the chain of 

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:10.659
 plate and give him doors once we're 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:13.019
 here we are squeezing and intense in 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:13.019
 the wheel 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.260
 and we are going to press 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.260
 ah 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.530
 i 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:34.340
 and well this is going to be the way 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:36.290
 change the dish is worth 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.540
 this is the tutorial today I hope that you 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.310
 have liked that the salt increases and if 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.080
 do you have any questions thank you in the 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.850
 comments 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.850
