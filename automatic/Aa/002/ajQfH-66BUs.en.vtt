what's going on guys his physics are

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.940 
what's going on guys his physics are
iron<00:00:09.970> physics<00:00:10.650> bringing<00:00:11.650> you<00:00:11.770> a<00:00:11.800> tutorial<00:00:11.860> on

iron physics bringing you a tutorial on
the

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.710 
the
to<00:00:15.680> cinematics<00:00:16.369> or<00:00:16.760> at<00:00:16.850> least<00:00:17.060> I'll<00:00:17.270> get<00:00:17.510> my

to cinematics or at least I'll get my
cinematics<00:00:18.400> these<00:00:19.400> are<00:00:19.550> cinematics<00:00:20.210> are

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
cinematics these are cinematics are

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.749 
cinematics these are cinematics are
basically<00:00:21.560> for<00:00:23.140> first<00:00:24.140> no<00:00:24.890> single<00:00:25.550> players

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
basically for first no single players

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.710 
basically for first no single players
night<00:00:26.360> is<00:00:26.720> they<00:00:27.200> don't<00:00:27.380> really<00:00:27.710> work<00:00:27.860> for<00:00:28.720> die

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
night is they don't really work for die

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.180 
night is they don't really work for die
and<00:00:30.050> for<00:00:30.230> like<00:00:30.519> recreating<00:00:31.519> dying<00:00:32.059> scenes<00:00:32.449> and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
and for like recreating dying scenes and

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.540 
and for like recreating dying scenes and
shit<00:00:34.190> like<00:00:34.340> that

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
shit like that

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.840 
shit like that
since<00:00:35.030> you<00:00:35.720> can<00:00:35.870> only<00:00:35.960> expect<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:36.850> one

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
since you can only expect a one

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.259 
since you can only expect a one
controller<00:00:38.379> and<00:00:39.379> that<00:00:39.850> controller<00:00:40.850> is<00:00:41.120> going

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
controller and that controller is going

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.299 
controller and that controller is going
to<00:00:41.330> be<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.540> secondary<00:00:41.989> they<00:00:42.199> will<00:00:42.410> spectate

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.069 

we<00:00:46.309> are<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:47.239> first<00:00:47.450> controller<00:00:47.780> are<00:00:47.960> you

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
we are the first controller are you

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.880 
we are the first controller are you
basically<00:00:48.590> going<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.390> spectate<00:00:50.770> once<00:00:51.770> the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
basically going to spectate once the

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.479 
basically going to spectate once the
second<00:00:52.219> one<00:00:53.079> we<00:00:54.079> get<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:54.590> cinematic<00:00:55.160> that<00:00:55.399> you

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
second one we get the cinematic that you

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.369 
second one we get the cinematic that you
want<00:00:56.559> you<00:00:57.559> have<00:00:57.590> executed<00:00:58.129> sorry<00:00:59.199> just<00:01:00.199> want

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
want you have executed sorry just want

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.640 
want you have executed sorry just want
to<00:01:00.500> run<00:01:00.649> in<00:01:00.800> cinematic<00:01:01.160> up<00:01:01.399> this

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:26.100 

you<00:01:05.250> got<00:01:05.460> running

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.880 

all<00:01:26.770> right<00:01:26.920> here<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.990> can<00:01:29.200> see<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.530> second

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
all right here you can see the second

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.650 
all right here you can see the second
pair<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:30.340> radars<00:01:30.730> already<00:01:31.150> seen

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
pair and the radars already seen

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.880 
pair and the radars already seen
Jordan's<00:01:31.990> first<00:01:32.170> player<00:01:32.440> is<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.770> one

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
Jordan's first player is the one

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.490 
Jordan's first player is the one
spectating<00:01:33.490> second<00:01:33.880> player<00:01:34.030> already<00:01:34.660> so

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
spectating second player already so

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.470 
spectating second player already so
while<00:01:35.680> he's<00:01:35.830> running<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.400> doing<00:01:37.030> this<00:01:37.240> thing

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
while he's running and doing this thing

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.750 
while he's running and doing this thing
and<00:01:38.440> slow<00:01:38.710> down<00:01:38.860> the<00:01:38.980> speed<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.630> DoubleTap

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
and slow down the speed you DoubleTap

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.510 
and slow down the speed you DoubleTap

guess<00:01:46.410> you<00:01:47.410> can<00:01:47.590> see<00:01:47.770> how<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.070> camera<00:01:48.520> it's

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
guess you can see how the camera it's

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.570 
guess you can see how the camera it's
already<00:01:49.500> zoomed<00:01:50.500> in<00:01:50.860> more<00:01:51.190> than<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.540> regular

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
already zoomed in more than the regular

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.720 
already zoomed in more than the regular
free<00:01:54.580> roam<00:01:54.850> camera<00:01:56.130> see<00:01:57.130> everything<00:01:57.520> is<00:01:57.610> just

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
free roam camera see everything is just

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.200 
free roam camera see everything is just
a<00:01:57.880> little<00:01:58.090> bit<00:01:58.180> more<00:01:58.330> tone<00:01:58.600> there

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.340 

you<00:02:01.990> can<00:02:02.110> even<00:02:02.260> go<00:02:02.530> into<00:02:03.840> edit<00:02:04.840> camera<00:02:05.170> mode

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
you can even go into edit camera mode

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.120 
you can even go into edit camera mode
and<00:02:05.650> you<00:02:05.800> can<00:02:05.950> sit<00:02:07.320> dolly<00:02:08.320> camera<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.830> you

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
and you can sit dolly camera and you

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.430 
and you can sit dolly camera and you
won't<00:02:12.370> mess<00:02:12.610> with<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:15.810> camera<00:02:16.810> angles<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
won't mess with the camera angles in a

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.340 
won't mess with the camera angles in a
shirt<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.600> I<00:02:19.600> think<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.870> works<00:02:20.080> better

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
shirt and I think this works better

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.620 
shirt and I think this works better
because<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:21.310> don't<00:02:21.940> know<00:02:22.000> when<00:02:22.210> I<00:02:22.240> arrive<00:02:22.480> on

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
because I don't know when I arrive on

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.030 
because I don't know when I arrive on
the<00:02:22.810> regular<00:02:23.700> camera<00:02:24.700> mode<00:02:24.910> on<00:02:25.710> when<00:02:26.710> I'm<00:02:26.830> not

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
the regular camera mode on when I'm not

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.220 
the regular camera mode on when I'm not
spectating<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.850> regular<00:02:28.240> online<00:02:28.780> games

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
spectating just regular online games

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.470 
spectating just regular online games
it's<00:02:29.650> like<00:02:29.800> it's<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.580> little<00:02:30.700> bit<00:02:30.820> glitchy<00:02:31.210> and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
it's like it's a little bit glitchy and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.600 
it's like it's a little bit glitchy and
shit<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:33.550> can<00:02:33.730> set<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.880> camera<00:02:34.890> then<00:02:35.890> run<00:02:36.190> and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
shit you can set a camera then run and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.750 
shit you can set a camera then run and
then<00:02:36.910> set<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.240> next<00:02:37.390> camera<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.640> be

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
then set the next camera and you can be

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.670 
then set the next camera and you can be
like<00:02:39.790> zoomed<00:02:40.180> in<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.660> guy<00:02:40.810> won't<00:02:41.140> even<00:02:41.290> I

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
like zoomed in and the guy won't even I

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.030 
like zoomed in and the guy won't even I
don't<00:02:41.830> know<00:02:42.330> glitched<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.690> much<00:02:45.780> perfect

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
don't know glitched that much perfect

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.750 
don't know glitched that much perfect
smooth

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.270 

I<00:02:51.790> really<00:02:52.420> like<00:02:52.629> this<00:02:52.750> motorart<00:02:53.349> he<00:02:53.980> can<00:02:54.160> get

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
I really like this motorart he can get

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.220 
I really like this motorart he can get
some<00:02:54.459> pretty<00:02:54.640> better<00:02:54.879> cinematics

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.890 

but<00:03:00.860> yeah<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.730> mean<00:03:02.000> that's<00:03:02.209> basically<00:03:02.360> all<00:03:02.659> you

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
but yeah I mean that's basically all you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.680 
but yeah I mean that's basically all you
need

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
need

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.390 
need
you<00:03:05.260> can<00:03:05.380> see<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.590> difference<00:03:05.950> here<00:03:06.010> from<00:03:06.310> the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
you can see the difference here from the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.080 
you can see the difference here from the
spectating<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.240> regular<00:03:07.600> camera

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
spectating and the regular camera

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.990 
spectating and the regular camera
obviously<00:03:10.090> respect<00:03:11.080> any<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.800> me<00:03:11.980> it's<00:03:12.520> just<00:03:12.910> a

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
obviously respect any to me it's just a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.670
