00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
the economy would collapse if people

the economy would collapse if people

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
made $2.00 a day they would not be able

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.990 
made $2.00 a day they would not be able
to<00:02:11.690> consume<00:02:12.200> enough<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:13.100> keep<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.490> economy

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
to consume enough to keep the economy

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.570 
to consume enough to keep the economy
actually<00:02:14.150> alive<00:02:14.900> because<00:02:15.830> they<00:02:16.220> would<00:02:16.370> have

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
actually alive because they would have

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.170 
actually alive because they would have
literally<00:02:17.180> no<00:02:17.570> disposable<00:02:18.350> income<00:02:18.740> in<00:02:19.180> fact

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
literally no disposable income in fact

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.770 
literally no disposable income in fact
if<00:02:20.390> they<00:02:20.660> really<00:02:20.840> only<00:02:21.110> made<00:02:21.410> $2<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.010> day<00:02:22.780> they

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
if they really only made $2 a day they

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.330 
if they really only made $2 a day they
would<00:02:23.930> not<00:02:24.080> even<00:02:24.230> be<00:02:24.470> able<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.740> afford<00:02:25.010> enough

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
would not even be able to afford enough

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.300 
would not even be able to afford enough
food<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:26.030> thus<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.200> workers<00:02:27.530> would<00:02:27.709> actually

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
food and thus the workers would actually

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.680 
food and thus the workers would actually
die<00:02:29.770> see<00:02:30.770> now<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:31.160> what<00:02:32.150> really<00:02:32.420> would

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
die see now this is what really would

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.140 
die see now this is what really would
happen<00:02:33.080> if<00:02:33.260> you<00:02:33.890> reduced<00:02:34.250> people's<00:02:34.670> salaries

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
happen if you reduced people's salaries

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.770 
happen if you reduced people's salaries
or<00:02:35.300> their<00:02:35.420> wages<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:36.010> $2<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.070> day

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
or their wages to $2 a day

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.420 
or their wages to $2 a day
but<00:02:38.780> this<00:02:38.930> doesn't<00:02:39.260> enter<00:02:39.530> into<00:02:39.560> their<00:02:39.980> minds

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430

but this doesn't enter into their minds
they<00:02:41.300> only<00:02:41.540> see<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.900> as<00:02:42.110> oh<00:02:42.320> if<00:02:42.739> we<00:02:42.950> do<00:02:43.100> this

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
they only see this as oh if we do this

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.890 
they only see this as oh if we do this
it'll<00:02:43.489> be<00:02:43.670> more<00:02:43.850> competitive<00:02:44.180> with<00:02:44.450> African

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
it'll be more competitive with African

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.090 
it'll be more competitive with African
labor<00:02:45.580> yes<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:46.970> literally<00:02:47.870> would<00:02:48.230> be<00:02:48.560> more

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
labor yes it literally would be more

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.180 
labor yes it literally would be more
competitive<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:50.030> African<00:02:50.630> labor<00:02:51.070> but<00:02:52.070> then

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
competitive with African labor but then

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.400 
competitive with African labor but then
the<00:02:52.280> people<00:02:52.459> of<00:02:52.700> Australia<00:02:52.959> would<00:02:53.959> be<00:02:54.110> living

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
the people of Australia would be living

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.930 
the people of Australia would be living
like<00:02:54.560> Africans<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.310> would<00:02:55.519> have<00:02:55.610> the<00:02:55.730> same

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
like Africans and would have the same

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.750 
like Africans and would have the same
living<00:02:56.239> standard<00:02:56.780> as<00:02:56.930> Africans<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.100> if<00:02:58.670> they

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
living standard as Africans and if they

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.580 
living standard as Africans and if they
had<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.090> same<00:02:59.360> living<00:02:59.750> centers<00:03:00.050> of<00:03:00.140> Africans

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
had the same living centers of Africans

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.590 
had the same living centers of Africans
they<00:03:01.220> wouldn't<00:03:01.550> be<00:03:01.670> able<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.880> consume<00:03:02.330> to

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
they wouldn't be able to consume to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.170 
they wouldn't be able to consume to
support<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.080> capitalist<00:03:03.680> system<00:03:03.739> at<00:03:04.310> all<00:03:04.790> and

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
support the capitalist system at all and

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.300 
support the capitalist system at all and
thus<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.110> capitalist<00:03:06.530> system<00:03:06.560> would<00:03:07.010> have<00:03:07.040> a

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
thus the capitalist system would have a

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.009 
thus the capitalist system would have a
tremendous<00:03:07.580> negative<00:03:08.180> effects<00:03:08.720> brought

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
tremendous negative effects brought

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.509 
tremendous negative effects brought

against it as a result list and would

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.509

eventually collapse they're not taking

this<00:04:09.519> is<00:04:09.640> absolutely<00:04:10.000> not<00:04:10.120> true<00:04:10.300> in<00:04:10.510> fact<00:04:10.570> it
