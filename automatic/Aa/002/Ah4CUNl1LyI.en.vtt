00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.339 

I<00:00:09.019> absolutely<00:00:10.019> love<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:11.040> flip<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.550> pitch<00:00:11.730> and

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
I absolutely love to flip and pitch and

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.620 
I absolutely love to flip and pitch and
one<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.530> things<00:00:13.769> that<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.009> think<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.670> always

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
one of the things that I think is always

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.090 
one of the things that I think is always
the<00:00:15.690> question<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.109> my<00:00:16.170> mind<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.500> how<00:00:16.650> long<00:00:16.830> do<00:00:17.039> I

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
the question on my mind is how long do I

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.910 
the question on my mind is how long do I
leave<00:00:17.279> my<00:00:17.460> bait<00:00:17.810> around<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.990> target<00:00:19.500> or<00:00:19.680> in

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
leave my bait around that target or in

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.320 
leave my bait around that target or in
that<00:00:20.070> spot<00:00:20.430> where<00:00:20.609> I've<00:00:20.730> pitched<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.180> bait

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
that spot where I've pitched the bait

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.810 
that spot where I've pitched the bait
before<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:21.930> reel<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.650> in<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.070> make<00:00:23.699> another

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
before I reel it in and make another

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.200 
before I reel it in and make another
cast<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.470> read<00:00:25.650> an<00:00:25.769> article<00:00:25.920> about<00:00:26.430> on

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
cast and I read an article about on

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.060 
cast and I read an article about on
Tommy<00:00:27.510> Biffle<00:00:27.750> which<00:00:28.080> obviously<00:00:28.680> one<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.980> the

especially one of the best ever to pick
up<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.969> flip<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.300> run<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.410> he<00:00:34.530> said<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> thing

up a flip and run and he said the thing

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.400 
up a flip and run and he said the thing
to<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.670> when<00:00:36.510> you're<00:00:36.660> especially<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.350> the

springtime when those fish are you know

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.720 
springtime when those fish are you know
they<00:00:39.989> want<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.710> protecting<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.340> an<00:00:41.430> area

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730

they want to be protecting of an area
around<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.030> bed<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.270> anything<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.260> he<00:00:43.440> pitch

around a bed or anything is is he pitch

around a bed or anything is is he pitch
up<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> he<00:00:45.000> would<00:00:45.149> just<00:00:45.329> he'd<00:00:45.660> hop<00:00:45.899> that

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
up there and he would just he'd hop that

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.810 
up there and he would just he'd hop that
bait<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.590> place<00:00:46.890> not<00:00:47.129> really<00:00:47.399> moving<00:00:47.610> it

horizontally<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.719> kind<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.930> shaking

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
horizontally but just kind of shaking

horizontally but just kind of shaking
the<00:00:49.410> rod<00:00:49.590> tip<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.010> he<00:00:50.100> would<00:00:50.219> count<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.760> 1

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the rod tip but he would count it like 1

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.760 
the rod tip but he would count it like 1
2<00:00:52.550> 3<00:00:53.550> 4<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> wherever<00:00:55.170> he<00:00:55.289> got<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> bite

shake of the rod or the tenth or twelfth

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.029 
shake of the rod or the tenth or twelfth
would<00:00:59.789> tell<00:01:00.000> him<00:01:00.469> you<00:01:01.469> know<00:01:01.590> how<00:01:01.739> long<00:01:01.949> he

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
would tell him you know how long he

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
would tell him you know how long he
should<00:01:02.070> leave<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.489> bait<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> cover

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
should leave that bait in in the cover

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.230 
should leave that bait in in the cover
or<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.439> spot<00:01:04.799> before<00:01:05.430> he'd<00:01:05.729> reel<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
or in that spot before he'd reel in and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.429 
or in that spot before he'd reel in and
make<00:01:06.360> another<00:01:06.479> cast<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.960> would<00:01:07.140> kind<00:01:07.350> of

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
make another cast that would kind of

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.830 
make another cast that would kind of
give<00:01:07.560> him<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.119> pattern<00:01:09.119> within<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.479> pattern

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
give him that pattern within a pattern

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.990 
give him that pattern within a pattern
how<00:01:09.990> long<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.380> leave<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.740> bait<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.580> area

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
how long to leave that bait in the area

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.820 
how long to leave that bait in the area
before<00:01:12.570> moving<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.439> making<00:01:13.560> another

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
before moving it out and making another

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.740 
before moving it out and making another
flip<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.850> be<00:01:14.970> more<00:01:15.180> efficient<00:01:15.630> like

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
flip and you can be more efficient like

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.929 
flip and you can be more efficient like
that<00:01:15.930> if<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.140> know<00:01:16.490> typically<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.610> got<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
that if you know typically you got to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.580 
that if you know typically you got to
leave<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.090> bait<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.840> little<00:01:19.229> bit<00:01:19.320> longer

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
leave that bait a little bit longer

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.890 
leave that bait a little bit longer
especially<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> waters<00:01:20.729> colder<00:01:21.180> before

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
especially when the waters colder before

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.330 
especially when the waters colder before
you<00:01:21.990> make<00:01:22.170> another<00:01:22.200> reel<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.250> make

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you make another reel it in and make

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.710 
you make another reel it in and make
another<00:01:23.549> flipper<00:01:23.850> pitch<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.570> that's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
another flipper pitch and so that's

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.780 
another flipper pitch and so that's
something<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> always<00:01:25.110> keep<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.470> mind<00:01:25.790> I'm

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
something that I always keep in mind I'm

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.100 
something that I always keep in mind I'm
not<00:01:26.850> always<00:01:27.240> counting<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:27.869> I'm<00:01:27.960> always

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
not always counting it but I'm always

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.870 
not always counting it but I'm always
trying<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.860> see<00:01:28.950> how<00:01:29.159> long<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.460> leave<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> in

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
trying to see how long to leave it in

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.370 
trying to see how long to leave it in
there<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> count<00:01:30.780> method<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.170> good

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
there but the count method is good

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.630 
there but the count method is good
because<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.770> gives<00:01:31.920> us<00:01:32.040> something<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> kind<00:01:32.579> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
because it gives us something to kind of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.280 
because it gives us something to kind of
focus<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.090> while<00:01:33.329> we're<00:01:33.509> flipping<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
focus on while we're flipping and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.719 
focus on while we're flipping and
pitching<00:01:34.320> every<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> these<00:01:35.100> targets<00:01:35.579> so

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
pitching every one of these targets so

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.100 
pitching every one of these targets so
next<00:01:36.329> time<00:01:36.450> you're<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:36.659> there<00:01:36.900> flipping

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
next time you're out there flipping

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.890 
next time you're out there flipping
