but it just sounded alike and those kind

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.340 
but it just sounded alike and those kind
of<00:02:02.790> things<00:02:02.850> are<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.509> uncommon<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.259> we

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
of things are just so uncommon that we
