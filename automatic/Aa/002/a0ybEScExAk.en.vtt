00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
buttons just drill two holes here or a

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.860 
buttons just drill two holes here or a
hole<00:02:47.599> here<00:02:47.959> that'd<00:02:48.470> be<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.709> best<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.870> yeah

right you might want to drill a hole

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.660 
right you might want to drill a hole
probably<00:02:57.200> about<00:02:57.319> right<00:02:57.560> here<00:02:58.069> on<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.459> back<00:02:58.640> of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
probably about right here on the back of

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.479 
probably about right here on the back of
the<00:02:58.879> controller<00:02:59.239> because<00:02:59.569> like<00:03:00.200> that's<00:03:01.160> where

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
the controller because like that's where

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.800 
the controller because like that's where

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
to get a solder one wire right here in

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.509 
to get a solder one wire right here in
the<00:03:18.349> middle<00:03:18.380> prom<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.400> these<00:03:19.609> three<00:03:21.519> because
