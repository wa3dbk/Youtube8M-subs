between<00:00:42.200> daylight<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.070> tungsten<00:00:43.280> which<00:00:43.699> fits

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
between daylight and tungsten which fits

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.950 
between daylight and tungsten which fits
the<00:00:44.210> environment<00:00:45.190> previously<00:00:46.190> with<00:00:46.519> my<00:00:46.760> z96<00:00:47.629> I

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
the environment previously with my z96 I

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.569 
the environment previously with my z96 I
would<00:00:48.199> have<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.469> go<00:00:48.559> search<00:00:48.829> for<00:00:48.859> my<00:00:49.190> filter

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
would have to go search for my filter

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.099 
would have to go search for my filter
which<00:00:49.760> would<00:00:49.940> probably<00:00:50.089> be<00:00:50.329> in<00:00:50.480> my<00:00:50.629> bag<00:00:50.929> and

00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:51.109 
which would probably be in my bag and

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:53.049 
which would probably be in my bag and
not<00:00:51.230> on<00:00:51.440> me<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:52.339> is<00:00:52.579> quite<00:00:52.820> annoying

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
not on me that is quite annoying

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.959 
not on me that is quite annoying
especially<00:00:53.329> if<00:00:53.749> you<00:00:53.870> lose<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:55.219> 600<00:00:55.670> LED

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
especially if you lose it the 600 LED

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.119 
especially if you lose it the 600 LED
has<00:00:56.179> its<00:00:56.449> functions<00:00:56.870> as<00:00:57.079> well<00:00:57.409> probably<00:00:58.010> one

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
has its functions as well probably one

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.520 
has its functions as well probably one
of<00:00:58.159> my<00:00:58.339> favorite<00:00:58.820> lights<00:00:59.089> however<00:00:59.420> you<00:01:00.350> have

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
of my favorite lights however you have

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.170 
of my favorite lights however you have
to<00:01:00.800> use<00:01:01.039> filtering<00:01:01.579> as<00:01:01.730> well<00:01:03.879> one<00:01:04.879> thing<00:01:05.089> I

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
to use filtering as well one thing I

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.580 
to use filtering as well one thing I
like<00:01:05.330> about<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:05.720> LED<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.230> that<00:01:06.380> has<00:01:06.560> a

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
like about this LED is that has a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.469 
like about this LED is that has a
battery<00:01:07.190> level<00:01:07.370> indicator<00:01:07.640> few<00:01:08.300> LEDs

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
battery level indicator few LEDs

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.620 
battery level indicator few LEDs
actually<00:01:09.080> have<00:01:09.320> this<00:01:09.560> however<00:01:10.510> button<00:01:11.510> is

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
actually have this however button is

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.810 
actually have this however button is
quite<00:01:11.870> hard<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.290> press<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:12.950> feels<00:01:13.520> quite

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
quite hard to press and feels quite

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.120 
quite hard to press and feels quite
flimsy<00:01:14.150> I'm<00:01:14.570> guessing<00:01:15.530> that<00:01:15.650> that's<00:01:15.860> going<00:01:16.040> to

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
flimsy I'm guessing that that's going to

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.350 
flimsy I'm guessing that that's going to
be<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:16.310> first<00:01:16.550> thing<00:01:16.730> to<00:01:16.850> break<00:01:17.030> on<00:01:17.210> this

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
be the first thing to break on this

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.080 
be the first thing to break on this
light<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:19.070> dimmer<00:01:19.280> on<00:01:19.490> this<00:01:19.700> light<00:01:19.910> is

needs to be replaced with something

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.039 
needs to be replaced with something
better

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
better

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.270 
better
secondly<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.200> case<00:01:51.439> has<00:01:51.709> these<00:01:51.950> annoying

everything<00:01:54.530> in<00:01:54.799> place<00:01:54.829> but<00:01:55.429> causes<00:01:56.000> quite<00:01:56.209> a

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
everything in place but causes quite a

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.690 
everything in place but causes quite a
few<00:01:56.539> issues<00:01:56.780> when<00:01:57.560> putting<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.039> light<00:01:58.189> in<00:01:58.429> and

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
few issues when putting the light in and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.330 
few issues when putting the light in and
taking<00:01:59.000> it<00:01:59.119> out<00:01:59.270> with<00:02:00.229> repeated<00:02:00.799> use<00:02:00.829> I'm

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
taking it out with repeated use I'm

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.099 
taking it out with repeated use I'm
guessing<00:02:01.819> that<00:02:01.939> it's<00:02:02.299> gonna<00:02:02.599> break<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:02.990> line

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
guessing that it's gonna break the line

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.199 
guessing that it's gonna break the line
eventually<00:02:03.739> I'm<00:02:03.890> definitely<00:02:04.879> not<00:02:05.000> gonna

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
eventually I'm definitely not gonna

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:08.949 
eventually I'm definitely not gonna
store<00:02:05.450> my<00:02:05.629> light<00:02:05.840> in<00:02:05.989> this<00:02:06.110> case<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:08.810> is<00:02:08.929> a

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
store my light in this case this is a

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.770 
store my light in this case this is a
