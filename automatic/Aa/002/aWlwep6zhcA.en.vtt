00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.840
 Hello everyone and today we have a video in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.900
 I want to create a jewelry 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.380
 teach how to make an unusual pendant and so 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.650
 for this you need we need 100 . 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.260
 here is such a thin here I immediately 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.570
 same we need double length 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.239
 your pendant here I have it already 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.719
 connected round then formed to us 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.820
 need two colors bead we will need 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.579
 here are such pins with a tip on the end 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.010
 soldered to them hard here and we need us 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.930
 there will be such pins with such tips on 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.489
 end of it all you can buy in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.890
 Shop for accessories 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.800
 so let's get down to it 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.719
 zigzag naboo bead sets 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.910
 so you can feel better you can always 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.129
 for example draw a diagram what are you 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.710
 want to make a pattern here you can do 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:13.100
 completely different pattern and so i'm well here we are 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.900
 We can gain and the amount of such 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.080
 of our here these pins here I am like 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.030
 I will attach where this is mine 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.610
 pins thats well i can make well 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:32.549
 the amount of length that will be put 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 fit so get down so I would take 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.880
 zigzag 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.000
 I've already drawn a diagram for myself 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.799
 I drew such a scheme for myself 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.860
 I will recruit it for you 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:52.409
 create any other scheme we are just here 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:59.969
 everything is very simple we recruit on our 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:02.479
 pin bead fits our 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.479
 scheme 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.300
 I read it here will be obtained 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.180
 on my trunks here on this one 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.150
 which of me will be 12 here 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:22.740
 such here pins with dialed beads 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.740
 get right now i'm typing 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.530
 how else do I have to dial 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.459
 but all the other pins you need 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.120
 will make 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.580
 similarly as I show it to you here 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.180
 now i typed after i 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.660
 typed 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.860
 i need to take pliers wick but 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.450
 pliers and pliers 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.590
 By the way, you'll need to forget it. 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.290
 here and make a ring here with me 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.860
 It turns out this here and I take on 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.220
 this pin or pin i like this 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:29.970
 just wear it like this 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.610
 need to do the rest of our 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.760
 BIS bead scheme is beneficial here 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:41.819
 here are the pins and so now I'm on 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.489
 made all her beaded pins 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.920
 and now we need to collect decorations 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.860
 for starters here and in this pin ring i 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.069
 I already hooked my chain to her 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.680
 parties now what we do we 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.470
 take our first 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.560
 we put a pin on our other 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.319
 pin and now we put on 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.340
 I chose to bead one to wear 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:10.280
 white and so here we have to wear everything 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.810
 our pins 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:18.530
 here it is through one bead constantly 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.530
 repeat 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.190
 you can alternate can give 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.330
 optional after one can wear 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.330
 eg after 2 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:42.560
 Well, for example, I chose that I will be through 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:45.110
 one dress for what we dress for 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.880
 that we have them on this pins 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.700
 they hung straight and nowhere they are not 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.040
 moved and didn’t move out if we don’t 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.910
 let's do that they will contain 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:58.640
 one common heap and be our reactions 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.350
 for example a pattern that is chosen but may 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.750
 be you this for example if you have everything 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.850
 plain pins can it on 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.850
 will equip such an idea 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:38.270
 two almost put on my clothes 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:40.940
 last thing we do now after 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.820
 As I here and so the whole thing here 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:49.310
 now we need to take 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:51.260
 round pliers and make a little ring but I tell you 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.540
 already in previous lessons showed how 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.620
 his business but until the end it does not close 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.300
 to hook our chain of him here everything 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.150
 just because the chain is narrowing 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:07.250
 captivity in the ring we just have to take 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.810
 one part to pull our chain there 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.500
 just this ring 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:17.680
 everything can now hold our little ring 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.680
 needle for this i use pliers 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:28.310
 initially you can’t get yourself yet 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:31.790
 help round-nose pliers twist here y 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.980
 I get such a pendant I became 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.890
 specially his long chain to 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:42.290
 don't make a clasp on it 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:44.270
 pendant is obtained on such a chain 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.550
 see when we put on beads 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.580
 he doesn’t go down to the general pile 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:52.070
 exactly hangs this one pin 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.930
 for example you can make a semicircle 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.700
 so that it does not hang exactly like that 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.400
 a little bit and shoes on you we will have you 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.590
 semicircle all thanks everyone for watching 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.860

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.860
