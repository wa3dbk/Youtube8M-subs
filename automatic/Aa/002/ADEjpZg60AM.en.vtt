00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
for a second when you realize what it is

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.980 
for a second when you realize what it is
you're<00:01:07.650> already<00:01:08.369> accepting<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.330> like<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.780> is

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
you're already accepting it like this is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.210 
you're already accepting it like this is
a<00:01:11.090> my<00:01:12.260> my<00:01:13.260> tastes<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.680> gonna<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> lot

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
a my my tastes are gonna be a lot

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.929 
a my my tastes are gonna be a lot
different<00:01:14.580> than<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.030> imagined<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:19.939> think

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
different than what I imagined I think

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.370 
different than what I imagined I think
also<00:01:21.090> it's<00:01:21.299> important<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.780> take<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> step<00:01:22.200> back

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
also it's important to take a step back

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.510 
also it's important to take a step back
and<00:01:24.229> when<00:01:25.229> you're<00:01:25.380> injured<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.830> don't<00:01:26.369> think

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
and when you're injured I don't think

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.570 
and when you're injured I don't think
it's<00:01:26.610> healthy<00:01:26.760> to<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.580> always

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
it's healthy to be like you know always

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.160 
it's healthy to be like you know always
there<00:01:29.760> and<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.600> can't<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.840> ready<00:01:30.990> wait

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
there and like we can't be ready wait

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.530 
there and like we can't be ready wait
never<00:01:31.350> ready<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.430> better<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.970> life<00:01:33.180> let

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
never ready it's better to life let

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.600 
never ready it's better to life let
yourself<00:01:33.900> all<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.560> way<00:01:34.590> down<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.040> then<00:01:35.369> like

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
yourself all the way down and then like

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.249 
yourself all the way down and then like
build<00:01:35.880> up<00:01:36.060> instead<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.450> cause<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> fact<00:01:37.080> is

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
build up instead of cause the fact is

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.840 
build up instead of cause the fact is
that<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.560> injury<00:01:37.830> not<00:01:38.009> housekeeper<00:01:38.460> well<00:01:38.610> so

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
that your injury not housekeeper well so

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.910 
that your injury not housekeeper well so
instead<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.450> hanging<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> like

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
instead of like hanging on and like

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.370 
instead of like hanging on and like
pretending<00:01:41.340> everything<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.670> okay<00:01:42.000> just<00:01:42.380> deal

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
pretending everything is okay just deal

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.819 
pretending everything is okay just deal
with<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.360> get<00:01:45.360> back<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.659> again

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.469 

it's<00:01:48.829> not<00:01:49.009> very<00:01:49.039> realistic<00:01:49.549> but<00:01:50.149> then<00:01:50.329> again

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
it's not very realistic but then again

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.359 
it's not very realistic but then again
do<00:01:50.749> you<00:01:50.810> have<00:01:50.929> like<00:01:51.170> all<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.649> media<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:52.039> asking

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
do you have like all the media is asking

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.739 
do you have like all the media is asking
like<00:01:52.520> what<00:01:52.729> about<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.060> World<00:01:53.240> Championships

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:53.749 
like what about the World Championships

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:56.109 
like what about the World Championships
is<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.200> impossible<00:01:54.469> and<00:01:55.069> like<00:01:55.640> nothing<00:01:55.880> is

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
is it impossible and like nothing is

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.609 
is it impossible and like nothing is
impossible<00:01:56.359> right<00:01:56.659> so<00:01:57.020> you're<00:01:57.170> just<00:01:57.319> sitting

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
impossible right so you're just sitting

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.550 
impossible right so you're just sitting
there<00:01:57.679> you're<00:01:57.920> like<00:01:58.159> impossible<00:01:58.909> no<00:01:59.569> it's

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
there you're like impossible no it's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.679 
there you're like impossible no it's
possible<00:02:00.799> but<00:02:01.729> like<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.299> doesn't<00:02:02.569> mean

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
possible but like it doesn't mean

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.069 
possible but like it doesn't mean
there's<00:02:02.869> like<00:02:02.990> a<00:02:03.020> 1%<00:02:03.799> chance<00:02:03.979> 5%<00:02:04.969> chance<00:02:05.179> 50%

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
there's like a 1% chance 5% chance 50%

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.249 
there's like a 1% chance 5% chance 50%
chance<00:02:06.640> it's<00:02:07.640> probably<00:02:08.030> closer<00:02:08.239> to<00:02:08.360> 5<00:02:08.509> and<00:02:08.929> 50

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
chance it's probably closer to 5 and 50

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.680 
chance it's probably closer to 5 and 50
but<00:02:09.700> I'm<00:02:10.700> not<00:02:10.970> gonna<00:02:11.120> say<00:02:11.269> something<00:02:11.599> is

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
but I'm not gonna say something is

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.720 
but I'm not gonna say something is
impossible<00:02:11.900> probably<00:02:12.890> not<00:02:13.099> gonna<00:02:13.250> happen<00:02:13.400> but

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
impossible probably not gonna happen but

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.309 
impossible probably not gonna happen but
everything<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.090> possible<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.780> I'm<00:02:15.019> just<00:02:15.230> I'm

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
everything is possible so I'm just I'm

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.680 
everything is possible so I'm just I'm
not<00:02:15.379> ruling<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.920> out<00:02:16.040> but<00:02:16.370> for<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.450> happen

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
not ruling it out but for that to happen

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.690 
not ruling it out but for that to happen
everything<00:02:18.560> would<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.040> run<00:02:19.190> perfect

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
everything would have to run perfect

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.690 
everything would have to run perfect
from<00:02:20.000> now<00:02:20.150> on<00:02:20.829> realistically<00:02:21.829> when<00:02:22.310> would<00:02:22.610> you

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
from now on realistically when would you

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.880 
from now on realistically when would you
like<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.180> be<00:02:23.299> back<00:02:23.599> on<00:02:23.780> skis<00:02:24.110> let's<00:02:24.620> put<00:02:24.799> it

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
like to be back on skis let's put it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.800 
like to be back on skis let's put it
this<00:02:25.010> way<00:02:25.220> we're<00:02:25.430> not<00:02:25.549> realistically<00:02:26.269> that's

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
this way we're not realistically that's

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.479 
this way we're not realistically that's
like<00:02:27.049> though<00:02:27.739> that's<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.160> tough<00:02:28.340> question

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
like though that's a tough question

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.009 
like though that's a tough question
because<00:02:28.940> those<00:02:29.180> like<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.720> have<00:02:29.810> being

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
because those like you have being

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.319 
because those like you have being
realistic<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:31.010> hoping<00:02:31.549> for<00:02:31.610> something<00:02:32.000> like

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
realistic and hoping for something like

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.140 
realistic and hoping for something like
how<00:02:32.510> do<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.780> put<00:02:32.959> those<00:02:33.079> two<00:02:33.590> together<00:02:33.680> so

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
how do you put those two together so

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.569 
how do you put those two together so
realistically<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.510> could<00:02:35.840> say<00:02:36.079> like

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
realistically I could say like

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.119 
realistically I could say like
mid-january<00:02:37.579> end<00:02:38.329> of<00:02:38.480> January<00:02:38.870> good<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.739> hope

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
mid-january end of January good I hope

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.420 
mid-january end of January good I hope
like<00:02:40.549> early<00:02:41.540> dinner<00:02:41.769> so<00:02:42.769> if<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.129> put<00:02:43.280> those

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
like early dinner so if you put those

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.280 
like early dinner so if you put those
two<00:02:43.489> together<00:02:43.700> let<00:02:44.150> me<00:02:44.299> like<00:02:44.480> mammoths

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
two together let me like mammoths

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.199 
two together let me like mammoths
generate<00:02:45.709> I'm<00:02:46.400> gonna<00:02:46.700> do<00:02:46.790> anything<00:02:46.940> stupid

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
generate I'm gonna do anything stupid

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.110 
generate I'm gonna do anything stupid
that<00:02:47.660> will<00:02:47.920> affect<00:02:48.920> anything<00:02:49.129> for<00:02:49.579> later<00:02:49.790> so

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
that will affect anything for later so

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.120 
that will affect anything for later so
it's<00:02:51.049> more<00:02:51.230> important<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:51.889> gets<00:02:52.040> on

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
it's more important that it gets on

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.089 
it's more important that it gets on
represent<00:02:52.549> it<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.329> can<00:02:53.480> win<00:02:53.630> races<00:02:53.780> again

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.929 

I've<00:02:57.640> had<00:02:57.879> the<00:02:58.150> last<00:02:58.659> couple<00:02:58.959> years<00:02:58.989> I've<00:02:59.319> been

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
I've had the last couple years I've been

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.309 
I've had the last couple years I've been
having<00:03:00.939> a<00:03:00.969> lot<00:03:01.090> of<00:03:01.120> good<00:03:01.329> animal<00:03:01.689> suit<00:03:01.870> graces

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
having a lot of good animal suit graces

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.039 
having a lot of good animal suit graces
and<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.799> think<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:04.989> have<00:03:05.139> looked<00:03:05.499> back<00:03:07.049> what

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
and I think if I have looked back what

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.979 
and I think if I have looked back what
grace<00:03:08.290> is<00:03:08.459> last<00:03:09.459> year<00:03:09.730> I'm<00:03:09.819> in<00:03:09.909> Borneo<00:03:10.329> special

grace is last year I'm in Borneo special

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.940 
grace is last year I'm in Borneo special
because<00:03:11.230> Borneo<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:11.799> so<00:03:12.040> tough<00:03:12.340> that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
because Borneo is so tough that

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.740 
because Borneo is so tough that
especially<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.040> last<00:03:15.219> part<00:03:15.340> is<00:03:15.849> like<00:03:16.120> inform

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
I mean I could for sure it'd be better

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.009 
I mean I could for sure it'd be better
in<00:03:42.040> gs<00:03:42.370> but<00:03:42.639> really<00:03:43.060> realistically<00:03:43.750> it's

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
in gs but really realistically it's

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.959 
in gs but really realistically it's
Donnellan<00:03:44.469> to<00:03:44.590> be<00:03:44.739> where<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.040> have<00:03:45.159> to<00:03:45.340> take<00:03:45.819> my

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:45.969 
Donnellan to be where I have to take my

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:49.470 
Donnellan to be where I have to take my
points<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:47.549> last<00:03:48.549> year<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.760> was<00:03:48.879> you<00:03:49.359> know<00:03:49.449> I

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
points and last year I was you know I

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.689 
points and last year I was you know I
wasn't<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.109> podium<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.650> every<00:03:51.040> single<00:03:51.489> speed

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
wasn't the podium and every single speed

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.209 
wasn't the podium and every single speed
race<00:03:51.879> I<00:03:52.120> think<00:03:52.739> from<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.859> start<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.129> the

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:54.219 
race I think from the start of the

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.839 
race I think from the start of the
season<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.669> then<00:03:55.919> after<00:03:56.919> just<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.639> into

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
season and then after just going into

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.970 
season and then after just going into
Olympics<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.599> I<00:03:59.079> all<00:03:59.439> of<00:03:59.469> a<00:03:59.530> sudden<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.859> was

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
Olympics and I all of a sudden I was

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.259 
Olympics and I all of a sudden I was
like<00:04:00.040> instead<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.519> being<00:04:00.699> one<00:04:00.879> two<00:04:01.060> three

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
like instead of being one two three

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.629 
like instead of being one two three
hours<00:04:01.389> like<00:04:01.689> four<00:04:02.019> or<00:04:02.079> five<00:04:02.199> six<00:04:02.409> and<00:04:02.769> that's

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
hours like four or five six and that's

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.729 
hours like four or five six and that's
just<00:04:04.030> when<00:04:04.720> you're<00:04:04.870> racing<00:04:05.169> against<00:04:05.379> someone

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
just when you're racing against someone

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.319 
just when you're racing against someone
who's<00:04:05.919> in<00:04:06.159> that<00:04:06.310> same<00:04:06.609> shape<00:04:06.879> like<00:04:07.120> they're

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
who's in that same shape like they're

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.580

all<00:04:07.569> on<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.810> podium<00:04:08.159> when<00:04:09.159> you<00:04:09.340> start<00:04:09.879> to<00:04:09.970> be

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
all on the podium when you start to be

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.710 
all on the podium when you start to be
number<00:04:11.590> five<00:04:11.939> then<00:04:12.939> that's<00:04:13.209> just<00:04:13.419> not<00:04:13.569> good

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
number five then that's just not good

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.249 
number five then that's just not good
enough<00:04:13.750> so<00:04:14.759> it's<00:04:15.759> a<00:04:16.030> little<00:04:16.570> bit<00:04:16.720> calendar<00:04:17.049> but

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:17.259 
enough so it's a little bit calendar but

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:18.779 
enough so it's a little bit calendar but
mostly<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:17.769> the<00:04:17.979> fact<00:04:18.159> that<00:04:18.250> I<00:04:18.459> just<00:04:18.639> wasn't

good<00:04:19.000> enough<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.419> wasn't<00:04:20.139> bad<00:04:20.289> but<00:04:20.500> this<00:04:20.650> just

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
good enough I wasn't bad but this just

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.469 
good enough I wasn't bad but this just
of<00:04:20.949> the<00:04:21.039> guys<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.370> were<00:04:21.909> even<00:04:22.030> better<00:04:22.150> for
