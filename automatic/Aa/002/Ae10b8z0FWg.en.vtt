00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.810
 and here 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.840
 next we will tackle the periodontium 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.619
 decay and fractures are not 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.470
 only causes of tooth loss the 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.539
 Periodontal disease can also be 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.670
 The origin 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.670
 but what is the periodontium 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.880
 the tooth is divided into two parts 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.690
 visible thanks to which we chew and 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.359
 a rooted in the bone 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.489
 the periodontium is constituted by 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.460
 four tissues that help to fix 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.070
 the tooth to the jaw 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.829
 the cement that covers the root 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.379
 linking the tooth ligament to the bone the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.390
 alveolar bone in which the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.390
 root and finally the gum 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.909
 Periodontal disease is a 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.159
 pathology that reaches one or several of 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.770
 these tissues 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.600
 It is evolutionary and starts with a 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.390
 inflammation of the gum 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.150
 in the most serious cases there is a 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.570
 fall of the alveolar bone and the tooth is 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.450
 see weakened 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.260
 but what are the symptoms of 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.260
 periodontal disease 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.070
 to start the gum becomes more red 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.890
 swollen and with a varnished look 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.159
 bleeding often accompanies this 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.159
 inflammation 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.820
 the gum tends to be mounted on the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.890
 tooth 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.370
 the patient then speaks many times 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.950
 of a tooth that moves 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.229
 it is often associated with bad breath 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.329
 there may also appear a certain 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.329
 sensitivity to cold and heat 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.700
 in some cases we can observe a 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.020
 small suppuration is taken for granted 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.319
 this destruction of tissues 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.270
 surrounding entail a short - term 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.430
 displacement of teeth and by 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.300
 consequently we will find teeth 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.490
 loose as well as food debris 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.680
 this can be very painful 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.310
 but because the disease arises 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.310
 periodontal 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.440
 bacteria that become aggressive are 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.440
 at the origin of these injuries 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.080
 the whitish segment plate composed 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.050
 essentially by bacteria it goes 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.880
 depositing on and under the gum 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.490
 if brushing does not eliminate it 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.520
 regularly this plate in contact with 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.530
 the saliva is mineralized and transformed 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.450
 in tartar 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.060
 the process of tissue destruction 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.400
 is underway 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.370
 there are factors that favor 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.000
 appearance of this periodontal disease 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:14.010
 stress depression depression smoking 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.440
 alcoholism as well as some 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.400
 generic diseases like diabetes 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.099
 or AIDS 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.060
 Family history is also 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:27.270
 must take into account 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.150
 but doctor what can we do in case of 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.890
 suffer this disease 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.319
 the treatment of the disease 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.050
 Periodontal will be done according to your 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.810
 degree of evolution 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.330
 to determine the severity the dentist 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.070
 will perform a check that you associate with a 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.740
 recognition with a check 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.810
 radiological examination once the 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.910
 diagnosis will draw up a plan 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.340
 treatment that will aim 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.050
 stop the progression and prevent 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.960
 recidivism 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.390
 in some cases a control of the plate 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.130
 bacterial and a dental cleaning will be 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.980
 enough 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:08.230
 but if necessary the dentist also 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.230
 may consider periodontal surgery 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.819
 what can we do to prevent this 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.730
 happen 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:18.600
 a basic rule remove the plate 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:23.030
 bacterial to fight this evil 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.700
 we must first locate it 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.020
 the plate developer will help us 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.389
 do what 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.849
 it is a tablet that the 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.729
 patient let melt in the mouth and that 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.520
 color plate this shows 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.180
 the lack of brushing and allows 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.910
 correct it 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.270
 to remove this plate the patient 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.759
 has numerous weapons we will remove the 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.150
 toothbrush brushes 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:54.270
 interdental floss toothpaste 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.150
 teeth the mouthwash the hydro 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.070
 drivers also called and irrigators 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:03.550
 dental and so on 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.460
 in conclusion it is important to remember a 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.530
 basic rule 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.100
 the absolute weapon to win the battle 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:14.360
 against dental plaque is the motivation 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.360
 constant of the patient 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.550
 and we thank you for your attention
