00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:16.229
 click on download wait 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:21.840
 possible and this month points 1 I don't 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:26.780
 the starting here is that we do them 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.829
 download to you certainly will not succeed 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:35.159
 because I had done before 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:37.619
 however click on the bomber is once 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:42.840
 done you will find yourself on the desktop 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.729
 this torrent file which is you 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.119
 you must unload a turning with yours 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.560
 so if you don't even have one there 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.930
 I leave in the description the link of 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.310
 utorrent which in my opinion is the best 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:03.500
 click here from all of them now 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.770
 on the download is the tenth time done 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.430
 open the file with a double click 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.550
 and you expect it to download files to 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.459
 referente sera in all thinks of 641 megs 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.440
 so it won't take anything and therefore 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.269
 guys unloader then once 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.879
