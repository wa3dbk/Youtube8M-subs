00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
decaying this this is the worst tower

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.770 
decaying this this is the worst tower
and<00:04:00.130> there<00:04:00.310> were<00:04:00.430> 20<00:04:00.670> new<00:04:00.910> lamps<00:04:01.270> on<00:04:01.420> here<00:04:01.570> for

and there were 20 new lamps on here for
Saturday<00:04:01.959> instead<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.680> 28<00:04:02.980> what<00:04:03.940> can<00:04:04.120> we<00:04:04.240> do

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
Saturday instead of 28 what can we do

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
Saturday instead of 28 what can we do
select<00:04:04.810> we<00:04:04.900> believe<00:04:05.140> because<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:08.050> the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
select we believe because of the the the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.100 
select we believe because of the the the
bull<00:04:08.620> Jonah<00:04:08.950> have<00:04:09.580> timeless<00:04:10.090> chain<00:04:10.330> we<00:04:10.930> can

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
bull Jonah have timeless chain we can

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.870 
bull Jonah have timeless chain we can
actually<00:04:11.410> reduce<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.980> amount<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.280> lamps<00:04:12.670> on

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
actually reduce the amount of lamps on

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.840 
actually reduce the amount of lamps on
there<00:04:13.150> instead<00:04:14.050> of<00:04:14.320> that<00:04:14.470> being<00:04:14.650> 28<00:04:15.430> will<00:04:15.760> be

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
there instead of that being 28 will be

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.930 
there instead of that being 28 will be
down<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.030> 20<00:04:16.919> so<00:04:17.919> we've<00:04:18.220> got<00:04:18.370> to<00:04:18.489> do<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.640> full

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
down to 20 so we've got to do a full

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.440 
down to 20 so we've got to do a full
