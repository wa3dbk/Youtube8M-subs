before they put the bourbon in it and
and<00:02:39.070> we<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.550> barrels<00:02:39.880> are<00:02:40.060> about

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and we get the barrels are about

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.380 
and we get the barrels are about
proximately<00:02:40.930> 24<00:02:41.380> years<00:02:41.530> old<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.300> there<00:02:43.300> have

proximately 24 years old and there have

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.860 
proximately 24 years old and there have
been<00:02:43.420> an<00:02:43.690> oak<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.670> does<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:46.420> does<00:02:46.600> have

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
been an oak and so it does it does have

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.750 
been an oak and so it does it does have
a<00:02:47.140> lot<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.650> flavor<00:02:47.920> left<00:02:48.220> over<00:02:48.489> from<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
a lot of the flavor left over from the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.580 
a lot of the flavor left over from the
bourbon<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.239> what<00:02:49.810> we<00:02:49.930> do<00:02:50.080> is<00:02:50.230> we<00:02:50.350> take<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
bourbon and what we do is we take the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.280 
bourbon and what we do is we take the
great<00:02:50.920> coffees<00:02:51.370> and<00:02:51.610> we<00:02:52.209> age<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.600> coffee's<00:02:53.140> in

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290

great coffees and we age the coffee's in
there<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.799> believe<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.310> in<00:02:54.400> parts<00:02:54.730> a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
there we believe that it in parts a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.240 
there we believe that it in parts a
unique<00:02:55.420> flavor<00:02:55.690> that<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.530> can<00:02:56.680> only<00:02:56.799> find<00:02:57.100> a

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
unique flavor that you can only find a

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.920 
unique flavor that you can only find a
velar<00:02:57.519> espresso<00:02:57.910> coffee<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.450> we're<00:02:58.630> doing<00:02:58.720> two

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
velar espresso coffee so we're doing two

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.930 
velar espresso coffee so we're doing two
unique<00:02:59.170> things<00:02:59.410> between<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.220> wood<00:03:00.400> fire<00:03:00.640> and
