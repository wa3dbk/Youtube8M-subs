hello everybody and welcome back to
another<00:00:02.580> quick<00:00:02.879> minecraft<00:00:03.389> tutorial<00:00:03.899> today

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
another quick minecraft tutorial today

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.630 
another quick minecraft tutorial today
I'm<00:00:04.470> going<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.650> be<00:00:04.710> showing<00:00:04.920> you<00:00:05.069> how<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.250> build

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
I'm going to be showing you how to build

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.639 
I'm going to be showing you how to build
two<00:00:05.819> on/off<00:00:06.270> block<00:00:06.600> swappers<00:00:07.109> these<00:00:07.410> are

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
two on/off block swappers these are

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.379 
two on/off block swappers these are
simply<00:00:07.950> block<00:00:08.220> swappers<00:00:08.610> hooked<00:00:08.849> up<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> tee

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
simply block swappers hooked up to a tee

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.480 
simply block swappers hooked up to a tee
flip-flop<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.200> give<00:00:10.650> them<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> practical<00:00:11.340> use

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
flip-flop to give them the practical use

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.280 
flip-flop to give them the practical use
of<00:00:11.700> displaying<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.630> state<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.110> T

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
of displaying the state of the T

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.129 
of displaying the state of the T
flip-flop<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:14.309> Green<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.639> four<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.420> red<00:00:15.960> is

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
flip-flop so Green is four on and red is

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.500 
flip-flop so Green is four on and red is
four<00:00:16.320> off<00:00:16.440> now<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.369> intended<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:17.940> use<00:00:18.300> as

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
four off now this is intended for use as

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.929 
four off now this is intended for use as
an<00:00:18.690> input<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.199> another<00:00:19.230> redstone<00:00:19.680> creation<00:00:20.369> ie

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
an input to another redstone creation ie

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.630 
an input to another redstone creation ie
a<00:00:21.240> door<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.750> mob<00:00:21.990> farm<00:00:22.230> or<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> mob<00:00:22.830> spawner<00:00:23.160> or

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
a door on mob farm or a mob spawner or

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.429 
a door on mob farm or a mob spawner or
any<00:00:23.850> kind<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.300> contraption<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.930> has<00:00:25.199> an

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
any kind of contraption that has an

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.500 
any kind of contraption that has an
on/off<00:00:25.859> state<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.210> visual

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
on/off state so that you have a visual

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.960 
on/off state so that you have a visual
indicator<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.320> let<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.680> know<00:00:28.859> if<00:00:29.099> it's<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.730> or

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
indicator to let you know if it's on or

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.240 
indicator to let you know if it's on or
off<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> reason<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.349> two<00:00:31.679> designs<00:00:32.070> is

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
off so the reason we have two designs is

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.280 
off so the reason we have two designs is
because<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> first<00:00:33.000> one<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.239> made<00:00:33.570> has<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
because the first one I made has the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.260 
because the first one I made has the
input<00:00:34.739> which<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.040> also<00:00:35.520> flush<00:00:35.880> with<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.120> wall

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
input which is also flush with the wall

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.869 
input which is also flush with the wall
above<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.200> block<00:00:37.440> swap<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.670> an

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
above the block swap up so there is an

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
above the block swap up so there is an
alternative<00:00:39.420> design<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> input

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
alternative design with the input

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.979 
alternative design with the input
alongside<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:42.300> we're<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.629> start<00:00:42.870> off

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
alongside it so we're going to start off

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.750 
alongside it so we're going to start off
by<00:00:43.200> building<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.680> smaller<00:00:44.070> design<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.670> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
by building the smaller design that you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.760 
by building the smaller design that you
see<00:00:44.789> right<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.300> now<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> build<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.590> you're

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
see right here now to build this you're

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.110 
see right here now to build this you're
going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> materials<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:47.969> in

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
going to need the materials that are in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.549 
going to need the materials that are in
this<00:00:48.239> chest<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.690> pause<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.020> video<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:49.469> you

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
this chest so pause the video if you

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.439 
this chest so pause the video if you
need<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> gather<00:00:50.039> those<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.550> build<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:51.000> we're

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
need to gather those to build this we're

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.000 
need to gather those to build this we're
gonna<00:00:51.570> start<00:00:51.870> off<00:00:51.930> by<00:00:52.050> placing<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.590> piston

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
gonna start off by placing the piston

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.560 
gonna start off by placing the piston
this<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.309> gonna<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> other<00:00:54.149> side<00:00:54.270> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
this is gonna be on the other side of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.420 
this is gonna be on the other side of
the<00:00:54.660> wall<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.199> block<00:00:55.500> right<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.949> will

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the wall so this block right here will

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.740 
the wall so this block right here will
be<00:00:56.579> where<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.760> wall<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.329> that's<00:00:57.449> gonna<00:00:57.570> be

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
be where the wall is and that's gonna be

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540 
be where the wall is and that's gonna be
flush<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.739> want<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> place

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
flush and what we want to do is place

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.939 
flush and what we want to do is place
five<00:00:59.879> blocks<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.660> remove<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:01.800> of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
five blocks like this remove all of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
five blocks like this remove all of
those<00:01:02.190> put<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.850> other<00:01:02.879> piston<00:01:03.480> there<00:01:03.600> facing

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
those put the other piston there facing

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.929 
those put the other piston there facing
into<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.229> middle<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.680> then<00:01:05.189> remove<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
into the middle and then remove that and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.910 
into the middle and then remove that and
then<00:01:06.090> back<00:01:06.270> here<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:07.049> need<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.290> put<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> sticky

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
then back here we need to put a sticky

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.190 
then back here we need to put a sticky
piston<00:01:08.130> facing<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.060> middle<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.479> well<00:01:09.689> so

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
piston facing into the middle as well so

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.630 
piston facing into the middle as well so
once<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:10.590> those<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.830> position<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.490> can

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
once you put those in position you can

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.370 
once you put those in position you can
put<00:01:11.760> your<00:01:11.880> green<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.390> red<00:01:12.930> wall<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.350> either

again pause the video if you need to see

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.160 
again pause the video if you need to see
that<00:02:05.880> we're<00:02:06.270> going<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> start<00:02:06.659> off<00:02:06.750> by<00:02:06.899> placing

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
that we're going to start off by placing

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.290 
that we're going to start off by placing
a<00:02:07.500> piston<00:02:07.979> again<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.670> other<00:02:08.789> side<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.209> this

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
a piston again so the other side of this

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.669 
a piston again so the other side of this
is<00:02:09.479> where<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.080> flush<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
is where it's going to be flush with the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.559 
is where it's going to be flush with the
wall<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.340> behind<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.849> piston<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.330> want<00:02:12.480> to

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
wall then behind this piston you want to

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.580 
wall then behind this piston you want to
place<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> block<00:02:13.080> here

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
place a block here

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.710 
place a block here
then<00:02:14.010> free<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.940> this<00:02:15.150> removed<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.629> one

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
then free like this removed the one

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.360 
then free like this removed the one
there<00:02:16.019> place<00:02:16.470> another<00:02:16.739> one<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.190> bottom

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
there place another one at the bottom

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.970 
there place another one at the bottom
then<00:02:17.760> go<00:02:17.910> up<00:02:18.060> by<00:02:18.239> one<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.720> block<00:02:19.170> here<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.590> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
then go up by one a block here and a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.619 
then go up by one a block here and a

what<00:03:00.959> we<00:03:01.049> need<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.290> do<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.590> put<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.829> block<00:03:02.099> into

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
what we need to do is put a block into

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.770 
what we need to do is put a block into
the<00:03:02.489> dropper<00:03:02.819> based<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.209> what<00:03:03.329> ones<00:03:03.510> at<00:03:03.660> the
