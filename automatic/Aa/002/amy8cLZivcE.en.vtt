fastest and easiest strategy guys for

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.480 
fastest and easiest strategy guys for
high<00:00:15.360> rounds<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:15.900> high<00:00:16.199> points<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.800> had<00:00:17.279> two

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
high rounds and high points I had two

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.859 
high rounds and high points I had two
hundred<00:00:17.760> twenty-five<00:00:18.150> thousand<00:00:18.480> points<00:00:18.630> i'll

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
hundred twenty-five thousand points i'll

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:19.849 
hundred twenty-five thousand points i'll
be<00:00:18.990> showing<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.320> later<00:00:19.590> in<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> video

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
be showing you this later in the video

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.830 
be showing you this later in the video
but<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> very<00:00:20.730> simple<00:00:21.119> trick<00:00:21.449> guys<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
but it's a very simple trick guys and

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.630 
but it's a very simple trick guys and
can<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.140> done<00:00:22.260> with<00:00:22.350> more<00:00:22.529> than<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.769> person<00:00:22.800> so

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
can be done with more than one person so

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.189 
can be done with more than one person so
what<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> first<00:00:24.210> suggest<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.689> buying<00:00:24.960> or

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
what I first suggest is buying or

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.439 
what I first suggest is buying or
actually<00:00:25.920> making<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> sliquifier<00:00:26.699> because

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
actually making the sliquifier because

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.689 
actually making the sliquifier because
the<00:00:27.539> sliquifier<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> key<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.189> it's

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
the sliquifier is the key to this it's

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.339 
the sliquifier is the key to this it's
so<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.420> best<00:00:30.630> probably<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> best

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
so it's the best probably the best

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.080 
so it's the best probably the best
Wonder<00:00:31.650> weapon<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:32.340> better<00:00:32.579> than<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.759> dg2

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
Wonder weapon it's better than the dg2

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.900 
Wonder weapon it's better than the dg2
and<00:00:33.300> will<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> war<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.079> black<00:00:34.290> ops<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.920> that's

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
and will the war in black ops and that's

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.280 
and will the war in black ops and that's
a<00:00:36.059> good<00:00:36.210> thing<00:00:36.270> because<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.989> thing<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.170> just

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
a good thing because this thing is just

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
a good thing because this thing is just
so<00:00:37.530> powerful<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.700> actually<00:00:39.450> like<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so powerful and it's actually like the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.750 
so powerful and it's actually like the
main<00:00:40.050> component<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.710> strategy<00:00:41.129> ball
