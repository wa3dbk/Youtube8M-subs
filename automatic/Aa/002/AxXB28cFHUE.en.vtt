00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.260
 hello guys and minutes in this new one 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.170
 video 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.629
 today we will see how to install the tea 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.220
 common hammond that adds weapons 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:21.859
 so let's start the installation immediately 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.880
 download your packages based 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.550
 this operating system xp and view 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.650
 download the ex point instead if it sells 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:37.070
 like the one I know the zip account 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:39.830
 so let's open first sorry package 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.000
 the package but why this folder 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.970
 I could start the program wait 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.320
 which makes install world if you want to make baku 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:54.310
 and easy rescue the sorry 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.310
 expect that the mod 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.070
 obviously the time it takes depends 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.230
 if you already have the downloaded mode there 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.910
 will put a little less time are 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:18.530
 daily from downloaded this goes 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.930
 directly here also that I entrust us 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.900
 a message will appear that said wife 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.790
 has been installed is how this asks 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.790
 they see the world and never did open 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.330
 open up a world 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.909
 and now I show you what adds this 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.750
 so you will understand he adds the weapons 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.560
 so we have this weapon with all the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.280
 related magazines on what I am now 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.650
 in creative creative then the penalty is 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.050
 as if we already have the bullets 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.050
 so I don't need to lose 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.129
 like this we'll see later so we have 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.050
 this that physical sibat does not shoot with 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.050
 the right mouse button 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.580
 then we have beautiful but hc 47 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.240
 then a foul 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.720
 with this was the sorry file 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:03:01.760
 then we have an intervention that 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:07.040
 strangely, that is, it does not show the mod 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.040
 then we have this 11 11 a 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.980
 let's say even if it were so 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.980
 enough for there to be an m16 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.720
 then a 911 mm1 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.170
 this is a two- dot m2 throw instead 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.910
 click 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:41.030
 you are only one side cable and one already flames 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.840
 in fact, like this, it seems to me that you are 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.420
 bazooka 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:53.090
 nay the M2M 203 are not already is a 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:59.080
 grenades I looked bino then then we have 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.080
 finally we have today 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.409
 these are actually the ammunition that 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:12.530
 you see the texture was made 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:17.799
 bad or that game error then 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.799
 we see we have this 4 to 1 m 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:27.580
 which type I don't find grenade launcher then 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.580
 this m60 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.720
 here I am then catch this make 10 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.720
 types of games 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.910
 what a mess with mp5 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.470
 a mouse 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.320
 how much you have just been born 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.900
 but shoot more then a spa spas 12 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.510
 these are all the weapons he adds 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.330
 this world made of tadpole world 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.940
 beautiful especially for lovers of this 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.600
 kind of thing indeed this is a 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.840
 mistake 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.290
 in fact he does it to put in a hero of 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.220
 texture of this way 19 enough 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:31.490
 funny ie beautiful maybe some names 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.950
 I don't know myself but I'm not a 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.510
 professional of weapons names 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.120
