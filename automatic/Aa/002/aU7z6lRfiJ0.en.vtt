it's<00:02:23.020> not<00:02:23.230> hard<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.500> figure<00:02:23.709> out<00:02:24.010> but<00:02:24.610> as<00:02:24.790> a<00:02:24.820> kid

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150

it's not hard to figure out but as a kid
it<00:02:25.390> definitely<00:02:25.959> threw<00:02:26.200> me<00:02:26.320> for<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.560> loop<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
it definitely threw me for a loop and

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.530 
it definitely threw me for a loop and
ended<00:02:27.310> up<00:02:27.430> getting<00:02:27.730> me<00:02:27.850> stuck<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.390> game

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.400 
ended up getting me stuck in the game
quite<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.930> bit<00:02:33.000> another<00:02:34.000> confusing<00:02:34.540> aspect<00:02:35.200> to

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
quite a bit another confusing aspect to

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.320 
quite a bit another confusing aspect to
nightmare<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.220> sleep<00:02:36.580> meter<00:02:36.820> at<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.030> top

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
nightmare is the sleep meter at the top

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.240 
nightmare is the sleep meter at the top
of<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.570> screen<00:02:37.840> once<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.739> drains<00:02:39.040> your

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
of the screen once it drains your

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.470 
of the screen once it drains your
character<00:02:39.640> will<00:02:39.820> enter<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.239> dream<00:02:40.420> world

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
character will enter the dream world

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.390 
character will enter the dream world
where<00:02:40.930> enemies<00:02:41.140> become<00:02:41.650> tougher<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.220> at

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
where enemies become tougher and at

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.130 
where enemies become tougher and at
times<00:02:42.610> will<00:02:43.000> summon<00:02:43.300> Freddy<00:02:43.630> for<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.900> quick

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
times will summon Freddy for a quick

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.260 
times will summon Freddy for a quick
fight<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:45.040> confusing<00:02:45.489> part<00:02:45.610> of<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.239> that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
fight the confusing part of it is that

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.090 
fight the confusing part of it is that
since<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.900> game<00:02:47.050> never<00:02:47.320> really<00:02:47.560> explains

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
since the game never really explains

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.040 
since the game never really explains
what<00:02:48.310> its<00:02:48.430> purpose<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.910> your<00:02:49.540> initial

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
what its purpose is your initial

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.570 
what its purpose is your initial
instinct<00:02:50.560> would<00:02:50.800> be<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.100> think<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.430> it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
instinct would be to think that it

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.840 
instinct would be to think that it
represented<00:02:52.120> your<00:02:52.239> health<00:02:56.280> there<00:02:57.280> isn't

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
represented your health there isn't

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.270 
represented your health there isn't
actually<00:02:58.090> a<00:02:58.450> life<00:02:58.870> bar<00:02:59.140> in<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.620> game<00:02:59.800> but<00:03:00.100> your
