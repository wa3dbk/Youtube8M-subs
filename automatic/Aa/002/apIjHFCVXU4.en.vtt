00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.950 
here is what it looks like
so<00:02:13.840> here's<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.830> blade<00:02:15.040> part<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:15.960> right

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
so here's the blade part of it right

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.640 
so here's the blade part of it right
there<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.730> as<00:02:18.730> we<00:02:19.000> scroll<00:02:19.330> across<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.230> camera

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
there and as we scroll across the camera

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.940 
there and as we scroll across the camera
it<00:02:20.710> seems<00:02:20.950> like<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.160> pretty<00:02:21.580> good<00:02:21.910> thing<00:02:22.950> right

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
it seems like a pretty good thing right

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.630 
it seems like a pretty good thing right
there<00:02:24.220> it<00:02:24.520> looks<00:02:24.910> like<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.420> an<00:02:25.570> initiate

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
there it looks like it's an initiate

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.070 
there it looks like it's an initiate
version<00:02:27.640> three<00:02:28.060> maybe<00:02:28.300> as<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.660> guys<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:29.020> see

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
version three maybe as you guys can see

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.960 
version three maybe as you guys can see
we<00:02:29.440> got<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:29.830> little<00:02:30.040> choke<00:02:30.430> point<00:02:30.760> right

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
we got this little choke point right

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.780 
we got this little choke point right
here<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:32.110> second<00:02:32.590> choice<00:02:32.800> oak<00:02:33.250> point<00:02:33.580> right

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
absolutely awesome I was I was I didn't

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.509 
absolutely awesome I was I was I didn't
know<00:03:16.750> what<00:03:16.959> to<00:03:16.990> expect<00:03:17.140> out<00:03:17.769> of<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.980> grab<00:03:18.220> bags

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
know what to expect out of the grab bags

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.240 
know what to expect out of the grab bags
but<00:03:19.420> this<00:03:19.450> choke<00:03:19.959> point<00:03:20.260> up<00:03:20.440> top<00:03:20.709> is<00:03:20.950> pretty

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
but this choke point up top is pretty

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.310 
but this choke point up top is pretty
awesome<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.910> then<00:03:22.360> having<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.780> second<00:03:23.200> one

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
awesome and then having the second one

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.160 
awesome and then having the second one
down<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:23.920> has<00:03:24.370> definitely<00:03:24.880> pretty<00:03:25.209> cool<00:03:25.450> so

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
down here has definitely pretty cool so

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.320 
down here has definitely pretty cool so
you<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.470> make<00:03:26.680> these<00:03:26.890> movements<00:03:27.880> like<00:03:28.180> that

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
you can make these movements like that

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.350 
you can make these movements like that
blocking<00:03:29.260> probably<00:03:30.220> can't<00:03:30.430> see<00:03:30.519> all<00:03:30.820> that<00:03:31.000> but

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
blocking probably can't see all that but

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.979 
blocking probably can't see all that but
it's<00:03:32.140> definitely<00:03:32.620> seems<00:03:33.420> pretty<00:03:34.420> good<00:03:34.570> the

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
it's definitely seems pretty good the

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.430 
it's definitely seems pretty good the
balance<00:03:35.380> point<00:03:35.470> is<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.959> little<00:03:37.959> bit<00:03:38.140> on<00:03:38.290> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
balance point is a little bit on the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.699 
balance point is a little bit on the
blade<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.860> seems<00:03:39.100> like<00:03:39.870> well<00:03:40.870> maybe<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.560> little

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
blade it seems like well maybe a little

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.340 
blade it seems like well maybe a little
bit<00:03:41.920> further<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.390> balance<00:03:43.720> points<00:03:44.080> like<00:03:44.320> a

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
bit further so the balance points like a

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.640 
bit further so the balance points like a
little<00:03:44.739> bit<00:03:44.860> on<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.130> blade<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:47.200> on<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.530> off

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
little bit on the blade the on and off

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.070 
little bit on the blade the on and off
switch<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:48.220> right<00:03:48.250> here<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:49.540> can<00:03:49.750> get<00:03:49.900> these

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
switch is right here you can get these

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.440 
switch is right here you can get these
things<00:03:50.290> with<00:03:50.560> sound<00:03:50.830> but<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.220> chose<00:03:51.610> not<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.150> but

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
things with sound but I chose not to but

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.800 
things with sound but I chose not to but
this<00:03:52.630> is<00:03:52.810> my<00:03:53.019> grab<00:03:53.350> bag<00:03:53.590> saver<00:03:54.450> I'll<00:03:55.450> have<00:03:55.630> to

this is my grab bag saver I'll have to

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.340 
this is my grab bag saver I'll have to
look<00:03:56.049> at<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.500> find<00:03:56.830> out<00:03:57.870> if<00:03:58.870> there's<00:03:59.080> any

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
look at it to find out if there's any

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.650 
look at it to find out if there's any
like<00:04:00.070> major<00:04:00.370> flaws<00:04:00.850> or<00:04:01.120> anything<00:04:01.480> in<00:04:01.570> the
