00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
long does it take to make like the

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.820 
long does it take to make like the
biplane<00:00:38.600> that<00:00:38.630> you<00:00:38.900> had<00:00:38.990> this<00:00:39.230> year<00:00:39.500> chicks

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
biplane that you had this year chicks

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.130 
biplane that you had this year chicks
bottom<00:00:40.280> about<00:00:40.520> 20<00:00:40.910> minutes<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:41.300> our<00:00:41.840> sewed

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
bottom about 20 minutes so our sewed

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.720 
bottom about 20 minutes so our sewed
with<00:00:42.170> four<00:00:42.620> cans<00:00:42.860> it's<00:00:43.040> really<00:00:43.250> easy

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
with four cans it's really easy

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.090 
with four cans it's really easy
this<00:00:44.270> is<00:00:44.450> really<00:00:44.660> a<00:00:44.690> simple<00:00:45.080> design<00:00:45.410> just<00:00:45.980> one

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
this is really a simple design just one

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.920 
this is really a simple design just one
a<00:00:46.130> lot<00:00:46.340> more<00:00:46.580> law<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:47.120> larger<00:00:47.450> one<00:00:47.630> takes

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
a lot more law the larger one takes

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.780 
a lot more law the larger one takes
about<00:00:48.050> an<00:00:48.200> hour<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:48.470> a<00:00:48.500> half<00:00:48.710> a<00:00:49.070> lot<00:00:49.550> more<00:00:49.760> a

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
about an hour and a half a lot more a

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.180 
about an hour and a half a lot more a
lot<00:00:50.000> more<00:00:50.059> cans<00:00:50.450> involved<00:00:51.170> because<00:00:51.650> a<00:00:51.770> lot

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
lot more cans involved because a lot

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.119 
lot more cans involved because a lot
more<00:00:52.400> detailed<00:00:53.120> time<00:00:53.620> basically<00:00:54.620> just<00:00:54.800> taking

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
more detailed time basically just taking

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.190 
more detailed time basically just taking
an<00:00:55.250> idea<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.879> going<00:00:56.120> forward<00:00:56.420> but<00:00:56.600> there's<00:00:57.050> an

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
an idea and going forward but there's an

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.299 
an idea and going forward but there's an
example<00:00:57.290> like<00:00:58.040> I<00:00:58.870> take<00:00:59.870> a<00:00:59.900> picture<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:00.710> then<00:01:00.770> I

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
example like I take a picture and then I

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.310 
example like I take a picture and then I
take<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.520> glance<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.090> I<00:01:02.180> try<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.450> copy<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:03.079> and

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
take a glance and I try to copy this and

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.100 
take a glance and I try to copy this and
I<00:01:03.829> take<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.070> jet<00:01:04.460> an<00:01:04.610> example<00:01:05.089> and<00:01:05.300> I<00:01:05.600> place<00:01:05.960> at

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
I take a jet an example and I place at

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.749 
I take a jet an example and I place at
the<00:01:06.170> front<00:01:06.440> you<00:01:06.770> can<00:01:06.920> kind<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:07.160> tell<00:01:07.400> looks

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
the front you can kind of tell looks

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.040 
the front you can kind of tell looks
similar<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.390> yeah<00:01:10.540> so<00:01:11.540> that's<00:01:11.750> where<00:01:11.930> you

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
similar to it yeah so that's where you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.109 
similar to it yeah so that's where you
get<00:01:12.170> all<00:01:12.350> your<00:01:12.380> ideas<00:01:12.950> books<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:13.610> magazines
