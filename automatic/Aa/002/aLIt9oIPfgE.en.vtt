 then h &amp; m 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 first of all start with one 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.180
 low hard as it enchants and before applying the foundation this is one 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.230
 basic makeup base 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.399
 cemetery workshop the green shop 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:30.109
 which works to apply as if it were a cream 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.850
 the whole viscount 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.260
 to this color 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.380
 White - 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.380
 however on the fixed it appears to stick 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.660
 in the vintage then apply all over the face 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.290
 in order to get an effect more 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.760
 poplar the in cossato + mat 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.280

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.490
 even to say stalin we exist creates a% pearlescent makeup base lacie releases 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.740
 dankim glitter though 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 I don't like it they prefer feather effect 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.430
 now 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.020
 certainly certain to the application of the foundation i uses a foundation 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.940
 fluid 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.880
 star max factor 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.340
 xevoz kinda foundation 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.440
 he is my start at 79 years old 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.240
 therefore kant for greater caution I use the fluid foundation rather 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.490
 that the mineral even if it is more alternate 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.250
 the muni delle police can be applied to the fluid foundation 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.940
 sponges so triangular 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.110
 or you want in the appropriate foundation brush 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.340
 this brush is the one in the green shop 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.690
 I am doing well with 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.530
 but low, maybe they were just a beginner from the big black 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.190
 so easy 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.100
 to beat 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.560
 and therefore I recommend however for a greater one for viscica also 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.369
 to be faster, use these ideas here 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.969

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.949

 nuancier so 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.199
 on the neck 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.199
 is very important 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:28.409
 because here we go tables relative caldura 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.090
 between the break we say trailler 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.439
 never seen and the neck 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:37.489
 and therefore designs also apply it on not just the neck 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.429
 mado starts with the split 

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.969
 -here we go 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.969

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:25.419
 because even on the areas that should not be given the break between the face he was chia 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.289
 to uniform everything 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:32.289
 we also go on the old soap dish 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:42.540
 how to sell this foundation a very natural grandmother effect 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.930
 it is not a foundation of those same where you see the difference 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.519
 the president provides that we have the foundation and then 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.229
 I recommend it 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.339
 verbania 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:09.179
 we check well if we have 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:11.779
 apply the foundation 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.779
 in all points 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.049
 you stink 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.279

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.409
 the excesses 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.509
 the foundation 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.479
 that may have remained models get more effect 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.370
 Unifarma 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.529
 it's more natural 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.400
 this way 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.930
 after the pkk we take a corrector any course use of the maiden in 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.969

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.629
 and let's go put 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:56.900
 courses 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.629
 in this way 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.899
 also with regard to the drawing up of the corrector we can 

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:06.899
 use a brush to wither from runs stand 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.389

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.309
 how can it be 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:14.139
 these here 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:17.099
 I simply go 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:20.279
 I have with the brush a 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:21.909
 dab 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:24.210
 the well areas 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.370
 in order to 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.509
 have the product absorbed 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.919
 we have the dark circles therefore how to withdraw 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.930
 slowly or simply 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.699
 dab 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.110

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.879
 the products 

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:43.879
 so that it is absorbed perfectly 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.710
 in this way 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:01.129
 and then we go maybe to fix up 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:03.490
 with the sponge 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.569
