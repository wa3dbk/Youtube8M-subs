00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
bar up to raise up the other side like

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.859 
bar up to raise up the other side like
so<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.019> let<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.379> fall<00:01:04.589> underneath<00:01:05.869> and

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
so and just let that fall underneath and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.789 
so and just let that fall underneath and
now<00:01:07.580> make<00:01:08.580> sure<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.760> got<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:11.600> everyo<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.590> it's

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
now make sure I got it everyo so it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.560 
now make sure I got it everyo so it's
not<00:01:13.920> quit<00:01:14.250> under<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.420> there

weren't<00:01:15.960> secured<00:01:16.320> hopefully<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:20.030> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
weren't secured hopefully and it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.660 
weren't secured hopefully and it
retracts<00:01:21.299> back<00:01:23.659> now<00:01:28.250> but<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.430> still<00:01:29.490> a

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
retracts back now but it's still a

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.319 
retracts back now but it's still a
little<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.000> loose<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:31.880> just<00:01:32.880> didn't<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
little bit loose I just didn't have the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.590 
little bit loose I just didn't have the
tightness<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.290> he<00:01:34.380> used<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> what<00:01:36.540> I'm

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
tightness that he used to so what I'm

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.310 
tightness that he used to so what I'm
gonna<00:01:36.689> do<00:01:37.549> lift<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.640> back<00:01:38.909> up

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.460 

and<00:01:44.100> try<00:01:45.200> another<00:01:46.200> loop<00:01:47.960> then<00:01:48.960> pull<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.440> back

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and try another loop then pull it back

00:01:49.470 --> 00:02:05.990 
and try another loop then pull it back
on<00:01:49.860> again<00:02:02.540> no<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.690> too<00:02:03.840> tight<00:02:04.760> okay

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
on again no it's too tight okay

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.760 
on again no it's too tight okay
no<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.450> still<00:02:06.660> I<00:02:09.229> did<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.380> one<00:02:10.530> other<00:02:10.679> time

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
no it's still I did this one other time

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.100 
no it's still I did this one other time
that<00:02:11.100> came<00:02:11.190> out<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.400> right<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.240> couldn't

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
that came out of right but I couldn't

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.420 
that came out of right but I couldn't
get<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.290> right<00:02:13.440> angles<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:13.950> everything<00:02:14.010> I

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
get the right angles and everything I

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.360 
get the right angles and everything I
couldn't<00:02:14.760> do<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:14.910> while<00:02:15.030> holding<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:17.450> but

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
couldn't do it while holding this but

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.750 
couldn't do it while holding this but
see<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.790> still<00:02:21.209> fix<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:22.400> at<00:02:23.400> least<00:02:23.580> half

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
see if I can still fix it at least half

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:35.930 
see if I can still fix it at least half
ass<00:02:23.970> back<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.270> where<00:02:24.570> it<00:02:24.630> was<00:02:26.209> okay<00:02:34.940> twice

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
ass back to where it was okay twice

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.050 
ass back to where it was okay twice
again<00:02:37.220> or<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.550> keep<00:02:38.670> loop

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
again or I can just keep loop

00:02:39.060 --> 00:03:12.770 
again or I can just keep loop
yeah<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.450> worked<00:02:43.970> twist<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> few<00:02:45.300> times

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.970 

there<00:03:13.780> we<00:03:13.930> go<00:03:14.080> I<00:03:15.690> got<00:03:16.690> just<00:03:17.170> enough<00:03:17.349> spring<00:03:17.769> to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
there we go I got just enough spring to

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.350 
there we go I got just enough spring to
it<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.709> when<00:03:21.069> you<00:03:21.129> move<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.459> back<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.819> forth

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
it and when you move this back and forth

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.640 
it and when you move this back and forth
it<00:03:23.260> doesn't<00:03:23.590> affect<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.250> yeah<00:03:25.650> moving

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
it doesn't affect this and yeah moving

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.990 
it doesn't affect this and yeah moving
back<00:03:26.799> forth<00:03:27.129> it's<00:03:27.489> not<00:03:27.640> really<00:03:27.849> doing

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
back forth it's not really doing

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.070 
back forth it's not really doing
anything<00:03:28.239> it's<00:03:29.170> because<00:03:29.379> there's<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.860> little

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
anything it's because there's a little

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.570 
anything it's because there's a little
middle<00:03:32.080> deal<00:03:32.290> on<00:03:32.349> the<00:03:32.440> inside<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:33.190> just<00:03:33.400> kind

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
middle deal on the inside it's just kind

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.960 
middle deal on the inside it's just kind
of<00:03:33.700> in<00:03:34.000> there<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.980> that's<00:03:36.430> how<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.640> fix<00:03:36.819> your

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
of in there and that's how you fix your

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.539 
of in there and that's how you fix your
whammy<00:03:37.150> bar<00:03:39.599> all<00:03:40.599> you<00:03:40.720> have<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:40.959> do<00:03:41.079> is<00:03:41.709> take

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
whammy bar all you have to do is take

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.349 
whammy bar all you have to do is take
apart<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:43.450> back<00:03:44.220> which<00:03:45.220> consists<00:03:45.760> of<00:03:45.879> two

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
apart the back which consists of two

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:56.400 
apart the back which consists of two
kind<00:03:49.359> of<00:03:49.480> small<00:03:49.900> screws<00:03:53.849> three<00:03:55.140> kind<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.230> big

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
kind of small screws three kind of big

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.069 
kind of small screws three kind of big

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
screws and the rest of them I don't I

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.059 
screws and the rest of them I don't I
didn't<00:04:02.379> really<00:04:02.590> count<00:04:03.060> but<00:04:04.060> there<00:04:04.329> is<00:04:05.069> X
