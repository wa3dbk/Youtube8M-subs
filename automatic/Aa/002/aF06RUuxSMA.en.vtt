00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
feel like my skin is getting really

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.410 
feel like my skin is getting really
accustomed<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.230> there<00:02:32.379> is<00:02:32.409> no<00:02:33.420> there

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420

bottle doesn't have the number of the
foundation<00:05:25.300> on<00:05:25.419> it<00:05:25.449> so<00:05:25.900> if<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.259> lose<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.830> box

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:27.069 
foundation on it so if you lose the box

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.860 
foundation on it so if you lose the box
that<00:05:27.280> you<00:05:27.340> bite<00:05:27.550> in<00:05:27.789> and<00:05:28.000> you<00:05:28.479> forget<00:05:28.840> what

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
that you bite in and you forget what

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.809 
that you bite in and you forget what
number<00:05:29.289> it<00:05:29.380> is<00:05:29.469> you're<00:05:29.770> not<00:05:29.919> gonna<00:05:30.130> be<00:05:30.340> able<00:05:30.430> to

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:30.819 
number it is you're not gonna be able to

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.100 
number it is you're not gonna be able to
figure<00:05:31.000> it<00:05:31.180> out<00:05:31.270> unless<00:05:31.449> you<00:05:31.569> get<00:05:31.750> matched

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
figure it out unless you get matched

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.559 
figure it out unless you get matched
again<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:33.370> that's<00:05:33.729> something<00:05:34.150> that<00:05:34.360> I<00:05:34.419> don't

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:34.569 
again so that's something that I don't

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.459 
again so that's something that I don't
really<00:05:34.659> like<00:05:34.780> because<00:05:35.080> every<00:05:35.380> other

00:05:35.459 --> 00:05:35.469 
really like because every other

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:37.770
