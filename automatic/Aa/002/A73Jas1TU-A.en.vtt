look at the picture ok the doctors told
her<00:00:50.309> she<00:00:50.539> has<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.780> turn<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.199> screw<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:53.239> each<00:00:54.239> leg

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
her she has to turn a screw on each leg

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.569 
her she has to turn a screw on each leg
4<00:00:55.890> times<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.280> day<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:57.949> what<00:00:58.949> happens<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
4 times a day and what happens with that

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.119 
4 times a day and what happens with that
is<00:00:59.789> quote<00:01:00.420> based<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> principle<00:01:01.949> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
is quote based on the principle of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.359 
is quote based on the principle of
tension<00:01:02.789> stress<00:01:03.500> bone<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.799> soft<00:01:05.159> tissue

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
tension stress bone and soft tissue

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.820 
tension stress bone and soft tissue
including<00:01:06.360> skin<00:01:06.630> muscle<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.260> neurovascular

including skin muscle and neurovascular

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.460 
including skin muscle and neurovascular
structures<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:09.030> heal<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.630> regenerate<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.380> a

predictable<00:01:10.920> manner<00:01:10.979> under<00:01:11.430> tension<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.500> what

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
predictable manner under tension so what

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.780 
predictable manner under tension so what
they're<00:01:13.770> doing<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.130> essentially<00:01:14.520> they

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
they're doing is essentially they

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.149 
they're doing is essentially they

later<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.340> your<00:02:05.460> life<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.880> think<00:02:05.909> there

later on in your life I think there

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.459 
later on in your life I think there
might<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.390> some<00:02:06.719> deeper<00:02:07.170> seeded

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
might be some deeper seeded

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.199 
might be some deeper seeded
psychological<00:02:08.250> issue<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.670> leading<00:02:08.970> you

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
psychological issue that's leading you

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.699 
psychological issue that's leading you
in<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.450> direction<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.289> might<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.470> be

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
in that direction and it might not be

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.750 
in that direction and it might not be
the<00:02:10.860> best<00:02:11.039> thing<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> do

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
the best thing to do

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.520 
the best thing to do
so<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.629> always<00:02:13.110> get<00:02:13.260> caught

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
so I always get caught

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.530 
so I always get caught
between<00:02:13.860> my<00:02:14.400> libertarian<00:02:15.120> side<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.740> my

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
between my libertarian side and my

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.720 
between my libertarian side and my
genuine<00:02:18.540> concern<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.230> humanity<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.220> wanting

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
genuine concern for humanity and wanting

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.520 
genuine concern for humanity and wanting
to<00:02:20.760> look<00:02:21.000> out<00:02:21.240> for<00:02:21.420> people's<00:02:21.810> well-being<00:02:22.050> and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
to look out for people's well-being and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.260 
to look out for people's well-being and
sometimes<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.340> think<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.730> those<00:02:24.030> things

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
sometimes I think that those things

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.630 
sometimes I think that those things
conflict<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.560> mean<00:02:25.860> with<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.130> here

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
conflict and I mean with this here

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640 
conflict and I mean with this here
I<00:02:26.670> guess<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.390> counter-argument<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.170> well

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
I guess the counter-argument is well

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.380 
I guess the counter-argument is well
really<00:02:29.280> how<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.850> different<00:02:29.970> than<00:02:30.209> any

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
really how is it different than any

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.960 
really how is it different than any
plastic<00:02:30.840> surgery<00:02:31.110> right<00:02:31.640> okay<00:02:32.640> it's<00:02:32.790> like

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
plastic surgery right okay it's like

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.710 
plastic surgery right okay it's like
getting<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.330> nose<00:02:33.480> job

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
getting a nose job

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.150 
getting a nose job
none<00:02:34.110> wrong<00:02:34.290> with<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> nose<00:02:34.560> job<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:35.040> like

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
none wrong with a nose job it's like

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.000 
none wrong with a nose job it's like
getting<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.760> I<00:02:36.030> something<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.319> lift<00:02:37.680> or<00:02:37.800> whatever

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
getting a I something I lift or whatever

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.430 
getting a I something I lift or whatever
the<00:02:38.100> fuck<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.370> called<00:02:39.020> nothing<00:02:40.020> wrong<00:02:40.260> with

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
the fuck it's called nothing wrong with

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.530 
the fuck it's called nothing wrong with
that<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.890> know<00:02:41.010> it's<00:02:41.430> just<00:02:41.580> people<00:02:42.209> want<00:02:42.420> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
that you know it's just people want to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.600 
that you know it's just people want to
get<00:02:43.170> more<00:02:43.350> self-confidence<00:02:44.100> look<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.430> little

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
get more self-confidence look a little

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.210 
get more self-confidence look a little
better<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:45.300> they<00:02:45.450> do<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.750> again<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.230> I'm<00:02:47.040> not

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
better so they do it again I I'm not

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.590 
better so they do it again I I'm not
judging<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:47.730> no<00:02:47.790> problem<00:02:48.180> with<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.330> is

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
judging I have no problem with it is

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.770 
judging I have no problem with it is
this<00:02:48.750> really<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.170> much<00:02:49.470> worse<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:50.690> don't<00:02:51.690> know

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
this really that much worse I don't know

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.470 
this really that much worse I don't know
I<00:02:51.810> guess<00:02:52.080> my<00:02:52.230> answer<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.590> yes<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.100> no<00:02:53.480> no

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
I guess my answer is yes and no no

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.509 
I guess my answer is yes and no no
because<00:02:54.810> whatever<00:02:55.019> do<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.680> but<00:02:55.920> yes<00:02:56.130> because

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
because whatever do you but yes because

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.699 
because whatever do you but yes because
it's<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.000> invasive<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.110> you're<00:02:58.200> probably<00:02:58.410> in

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
it's so invasive and you're probably in

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.940 
it's so invasive and you're probably in
so<00:02:59.010> much<00:02:59.280> pain<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.959> it's<00:03:00.959> just<00:03:01.230> you're<00:03:01.650> going

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
so much pain and it's just you're going

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.820 
so much pain and it's just you're going
through<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.459> much<00:03:02.850> trouble<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.630> get<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.319> payoff

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
through so much trouble to get a payoff

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.460 
through so much trouble to get a payoff
that<00:03:04.860> might<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:05.459> even<00:03:05.640> be<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.060> great<00:03:06.470> but

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
that might not even be that great but

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.809 
that might not even be that great but
then<00:03:07.590> again<00:03:07.680> Who<00:03:07.920> am<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.190> say<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.459> what

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
then again Who am I to say that what

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.460 
then again Who am I to say that what
would<00:03:09.120> be<00:03:09.269> good<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.780> what<00:03:09.959> would<00:03:10.110> be<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> bad

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
would be good and what would be a bad

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.140 
would be good and what would be a bad
payoff<00:03:10.769> so<00:03:10.950> again<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.250> really<00:03:11.610> don't<00:03:11.640> know<00:03:11.910> I'm

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
payoff so again I really don't know I'm

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.750 
payoff so again I really don't know I'm
caught<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.840> middle<00:03:13.069> please<00:03:14.069> don't<00:03:14.400> do<00:03:14.580> it
