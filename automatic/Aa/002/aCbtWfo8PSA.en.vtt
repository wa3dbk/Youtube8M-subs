00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.390
 then let's see who 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.820
 catalog as the most 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.139
 dangerous of the country it is about the 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.139
 150 road 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.510
 and driving in Mexico has never been easy 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.460
 and the accidents of the last weeks 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.020
 have stressed how dangerous it can be 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.020
 move through the roads of the country 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.000
 but what exactly are the 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.000
 most dangerous roads of mexico 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.179
 official statistics suggest that 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.309
 There are two routes that concentrate the 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.289
 greater number of accidents in the last 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.600
 decade the first is one of the most 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.519
 busy and an obvious answer is the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.500
 mexico-querétaro but the second is a 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:59.769
 toll road that connects to puebla 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.769
 with córdoba in veracruz the route 150 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.260
 mainly for civil reasons 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.350
 the smallest units are those that 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.299
 Sometimes problems arise a lot 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.420
 heavy traffic of what is the stretch of 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:20.170
 san martín texmelucan to hope and 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.659
 there is very little surveillance situation if 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.890
 they realize is a stretch that in its great 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.890
 part is straight 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.920
 this stretch of just 200 kilometers 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.509
 heavily traveled by transports 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.159
 heavy have a long history of 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.170
 claims includes the summits of 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.720
 mistreat an area famous for conditions 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 Adverse as rails rails 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.920
 narrow and haze 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.110
 and for being in permanent state of 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.480
 repair to try to reduce the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.030
 landslides for the hairs that run through it 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.230
 continuously the route deserves respect not 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.230
 there are few who have death 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.409
 and where comes something that gets pretty 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:06.770
 Thicken birds look 56 meters 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.700
 sometimes I wanted to handle this with the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.810
 drink 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.810
 when sounds in the mold 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.670
 the party as third parties 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.020
 6 years ago this area became famous for 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.430
 be scenarios of one of the worst 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.280
 road accidents of which 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.810
 have a record in the history of mexico 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.280
 53 people died in an incident in 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.500
 the one that combined the lack of brakes 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.510
 a human error and especially the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.020
 faulty signaling ramp 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.020
 security 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:49.019
 here it shows that it was not 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.019
 that training 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.390
 problem lies in that after passing 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.030
 in a mountainous area they are already down to this 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.730
 pending with the braces walls and a lot 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.860
 speed and a few meters later it 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.080
