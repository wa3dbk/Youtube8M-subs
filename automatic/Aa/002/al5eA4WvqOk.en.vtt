00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.550 

Christmas<00:01:12.079> I<00:01:13.630> probably<00:01:14.630> never<00:01:14.930> landed<00:01:15.350> in<00:01:15.470> a

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
Christmas I probably never landed in a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.300 
Christmas I probably never landed in a
stronger<00:01:15.950> crosswind<00:01:16.430> than<00:01:16.520> this

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.040 

if<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.400> put<00:01:22.580> my<00:01:22.730> wing<00:01:22.910> down<00:01:23.120> right<00:01:23.360> now<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:23.810> went

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
if I put my wing down right now and went

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.900 
if I put my wing down right now and went
straight<00:01:24.260> it<00:01:25.010> would<00:01:25.130> just<00:01:25.340> shove<00:01:25.550> me<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.820> the

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
straight it would just shove me to the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.010 
straight it would just shove me to the
ground

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
it was a real good strong crosswind but

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.509 
it was a real good strong crosswind but
I<00:02:30.080> didn't<00:02:30.709> much<00:02:30.830> more<00:02:31.040> than<00:02:31.190> getting<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.459> the

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
I didn't much more than getting in the

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.490 
I didn't much more than getting in the
air<00:02:31.670> they're<00:02:32.510> just<00:02:32.720> really<00:02:32.870> shifted<00:02:33.379> it

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
air they're just really shifted it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.199 
air they're just really shifted it
turned<00:02:33.739> into<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.010> real<00:02:34.220> corporate<00:02:34.580> tailwind

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
turned into a real corporate tailwind

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.990 
turned into a real corporate tailwind
and<00:02:35.480> it<00:02:36.470> was<00:02:36.620> really<00:02:36.800> hairy<00:02:37.099> they're<00:02:37.819> just

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
and it was really hairy they're just

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.780 
and it was really hairy they're just
about<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:39.620> about<00:02:39.709> couldn't<00:02:40.099> keep<00:02:40.190> flying<00:02:40.489> I

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
about just about couldn't keep flying I

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.030 
about just about couldn't keep flying I
couldn't<00:02:41.090> gain<00:02:41.209> any<00:02:41.420> altitude<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.080> did<00:02:42.739> finally

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
couldn't gain any altitude I did finally

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.009 
couldn't gain any altitude I did finally
get<00:02:43.250> up<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.610> little<00:02:43.910> ways<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.269> then<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.660> just

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
get up a little ways and then I I just

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.559 
get up a little ways and then I I just
went<00:02:45.769> ahead<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.130> landed<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.730> runways<00:02:47.360> long

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
went ahead and landed the runways long

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:48.970 
went ahead and landed the runways long
enough<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:47.900> climbed<00:02:48.200> up<00:02:48.349> and<00:02:48.560> went<00:02:48.680> right<00:02:48.830> back

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
enough I climbed up and went right back

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.890 
enough I climbed up and went right back
down<00:02:49.090> right<00:02:50.090> I<00:02:50.120> better<00:02:50.330> get<00:02:50.450> this<00:02:50.599> thing<00:02:50.660> on

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
down right I better get this thing on

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.300 
down right I better get this thing on
the<00:02:51.049> ground<00:02:51.319> you<00:02:51.500> can't<00:02:51.709> see<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.010> runway

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
the ground you can't see the runway

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.530 
the ground you can't see the runway
because<00:02:52.370> I'm<00:02:52.580> crabbing<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.120> much<00:02:53.299> right<00:02:53.510> now

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540
