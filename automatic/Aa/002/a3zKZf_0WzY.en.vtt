regurgitate some shit and sell it and
you<00:04:03.969> know<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.120> actually<00:04:04.780> worked<00:04:04.989> they<00:04:05.799> are<00:04:05.859> now

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
you know it actually worked they are now

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.039 
you know it actually worked they are now
the<00:04:06.099> biggest<00:04:06.430> selling<00:04:07.329> first-person<00:04:07.750> shooter

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
the biggest selling first-person shooter

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.789 
the biggest selling first-person shooter
in<00:04:08.139> history<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:10.120> I<00:04:10.810> honestly<00:04:11.319> just<00:04:11.560> don't

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
in history and I I honestly just don't

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.949 
in history and I I honestly just don't
think<00:04:12.069> they<00:04:12.159> deserve<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:12.699> if<00:04:13.090> any<00:04:13.329> game<00:04:13.629> at

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
think they deserve that if any game at

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.509 
think they deserve that if any game at
first<00:04:14.289> person<00:04:14.590> shooter<00:04:14.829> wise<00:04:14.949> deserves<00:04:15.340> that

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
first person shooter wise deserves that

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.399 
first person shooter wise deserves that
it's<00:04:15.909> probably<00:04:16.299> one<00:04:16.750> of<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.900> half<00:04:17.079> lives

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
it's probably one of the half lives

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:19.499 
it's probably one of the half lives
those<00:04:17.889> are<00:04:18.070> just<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.310> best<00:04:18.579> all-around<00:04:19.030> first

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:19.509 
those are just the best all-around first

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.390 
those are just the best all-around first
person<00:04:19.900> shooter<00:04:20.259> experience<00:04:20.829> in<00:04:20.979> my<00:04:21.099> opinion

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
person shooter experience in my opinion

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.540 
person shooter experience in my opinion
they<00:04:22.120> really<00:04:22.360> immerse<00:04:22.719> you<00:04:22.900> in<00:04:23.050> this<00:04:23.400> you<00:04:24.400> know

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
they really immerse you in this you know

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.540 
they really immerse you in this you know
so<00:04:25.060> although<00:04:25.750> i<00:04:26.260> do<00:04:26.409> like<00:04:26.560> modern<00:04:27.070> warfare<00:04:27.250> it

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
so although i do like modern warfare it

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.170 
so although i do like modern warfare it
it's<00:04:27.669> more<00:04:27.789> of<00:04:27.909> like<00:04:27.940> an

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
it's more of like an

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.270 
it's more of like an
arcade<00:04:28.570> shooter<00:04:28.600> just<00:04:29.229> super<00:04:29.470> fast<00:04:29.740> pace<00:04:30.039> and

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
arcade shooter just super fast pace and

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.659 
arcade shooter just super fast pace and
everything<00:04:30.639> I<00:04:31.630> just<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.650> don't<00:04:32.830> know<00:04:32.949> I<00:04:33.220> think

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
everything I just I don't know I think

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.580 
everything I just I don't know I think
it's<00:04:33.789> way<00:04:34.150> over<00:04:34.419> rated<00:04:34.570> and<00:04:34.930> people<00:04:35.289> need<00:04:35.440> to

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
it's way over rated and people need to

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.249 
it's way over rated and people need to
just<00:04:35.800> move<00:04:35.979> along<00:04:36.310> and<00:04:36.789> in<00:04:37.630> even<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.139> know

just move along and in even and you know

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.620 
just move along and in even and you know

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.830 
you can see from my review I was really
giddy<00:04:42.490> when<00:04:42.699> I<00:04:42.759> made<00:04:43.000> that<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.449> that<00:04:43.600> game

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
giddy when I made that that that game

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.779 
giddy when I made that that that game
was<00:04:43.960> awesome<00:04:44.350> but<00:04:44.979> you<00:04:45.130> know<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:45.430> still<00:04:45.639> has

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:45.789 
was awesome but you know it still has

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:47.850 
was awesome but you know it still has
its<00:04:45.970> issues<00:04:46.120> too<00:04:46.509> there's<00:04:47.199> there<00:04:47.560> should<00:04:47.740> be

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
its issues too there's there should be

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.230 
its issues too there's there should be
more<00:04:48.009> people<00:04:48.340> in<00:04:48.430> that<00:04:48.550> game<00:04:48.820> there<00:04:49.030> should<00:04:49.150> be

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
more people in that game there should be

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.090 
more people in that game there should be
twice<00:04:49.419> as<00:04:49.479> many<00:04:49.660> people<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.139> can<00:04:50.320> play<00:04:50.500> they

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
twice as many people that can play they

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.580 
twice as many people that can play they
should<00:04:51.280> have<00:04:51.370> had<00:04:51.460> more<00:04:51.669> guns<00:04:51.940> and<00:04:52.210> perks<00:04:52.590> that

should have had more guns and perks that

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.439 
should have had more guns and perks that
you<00:04:53.680> can<00:04:53.860> unlock<00:04:53.979> to<00:04:54.610> you<00:04:55.000> know<00:04:55.090> advanced
