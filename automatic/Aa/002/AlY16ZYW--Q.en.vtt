00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 Now let's have a look at the snare times 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.040
 detail 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.170
 I dismantled them for that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.170
 on which drum pads can detect acts 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.039
 it, this is a special edition the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.930
 so only for the music store 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.770
 The snare drum is made 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.440
 strictly limited to 20 copies, the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.019
 snare is made in a beautiful 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.470
 rosewood from her to german rosewood 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.189
 from her which traditionally from the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.500
 home is only made vertically the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.590
 Cauldron Disney Dream is with an air 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.600
 Equalizing hole equipped as already 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.409
 Drum kettle had mentioned a rosewood 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.020
 from her 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.320
 however, the inner layers are off 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.770
 Maple made the boiler is based on 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.650
 the new culture of eating is and would be like that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.560
 there in the configurator a winchell 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.320
 Execution on both sides of the snare 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.220
 So we have a 45 degree boiler 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.100
 advice on the lower side of the snare 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.970
 So we have this exclusive for 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.649
 music store 10 is incorporated 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.740
 which has a depth of three 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.640
 millimeters also the boiler hardware of 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.619
 snare drum is based on the osze series 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.710
 and thus all the fittings parts of 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.340
 Snare drum from the outside as from the inside rubber 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.200
 backed by the patented sonorous 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.690
 0 glide withdrawal we have the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.230
 possibility of carpet with only one 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.510
 handle to solve 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.790
 another important part of everyone 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.150
 snare drum is of course the snare drum 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:25.290
 carpet and although we have a 20 here 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.420
 spiral brass carpet then i would like 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.640
 of course also on the snare withdrawal 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.569
 into here we have the sonorous 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.760
 douglas's withdrawal for me one of the 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.280
 Best snare withdrawal in the market 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.709
 She is really buttery and 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.480
 we have a so-called pseudo here 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.000
 parallel withdrawal that means we have 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.450
 the opportunity to snare carpet 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.340
 both sides still to adjust 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.930
 for the sound picture a snare drum game 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.400
 of course the cocking mature one 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.400
 decisive role 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.160
 and here come to validity two pressure 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.680
 Tensioned mature from home sonor with 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.260
 a 10 department for me personally 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.319
 really the west left cocking tires 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.600
 unlikely on the market 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.049
 good quality of a really 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.870
 unlikely good chrome plating that 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.620
 was the special edition of sonor music 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.690
