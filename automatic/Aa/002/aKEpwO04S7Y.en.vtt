00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 stages of kakÃ¡ first step after 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.960
 harvested 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.179
 the fruit is cut in half and the seed 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.940
 wrapped in the white pulp of temping 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.410
 cocoa are removed and powders to ferment 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 wood matches 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.150
 during five days the control of 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.600
 natural chemical reactions occurring in the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.420
 fermentation and will end in good 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.699
 quality of the aroma and flavor of the product 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.619
 Last 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.900
 second stage the dried seeds are 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.940
 taken to the roasting where they are 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 peeled broken in small 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.579
 pieces and then submitted to the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 the time and temperature applied in the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.469
 are another of the secrets to 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.379
 To Get The Best Third Stage Chocolate 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.350
 once roasted and ground seeds 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.079
 produce a so-called liquor the mass of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.949
 cocoa cream with a creamy consistency 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.530
 dark 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.489
 this is the basic raw material used 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.469
 by the chocolate factories fourth stage 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.430
 after the resource is mixed sugar and 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.589
 powdered milk 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.990
 the goal is something correct fusion story 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.119
 between ingredients with increased 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.760
 melting temperature 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.869
 present in milk caramelization and appears 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.810
 there the characteristic aroma of chocolate 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:21.930
 fifth step after the dry count is the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.360
 time counting when the liquid is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.280
 added cocoa butter to the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.860
 other ingredients if the first 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.590
 Count is responsible for Rome 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.909
 the second determines the viscosity and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.650
 chocolate texture 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.829
 the longer the time in this process 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.299
 the better the quality of flavor and 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.970
 chocolate texture 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.030
 after counting the chocolate follows 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.110
 to the mill where it will be refined and sixth 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.299
 last step 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.329
 the finished chocolate passes into the tank 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.649
 storage temperature from 45 to 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.380
 50 degrees 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.119
 before going to temperar deira machine 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.320
 which has the function of crystallizing the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.810
 cocoa butter 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.899
 From there the chocolate is at the temperature of 30 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.119
 degrees ready to be molded 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.860
 informed of truffle tablet or egg of 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.660
 Easter is always good to be in a 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.310
 delicious chocolate 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.020
 so this is it I think you 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.860
 realized 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.420
 that cocoa fruit is not turning 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.120
 a delicious chocolate 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.550
 I think it's obvious that they signed up 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.410
 but this is it 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.150
 and I said that I wanted to show you 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.250
 So thank you so much for watching until 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.250
 now it 's that 's it and I went
