00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
bit more oil to help the Browning of the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.419 
bit more oil to help the Browning of the
broccoli<00:02:07.649> you're<00:02:08.649> going<00:02:08.799> to<00:02:08.859> want<00:02:09.009> to<00:02:09.130> do<00:02:09.250> this

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
broccoli you're going to want to do this

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.490 
broccoli you're going to want to do this
for<00:02:09.670> about<00:02:09.759> one<00:02:10.239> minute<00:02:10.390> maybe<00:02:11.019> two

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.800 

you<00:02:17.250> look<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:17.970> starting<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.570> just

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
you look here it's starting to just

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.570 
you look here it's starting to just
brown<00:02:21.200> just<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.290> slight<00:02:22.650> bit<00:02:22.950> more<00:02:25.250> by<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.310> way

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
brown just a slight bit more by the way

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.030 
brown just a slight bit more by the way
it's<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> oil<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:28.020> makes<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.440> brown<00:02:28.710> if<00:02:28.920> you

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
it's the oil that makes it brown if you

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.440 
it's the oil that makes it brown if you
didn't<00:02:29.340> have<00:02:29.460> oil<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.940> here<00:02:30.090> won't<00:02:30.300> be

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
didn't have oil in here won't be

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.710 
didn't have oil in here won't be
browning<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:32.070> oil<00:02:32.280> transfers<00:02:33.000> heat<00:02:33.240> from<00:02:33.510> the

browning the oil transfers heat from the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.390 
browning the oil transfers heat from the
