00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:15.070
 Ok I'll create the menu of the endorsement menu for 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.140
 increase the experience of our boats 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:22.300

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.719
 rope or in a castle because it will 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.829
 here in a confluence zone with 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:44.140
 Spain and it's great to have a 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:51.100
 cartel to defend us from the Spanish 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:56.429

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.680

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:48.960
