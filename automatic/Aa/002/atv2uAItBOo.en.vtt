00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.680
 I shut down my computer as I said 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.890

 right now fast enough then the pass 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.359
 we have these diseases 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.800
 ever think oh my wants okay 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.480
 My work just wants to know the most 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.160
 i also found it very funny i got in 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.600
 made my mind and I found too 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.860
 very nice that some people with the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.690
 but edge in the game 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.660
 So there people can now for 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.590
 addressed the people get the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.780
 community winter weeks which was not 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:58.710
 that had stolen no matter 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.350
 I have everything a little too well that's it 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.869
 to be with him that is a problem of 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.420
 total cash flow in the to our house 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:22.950
 guest oh who needs research work 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:28.490
 is overrated overrated what murder 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.490
 the opinion 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.979
 we are 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:02:10.340
 you will be saved old friend and fun 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:15.390
 have and still another offender 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.110
 there comes someone extra course it goes 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:28.640
 much smaller twitter here he comes is 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:32.579
 just looked at it was 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.109
 So I have in the livestream 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.609
 friendly team have made there 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.859
 I hit somebody 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.980
 then I have but for me from the 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.540
 klo killed that fit so imagine 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.170
 not next to me when I start to 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.859
 beat 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.480
 yes I played well today and 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.880
 yesterday also with flex under water and 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.489
 that is very often that I built there 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.829
 band because I just mean 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.850
 Teammates kill 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.190
 But there are bulkhead construction of shoots like 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.820
 a farce and once you are with it 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.820
 dead immediately 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:31.660
 tamis full concentration 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:33.910
 he does not check that in too much 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:41.230
 a bit tricky if you do not mind us 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:49.110
 bring it back again 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:49.110
 probably just lost there 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:04:05.220
 no, it is also good here , too 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.220
 the bridge on it 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:17.470
 too bad peter paal had hello 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.269
 now we have attacked because 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.890
 just to reject them 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.880
 during the shader is just off 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.470
 he assumed 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:32.650
 I got that from Luke Place 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:35.560
 that means good point the good point 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.070
 download and you certainly have like that 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.070
 necessary in it 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.110
 I think so in the shader 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.400
 net profit is made now the 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.850
 guest at a asked which text 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.100
 effect that was good and makes the paul 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.690
 mut I use to get away now so 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.520
 personally not as often i always was 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.220
 My tip just in general which also 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.070
 in the shots but I have 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.560
 but not so bad in itself 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.330
 only really works the mixture of bio 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.370
 almost stopped what you want us to do here 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:19.479
 even that too historically 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:21.930
 texture pack you know labs know 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.930
 who the boss 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:34.930
 there comes another place over would have 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:36.550
 continue to let in weaker but that 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.370
 was the other culprit 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.669
 okay who lives the herd that means that 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:51.280
 I am also proud of it 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:58.270
 actually got two more because we are 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:06:02.650
 here four live a total of 56 felix 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.220
 harth games is okay i do not know any 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.199
 error 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.360
 yes, I can not let him either 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.020
 the man did not kill let's leave 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.970
 disappeared 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:17.590
 felix this is the Turkish version of 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:23.500
 my name feliz navidad ago 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:28.090
 christmas or totally so I verpeilt 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:30.130
 had somehow in mind the belief 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.150
 I am peace or something and my name is 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.880
 it had to be christmas 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.110
 that's why there are a few scenes 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.310
 and find what I have yet to 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.020
 Fully in demand what it is 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.940
 means 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.629
 but I just do not think so 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:48.849
 that was a pretty good round 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:50.520
 everyone is having fun here we are the bosses 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.479
 is with approx 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.849
 I just hope that you full 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:56.470
 As always love has failed 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:58.599
 paul von megaman originates in the 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.280
 description and yes we are then on 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:03.030
 next time if again picture main 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.030
 gets skin in
