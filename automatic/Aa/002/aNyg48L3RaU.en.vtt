 [Music] 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.320
 what I wanted to dream disappeared like 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.050
 a whisper in the middle of the lights during 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.210
 the evening is that I lost it but I know 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.810
 that your post will open finally the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.660
 destination that will reach me you will only be able to see 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.359
 I let myself have because it did not happen what 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.579
 I hope that having the same 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.920
 moon want to escape before taking 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.740
 turn what do you want from me in what 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.040
 that I ask the darkness 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.830
 environment that day when you find yourself 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.420
 smile pierced me and now I am your 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.290
 true my love 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.430
 pretend between these two pain is a 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:58.300
 promise that until today I want to embrace 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:02.739
 Your love is near you We will be 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.940
 here because because before we are 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.890
 running out of flavor but with you I want 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.340
 share 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.000
 while that tide of thought that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.930
 we are going to find women of hamas 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.420
 of blood that floods me and you do not come to me 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:26.159
 until the sky will arrive 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.159
 to become your 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.630
 all this did not excite me listening to how 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.659
 it starts but in my way of being 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.930
 contained by the invisible chain that 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.340
 he let go of me even though I can not 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:57.580
 jump the wind freeze us move on to 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.880
 semis because I'm here but I do not 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.880
 I will go my love can also release 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.530
 what do you want to hide as looks 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.300
 I want to breathe you for feeling that pain 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.670
 of not seeing you need to wear those 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.660
 encounters with your things will give you that 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.930
 that's what you're in love because now 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.739
 I realize that I love you, you come 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.780
 When you look, I will protect you 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:35.750
 lives girls in repentance 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.750
 that feels the dad is awake 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:54.599
 [Music] 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:58.680
 we have to make love to each other and get 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:01.440
 think about our happiness that under that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.129
 do not get inside me forming your life 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.129
 never again 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:27.900
 it is the easiest way 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.900
 and if we were wrong that same place 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.659
 nothing nothing 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.659
 but nothing 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:39.420
 I would say more kind 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:43.760
 [Music] 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.760
 in my life
