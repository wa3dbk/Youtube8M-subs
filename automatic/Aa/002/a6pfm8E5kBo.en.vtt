it right now on a boat less about half
of<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:35.090> luminosity<00:00:35.570> so<00:00:36.260> what<00:00:36.649> we're<00:00:36.800> gonna<00:00:36.920> do

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
of the luminosity so what we're gonna do

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.400 
of the luminosity so what we're gonna do
is<00:00:37.370> just<00:00:37.399> pump<00:00:37.879> them<00:00:38.090> up<00:00:38.210> to<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.539> max<00:00:38.780> just<00:00:39.230> to

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
is just pump them up to the max just to

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.279 
is just pump them up to the max just to
kind<00:00:39.649> of<00:00:39.679> show<00:00:39.739> you<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:41.420> performance<00:00:42.019> of<00:00:42.199> each

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
kind of show you the performance of each

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:50.979 
kind of show you the performance of each
one<00:00:43.390> it's<00:00:44.390> maxed<00:00:44.809> out<00:00:44.929> on<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:45.230> Cobalt<00:00:49.989> looks

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
one it's maxed out on the Cobalt looks

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.689 
one it's maxed out on the Cobalt looks
like<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.350> side<00:00:51.620> book<00:00:51.800> is<00:00:51.949> a<00:00:51.980> little<00:00:52.519> bit

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
like the side book is a little bit

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.669 
like the side book is a little bit
brighter<00:00:52.940> even<00:00:53.359> by<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.539> naked<00:00:53.780> eye<00:00:54.019> -<00:00:54.199> it's

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
brighter even by the naked eye - it's

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.310 
brighter even by the naked eye - it's
not<00:00:55.670> by<00:00:55.820> much<00:00:56.030> but<00:00:56.059> it's<00:00:56.570> just<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:56.929> little<00:00:57.230> bit

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
not by much but it's just a little bit

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.200 
not by much but it's just a little bit
it's<00:00:57.530> noticeable<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:58.370> fairly<00:00:58.670> comparable

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
it's noticeable it's fairly comparable

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.840 
it's noticeable it's fairly comparable
what<00:01:00.079> I<00:01:00.109> like<00:01:00.440> about<00:01:00.620> both<00:01:00.949> of<00:01:01.010> these<00:01:01.399> ear

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
what I like about both of these ear

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.079 
what I like about both of these ear
eaters<00:01:02.300> with<00:01:02.839> their<00:01:03.460> front<00:01:04.460> light<00:01:04.670> technology

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
eaters with their front light technology

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.210 
eaters with their front light technology
is<00:01:05.510> they're<00:01:05.720> they're<00:01:05.930> white<00:01:06.140> you<00:01:06.680> don't<00:01:06.950> see

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
is they're they're white you don't see

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.149 
is they're they're white you don't see
that<00:01:07.399> really<00:01:08.060> bluish<00:01:08.720> tinge<00:01:09.170> like<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.799> saw<00:01:10.130> on

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
that really bluish tinge like you saw on

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.950 
that really bluish tinge like you saw on
the<00:01:10.490> Nook<00:01:10.700> Simple<00:01:10.729> Touch<00:01:11.090> with<00:01:11.450> glow<00:01:11.720> light

the Nook Simple Touch with glow light

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.200 
the Nook Simple Touch with glow light
and<00:01:12.229> of<00:01:12.979> course<00:01:13.520> you're<00:01:13.820> not<00:01:13.909> going<00:01:14.149> to

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
and of course you're not going to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.230 
and of course you're not going to
probably<00:01:14.509> read<00:01:15.110> your<00:01:15.680> e-reader<00:01:16.119> you<00:01:17.119> know

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
probably read your e-reader you know

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.300 
probably read your e-reader you know
with<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.509> glow<00:01:17.750> light<00:01:18.020> on<00:01:18.170> full-blast<00:01:18.649> you'll

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
with the glow light on full-blast you'll

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.730 
with the glow light on full-blast you'll
probably<00:01:19.579> have<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.630> know<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.020> somewhere

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
probably have it you know and somewhere

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.280 
probably have it you know and somewhere
between<00:01:22.130> like<00:01:22.579> a<00:01:22.759> comfortable<00:01:23.659> medium<00:01:24.079> and

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
between like a comfortable medium and

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.270 
between like a comfortable medium and
whatnot<00:01:25.600> of<00:01:26.600> course<00:01:26.899> the<00:01:27.200> scroll<00:01:27.680> bar<00:01:27.890> here

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
whatnot of course the scroll bar here

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.230 
whatnot of course the scroll bar here
for<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.700> books

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
for the books

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.459 
for the books
and<00:01:29.920> what<00:01:30.920> we'll<00:01:31.070> probably<00:01:31.100> do<00:01:31.789> is<00:01:31.820> just<00:01:32.469> turn

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
and what we'll probably do is just turn

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.700 
and what we'll probably do is just turn
it<00:01:33.680> a<00:01:33.829> little<00:01:34.159> less<00:01:34.600> intrusive<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:36.140> something

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
it a little less intrusive to something

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.880 
it a little less intrusive to something
that<00:01:36.860> you're<00:01:37.310> gonna<00:01:37.490> do<00:01:38.180> like<00:01:38.539> on<00:01:38.719> average<00:01:39.259> so

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
that you're gonna do like on average so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.899 
that you're gonna do like on average so
about<00:01:40.430> midway<00:01:40.820> or<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.070> okay<00:01:43.070> so<00:01:43.399> you<00:01:43.520> saw<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
about midway or so okay so you saw the

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.149 
about midway or so okay so you saw the
different<00:01:44.450> levels<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.170> know<00:01:45.409> that<00:01:45.680> we<00:01:45.890> could

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
different levels you know that we could

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.060 
different levels you know that we could
do<00:01:46.880> it<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:47.210> we<00:01:47.270> put<00:01:47.750> them<00:01:47.899> side-by-side<00:01:48.259> in

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
do it and we put them side-by-side in

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.690 
do it and we put them side-by-side in
terms<00:01:49.399> of<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:50.630> glow<00:01:50.960> light<00:01:51.259> in<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.890> true<00:01:52.280> dark

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
terms of the glow light in a true dark

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.240 
terms of the glow light in a true dark
circumstance<00:01:53.630> let's<00:01:54.320> just<00:01:54.590> check<00:01:54.859> out<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.219> e

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
circumstance let's just check out the e

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.639 
circumstance let's just check out the e
reading<00:01:55.850> experience<00:01:56.539> just<00:01:56.840> on<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.049> general

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649

book between the two and we can give you

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.580 
book between the two and we can give you
a<00:02:00.649> sense<00:02:01.039> on<00:02:01.310> how<00:02:01.789> these<00:02:02.060> go<00:02:02.479> head-to-head<00:02:03.020> you

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
a sense on how these go head-to-head you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:19.809 
a sense on how these go head-to-head you
know<00:02:03.740> reading<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.429> full<00:02:05.000> book

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.600 

well<00:02:20.819> let's<00:02:20.939> get<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.329> page<00:02:21.689> here<00:02:22.129> okay<00:02:23.129> full

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
well let's get to a page here okay full

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.339 
well let's get to a page here okay full
of<00:02:23.760> text<00:02:24.000> there<00:02:24.299> we<00:02:24.420> go<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.840> can<00:02:25.019> see<00:02:25.200> they

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
of text there we go so you can see they

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.770 
of text there we go so you can see they
are<00:02:25.379> different<00:02:25.920> because<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:27.209> fonts<00:02:27.629> have

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
are different because the fonts have

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.679 
are different because the fonts have
been<00:02:28.079> altered<00:02:28.799> so<00:02:29.489> what<00:02:29.849> we're<00:02:29.970> gonna<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:30.360> is

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
been altered so what we're gonna do is

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:46.220 
been altered so what we're gonna do is
change<00:02:38.269> come<00:02:39.269> on<00:02:43.250> there<00:02:44.250> we<00:02:44.430> go<00:02:44.629> so<00:02:45.629> many<00:02:45.810> users

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
change come on there we go so many users

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.630 
change come on there we go so many users
are<00:02:46.379> at<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.560> top<00:02:46.769> in<00:02:47.069> the<00:02:47.159> middle<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.579> the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
are at the top in the middle and the

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.729 
are at the top in the middle and the
bottom<00:02:47.819> start<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.780> keep<00:02:48.959> track<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:49.470> we<00:02:49.590> have

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
bottom start to keep track so we have

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.509 
bottom start to keep track so we have
the<00:02:49.920> top<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.780> font<00:02:51.780> changes<00:02:52.140> here<00:02:52.379> so<00:02:52.530> we<00:02:53.280> can

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
the top the font changes here so we can

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.949 
the top the font changes here so we can
try<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.849> do<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.359> as<00:02:54.590> best<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.959> match

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
try to do this as best we can and match

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.530 
try to do this as best we can and match
everything<00:02:58.379> see<00:02:58.859> if<00:02:58.920> we<00:02:59.099> have<00:02:59.250> similar<00:02:59.639> font

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
everything see if we have similar font

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.050 
everything see if we have similar font
styles<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:02.280> looks<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.579> we<00:03:02.670> both<00:03:02.819> have

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
styles it looks like we both have

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.860 
styles it looks like we both have
Georgia<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.870> we'll<00:03:04.019> do<00:03:04.139> that<00:03:05.510> then<00:03:06.510> we'll<00:03:06.690> make

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
Georgia so we'll do that then we'll make

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:14.599 
Georgia so we'll do that then we'll make
this<00:03:07.109> just<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.650> little<00:03:07.799> bit<00:03:07.980> bigger<00:03:13.310> yeah<00:03:14.310> that

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
this just a little bit bigger yeah that

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.539 
this just a little bit bigger yeah that
looks<00:03:14.879> fairly<00:03:15.150> comparable<00:03:15.569> we're<00:03:15.959> like<00:03:16.109> it

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
looks fairly comparable we're like it

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.240 
looks fairly comparable we're like it
maybe<00:03:17.549> don't<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.659> line<00:03:18.840> spacing<00:03:19.139> a<00:03:19.470> bit<00:03:19.650> there

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
maybe don't the line spacing a bit there

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.699 
maybe don't the line spacing a bit there
we<00:03:20.489> go<00:03:20.639> all<00:03:21.299> right<00:03:21.359> so<00:03:21.510> let's<00:03:22.139> just<00:03:22.230> go<00:03:22.530> into

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
we go all right so let's just go into

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.589 
we go all right so let's just go into
the<00:03:23.129> book<00:03:23.639> itself<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.239> see<00:03:24.840> how<00:03:24.959> they<00:03:25.139> look

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
the book itself and see how they look

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.869 
the book itself and see how they look
and<00:03:27.599> we'll<00:03:28.319> of<00:03:28.500> course<00:03:28.530> put<00:03:29.400> these<00:03:29.579> two

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
and we'll of course put these two

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.300 
and we'll of course put these two
head-to-head<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.720> proper<00:03:31.260> review<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
head-to-head in a proper review the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.559 
head-to-head in a proper review the
purpose<00:03:32.639> of<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:32.849> video<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.299> just<00:03:33.329> a

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
purpose of this video is just a

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.229 
purpose of this video is just a
nighttime<00:03:33.780> reading<00:03:34.199> test<00:03:34.849> so<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:35.940> can<00:03:36.000> see

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
nighttime reading test so you can see

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.059 
nighttime reading test so you can see
here<00:03:36.480> our<00:03:36.690> first<00:03:37.049> starting<00:03:37.500> on<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> side<00:03:37.859> book

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
here our first starting on the side book

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.670 
here our first starting on the side book
it<00:03:38.250> refreshes<00:03:38.970> every<00:03:39.120> single<00:03:40.019> page<00:03:40.319> and<00:03:40.590> it

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
it refreshes every single page and it

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.159 
it refreshes every single page and it
blacks<00:03:40.980> out<00:03:41.250> when<00:03:41.639> you<00:03:41.760> swipe<00:03:42.120> however<00:03:42.989> when

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169 
blacks out when you swipe however when

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.550 
blacks out when you swipe however when
you<00:03:43.290> tap<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:45.510> only<00:03:45.690> does<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:45.959> about<00:03:46.290> every

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
you tap it only does it about every

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.920 
you tap it only does it about every
seventh<00:03:47.069> page<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.579> this<00:03:47.669> is<00:03:47.879> a<00:03:47.930> good

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
seventh page so this is a good

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.930 
seventh page so this is a good
workaround<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.560> have<00:03:49.709> that<00:03:49.919> full<00:03:50.340> black

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
workaround to have that full black

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.750 
workaround to have that full black
refresh<00:03:51.980> well<00:03:52.980> it's<00:03:53.069> not<00:03:53.190> doing<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.579> for<00:03:53.699> a

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
refresh well it's not doing it for a

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.509 
refresh well it's not doing it for a
while<00:03:53.940> yeah<00:03:54.930> actually<00:03:55.340> there<00:03:56.340> was<00:03:56.489> this

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
while yeah actually there was this

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.369 
while yeah actually there was this
there's<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.090> think<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.419> setting<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.199> could

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
there's I think a setting that you could

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.409 
there's I think a setting that you could
just<00:03:58.560> disable<00:03:59.040> refresh<00:03:59.519> all<00:03:59.730> together<00:04:00.060> and

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
just disable refresh all together and

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:02.689 
just disable refresh all together and
then<00:04:00.930> one<00:04:01.169> of<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.349> settings<00:04:01.620> menus<00:04:02.159> I<00:04:02.400> knew<00:04:02.579> on

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
then one of the settings menus I knew on

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.939 
then one of the settings menus I knew on
the<00:04:02.730> first<00:04:03.030> launch<00:04:03.359> it<00:04:03.659> was<00:04:03.870> refreshing<00:04:04.709> every

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
the first launch it was refreshing every

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.649 
the first launch it was refreshing every
seventh<00:04:05.400> or<00:04:05.549> so<00:04:05.730> but<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.060> looks<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.449> yeah

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
seventh or so but it looks like yeah

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.220 
seventh or so but it looks like yeah
it's<00:04:06.959> very<00:04:07.949> consistently<00:04:08.760> smooth<00:04:09.150> yeah<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:09.989> of

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
it's very consistently smooth yeah so of

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.379 
it's very consistently smooth yeah so of
course<00:04:10.470> if<00:04:10.799> you<00:04:10.919> don't<00:04:11.190> like<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.579> refresh<00:04:12.000> tap

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
course if you don't like the refresh tap

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.469 
course if you don't like the refresh tap
it<00:04:12.599> don't<00:04:12.840> swipe<00:04:13.109> it<00:04:13.400> whereas<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.430> Kobo<00:04:14.879> very

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
it don't swipe it whereas the Kobo very

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.610 
it don't swipe it whereas the Kobo very
quick<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:17.400> almost<00:04:17.699> seems<00:04:18.060> like<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:19.109> Kobo's

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
quick it almost seems like the Kobo's

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.979 
quick it almost seems like the Kobo's
quicker<00:04:20.190> on<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.760> taps<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.419> does<00:04:21.659> seem<00:04:21.959> that

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
quicker on the taps it does seem that

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.010 
quicker on the taps it does seem that
way<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.860> get<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.039> little<00:04:23.370> bit<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.610> blurry

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
way you get a little bit of blurry

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.300 
way you get a little bit of blurry

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
the side book looks a little sluggish

and stuff like that that's advanced

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.230 
and stuff like that that's advanced
customization<00:05:30.650> but<00:05:31.490> I<00:05:31.520> mean<00:05:31.700> both<00:05:31.910> of<00:05:31.940> these

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
customization but I mean both of these

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.680 
customization but I mean both of these
do<00:05:32.630> allow<00:05:32.960> you<00:05:32.990> to<00:05:33.669> load<00:05:34.669> in<00:05:34.850> your<00:05:35.030> own<00:05:35.150> fonts

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
do allow you to load in your own fonts

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.469 
do allow you to load in your own fonts
and<00:05:36.010> you<00:05:37.010> know<00:05:37.130> you<00:05:37.190> have<00:05:37.460> lots<00:05:37.729> of<00:05:37.910> font<00:05:38.150> sizes

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
and you know you have lots of font sizes

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:40.719 
and you know you have lots of font sizes
they're<00:05:39.110> fairly<00:05:39.380> comparable<00:05:39.919> in<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:40.550> ways

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
they're fairly comparable in the ways

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.760 
they're fairly comparable in the ways
that<00:05:40.970> a<00:05:41.150> lot<00:05:41.180> of<00:05:41.390> them<00:05:41.539> do<00:05:41.750> like<00:05:41.990> live<00:05:42.289> updates

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
that a lot of them do like live updates

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.310 
that a lot of them do like live updates
and<00:05:43.039> stuff<00:05:43.130> like<00:05:43.400> that<00:05:43.640> so<00:05:44.240> something<00:05:45.140> that

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
and stuff like that so something that

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.490 
and stuff like that so something that
the<00:05:45.760> Sybok<00:05:46.760> from<00:05:47.539> Vulcan<00:05:47.900> has<00:05:48.050> always<00:05:48.260> been

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
the Sybok from Vulcan has always been

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.590 
the Sybok from Vulcan has always been
good<00:05:48.620> at<00:05:48.680> is<00:05:49.010> they<00:05:49.610> actually<00:05:49.820> incorporate<00:05:50.450> a

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600 
good at is they actually incorporate a

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.170 
good at is they actually incorporate a
lot<00:05:50.840> of<00:05:50.960> inertia<00:05:51.700> qualities<00:05:52.700> into<00:05:52.910> their

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
lot of inertia qualities into their

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.870 
lot of inertia qualities into their
e-readers<00:05:53.510> as<00:05:53.930> you<00:05:54.050> can<00:05:54.200> see<00:05:54.410> here<00:05:54.710> if<00:05:55.010> you

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
e-readers as you can see here if you

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.210 
e-readers as you can see here if you
slide<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.570> fonts<00:05:57.020> it<00:05:57.410> actually<00:05:57.860> continues

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
slide the fonts it actually continues

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.560 
slide the fonts it actually continues
moving<00:05:58.669> past<00:05:59.030> when<00:05:59.300> you<00:05:59.389> let<00:05:59.570> go<00:05:59.600> it<00:06:01.570> actually

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570 
moving past when you let go it actually

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.840 
moving past when you let go it actually
kind<00:06:02.960> of<00:06:03.020> keeps<00:06:03.470> moving<00:06:04.070> much<00:06:04.280> like<00:06:04.520> when<00:06:04.729> you

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
kind of keeps moving much like when you

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.640 
kind of keeps moving much like when you
scroll<00:06:05.210> something<00:06:05.720> on<00:06:05.840> a<00:06:05.870> computer<00:06:06.380> you<00:06:06.470> see

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
that and this is really impressive

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.270 
that and this is really impressive
especially<00:06:08.510> on<00:06:08.630> eating<00:06:09.050> because<00:06:09.770> you're<00:06:09.979> on

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
refresh problems that it can become

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:15.940 
refresh problems that it can become
