Miyamoto and Cal senior recognize a need
for<00:03:45.530> japanese-american<00:03:46.459> cooperation<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.410> find

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
for japanese-american cooperation I find

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.380 
for japanese-american cooperation I find
it<00:03:48.530> very<00:03:48.590> interesting<00:03:48.829> that<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.640> men<00:03:49.880> often

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
it very interesting that the men often

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.390 
it very interesting that the men often
seen<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.930> society<00:03:51.470> as<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.769> soldiers<00:03:52.190> and

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
seen the society as the soldiers and

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.550 
seen the society as the soldiers and
protectors<00:03:52.880> come<00:03:53.329> across<00:03:53.600> in<00:03:53.840> this<00:03:54.019> novel<00:03:54.260> as

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
protectors come across in this novel as

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.890 
protectors come across in this novel as
being<00:03:54.890> less<00:03:55.160> racist<00:03:55.430> than<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.940> women<00:03:56.239> who<00:03:56.870> are

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
being less racist than the women who are

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.199 
being less racist than the women who are
culturally<00:03:57.290> viewed<00:03:57.859> as<00:03:58.010> a<00:03:58.070> lovers<00:03:58.549> and<00:03:58.790> carers

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
culturally viewed as a lovers and carers

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.930 
culturally viewed as a lovers and carers
but<00:03:59.930> then<00:04:00.079> again<00:04:00.200> that<00:04:00.890> too<00:04:01.190> is<00:04:01.370> all<00:04:01.549> based<00:04:01.760> on

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
but then again that too is all based on

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.610 
but then again that too is all based on
an

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
an

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.220 
an
perspective
