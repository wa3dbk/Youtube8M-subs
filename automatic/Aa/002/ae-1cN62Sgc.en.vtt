00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hi, how are you? I'm a marine. 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.160
 dog photographer 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.899
 did you know that some foods can 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.820
 be fatal to your dog 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.679
 check out a list of ten times the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.610
 dog can not eat at all 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.610
 soon after the goal 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.830
 powder 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.900
 the first food your 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.390
 dog can not talk one of the candy 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.250
 bullets lollipops products light them 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.860
 contain a substance called shington 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.540
 this substance it increases the level of 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.489
 insulin into the bloodstream of the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.470
 dog and with it he can suffer a 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.269
 liver failure other food 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.250
 dog can not even see a little 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.830
 unusual is the avocado it contains a 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.420
 substance called percy the new human 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.879
 not a problem but the dog itself 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.129
 in small amounts can lead to vomiting 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.350
 diarrhea and even lead to death then 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.180
 let your dog combine avocado and 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.729
 Have you asked for Avocado House to vote one? 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.290
 drought kept away is safer to 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.360
 something I particularly think 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.799
 of note is the height of the dog 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.780
 people are not aware that this 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.299
 it may be a problem the dog may have 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.189
 vomiting diarrhea difficulty breathing 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.380
 and into a coma and even die because 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.180
 drank water and this may even be with 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.909
 very small so if you're an idiot 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.549
 Do not do this if you know 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.409
 Someone who does this has already said that this 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.689
 person how much it is putting at risk 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.799
 the life of her little animal called 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.930
 foods that we love to use 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.720
 food but it is not recommended in a way 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.740
 some for the onion puppies and those 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.560
 two foods contain a substance 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.000
 called the fetus henry itself. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.780
 eyeglass history substance 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.220
 reds 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.080
 with that the dog can develop 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.640
 anemia this can be a problem because 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.800
 if left untreated it is fatal 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.970
 so you do not have to if some garlic is 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.260
 onion of your dog 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.060
 this food is something that people 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.440
 loves and most likely people 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.440
 There is a house, so we have to be careful. 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.300
 redoubled chocolate chocolate has a 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.430
 substance called theobromine which is 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.010
 fatal for dogs so do not let 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.780
 chocolate in the sink where it reaches the 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.060
 food that I found very curious is the egg 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.740
 raw the dog should not eat because he 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.240
 has an enzyme that hinders absorption 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.950
 of vitamin b 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.259
 in the long run your dog may have 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.670
 skin problems and hair we already 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.799
 has several races have so many problems 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.629
 with skin by for example the bulldog 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.430
 incredible goal so it 's best to prevent 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.459
 and not allow it to run smoothly 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.959
 some the potato and mainly the bark 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.940
 of potatoes can be a major problem 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.130
 with her dog she has a substance 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.350
 calls the girl who even in small 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.790
 amount is fatal to the animal if you 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.710
 potato for him I'm sure 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.650
 which is cooked is well prepared 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.120
 It has nothing green and does not bark 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.220
 apple of your dog 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.260
 many of them I love but have to have a lot 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.330
 be careful because the apple kernels contain 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.980
 cyanide for us is not a problem 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.420
 because it would still be too small for 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.040
 cyanide dogs can be a great 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.320
 the same candidate problem falls 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.090
 can produce negative results in the 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.160
 for example with the sound are 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.440
 all the difficulty of breathing and even 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.870
 same as when you give some 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.550
 wide it takes the kernels or breaks them 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.410
 so he is not at risk 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.140
 I imagine as well as I, you and I too. 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.450
 I love bacon but I do not owe your dog 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.280
 because very fatty foods can 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.050
 to generate pancreatitis on the counter 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.730
 happened because it can ignite and 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.260
 stop working as I should 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.700
 I last left a food that is 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.280
 considered one of the most lethal for 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.990
 dogs is macadamia the macadamia she has 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.600
 a very strong reaction in the body of the 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.970
 dog she will generate fever vomiting 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.220
 paralysis as it is most likely to 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.320
 death and even more if you have chocolate 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.300
 macadamia is a redoubled care that 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.709
 we have to have it now that we know 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.660
 which foods we should not 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.640
 allow the dog as we redouble 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.110
 attention and avoid accidents 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.330
 share this video so that more 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.070
 people have this information and people 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.690
 avoid more and more ideas 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.670
 food if you liked the video 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.170
 clicking here I like sea ​​and I do not know 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.670
