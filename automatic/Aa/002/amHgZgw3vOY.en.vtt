00:00:02.019 --> 00:00:17.150
 My dream series is what I'm doing. 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.100
 vinícius and this one 12 to comics 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.500
 today we have a batman without lost memory 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.869
 in time and some summed up 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.480
 vampires 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.019
 starting with batman bruce return 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.090
 wayne 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.039
 but first of all for your law only 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.500
 here you have to fulfill some requirements 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.780
 first, this is the one that shows the 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.940
 consequences of what happened at the end 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.310
 of final crisis so this is a picture 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.320
 hard to recommend because the guy has to 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.240
 have read the final crisis and must 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.580
 liked the final crisis so we 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.110
 decreases the number of voters and 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.210
 of course the subject also has to have 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.700
 the final crisis, which reduces the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.680
 number of readers this one about twelve 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.630
 people around the world second 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.670
 place is a hq written by the great 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.740
 Morrison, then you have to know that you will not 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.570
 be something so simple to understand as 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.190
 most of the things he writes that 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.230
 will have to read with some attention the 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.880
 but do not think the batman's turn is going 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.770
 be a very simple thing and it is also 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.930
 very important that you have read the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.060
 incarcerated before this stage of 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.280
 module that would be batman son who is the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.200
 first one of them beats a black glove that 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.030
 would be the second and last batman 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.890
 rest in peace makes it as I said 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.840
 final crisis too so if you do not 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.550
 these prerequisites, skip to 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.440
 the next review but if you are a 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.900
 curious and does not care about spoiler 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.900
 about final crisis then stay with us 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.730
 said that we'll sign as we saw by 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.920
 from the end of the 15th final batman took a 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.590
 ray of the dark side called san-são 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.300
 Omega and apparently died inclusive 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.370
 which has a scene in which the 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.860
 superman with batman's body in the 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.020
 but in the last two pages of 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.420
 final crisis we have our dear man 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.460
 bat enjoying a bonfire inside 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.979
 a cave thousands of years in the past 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.990
 yes you understood me well the batman in one 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.460
 cave and from there we will have the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.340
 return of course in just interesting 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.960
 receives here is that the batman it stays 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.970
 missing in time 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.429
 only that it has six editions and in each edition 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.470
 He's going to have a different time. He 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.040
 begins at the time of the caves after 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.200
 People are going to have a batman in time. 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.269
 witch hunter then a batman in the 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.489
 pirates mean with batman in the old 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.079
 west it jumps throughout the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.000
 war so it's cool that in every issue 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.709
 batman will have to deal with a 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.810
 different situation it will be in a 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.849
 at a different time in a society 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.709
 Another cool point is that the 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.989
 module are through the ages it goes 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.939
 including small easter eggs from 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.310
 batman mythology in each of the 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.930
 times and it's a lot of fun and tasting 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.819
 these references which is very legal but 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.670
 The synopsis does not end there. 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.439
 the dark side sent a creature called 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.090
 omega adapter to chase batman 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.280
 through time and to complete the 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.859
 the justice league can not afford to 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.799
 Batman back to the 21st century because 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:58.500
 This can lead to the end of time. 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.079
 I really liked the saga that is expensive. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.879
 although I only understood everything when I 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.549
 I gave the second league because this is 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.439
 half confused know how to play more funk in the 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.480
 final and this is the party too 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.700
 several loose ends of stories 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.109
 previous years in the office on 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.669
 so you have to be with everything 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.310
 to have a better experience 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.989
 sound humor it usually requires quite a bit of 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.389
 voter in the works he writes 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.310
 but I do not see this as a bad face 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.930
 a lot of people that does not support the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.269
 they know they do not like to 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.889
 for it to create very complex frames 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.680
 But I think it's cool because he's a writer. 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.449
 that pulls out of the comfort zone is a guy 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.239
 who strives to create a plot 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:38.400
 complex and original then preferably 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.409
 when you read something from him the sidrolândia 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.479
 all in one shot just because otherwise it will 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.549
 end up getting a little lost at last I am 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:46.409
 a guy I particularly like 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.109
 His job I bought this one here. 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.970
 fnac of porto alegre and the price of cover 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.709
 her and sixty-two reais more 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.659
 miraculously they were giving 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.639
 discount at the physical store so I got one 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.250
 little less forecast for August 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.349
 a panini launch one in each swim 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.430
 which compiles every phase of module 1 through 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.959
 batman and robin 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.760
 is a magazine that goes sort of in 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.349
 parallel with this will help 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.090
 better understand with face I liked it 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.109
 enough of the wisdom that I had fun 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.759
 quite reading 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.799
 was in the end he had some things that 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:15.750
 I did not like them so much, although there are others 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.430
 that they paid too much so are very 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.530
 mainly a funk dance that 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.940
 has in the end I found too many references 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.610
 that I live only put to all the mythology 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.990
 Batman was brilliant for this was the 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.000
 situations also that he placed the 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.750
 character are hilarious faces 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.180
 here is a great 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.340
 jokes habit saw batman having 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.680
 that turn around in the most diverse 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.580
 situations bizarre vampire anthology 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.800
 American 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.990
 good the main American vampire series 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.630
 I think you should know is one of the HQs. 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.130
 of the vertigo being released in the 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.050
 even though we have not yet 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.300
 much being released in the then is very 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.980
 difficult is one of the best but anyway it is 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.500
 a series that went on to win more than 1 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.090
 in 2011 as best new series I have 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.400
 here with me the two bound that the 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.290
 panini launched from the American vampire with 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.330
 main series and more that came out in 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.460
 of the article that is there in my 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.140
 The main series is written by the 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.700
 cuts the leader who is the writer of the 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.830
 Batman's current phase is from the magazine 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.660
 Batman main character designed by 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.240
 rafael albuquerque one of my drawings 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.470
 favorites and was curious that 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.710
 stefan king 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.870
 yes those funk even wrote the 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.520
 The first article of the magazine also 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.010
 Anthology I want to know the anthology 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.020
 for the original series called Vampire 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.820
 American that which just spent 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.120
 all the basic information 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.250
 it has suffered a hiatus in Issue 34 is that 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.500
 sniper he was quite busy is 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.390
 so the guy writes just about everything 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.280
 Why are not you today, then? 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.020
 decided to stop a little 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.880
 magazine and in the meantime 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.380
 fans were not left without harassing them 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.630
 decided to launch the anthologies of 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.500
 tales delivery in the hands of several 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.660
 artists 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.550
 the main characters series face 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.550
 like the whole anthology of stories only 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.860
 will have good stories average stories 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.810
 Lousy stories are total of nine 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.310
 short stories gathered here that 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.130
 passes on an American vampire universe 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.200
 face has a very good writing by dis 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.330
 an air a guy who involves natives grandson 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.770
 made call with the Indian is he mixed 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.060
 decided to mix a little scalp 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.120
 with the American vampire has another 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.290
 spectacular written by francisco 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.840
 let me see the guy's name on it 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.910
 franca vidya but that is how it is pronounced 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.590
 but also has a terrible section 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.570
 Hey, man, you got a mosquito, you do not believe how it is. 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.850
 the publisher left it to spend 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.030
 boi the price that well affordable guy is 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.220
 a work that costs 7 50 with lwc paper 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.080
 To vinícius but I never saw vampire. 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.630
 I can buy that face. 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.000
 until date, not knowing much 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:41.550
 mythology the stories they are milk 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.440
 high contained but clear all this 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.420
 the main point the experiment will be 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.130
 much better because it has stories 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.410
 here that refer to the character 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.460
 of the situations that the guy who is a fan of 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:55.440
 series he enjoys a lot of good people 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.600
 another cycle is complete and we have the 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.550
 end of one more program kid link 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.110
 the last two videos of the channel 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.520
 these two recommendations 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.410
 only with a guy who is 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.410
 the film was following the 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.330
 Batman of him that only for those who like 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:12.680
 tales of vampires this is cool 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.680
 here a hug
