00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.870 
it says an X anyway there's a way to all
them<00:00:22.529> hack<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.130> you're<00:00:23.279> running<00:00:23.430> any<00:00:23.760> of

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
them hack it if you're running any of

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.470 
them hack it if you're running any of
the<00:00:24.060> custom<00:00:24.480> roms<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.439> custom<00:00:25.800> kernel

if<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.960> overclocking<00:00:28.650> kernels<00:00:29.039> you

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
if you have the overclocking kernels you

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.240 
if you have the overclocking kernels you
can<00:00:29.609> actually<00:00:30.390> force<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.850> to<00:00:32.850> charge<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.590> if

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
can actually force it to charge so if

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.860 
can actually force it to charge so if
you<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> kernels<00:00:36.180> I'm<00:00:36.390> running
