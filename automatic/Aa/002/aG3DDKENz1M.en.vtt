00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
sounds a s10 freestanding subwoofer so

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.609 
sounds a s10 freestanding subwoofer so
often<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:20.910> get<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.300> boat<00:00:21.570> where<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
because you need a big flat area to

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.290 
because you need a big flat area to
flush<00:00:28.439> mount<00:00:28.619> those<00:00:28.830> things<00:00:29.070> well<00:00:29.820> wet<00:00:30.000> sounds

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300

freestanding subwoofer with a full
enclosure<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:36.140> that<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.350> actually

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
enclosure here that you can actually

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
enclosure here that you can actually
bolt<00:00:37.950> down<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:38.760> look<00:00:38.910> down<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:39.270> at

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
bolt down so if you look down here at

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.170 
bolt down so if you look down here at
this<00:00:39.480> unit<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.320> see<00:00:40.500> there's<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:41.180> flange

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
this unit you can see there's a flange

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.990 
this unit you can see there's a flange
on<00:00:42.329> each<00:00:42.450> side<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.829> actually

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
on each side and so you can actually

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.180 
on each side and so you can actually
bolt<00:00:45.000> this<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.210> place<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.770> what<00:00:46.770> they<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.039> in

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
bolt this in place and what they have in

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.770 
bolt this in place and what they have in
mind<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.730> put<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.149> maybe<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
mind is that you put it in maybe the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.290 
mind is that you put it in maybe the
center<00:00:49.020> console<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.590> boat<00:00:49.860> or<00:00:50.300> possibly

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
of these big 10 inch subwoofers in a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.910 
of these big 10 inch subwoofers in a
flat<00:01:05.070> spot<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> bulkhead<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.770> have

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
flat spot on a bulkhead so what we have

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.780 
flat spot on a bulkhead so what we have
here<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> metal<00:01:09.030> grill<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:09.840> sounds

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
here is a metal grill with what sounds

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.380 
here is a metal grill with what sounds
awesome<00:01:11.790> tenant<00:01:12.420> subwoofer<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.979> case<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.180> all

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
awesome tenant subwoofer the case is all

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.420 
awesome tenant subwoofer the case is all
composite<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.259> thing<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.590> sturdy<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
composite and this thing is sturdy it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.679 
composite and this thing is sturdy it
weighs<00:01:17.640> about<00:01:18.270> 25<00:01:18.810> pounds<00:01:20.240> it<00:01:21.240> has<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
weighs about 25 pounds it has the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.810 
weighs about 25 pounds it has the
built-in<00:01:21.960> amplifier<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> look<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
built-in amplifier so if you look on the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.340 
built-in amplifier so if you look on the
back<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> amplifier

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
back here you can see all the amplifier

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.499 
back here you can see all the amplifier
controls<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.670> really<00:01:26.909> all<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.270> connect

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
controls so really all you do is connect

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.300 
controls so really all you do is connect
power<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.080> connect<00:01:28.350> your<00:01:28.439> RCA<00:01:28.829> cables

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
power to it and connect your RCA cables

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.580 
power to it and connect your RCA cables
and<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:30.270> instantly<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.840> subwoofer<00:01:31.200> so

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and you instantly have a subwoofer so

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.870 
and you instantly have a subwoofer so
it's<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> very<00:01:31.950> easy<00:01:32.130> installation

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
it's a very easy installation

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's a very easy installation
in<00:01:33.840> fact<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.290> sounds<00:01:34.650> gives<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.390> this

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
in fact what sounds gives you this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.719 
in fact what sounds gives you this
little<00:01:36.829> electrical<00:01:37.829> block<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.640> can

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
little electrical block here so you can

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.069 
little electrical block here so you can
put<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:38.909> heavy<00:01:39.150> gauge<00:01:39.360> wires<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> ear

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
put your heavy gauge wires in the ear

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.190 
put your heavy gauge wires in the ear
and<00:01:40.850> quickly<00:01:41.850> snap<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.420> place<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.049> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and quickly snap that in place so this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200 
and quickly snap that in place so this
will<00:01:43.350> make<00:01:43.500> removing<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.130> amplifier<00:01:44.640> simple

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
will make removing this amplifier simple

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.190 
will make removing this amplifier simple
if<00:01:45.299> you're<00:01:45.420> ready<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.630> send<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.930> back<00:01:48.200> they

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
if you're ready to send it back they

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.270 
if you're ready to send it back they
give<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.590> remote<00:01:50.240> bass<00:01:51.240> control<00:01:51.270> knob

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
give you this remote bass control knob

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.100 
give you this remote bass control knob
and<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.579> plugs<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.030> right<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.990> can

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and this plugs in right here and you can

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.200 
and this plugs in right here and you can
mount<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.470> up<00:01:55.920> under<00:01:56.250> somewhere<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.060> got<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
mount this up under somewhere it's got a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
mount this up under somewhere it's got a
couple<00:01:57.420> mounting<00:01:57.750> holes<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.079> sides<00:01:58.290> it's

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
couple mounting holes on the sides it's

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.709 
couple mounting holes on the sides it's
not<00:01:59.280> waterproof<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.090> sure<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.360> keep<00:02:00.479> this

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
not waterproof so be sure to keep this

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.130 
not waterproof so be sure to keep this
