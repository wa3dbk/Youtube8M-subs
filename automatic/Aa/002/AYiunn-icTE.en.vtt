 have to use with dry hair 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.160

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.900
 of aviÃ¡ wet stayed in the past by 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.420
 that before everyone was with 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.590
 the hair charred then now 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.690

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.370
 nutrition not a nutrition treatment 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.340
 that is also available to everyone 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.129
 little you of the forgiveness that you are 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.320
 makes and uses the daily iron 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.110
 daily that's a mistake too 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.430
 ask why 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.440
 every day you can not attack 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 same way the hair is not true this 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.699
 also remember that many people who 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.620
 uses the iron very followed in addition 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.120
 you also have to keep in mind that if 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.699
 it happens to you on the plate too many times 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.359
 what you are doing is burning yourself 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.359
 hair that more 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.479
 we have some super ingredients 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.520
 special ladies do not miss 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.100
 nourishing masks with things that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.140
 you can have at home let's see 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.490
 this nourishing mask that when you 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.820
 we have read it has seemed spectacular 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.040
 well it's good nutrition we have 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.080
 our reach at home to nurture the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.360
 hair by the excess or continuous of the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.970
 iron we have a lack that does not have 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.970
 one part in the refrigerator we have 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.950
 also oatmeal we have the egg whites 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.110
 that is super important and yogurt 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.550
 natural what you have to remember that the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.369
 amounts here do not have much to do 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:46.830
 we can definitely use a little 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:49.110
 of each of the products but what 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.539
 yes you need to first head the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 clean completely clean and that to the 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.820
 time to make the mixture then on it 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.640
 the product you have is weight because 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.350
 this is the exact texture that a 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.390
 pretty creamy texture so that 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.429
 be easy to use in the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.879
 hair here I'm going to use a little bit of 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.410
 product in the hair bristles now 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.360
 remember also if we have the help 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.099
 of someone because it is better to massage the 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 hair so that the product can 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.660
 enter the pores bone if 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.120
 we have help let's do this for 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.220
 example let's use the product and 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.890
 what we need can use the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.170
 product is able to save the hair with 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.470
 a towel and if it is hot in the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.180
 microwave will be much better 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.200
 that's right, you have to leave the product for 30 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.760
 or 40 minutes 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.400
 if you are using this treatment 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.560
 home is not necessary to reuse 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.950
 a conditioner or any cream 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.950
 stop 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.599
 thank you very much
