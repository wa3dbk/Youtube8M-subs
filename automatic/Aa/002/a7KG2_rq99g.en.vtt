we're gonna talk a little bit about

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.500 
we're gonna talk a little bit about
loading<00:00:18.350> your<00:00:18.619> trailer<00:00:19.190> whether<00:00:19.400> you<00:00:19.670> have<00:00:19.910> a

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
loading your trailer whether you have a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.320 
loading your trailer whether you have a
two-place<00:00:21.410> caravan<00:00:22.340> trailer<00:00:22.580> like<00:00:22.760> I<00:00:22.939> do<00:00:23.000> or

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
two-place caravan trailer like I do or

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.820 
two-place caravan trailer like I do or
whether<00:00:23.480> you<00:00:23.570> have<00:00:23.660> an<00:00:23.779> enclosed<00:00:24.170> pretty<00:00:24.650> much

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
whether you have an enclosed pretty much

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.470 
whether you have an enclosed pretty much
works<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:25.279> same<00:00:25.460> way<00:00:25.700> things<00:00:25.970> that<00:00:26.150> you<00:00:26.270> need

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
works the same way things that you need

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.540 
works the same way things that you need
on<00:00:26.660> your<00:00:26.810> trailer<00:00:27.230> to<00:00:27.410> ensure<00:00:27.800> that<00:00:28.040> loading

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
on your trailer to ensure that loading

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.339 
on your trailer to ensure that loading
and<00:00:28.670> unloading<00:00:28.730> your<00:00:29.240> sled<00:00:29.480> just<00:00:29.750> goes<00:00:29.930> super

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
and unloading your sled just goes super

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.280 
and unloading your sled just goes super
smooth<00:00:30.619> I<00:00:30.890> use<00:00:31.369> these<00:00:31.640> super<00:00:32.090> glides<00:00:32.329> on<00:00:32.960> my

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
smooth I use these super glides on my

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.170 
smooth I use these super glides on my
trailer<00:00:33.680> deck<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.160> reason<00:00:34.460> for<00:00:34.489> that<00:00:34.760> is

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
trailer deck and the reason for that is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.750 
trailer deck and the reason for that is
they<00:00:35.600> allow<00:00:35.840> ride<00:00:36.590> right<00:00:36.950> up<00:00:37.130> and<00:00:37.340> off<00:00:37.579> the

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
they allow ride right up and off the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.330 
they allow ride right up and off the
sled<00:00:37.970> super<00:00:38.510> easy<00:00:38.690> they<00:00:39.170> also<00:00:39.410> don't<00:00:39.860> damage

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
sled super easy they also don't damage

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
skis you can also turn on the super

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.470 
skis you can also turn on the super
glides<00:00:46.250> which<00:00:46.460> you<00:00:46.550> can't<00:00:46.760> do<00:00:47.000> with<00:00:47.030> any<00:00:47.390> other

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
glides which you can't do with any other

glides which you can't do with any other
glide<00:00:47.870> material<00:00:48.490> for<00:00:49.490> use<00:00:49.670> for<00:00:49.880> trailers<00:00:50.300> it's

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
glide material for use for trailers it's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.480 
glide material for use for trailers it's
also<00:00:50.930> essential<00:00:51.440> that<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:51.830> use<00:00:51.950> them<00:00:52.190> on<00:00:52.310> your

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
also essential that you use them on your

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.730 
also essential that you use them on your
aluminum<00:00:52.730> Rams<00:00:53.180> because<00:00:53.630> if<00:00:53.750> you<00:00:53.870> don't<00:00:54.080> the

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.740 
aluminum Rams because if you don't the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.500 
aluminum Rams because if you don't the
car<00:00:54.950> bites<00:00:55.130> can<00:00:55.310> bite<00:00:55.490> into<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.850> aluminum<00:00:56.120> and

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
car bites can bite into the aluminum and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.810 
car bites can bite into the aluminum and
then<00:00:56.600> if<00:00:56.720> you<00:00:56.840> have<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.560> give<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.520> lot<00:00:58.670> of

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
then if you have to give it a lot of

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.610 
then if you have to give it a lot of
throttle<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.390> then<00:00:59.480> it<00:00:59.570> hooks<00:00:59.780> up<00:01:00.020> you<00:01:00.470> can

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
throttle and then it hooks up you can

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.650 
throttle and then it hooks up you can
launch<00:01:00.860> your<00:01:01.190> sled<00:01:01.610> into<00:01:02.060> the<00:01:02.180> back<00:01:02.360> of<00:01:02.570> the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
launch your sled into the back of the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.970 
launch your sled into the back of the
pickup<00:01:02.960> which<00:01:03.140> I've<00:01:03.290> seen<00:01:03.440> a<00:01:03.470> number<00:01:03.829> of

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
pickup which I've seen a number of

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.249 
pickup which I've seen a number of
people<00:01:04.070> do<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:04.939> having<00:01:05.449> super<00:01:05.750> glides<00:01:05.960> on<00:01:06.110> your

the<00:01:11.299> other<00:01:11.479> advantage<00:01:11.990> of<00:01:12.079> the<00:01:12.170> super<00:01:12.320> glides

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
the other advantage of the super glides

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.190 
the other advantage of the super glides
is<00:01:12.920> they<00:01:13.340> have<00:01:13.579> grip<00:01:14.030> on<00:01:14.299> them<00:01:14.509> as<00:01:14.630> well<00:01:14.899> that

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
is they have grip on them as well that

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.679 
is they have grip on them as well that
enables<00:01:15.860> you<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.280> walk<00:01:16.670> up<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.270> down<00:01:17.450> your

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
advantage using super clamps is that you

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.699 
advantage using super clamps is that you
can<00:02:11.000> lock<00:02:11.299> them<00:02:11.599> both<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.080> front<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.530> rear
