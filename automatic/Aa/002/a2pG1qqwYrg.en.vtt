00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 well now continuing with the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.690
 research around this great 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.780
 object that was caught in front of the sun 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.269
 Well, as I was saying, a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.700
 great controversy that if it is a 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.130
 natural event that does have any 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.220
 explanation certainly not going to 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.310
 let go and they will attack or they will 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.920
 justify what you think is good you 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.529
 he is the best judge since he saw the images 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 now I listened to the explanations with 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.270
 fernando correa 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.910
 in the continuation of the investigation 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.360
 of the circular object that seems to be 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.820
 absorbing energy from the sun the video 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.070
 is going around the world the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.079
 NASA experts do not mention that it is 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.059
 some defect in the images but 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.540
 they try to explain it as a phenomenon 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.430
 called a hole in the solar corona 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.710
 arguing that it is something very common not 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.870
 However, they present video recordings that 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.600
 they do not seem to correspond with what 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.719
 observe with respect to the registered object the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.810
 March 8 , 2012 by his telescope 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.020
 dynamic solar the s of o that from the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.479
 space registered a circle or sphere that 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.770
 it must be huge and it was getting closer 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.539
 in the sun until a part is evident 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.630
 hours later the object is approaching 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:24.690
 even more and it remains literally 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.310
 connected to the solar atmosphere during 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.369
 more than 80 hours 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.700
 the object absorbed high filaments 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.979
 temperatures observe thus remained 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.990
 between 14 hours of universal time 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.840
 from day 8 until 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.030
 beginning of March 12 when he left 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.549
 moving away leaving a tremendous 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.549
 turbulence that lasted more than five hours 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.600
 the space telescope that today has 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.300
 observed the star king with different 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.410
 color filters since April 2010 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.080
 and I had never caught something like this in 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.930
 the different colors and videos appears 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.390
 this circular part on the internet have 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.210
 all kinds of controversies have arisen 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.910
 this unidentified object such as what 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.730
 describe various titles of the number 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.970
 of videos uploaded to the network although in the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.470
 nasa almost never intervenes publicly 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.230
 when strange objects appear 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.360
 near the sun on this occasion if I 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.080
 they did and the center scientist 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.360
 space goddard doctor alex young 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.990
 presented these explanations of 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.320
 streamwide javier maxi old city 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.320
 qinghua textual assemblies and it was not 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:03:01.140
 in the table 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.859
 Dr. Jon points out that it is a phenomenon 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.709
 common but watch and listen with 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:14.489
 attention how he tried to prove that this 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.489
 it happens frequently 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:27.909
 9 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:31.180
 is a reference in the masters know 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:34.239
 when to eat lands of san miguel 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.549
 lu qing fandi and its lands now 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.129
 watch carefully again the 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.530
 comparisons that are cited as 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.349
 multiple examples of a spherical object 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.850
 absorbing filaments from the sun though 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.280
 they mention that 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.280
 something common are not observed the same 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.390
 in another video they presented this 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.590
 in the images it is observed as the 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.080
 cavity comes out of the sun 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.110
 unlike the video that shows 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.560
 clearly like never before a sphere 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:23.140
 dark that is approaching the sun 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.040
 positions very close and attracts 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.440
 filaments is positive the intention of 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.410
 the nasa for trying to explain this 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.230
 object as a common phenomenon not 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.920
 However, on this occasion we do not share 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.950
 your opinion you judge for yourself and 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.110
 We believe that it would be beneficial 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.690
 they will also explain the various objects 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.830
 unidentified that have appeared in 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.300
 the shots of his space telescopes 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.330
 like this object 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.349
 when a solar flare hits him and 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.110
 then disappears was caught by the two 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:06.120
 stereo telescopes on December 1 , 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.120
 2011 observe 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:16.059
 also this object with shapes 

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:19.059
 rounded very strange it seems huge 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:21.939
 and close to the sun was captured by the 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:24.539
 soy telescope on December 3, 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.539
 2011 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.620
 also on December 30 , 2011 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:35.800
 the stereo telescope be captured an object 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:39.219
 awesome with pyramid shape or 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.650
 two triangles something that challenges the 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.080
 conventional explanations 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.009
 it was never pointed out that it was a defect in 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:51.069
 the UFO takes that look hollow is 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:53.800
 there and there are other evidences of 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:55.840
 mysterious bodies near the sun that 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.379
 so far they do not have an explanation 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.870
 complete as the dark spherical object 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:05.210
 that for more than 80 hours 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.270
 absorbed filaments of the sun 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.000
 it is about legitimate evidence of the 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.180
 nasa space telescopes that 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.419
 lead us to consider the possibility 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.250
 that of not being a new solar phenomenon 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:22.750
 then it could be about the presence 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.750
 of other intelligences
