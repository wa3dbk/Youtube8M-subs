clear all these buildings until we find

clear all these buildings until we find
the<00:00:43.020> scientists<00:00:43.500> when<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.739> find<00:00:43.950> the

the scientists when we find the

the scientists when we find the
scientists<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.910> safely<00:00:45.390> extract<00:00:46.379> her

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
scientists we have to safely extract her

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
scientists we have to safely extract her
back<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> extraction<00:00:47.969> point<00:00:48.149> which<00:00:48.960> is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
back to the extraction point which is

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.049 
back to the extraction point which is
the<00:00:49.350> same<00:00:49.590> point<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.280> infiltrated<00:00:50.850> on

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the same point that we infiltrated on

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.799 
the same point that we infiltrated on
and<00:00:52.160> that's<00:00:53.160> about<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.149> probably<00:00:54.539> one

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and that's about it this is probably one

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.650 
and that's about it this is probably one
of<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.110> easiest<00:00:55.500> strike<00:00:55.829> force<00:00:56.070> missions<00:00:56.660> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
of the easiest strike force missions to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.380 
of the easiest strike force missions to
do<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.020> veteran<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.699> really<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.239> really

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390

like<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.690> strategy<00:01:00.930> aspect<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:01.770> strategy

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
like the strategy aspect I like strategy

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
like the strategy aspect I like strategy
games<00:01:02.460> even<00:01:03.239> though<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.449> don't<00:01:03.539> I'm<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.019> play

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260

games even though I don't I'm to play
them<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.680> computer<00:01:05.189> but<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
them on the computer but I like the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
them on the computer but I like the
strategy<00:01:07.409> aspect<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> can't<00:01:08.790> want

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
strategy aspect and when you can't want

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.969 
strategy aspect and when you can't want
to<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> first-person<00:01:12.979> do

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

to you know go down the first-person do
what<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> gotta<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:14.970> where<00:01:15.210> our

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
what you gotta do so this is where our

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.649 
what you gotta do so this is where our
infiltrating<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:17.369> we<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.759> seal<00:01:18.030> teams<00:01:18.330> I

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
infiltrating so we have to seal teams I

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.990 
infiltrating so we have to seal teams I
don't<00:01:19.140> use<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.650> minigun<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> helicopter

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
don't use the minigun on the helicopter

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.600 
don't use the minigun on the helicopter
at<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> don't<00:01:21.630> really<00:01:22.140> need<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.920> i<00:01:23.189> think

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
at all I don't really need to i think

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.070 
at all I don't really need to i think
the<00:01:23.850> boots<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> ground<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.630> must<00:01:24.840> do<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the boots on the ground we must do the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.560 
the boots on the ground we must do the
job<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.409> said<00:01:25.650> one<00:01:25.860> SEAL<00:01:26.130> team<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> building

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
job I said one SEAL team to the building

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.270 
job I said one SEAL team to the building
all<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.020> way<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.380> right<00:01:28.650> right<00:01:28.979> there

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
all the way to the right right there

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.850 
all the way to the right right there
unless<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:30.060> one<00:01:30.360> SEAL<00:01:30.659> team<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
unless on one SEAL team so the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.090 
unless on one SEAL team so the
building's<00:01:32.450> far<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.810> left<00:01:33.890> right<00:01:34.890> there

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
building's far to the left right there

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.469 
building's far to the left right there
clear<00:01:35.400> those<00:01:35.579> right<00:01:35.759> away<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.299> she's

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
clear those right away because if she's

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
clear those right away because if she's
in<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.229> pull<00:01:37.500> her<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:37.650> really

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
in there we can pull her out really

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.100 
in there we can pull her out really
quick<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> contact<00:01:39.479> should<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.750> minimal

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
quick and contact should be minimal

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.530 
quick and contact should be minimal
because<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:41.280> enemies<00:01:41.640> are<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:41.850> getting<00:01:42.420> in

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
because the enemies are just getting in

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.899 
because the enemies are just getting in
and<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.200> believe<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:43.649> like<00:01:44.460> six<00:01:44.729> minutes

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and I believe we have like six minutes

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.160 
and I believe we have like six minutes
to<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:46.200> than<00:01:46.439> enough<00:01:46.649> time<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.960> once

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
to do this more than enough time so once

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.980 
to do this more than enough time so once
I<00:01:49.259> clear<00:01:49.470> these<00:01:49.590> two<00:01:49.770> buildings<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.990> send

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
I clear these two buildings I can send

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.630 
I clear these two buildings I can send
my<00:01:52.110> seals<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.829> building<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.280> there

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
my seals to that building right there

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.120 
my seals to that building right there
right<00:01:53.909> next<00:01:54.030> door<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.960> once<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:55.680> she's<00:01:55.829> not<00:01:56.009> in

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
right next door and once if she's not in

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
extraction point what I found is take

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.080 
extraction point what I found is take
controller<00:04:09.920> her<00:04:10.160> as<00:04:10.430> long<00:04:10.700> as<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:10.910> know

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
controller her as long as you know

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.880 
controller her as long as you know
there's<00:04:11.300> not<00:04:11.420> enemies<00:04:11.600> around<00:04:11.960> for<00:04:12.740> some

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
there's not enemies around for some

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.500 
there's not enemies around for some
reason<00:04:13.250> if<00:04:13.400> you<00:04:13.610> take<00:04:13.790> control<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:14.180> her<00:04:14.330> she

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
reason if you take control of her she

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.590 
reason if you take control of her she
dies<00:04:14.780> really<00:04:15.200> fast

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
dies really fast

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.240 
dies really fast
look<00:04:17.600> my<00:04:17.810> units<00:04:18.170> just<00:04:18.290> like<00:04:18.440> left<00:04:18.859> here<00:04:19.040> pretty

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
look my units just like left here pretty

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.849 
look my units just like left here pretty
much<00:04:19.540> and<00:04:20.540> when<00:04:21.170> you<00:04:21.260> take<00:04:21.410> control<00:04:21.530> of<00:04:21.739> her

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
much and when you take control of her

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.040 
much and when you take control of her
she<00:04:21.980> dies<00:04:22.190> a<00:04:22.220> lot<00:04:22.460> quicker<00:04:22.700> than<00:04:22.880> when<00:04:23.480> you<00:04:24.020> are

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
she dies a lot quicker than when you are

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:31.210 
she dies a lot quicker than when you are
up<00:04:24.440> in<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:25.990> strategic<00:04:26.990> view<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.910> uh<00:04:30.130> I'm<00:04:31.130> not
