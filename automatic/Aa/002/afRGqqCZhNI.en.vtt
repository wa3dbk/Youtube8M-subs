00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:12.009
 hi guys today I'll tell you is 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.480
 on a very important topic that is the 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.490
 preoperative 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.640
 There are many doubts about the 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.400
 and I'm here to talk about the 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.430
 main doubts and clarify for 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.380
 you some very important points 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.210
 about the preoperative as I have always 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.240
 GIs say patience 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:35.530
 preoperative treatment is already a 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:39.880
 surgery is a good pre-operation 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:44.380
 means already in the middle of the 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:47.320
 50 percent process is a good one. 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.510
 result for your post operative period to 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.550
 your surgery be a success 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:57.700
 then there are some some are some 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.059
 some very important items and I 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.130
 I would like to point out to you that it is the 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.890
 first the first derby of these these 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.140
 items is a good one in guinea xiii that 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.740
 means the first contact with your 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.440
 surgeon this ship nese the query 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.250
 What are you doing for the first time? 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.619
 must have a minimum of 40 minutes at a time. 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.190
 hour and a half because he's the first 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.470
 contact the surgeon will 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.979
 little of each 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:36.340
 not only the part is aesthetic but also 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.380
 everything about health and its history 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.020
 previous diseases 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.700
 so it is very important that this 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.000
 first moment 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.540
 the first appointment with your surgeon is 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.790
 you go with the available time that you 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.000
 take all this time to say it all 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:58.090
 that you want everything was about your 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.060
 health as it has evolved if it has 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.479
 some intercurrence, that is 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.930
 fundamental is then starting from this 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.350
 history is 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.630
 returns from illness, or the use of some 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.390
 type of medication 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.200
 all this has to be reported in your 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.860
 medical record and this medical record 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.120
 everything has that is reported is leaving 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:30.590
 hence we are going to think about it now 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.310
 physical examination 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.420
 part of history's parties that 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.750
 you told 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:43.040
 we go to an examination of the body then there 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.709
 The doctor bothers me with discomfort. 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.760
 with mama so we're going back to 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.880
 to examine 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.910
 I'm obviously going to give preference to your 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.560
 Mom and from then on we will have 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.550
 that examine other parts of the body 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.280
 also because it's up to the doctor to do 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.180
 investigation to see if 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.030
 is there any other disease associated with 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.790
 some other surgical indication and a 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.830
 surgeon is here for that too. 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.739
 I had many patients, for example, who 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.820
 came to operate the abdomen and had 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.110
 r is umbilical that can be 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.320
 corrected 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.959
 also during the 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.739
 abdominoplasty but could not 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.660
 in the case of a liposuction then 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.840
 there are some diseases that are 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.680
 detected at the physical examination of the patient 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:44.209
 which is also fundamental is after the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.340
 physical examination, there are those 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.070
 exams exam request 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.239
 complementary examinations are also very 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.230
 important 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.260
 I have a request for a nerd criteria 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.519
 examination of both laboratory tests 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.040
 would blood urine is imaging is 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.310
 would be an operative chest x-ray 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.609
 The abdominal wall is the 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.530
 mammography when necessary is also the 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.230
 breast ultrasound that goes 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.239
 depending on what I went through is 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.680
 proposing to carry out the procedure 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.560
 surgical 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:25.100
 then these exams are also 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.270
 but as the name implies 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.789
 they are complementary as 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:36.470
 important is the clinic the clinic is 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:38.780
 always sovereign then the disease is not to that 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.020
 contact the surgeon 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.880
 especially of his life he is much more 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.110
 important than the exams 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.990
 complementary 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.500
 the complementary tests they will only give 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.979
 the surgeon to the doctor what he has already 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.960
 the patient who had the 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.380
 normal exams 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.229
 logical that we expect to have right pre 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.349
 that they are more then 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:08.900
 by the history we have 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.820
 first consultation and the patient 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.340
 specifically the patient for the 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.409
 plastic surgery it has to be a 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.440
 patient can not be a 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.430
 patient with comorbidities with 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.630
 serious 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:26.990
 We always put the following is the 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:30.710
 patient for plastic surgery it 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:34.130
 has to meet the criteria for 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.760
 normality of health may be in a 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:41.030
 surgical risk grade two because they are 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:43.010
 type of diabetes is 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.300
 hypertension patient 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:50.750
 are then 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:54.020
 controlled diseases that can then be 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:59.449
 to undergo cosmetic surgery right 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:01.759
 So it's I think this is what I 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:05.449
 I'd like you to understand, it's not 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.849
 because I have high blood pressure that 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.759
 I can not do 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:11.529
 the plastic is not like that right since 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:15.879
 you have a follow-up 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:18.219
 cardiological since you have it is 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:20.789
 take the remedy also that the 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:23.289
 cardiologist has prescribed and you 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.539
 regularly and be the pre- level 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:27.729
 well-controlled history has no 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:30.819
 no problem to submit to a 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:33.580
 surgical procedure is another point 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:38.589
 important at this time of the first 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:42.039
 consultation is to inform your doctor about the 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:45.419
 of any kind of drug I drug 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:49.119
 I say any kind even 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:53.379
 alcohol smoking is very important 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:55.629
 For example smoking is what we ask for. 

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:58.240
 to the maximum that the patient can achieve 

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:01.689
 suspend before the procedure 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:04.209
 I'm sure it has experience beginning 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:06.879
 You do not get who's right in that 

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:09.339
 in the routine of very heavy work 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:12.399
 will succeed in getting out of the way 

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:14.860
 totally the cigarette and I already know then 

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:17.139
 has already spoken at its core is to 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:20.800
 much as you can right 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:24.759
 it is we also have some weapons not 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:28.329
 is against and smoking is what would be 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:29.919
 the medications that would also be the 

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:31.959
 hyperbaric therapy 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.300
 I hope you have clarified it for you. 

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:38.399
 some important points and let's 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.399
 talking a kiss
