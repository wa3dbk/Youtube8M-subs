navigate<00:03:33.660> with<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.990> mouse<00:03:34.200> then<00:03:34.800> you<00:03:34.980> will

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
navigate with the mouse then you will

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.670 
navigate with the mouse then you will
use<00:03:35.160> on<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.060> click<00:03:36.330> and<00:03:36.630> it's<00:03:37.410> really<00:03:37.620> easy

use on to to click and it's really easy

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.820 
use on to to click and it's really easy
to<00:03:37.980> use<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.550> basically<00:03:39.420> like<00:03:39.840> using<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.260> xbox
