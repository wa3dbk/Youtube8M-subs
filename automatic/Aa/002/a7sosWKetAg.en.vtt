00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.060
 Look and just see what I 'm doing. 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.619
 making a video for you 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.519
 after so much time so here at tb 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:35.210
 Must be in the Divine Ward. 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:35.210
 recently one of those who moves the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:56.070
 fast play and you should play with 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:09.049
 other characters and of the 120 that neither 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:12.960
 running with 7 ends up in the case right? 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:20.090
 not usual in the current would be a point 7 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.090
 is already almost 100 in a 1.8 mother 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.619
 I think it allows you to play with these 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.650
 characters like I said that you have the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.930
 quick change, just change everything I think 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.850
 that the effect of the mother on the blue beret and I think 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.130
 that I have never seen here on tb r 1,000 in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.380
 but I think it gives the effect 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.990
 quick exchange but can be the item 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.250
 but also how do you try 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.549
 version 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.509
 so I do not know how to grow the beret effect 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.509
 blue but can also be 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.040
 so for those who like shocks who likes 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.170
 of snape 30 existing here in TB must 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.630
 now with 80's car get easy yet 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.590
 who was in doubt buying himself 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.020
 no item 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.450
 It 's really cool, it really helps. 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.450
 Pretty soon I want to do it here. 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.930
 practicing quixote is very cool 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:15.420
 much faster than using the pr but who 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.390
 have doubt what you can not buy can 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.350
 with this thought the assignment of 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.090
 server 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.350

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.490
