00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
number of rods but we recommend that you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.180 
number of rods but we recommend that you
use<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.850> least<00:01:54.119> two<00:01:54.540> ground<00:01:54.840> rods<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.530> then<00:01:56.040> as

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
use at least two ground rods and then as

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.340 
use at least two ground rods and then as
you<00:01:56.310> begin<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.910> get<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> more<00:01:57.930> powerful

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
you begin to get a more powerful

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.770 
you begin to get a more powerful
energizer<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.880> would<00:02:00.030> then<00:02:00.180> increase<00:02:00.600> by

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
energizer you would then increase by

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.870 
energizer you would then increase by
that<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.710> also<00:02:01.860> always<00:02:02.369> refer<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> your

determine<00:02:05.580> how<00:02:05.729> many<00:02:05.790> ground<00:02:06.180> rods<00:02:06.390> you'll

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
determine how many ground rods you'll

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.930 
determine how many ground rods you'll
need<00:02:06.780> as<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.740> round<00:02:07.860> rod<00:02:08.190> your<00:02:08.429> first<00:02:08.640> ground

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
need as you round rod your first ground

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.570 
need as you round rod your first ground
rod<00:02:09.179> what<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.890> drive<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.220> down

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
rod what you can do is drive it down

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.910 
rod what you can do is drive it down
directly<00:02:12.330> right<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:12.810> under<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.319> energizer

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
directly right up under the energizer

itself<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.780> then<00:02:16.350> for<00:02:16.770> all<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.190> consecutive

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
itself and then for all the consecutive

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.240 
itself and then for all the consecutive
ground<00:02:18.120> rods<00:02:18.390> after<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.709> need<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.980> space

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
ground rods after that you need to space

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.680 
ground rods after that you need to space
them<00:02:20.490> apart<00:02:20.850> from<00:02:20.970> each<00:02:21.180> other

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
them apart from each other

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.559 
them apart from each other
at<00:02:22.050> least<00:02:22.470> ten<00:02:22.860> foot<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:24.000> what<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.360> does

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
at least ten foot because what it does

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.230 
at least ten foot because what it does
is<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.650> ground<00:02:25.920> itself<00:02:26.310> takes<00:02:26.670> about<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.970> nine

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
is the ground itself takes about a nine

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.030 
is the ground itself takes about a nine
foot<00:02:27.600> circumference<00:02:28.140> around<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.770> ground

foot circumference around that ground

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.860 
foot circumference around that ground
rod<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.610> don't<00:02:29.850> want<00:02:30.030> those<00:02:30.209> those

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
rod so you don't want those those

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.840 
rod so you don't want those those
circles<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.470> overlap<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.130> want<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.550> as

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
circles to overlap you want to have as

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.120

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
much ground that you can so that you can

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.520 
much ground that you can so that you can
get<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.310> sufficient<00:02:35.880> ground<00:02:36.150> just<00:02:37.140> taking

get that sufficient ground just taking

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.500 
get that sufficient ground just taking
just<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.890> steel<00:02:38.280> t-post<00:02:38.790> driver<00:02:39.090> or<00:02:39.240> whatever

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
you're going to drive it down into the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.100 
you're going to drive it down into the

ground itself drive it down to within
just<00:02:43.380> right<00:02:44.220> at<00:02:44.370> surface<00:02:44.790> level<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:47.040> then<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
just right at surface level and then to

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.780 
just right at surface level and then to
make<00:02:47.490> that<00:02:47.640> connection<00:02:48.200> from<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.670> you're<00:02:50.670> just

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
make that connection from it you're just

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.100 
make that connection from it you're just
going<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.970> use<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> piece<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.540> your<00:02:51.660> under<00:02:51.930> gate

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
going to use a piece of your under gate

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.479 
going to use a piece of your under gate
cable<00:02:52.530> itself

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.759 

and<00:02:58.060> then<00:02:58.209> of<00:02:58.659> course<00:02:58.719> what<00:02:59.079> you<00:02:59.170> got<00:02:59.319> to<00:02:59.439> do<00:02:59.560> is

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
and then of course what you got to do is

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.309 
and then of course what you got to do is
remove<00:03:00.189> the<00:03:00.400> insulation<00:03:00.819> from<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.299> the<00:03:02.049> under

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
remove the insulation from the the under

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.670 
remove the insulation from the the under
gate<00:03:02.500> cable<00:03:06.930> we'll<00:03:07.930> be<00:03:08.079> able<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.260> expose<00:03:08.650> that

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
gate cable we'll be able to expose that

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.349 
gate cable we'll be able to expose that
right<00:03:09.099> there<00:03:10.469> and<00:03:11.469> then<00:03:11.650> with<00:03:11.829> the<00:03:11.920> use<00:03:12.099> of

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
right there and then with the use of

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.250 
right there and then with the use of
some<00:03:13.359> people<00:03:13.659> call<00:03:13.870> them<00:03:14.019> just<00:03:14.200> acre<00:03:14.590> nuts<00:03:15.040> or

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
some people call them just acre nuts or

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.750 
some people call them just acre nuts or
different<00:03:17.260> types<00:03:17.439> of<00:03:17.680> connectors<00:03:18.280> themself

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
different types of connectors themself

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.640 
different types of connectors themself
you'll<00:03:18.969> find<00:03:19.239> in<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.599> ground<00:03:19.840> rod<00:03:20.019> section

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
you'll find in the ground rod section

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.059 
you'll find in the ground rod section
whenever<00:03:21.549> you<00:03:21.670> go<00:03:21.849> to<00:03:21.879> get<00:03:22.120> your<00:03:22.269> ground<00:03:22.510> rod

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
whenever you go to get your ground rod

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.440 
whenever you go to get your ground rod
it's<00:03:24.069> basically<00:03:24.459> it's<00:03:24.700> going<00:03:24.819> to<00:03:24.909> be<00:03:25.000> slid<00:03:25.299> up

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
it's basically it's going to be slid up

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.020 
it's basically it's going to be slid up
onto<00:03:25.780> there<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.379> then<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.430> can<00:03:27.519> see<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.849> wire

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
onto there and then you can see the wire

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.220 
onto there and then you can see the wire
itself<00:03:28.650> then<00:03:30.599> it's<00:03:31.599> going<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.810> go<00:03:31.930> right<00:03:32.079> up

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
itself then it's going to go right up

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.159 
itself then it's going to go right up
under<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.829> and<00:03:33.669> as<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.239> tighten<00:03:34.689> it<00:03:34.810> down<00:03:34.840> on

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
under it and as you tighten it down on

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:42.780 
under it and as you tighten it down on
there<00:03:40.709> if<00:03:41.709> that's<00:03:41.919> going<00:03:42.099> to<00:03:42.159> do<00:03:42.250> then<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.519> make

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
there if that's going to do then is make

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.819 
there if that's going to do then is make
that<00:03:42.909> good<00:03:43.120> connection<00:03:43.599> to<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.590> course

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
that good connection to it and of course

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.229 
that good connection to it and of course
if<00:03:44.980> this<00:03:45.099> were<00:03:45.280> down<00:03:45.430> into<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:45.700> ground<00:03:45.969> you

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
if this were down into the ground you

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.479 
if this were down into the ground you
trail<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.959> right<00:03:47.169> back<00:03:47.349> up<00:03:47.590> coming<00:03:48.129> back<00:03:48.310> up

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
trail that right back up coming back up

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.699 
trail that right back up coming back up
to<00:03:48.609> your<00:03:48.700> energizer<00:03:49.290> connecting<00:03:50.290> into<00:03:50.590> the

to your energizer connecting into the

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.280 
to your energizer connecting into the
ground<00:03:50.980> terminal<00:03:51.310> itself<00:03:51.930> there's<00:03:52.930> something

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
ground terminal itself there's something

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.110 
ground terminal itself there's something
we<00:03:53.379> didn't<00:03:53.590> talk<00:03:53.709> about<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:54.040> moment<00:03:54.430> ago<00:03:54.639> what

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
we didn't talk about a moment ago what

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.429 
we didn't talk about a moment ago what
we'll<00:03:55.299> do<00:03:55.450> is<00:03:55.569> we'll<00:03:55.689> take<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:55.959> energizer

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 
we'll do is we'll take the energizer

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.469 
we'll do is we'll take the energizer
back<00:03:56.769> off<00:03:59.639> the<00:04:00.639> lightning<00:04:01.090> bolt<00:04:01.299> would

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
back off the lightning bolt would

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.110 
back off the lightning bolt would
represent<00:04:01.870> your<00:04:02.379> electric<00:04:03.340> that's<00:04:03.790> where<00:04:03.970> the

represent your electric that's where the

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.520 
represent your electric that's where the
electrical<00:04:04.659> charge<00:04:04.900> is<00:04:05.079> going<00:04:05.199> to<00:04:05.319> come<00:04:05.500> out

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
electrical charge is going to come out

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.890 
electrical charge is going to come out

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
of it this symbol right here represents

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.839 
of it this symbol right here represents
ground<00:04:08.620> that's<00:04:08.859> the<00:04:09.040> ground<00:04:09.310> connection

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
ground that's the ground connection

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.479 
ground that's the ground connection
right<00:04:10.000> there<00:04:10.620> all<00:04:11.620> right<00:04:11.859> what<00:04:12.129> we're<00:04:12.280> doing

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
right there all right what we're doing

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.210 
right there all right what we're doing
now<00:04:12.669> is<00:04:13.120> coming<00:04:13.569> from<00:04:13.689> our<00:04:13.870> energizer<00:04:14.379> back<00:04:15.010> to

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
now is coming from our energizer back to

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.900 
now is coming from our energizer back to
making<00:04:15.489> our<00:04:15.609> connection<00:04:16.060> right<00:04:16.239> into<00:04:16.479> here

going to do is use a couple of our

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:23.360 
going to do is use a couple of our
staples<00:05:21.150> what<00:05:22.150> we<00:05:22.270> would<00:05:22.419> do<00:05:22.569> then<00:05:22.840> just

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
staples what we would do then just

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.820 
staples what we would do then just
continue<00:05:24.370> that<00:05:24.550> right<00:05:24.759> on<00:05:24.880> across<00:05:25.830> securing

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
it all the way across until we get over

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.260 
it all the way across until we get over
to<00:05:30.069> where<00:05:30.250> our<00:05:30.280> energizer<00:05:30.880> itself<00:05:31.389> is<00:05:33.270> cutting

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
to where our energizer itself is cutting

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.110 
to where our energizer itself is cutting
it<00:05:34.389> to<00:05:34.569> length<00:05:34.599> that<00:05:34.990> we<00:05:35.139> need<00:05:38.880> what<00:05:39.880> we<00:05:40.000> would

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
it to length that we need what we would

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.060 
it to length that we need what we would
do<00:05:40.270> there<00:05:40.539> of<00:05:41.169> course<00:05:41.409> we've<00:05:41.560> got<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:41.830> remove

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
do there of course we've got to remove

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.760 
do there of course we've got to remove
the<00:05:42.419> polymer<00:05:43.419> from<00:05:43.539> the<00:05:43.690> end<00:05:43.810> of<00:05:43.930> here<00:05:44.229> so<00:05:44.620> that

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
the polymer from the end of here so that

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.600 
the polymer from the end of here so that
we'd<00:05:44.889> be<00:05:45.009> able<00:05:45.070> to<00:05:45.250> make<00:05:45.460> that<00:05:45.639> connection<00:05:47.610> got

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
we'd be able to make that connection got

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.490 
we'd be able to make that connection got
our<00:05:48.729> bare<00:05:48.940> wire<00:05:49.180> itself<00:05:49.630> and<00:05:50.229> what<00:05:50.380> we're

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
our bare wire itself and what we're

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.950 
our bare wire itself and what we're
going<00:05:50.620> to<00:05:50.650> do<00:05:50.800> then<00:05:51.039> is<00:05:51.699> come<00:05:51.969> in<00:05:52.180> connect<00:05:52.840> to

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
going to do then is come in connect to

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.050 
going to do then is come in connect to
the<00:05:53.050> backside<00:05:53.440> of<00:05:53.469> our<00:05:53.650> energizer<00:05:54.130> then<00:05:54.909> that

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
the backside of our energizer then that

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.540 
the backside of our energizer then that
will<00:05:55.210> complete<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:55.900> ability<00:05:56.409> to<00:05:56.860> get<00:05:57.430> our

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
will complete the ability to get our

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.190 
will complete the ability to get our
electricity<00:05:58.349> to<00:05:59.349> our<00:05:59.380> rail<00:05:59.740> itself
