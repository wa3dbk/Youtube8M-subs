he<00:02:52.370> know<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.760> were<00:02:52.970> rookies<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.750> we

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
he know that were rookies in that we

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.199 
he know that were rookies in that we
don't<00:02:54.380> really<00:02:54.709> know<00:02:54.889> what<00:02:55.670> everybody's<00:02:56.180> doing
