00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
and that's so that you don't yank on it

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.780 
and that's so that you don't yank on it
and<00:01:26.590> have<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.800> just<00:01:27.070> yank<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.430> whole<00:01:27.550> thing

and have it just yank the whole thing
out<00:01:27.909> and<00:01:28.440> possibly<00:01:29.440> break<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:29.830> cord<00:01:30.100> so<00:01:30.520> very
