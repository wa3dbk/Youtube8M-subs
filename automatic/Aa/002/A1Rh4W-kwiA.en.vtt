00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.710 
with homing missiles it sounds fair
enough<00:02:56.890> but<00:02:57.280> here's<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.580> thing<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:58.299> missiles

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
enough but here's the thing the missiles

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.809 
enough but here's the thing the missiles
don't<00:02:59.200> hurt<00:02:59.590> him<00:02:59.829> you<00:03:00.010> have<00:03:00.129> to<00:03:00.220> use<00:03:00.430> them<00:03:00.670> so

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
don't hurt him you have to use them so

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.250 
don't hurt him you have to use them so
he<00:03:00.940> drops<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.360> marbles<00:03:01.629> he's<00:03:01.750> carrying<00:03:02.110> so

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
he drops the marbles he's carrying so

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.990 
he drops the marbles he's carrying so
you<00:03:02.349> can<00:03:02.500> collect<00:03:02.620> all<00:03:02.799> 100<00:03:03.310> he<00:03:03.549> can<00:03:03.730> shoot<00:03:03.879> you

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
you can collect all 100 he can shoot you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.759 
you can collect all 100 he can shoot you
too<00:03:04.239> naturally<00:03:04.959> but<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.349> makes<00:03:05.470> he<00:03:05.620> drop

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
too naturally but that makes he drop

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.759 
too naturally but that makes he drop
models<00:03:06.129> and<00:03:06.310> lose<00:03:06.940> health<00:03:07.239> you<00:03:07.810> can<00:03:08.230> dodge<00:03:08.590> his

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
models and lose health you can dodge his

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.500 
models and lose health you can dodge his
missiles<00:03:09.190> but<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.519> really<00:03:09.849> have<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.030> nail<00:03:10.329> the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
missiles but you really have to nail the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.970 
missiles but you really have to nail the
timing<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.019> camera<00:03:11.409> is<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:11.680> close<00:03:11.950> you

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
timing and the camera is so close you

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.100 
timing and the camera is so close you
barely<00:03:12.310> have<00:03:12.519> any<00:03:12.700> time<00:03:12.879> to<00:03:13.060> react<00:03:13.329> why<00:03:13.840> don't

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
barely have any time to react why don't

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.170 
barely have any time to react why don't
my<00:03:14.349> missiles<00:03:14.769> hurt<00:03:15.040> him<00:03:15.220> why<00:03:15.579> he's<00:03:15.849> so<00:03:16.060> much

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
my missiles hurt him why he's so much

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.880 
my missiles hurt him why he's so much
more<00:03:16.209> accurate<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:17.019> why<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.319> so<00:03:17.530> hard<00:03:17.799> to

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
more accurate and why is it so hard to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.410 
more accurate and why is it so hard to
steer<00:03:18.190> this<00:03:18.340> pig<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.819> actually<00:03:19.120> collect<00:03:19.299> the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
steer this pig to actually collect the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.349 
steer this pig to actually collect the
marbles<00:03:19.890> alright<00:03:20.890> forget<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.640> last<00:03:21.819> one<00:03:22.150> but

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
marbles alright forget that last one but

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.750 
marbles alright forget that last one but
anyway<00:03:22.810> so<00:03:23.049> I<00:03:23.319> eventually<00:03:23.799> beat<00:03:24.250> him<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.700> I

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
anyway so I eventually beat him and I

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.099 
anyway so I eventually beat him and I
moved<00:03:24.970> on<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.269> next<00:03:25.390> level<00:03:25.660> hence

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
moved on to the next level hence

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.930 
moved on to the next level hence
unnecessary<00:03:26.620> long<00:03:26.799> time<00:03:27.069> collecting<00:03:27.519> marbles

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
unnecessary long time collecting marbles

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.839 
unnecessary long time collecting marbles
so<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:28.090> could<00:03:28.299> get<00:03:28.359> to<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.510> next<00:03:28.840> boss<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.349> oh

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
so I could get to the next boss and oh

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:32.789 
so I could get to the next boss and oh
no<00:03:30.849> not<00:03:31.239> another<00:03:31.510> one<00:03:31.629> of<00:03:31.840> these<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.620> it's

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
no not another one of these and it's

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.860 
no not another one of these and it's
harder<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.430> time<00:03:33.489> as<00:03:33.909> well<00:03:34.090> he<00:03:34.450> can<00:03:34.599> teleport

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
harder this time as well he can teleport

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.720 
harder this time as well he can teleport
to<00:03:35.200> avoid<00:03:35.470> my<00:03:35.620> missiles<00:03:36.040> and<00:03:36.250> now<00:03:36.310> each<00:03:36.459> hit

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
to avoid my missiles and now each hit

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.490 
to avoid my missiles and now each hit
knocks<00:03:36.970> off<00:03:37.120> twice<00:03:37.510> as<00:03:37.750> much<00:03:37.870> of<00:03:38.079> my<00:03:38.230> health

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
knocks off twice as much of my health

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.860 
knocks off twice as much of my health
why<00:03:39.340> did<00:03:39.579> they<00:03:39.700> reuse<00:03:40.090> this<00:03:40.269> become<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.659> why<00:03:40.840> am

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
why did they reuse this become it why am

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.960 
why did they reuse this become it why am
