design and develop products I cook on

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.220 
design and develop products I cook on
them<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.150> put<00:00:27.509> everything<00:00:27.720> through<00:00:28.050> their

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
them and I put everything through their

paces<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.890> make<00:00:29.070> sure<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.520> they<00:00:29.790> live<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
paces and make sure that they live up to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
expectations that we have for Weber

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.150 
expectations that we have for Weber
products<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> essentially<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.770> paid<00:00:37.949> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
products so essentially I get paid to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.290 
products so essentially I get paid to
grill<00:00:38.370> all<00:00:38.580> day<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.970> then<00:00:39.059> tell<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
grill all day and then tell the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.060 
grill all day and then tell the
engineers<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.840> think<00:00:40.080> about<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.769> it's

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
engineers what I think about it so it's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.400 
engineers what I think about it so it's
a<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> pretty<00:00:41.580> good<00:00:41.790> job<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.600> do<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.080> lot<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
a it's a pretty good job we do a lot of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.049 
a it's a pretty good job we do a lot of
our<00:00:43.590> testing<00:00:43.980> indoors<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.699> that<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:44.910> can

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
our testing indoors so that we can

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.580 
our testing indoors so that we can
control<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.540> environment<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.170> learn<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.500> we

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
control the environment to learn what we

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.200 
control the environment to learn what we
want<00:00:46.769> to<00:00:46.860> learn<00:00:46.980> about<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.340> product<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:47.910> it's

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
want to learn about the product so it's

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.870 
want to learn about the product so it's
a<00:00:48.300> little<00:00:48.510> bit<00:00:48.630> strange<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.590> grill<00:00:50.130> inside<00:00:50.579> but

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
a little bit strange to grill inside but

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.610 
a little bit strange to grill inside but
it's<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.210> fun<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.420> we're<00:00:51.630> all<00:00:51.750> set<00:00:51.960> up<00:00:52.079> we

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
it's kind of fun and we're all set up we

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.160 
it's kind of fun and we're all set up we
have<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.890> big<00:00:53.629> ventilation<00:00:54.629> system<00:00:55.020> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
have this big ventilation system that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.720 
have this big ventilation system that
obviously<00:00:55.260> sucks<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:55.950> the<00:00:56.100> smoke<00:00:56.460> all

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
obviously sucks out all the smoke all

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.180 
obviously sucks out all the smoke all
the<00:00:56.850> carbon<00:00:57.149> monoxide<00:00:57.800> we<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> fire

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
the carbon monoxide we have a fire

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.100 
the carbon monoxide we have a fire
system<00:00:59.700> we<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.910> carbon<00:01:00.210> monoxide<00:01:00.660> detectors

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
system we have carbon monoxide detectors

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.470 
system we have carbon monoxide detectors
in<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.010> very<00:01:02.219> safe<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.450> I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
in here so it's very safe and then I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.510 
in here so it's very safe and then I
have<00:01:03.719> all<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.140> our<00:01:04.440> accessories<00:01:04.949> available

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520

where we do a lot of cooking but that's
that's<00:01:19.590> off-limits<00:01:19.890> for<00:01:20.310> today<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.909> lot<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.299> our

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that's off-limits for today a lot of our

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.090 
that's off-limits for today a lot of our
testing<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.900> start<00:01:22.140> indoors<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:22.979> this

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
testing will start indoors here in this

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.130 
testing will start indoors here in this
kitchen<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:24.180> once<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.479> get<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> product

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
kitchen and then once we get the product

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.020 
kitchen and then once we get the product
to<00:01:25.439> do<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:26.010> we<00:01:26.130> want<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.880> take

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
to do what we want it to do then we take

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.250 
to do what we want it to do then we take
it<00:01:27.090> outside<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.720> put<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.020> real-world

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
it outside and put it in real-world

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.230 
it outside and put it in real-world
conditions<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.220> rerun<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.520> same<00:01:29.760> test<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
conditions and rerun the same test and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.429 
conditions and rerun the same test and
make<00:01:30.330> sure<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.630> it<00:01:30.750> will<00:01:30.840> perform<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.290> any

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
make sure that it will perform in any

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.070 
make sure that it will perform in any
any<00:01:31.830> environment<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.659> usually<00:01:33.930> where

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
any environment so this is usually where

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.590 
any environment so this is usually where
it<00:01:34.110> starts<00:01:34.700> we<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.210> certain<00:01:36.570> foods

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it starts we have we have certain foods

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
it starts we have we have certain foods
that<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.439> standard<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:37.920> for

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
that are kind of a standard you know for

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.640 
that are kind of a standard you know for
testing<00:01:38.580> something<00:01:38.790> over<00:01:39.090> high<00:01:39.299> heat<00:01:39.500> will<00:01:40.500> do

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
testing something over high heat will do

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
testing something over high heat will do
