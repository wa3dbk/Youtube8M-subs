00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320
 you have a guy and you can not 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:12.760
 teach how to install free applications 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.200
 If you need a computer 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.220
 starting with carlos a safari 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:25.360
 and there are four very easy steps we enter 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.360
 to safari and we put with 659 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.470
 we were in to have some going to open a 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.090
 good page on this page 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.090
 and let's go down 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.850
 this install 4 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.940
 let's install 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:52.699
 and start installing 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.170
 there is another method that is that of the 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.210
 computer 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.340
 and good is with this program 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.920
 how can you see 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.630
 here are all the applications and if 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.650
 they have a specific one that is up the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.820
 bar to look for the other one too 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.820
 and there is also this 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.740
 to search and search 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.100
 for 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.800
 for a device nothing else here by 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:34.590
 example we can fixed functions 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.550
 and we practically get two daughters 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.750
 even though 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.850
 well, this is 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.570
 downloading 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.750
 finish 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.700
 what this said this other method 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.870
 that I'm going to leave the program in 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.800
 description if you want better this 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:00.060
 study is compatible with all 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.060
 iphone ipad ipod levels or whatever 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:09.610
 well this is downloaded by 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.610
 the systems installs automatically 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.980
 and see there's a downside to this from this 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.500
 computer program that is that every 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.300
 to synchronize is your ipad with itunes it 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.130
 erase the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.640
 the applications and position of 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.020
 transfer jr 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.020
 to your applications but now 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.500
 you do not need 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.640
 and good 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.630
 we are waiting 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.630
 so bless 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.370
 but as you can see 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.370
 it works 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:55.650
 we can not play 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.650
 and be able to play 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.150
 good 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.780
 share and well any doubt me what 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:13.730
 leave in the comments 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.730
 suggestion and the next
