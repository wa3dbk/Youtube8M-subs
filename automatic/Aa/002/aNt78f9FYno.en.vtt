00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.020
 things that you learn more vocabulary 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:27.710

 more things that you have more better 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.640
 if you say instrumentality is I what 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.610
 I want to learn this because it's not my 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.850
 style then is your mentality is well 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.379
 girl 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.379
 you have to learn everything 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.750
 but never in battles because it's not my 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.130
 style but I learned them because 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.790
 it makes me stronger 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.330
 I have more control of my body I have more 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.870
 of what I am the living in is an art 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.600
 this is not no, you do not have to look at it as 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.000
 athletes because if you look at him as an athlete 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.000
 then it means that you are removing 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.080
 the dance of what we are doing the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.229
 the most important thing for me is what it is 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.659
 for me without a live is dancing and for 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.020
 the flow 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.569
 to do something as if you're dancing and 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.560
 you are going to stop to make a cold then 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:46.869
 I have learned in my mind because he wants 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.630
 say that you are not practicing flow 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.750
 you mean you do not care about me 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.940
 the flow 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.970
 everything is clear to me 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.640
 yes you are dancing and you stop to go 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.520
 on the floor that means you are not 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.690
 practicing flow you do not care about 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.300
 destination 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.229
 style is the most important thing of 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.400
 live is more important than everything is your 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.830
 style 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.290
 if we can turn off the lights and someone 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.690
 more than you can look at your car can you 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.970
 say those furniture these die dancing 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.970
 that's who dances is not romÃ¡n dancing 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.540
 it means that you have style 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.720
 ok what I'm going to teach now are things 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.300
 originals are factory things but they are 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.700
 many things that many people do not use 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.430
 ok I always want to teach things that 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.980
 you can use that I do not want to come 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.769
 here 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.360
 to teach sixth and you must practice 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.730
 sixth 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.910
 I do not want to teach original things but 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.170
 teach things that I want you to 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.800
 use but I put more with you do your 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.210
 things 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.210
 then like me 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:07.700
 opening it thoroughly in tubes 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:11.030

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.569
 friends to is not night football to the author 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.420
 but blaming me tires me a lot 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:23.000
 I always act because they are 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:26.300
 transitions of the things that to me 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.430
 they like more those are everywhere there are 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.209
 that give space and 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.909
 and please learn the steps not the 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.730
 you can if you do not grab the movement 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:41.079
 perfect now it's fine just learn 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.079
 it is to practice it
