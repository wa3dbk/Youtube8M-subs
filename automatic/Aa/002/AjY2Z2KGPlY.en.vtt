00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.610
 no 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.540
 Hello 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.460
 even today we will test review a 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.110
 piece of the arcadia the shoe that 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.630
 let us examine nation today and lips 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.950
 terelle z2 in the appearance of the shoe 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.870
 dog really little compared to the model 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.770
 previous but we'll find out in 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.770
 field we begin 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.590
 let's start at parrella tomaia arias ha 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.780
 decided to reuse the skill already 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.760
 used in the parades of the 71 this 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.830
 synthetic and very fine material 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.570
 but the first thing we notice in the pre 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.790
 after are obviously the solutions in 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.740
 rubber and then we find the five zones 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.140
 lethal strategically distributed on 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.300
 the whole upper we find the paston 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.440
 precisely in the part of the passage e 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.870
 this is the area that has been modified 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.460
 mostly because before we found the 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.320
 my walls phone was we find these 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.729
 strips that in my opinion guarantee a 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.140
 best clip is better sensitivity 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.000
 on the ball 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.410
 then we find the direction that as in the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.119
 previous model the area more 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.960
 efficient because it helps when we kick 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.150
 in rounds 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.310
 then we find the sweet spot that second 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.050
 me along with the boyzone don't make a 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.700
 great effect because I really am 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.619
 extreme in the shoe I don't think that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.960
 they can make a difference 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.240
 then we find the first touch that second 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.040
 me is very efficient because it helps 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.020
 when we know the word we receive from 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.000
 put on this shoe has been modified 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.250
 in fact now it is narrower giving a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.810
 more natural fit feel too 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.610
 in these shoes used mine 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.970
 alias number like all other shoes 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.970
 alias 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.910
 the sole and the space frame 2.0 the same 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.100
 l for other slow 1 with the classics 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.020
 indeed we find triangular takiti 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.610
 four in the back and these 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.290
 they do their job very well because 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.180
 it penetrates the ground but there is 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.090
 bad in the front instead 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.650
 we find 7 if in the lateral parts and one 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.120
 in the central part 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.800
 the three packages in the middle part 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.080
 of the shoe serve to give stability 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.090
 while those in the most front part 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.500
 of the shoe are higher and more consistent 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.250
 will lose more thrust in the process of 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.320
 acceleration 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.490
 I think this school is one of the 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.800
 better because it guarantees a good one 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.560
 compromise between good grip in the changes of 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.570
 direction and good maneuverability anyway 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.670
 in rotary movements 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.670
 so I think everything works 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.400
 talking about durability protection too 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.100
 this excellent shoe under every 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.209
 point of view in fact being a dias 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.340
 this shoe is practically 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.050
 indestructible while under the point of 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.850
 view was enhancing this is not sure 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.280
 good cushioning of pestons thanks 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.280
 to lethal areas so everything works 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.350
 ending this life can stop the 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.700
 shoe is absolutely recommended for 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.680
 any player looking for one 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.540
 shoe for control as you while 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.940
 look for the ad these shoes are 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.030
 complete from all points of view 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.530
 from lz a boot wanted leaving the 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.270
 natural leather to make room for 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.100
 skill this thus guaranteeing a remarkable 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.960
 lightening in order to adapt 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.760
 also offensive roles in which it is required 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.070
 a shoe lighter than the 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.930
 other roles st shoe I really like 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.970
 so much and I didn't find any negatives from 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.010
 say but what do you think 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.080
 you have already tried them or not because of me 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.520
 like them because no let me know how
