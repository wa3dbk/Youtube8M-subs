intermediate<00:00:26.430> tanks<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.029> didn't<00:00:27.240> bother<00:00:27.359> to

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
intermediate tanks I didn't bother to

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.140 
intermediate tanks I didn't bother to
top<00:00:27.779> them<00:00:27.930> off<00:00:28.020> so<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:29.070> takes<00:00:29.250> five<00:00:29.760> minutes<00:00:29.910> to

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
top them off so it takes five minutes to

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
I finished the trip the odometer rolled

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.830 
I finished the trip the odometer rolled
over<00:00:38.370> twice<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:39.030> didn't<00:00:39.239> reset<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.720> whole

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.660 
over twice I didn't reset it the whole
trip<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.320> that's<00:00:40.500> actually<00:00:40.800> two<00:00:41.100> thousand

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
trip so that's actually two thousand

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.670 
trip so that's actually two thousand
seven<00:00:42.030> hundred<00:00:42.120> eighty<00:00:42.750> nine<00:00:42.900> point<00:00:43.410> nine

seven hundred eighty nine point nine

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.310 
seven hundred eighty nine point nine
miles<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.309> rounded<00:00:45.269> that<00:00:45.330> up<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.720> two<00:00:45.870> thousand

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
miles I rounded that up to two thousand

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
miles I rounded that up to two thousand
seven<00:00:46.350> hundred<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:48.710> ninety<00:00:49.710> miles<00:00:50.690> you<00:00:51.690> can

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
seven hundred and ninety miles you can

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.810 
seven hundred and ninety miles you can
see<00:00:51.960> my<00:00:52.140> odometer<00:00:52.379> rolled<00:00:53.339> over<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.580> hundred

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
see my odometer rolled over a hundred

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.130 
see my odometer rolled over a hundred
thousand<00:00:54.180> miles<00:00:54.330> while<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> was<00:00:54.720> on<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> trip

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
thousand miles while I was on the trip

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.000 
thousand miles while I was on the trip
so<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:58.699> gauge<00:00:59.699> also<00:01:00.479> I<00:01:00.960> did<00:01:01.229> not<00:01:01.260> reset<00:01:01.799> it<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
so the gauge also I did not reset it the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.100 
so the gauge also I did not reset it the
whole<00:01:02.129> trip<00:01:02.400> I<00:01:02.549> reset<00:01:03.150> at<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.330> beginning<00:01:03.839> it's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110

at<00:01:04.680> sixteen<00:01:05.159> point<00:01:05.430> nine<00:01:05.489> I'd<00:01:05.940> be<00:01:06.119> pretty

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330

was<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> slowest<00:02:08.879> truck<00:02:09.060> on<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.269> road<00:02:09.390> most

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
was the slowest truck on the road most

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:16.610 
was the slowest truck on the road most
of<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> time<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:15.000> anyway<00:02:15.440> that's<00:02:16.440> pretty

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
of the time so but anyway that's pretty

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.070 
of the time so but anyway that's pretty
good<00:02:16.890> 18.6<00:02:17.670> too<00:02:18.799> we<00:02:19.799> spent<00:02:20.330> at<00:02:21.330> least<00:02:21.690> two

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
good 18.6 too we spent at least two

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.619 
good 18.6 too we spent at least two
hours<00:02:22.110> in<00:02:22.860> traffic<00:02:23.280> tie-ups<00:02:23.970> when<00:02:24.390> we<00:02:24.450> got

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
hours in traffic tie-ups when we got

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.660 
hours in traffic tie-ups when we got
close<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.840> New<00:02:25.080> York<00:02:25.110> City<00:02:25.290> twice<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.250> traffic

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
close to New York City twice the traffic

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.449 
close to New York City twice the traffic
came<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.940> stop<00:02:27.239> and<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.659> creeped<00:02:27.930> along

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
came to a stop and we just creeped along

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.000 
came to a stop and we just creeped along
basically<00:02:29.459> at<00:02:29.819> idle<00:02:30.290> going<00:02:31.290> from<00:02:31.470> zero<00:02:31.799> miles

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
basically at idle going from zero miles

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.800 
basically at idle going from zero miles
an<00:02:32.159> hour<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.549> two<00:02:32.909> somewhere<00:02:33.360> running<00:02:33.480> there

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
an hour to two somewhere running there

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.009 
an hour to two somewhere running there
and<00:02:34.019> then<00:02:34.739> once<00:02:34.950> again<00:02:35.069> in<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:36.329> North<00:02:36.629> Carolina

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
and then once again in in North Carolina

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.959 
and then once again in in North Carolina
there<00:02:37.200> was<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> traffic<00:02:37.560> accident<00:02:38.159> and<00:02:38.279> traffic

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
there was a traffic accident and traffic

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.509 
there was a traffic accident and traffic
backed<00:02:39.180> way<00:02:39.359> up<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.469> two<00:02:40.529> hours<00:02:41.099> sitting<00:02:41.370> at

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
backed way up so two hours sitting at

backed way up so two hours sitting at
idle<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:41.999> drove<00:02:42.359> about<00:02:42.450> 300<00:02:42.989> miles<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.469> mountain

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829

miles in Boston city traffic I could

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.089 
miles in Boston city traffic I could
just<00:02:51.150> feel<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.409> diesel<00:02:52.409> fuel<00:02:52.590> being<00:02:52.769> sucked

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
just feel the diesel fuel being sucked

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.580 
just feel the diesel fuel being sucked
out<00:02:53.219> of<00:02:53.279> the<00:02:53.400> tank<00:02:53.639> in<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:53.939> city<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:55.319> rest<00:02:55.499> of

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
the time was on the freeway I had the

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.039 
the time was on the freeway I had the
air<00:02:58.200> conditioning<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.769> about<00:02:58.980> half<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.310> time

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
air conditioning on about half the time

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.940 
air conditioning on about half the time
this<00:03:01.049> is<00:03:01.139> going<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.319> be<00:03:01.379> sort<00:03:01.529> of<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.620> boring

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
this is going to be sort of a boring

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.670 
this is going to be sort of a boring
video<00:03:02.510> but<00:03:03.510> anyway<00:03:03.569> it's<00:03:03.900> um<00:03:04.139> I'm<00:03:04.499> pretty

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
video but anyway it's um I'm pretty

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.940 
video but anyway it's um I'm pretty
happy<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.099> I<00:03:05.430> had<00:03:05.579> to<00:03:05.669> push<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.150> my<00:03:07.079> brick<00:03:07.409> to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
happy that I had to push the my brick to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.399 
happy that I had to push the my brick to
60<00:03:08.430> amps<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:08.999> think<00:03:09.329> I'll<00:03:09.419> do<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.689> video<00:03:10.109> the

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
60 amps I think I'll do that video the

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.519 
60 amps I think I'll do that video the
brick<00:03:11.749> alright<00:03:12.749> well<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:12.959> is<00:03:13.109> my<00:03:13.230> setup

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:13.529 
brick alright well this is my setup

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:16.640 
brick alright well this is my setup
again<00:03:13.889> I've<00:03:14.099> done<00:03:14.310> videos<00:03:14.669> of<00:03:14.879> this<00:03:15.499> in<00:03:16.499> an

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
again I've done videos of this in an

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.860 
again I've done videos of this in an
effort<00:03:16.859> to<00:03:16.950> get<00:03:17.069> more<00:03:17.909> fuel<00:03:18.180> mileage<00:03:18.450> I've

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
effort to get more fuel mileage I've

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.259 
effort to get more fuel mileage I've
been<00:03:19.019> pushing<00:03:19.230> this<00:03:19.529> set<00:03:20.279> up<00:03:20.430> as<00:03:20.609> bricks

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
been pushing this set up as bricks

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.019 
been pushing this set up as bricks
it's<00:03:21.810> my<00:03:21.930> original<00:03:22.319> brick<00:03:22.620> pushing<00:03:23.189> it<00:03:23.279> to<00:03:23.459> 60

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:24.029 
it's my original brick pushing it to 60

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.019 
it's my original brick pushing it to 60
amps<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:24.889> tried<00:03:25.889> going<00:03:26.099> as<00:03:26.249> high<00:03:26.340> as<00:03:26.489> 70<00:03:26.909> but

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:27.029 
amps I tried going as high as 70 but

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:29.629 
amps I tried going as high as 70 but
when<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.269> happens<00:03:27.689> I<00:03:27.840> go<00:03:28.079> up<00:03:28.139> to<00:03:28.169> 70<00:03:28.650> these

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
when that happens I go up to 70 these

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.670 
when that happens I go up to 70 these
connections<00:03:30.180> degrade<00:03:30.599> too<00:03:30.870> rapidly<00:03:31.260> even<00:03:31.499> at

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
connections degrade too rapidly even at

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.339 
connections degrade too rapidly even at
60<00:03:32.099> amps<00:03:33.090> they<00:03:33.180> degrade<00:03:33.569> it<00:03:33.809> should<00:03:34.139> have<00:03:34.230> been

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
60 amps they degrade it should have been

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.229 
60 amps they degrade it should have been
soldered<00:03:34.559> on<00:03:34.859> or<00:03:35.189> bolted<00:03:35.760> or<00:03:35.849> something<00:03:36.120> but

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
soldered on or bolted or something but

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.409 
soldered on or bolted or something but
this<00:03:36.359> is<00:03:36.510> what<00:03:36.659> I<00:03:36.689> have<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.019> work<00:03:37.169> with<00:03:37.730> as<00:03:38.730> you

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
this is what I have to work with as you

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.809 
this is what I have to work with as you
can<00:03:39.540> see<00:03:39.689> I've<00:03:39.809> got<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.799> white<00:03:41.189> wires<00:03:41.459> are

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
can see I've got the white wires are

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.940 
can see I've got the white wires are
positive<00:03:42.359> so<00:03:42.450> at<00:03:42.540> four<00:03:42.749> positive<00:03:43.290> wires<00:03:43.680> and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
positive so at four positive wires and

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.190 
positive so at four positive wires and
three<00:03:44.249> negatives<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.450> negative<00:03:45.840> plates

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
three negatives so the negative plates

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.190 
three negatives so the negative plates
are<00:03:46.349> being<00:03:46.529> shared<00:03:46.799> by<00:03:47.010> two<00:03:47.069> positives

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
are being shared by two positives

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.379 
are being shared by two positives
consequently<00:03:49.200> these<00:03:50.129> wires<00:03:50.579> right<00:03:50.879> here<00:03:51.150> get

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
consequently these wires right here get

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.500 
consequently these wires right here get
hot<00:03:51.599> fast<00:03:51.930> or<00:03:52.529> the<00:03:52.680> connection<00:03:53.099> degrades<00:03:53.510> and

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
hot fast or the connection degrades and

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.549 
hot fast or the connection degrades and
once<00:03:54.689> the<00:03:54.809> connection<00:03:55.169> starts<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:55.439> degrade

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:55.559 
once the connection starts to degrade

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:58.069 
once the connection starts to degrade
they<00:03:56.159> get<00:03:56.309> hotter<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:56.849> it<00:03:57.120> goes<00:03:57.269> rapidly<00:03:57.930> down

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
they get hotter and it goes rapidly down

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.709 
they get hotter and it goes rapidly down
so<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.319> designed<00:03:58.499> this<00:03:58.889> brick<00:03:59.159> to<00:04:00.059> run<00:04:00.239> at<00:04:00.389> 40

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:00.719 
so I designed this brick to run at 40

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:01.909 
so I designed this brick to run at 40
amps<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.049> figured<00:04:01.290> these<00:04:01.409> wires<00:04:01.650> will<00:04:01.769> be

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
amps I figured these wires will be

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.769 
amps I figured these wires will be
adequate<00:04:02.309> but<00:04:02.579> at<00:04:02.699> 60<00:04:02.999> amps<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.359> do<00:04:03.419> have<00:04:03.659> the

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:03.779 
adequate but at 60 amps I do have the

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.679 
adequate but at 60 amps I do have the
problem<00:04:04.139> with<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.349> wires<00:04:04.559> getting<00:04:04.829> hot<00:04:05.010> now

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:05.689 
problem with the wires getting hot now

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.179 
problem with the wires getting hot now
to<00:04:06.689> get<00:04:06.809> this<00:04:06.930> thing<00:04:07.139> to<00:04:07.230> pull<00:04:07.379> 60<00:04:07.739> amps<00:04:08.069> on<00:04:08.159> a

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
to get this thing to pull 60 amps on a

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.830 
to get this thing to pull 60 amps on a
regular<00:04:08.549> basis<00:04:08.909> is<00:04:09.059> pretty<00:04:09.299> tricky<00:04:09.659> because

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
regular basis is pretty tricky because

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.459 
regular basis is pretty tricky because
on<00:04:10.620> short<00:04:10.980> trips<00:04:11.249> it<00:04:11.609> doesn't<00:04:11.909> warm<00:04:12.090> up<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:13.169> I

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:13.469 
on short trips it doesn't warm up so I

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.580 
on short trips it doesn't warm up so I
have<00:04:13.650> this<00:04:13.769> really<00:04:14.599> concentrated<00:04:15.599> sodium

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
have this really concentrated sodium

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.509 
have this really concentrated sodium
hydroxide<00:04:17.340> mixture<00:04:17.730> in<00:04:17.880> here

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
hydroxide mixture in here

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.539 
hydroxide mixture in here
and<00:04:18.780> typically<00:04:19.889> when<00:04:20.889> I'm<00:04:20.979> just<00:04:21.190> doing<00:04:21.459> my

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
and typically when I'm just doing my

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.129 
and typically when I'm just doing my
normal<00:04:21.579> driving<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.270> keep<00:04:22.449> the<00:04:22.630> reservoir

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
normal driving I keep the reservoir

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.249 
normal driving I keep the reservoir
filled<00:04:23.350> about<00:04:23.560> here<00:04:25.319> so<00:04:26.319> I<00:04:27.630> usually<00:04:28.630> drive<00:04:28.780> 15

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
filled about here so I usually drive 15

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.980 
filled about here so I usually drive 15
minutes<00:04:29.349> to<00:04:29.590> an<00:04:29.680> hour<00:04:29.770> never<00:04:30.160> more<00:04:30.400> than<00:04:30.520> that

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
minutes to an hour never more than that

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.870 
minutes to an hour never more than that
lots<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.110> stops<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.770> gets<00:04:32.919> a<00:04:33.009> fat<00:04:33.550> brick<00:04:33.849> a

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
lots of stops so it gets a fat brick a

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.309 
lots of stops so it gets a fat brick a
chance<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.300> cool<00:04:34.449> down<00:04:34.509> so<00:04:34.930> when<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.080> go<00:04:35.199> on<00:04:35.259> a

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:35.319 
chance to cool down so when I go on a

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:38.460 
chance to cool down so when I go on a
long<00:04:35.500> trip<00:04:36.270> I've<00:04:37.270> got<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.599> fill<00:04:37.810> it<00:04:37.840> way<00:04:38.110> up<00:04:38.139> I

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
long trip I've got to fill it way up I

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.080 
long trip I've got to fill it way up I
put<00:04:38.830> it<00:04:38.919> fill<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.250> reservoir<00:04:39.669> up<00:04:39.759> to<00:04:39.880> here

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
put it fill the reservoir up to here

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.700 
put it fill the reservoir up to here
that<00:04:40.240> gives<00:04:40.389> more<00:04:40.569> water<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:41.110> the<00:04:41.199> system<00:04:41.410> it's

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
that gives more water in the system it's

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.490 
that gives more water in the system it's
the<00:04:41.770> same<00:04:41.979> amount<00:04:42.460> of<00:04:42.610> sodium<00:04:42.789> hydroxide<00:04:43.500> just

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
the same amount of sodium hydroxide just

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.740 
the same amount of sodium hydroxide just
more<00:04:44.650> water<00:04:44.919> and<00:04:45.190> that<00:04:45.970> allows<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.449> to<00:04:46.479> cool

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
more water and that allows it to cool

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.020 
more water and that allows it to cool
more<00:04:47.009> and<00:04:48.009> that<00:04:48.130> works<00:04:48.370> pretty<00:04:48.550> well<00:04:48.669> I<00:04:48.789> can

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
more and that works pretty well I can

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.969 
more and that works pretty well I can
keep<00:04:49.210> the<00:04:49.389> amperage<00:04:50.169> up<00:04:50.380> there<00:04:50.530> pretty<00:04:50.680> good

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
keep the amperage up there pretty good

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.070 
keep the amperage up there pretty good
but<00:04:51.190> if<00:04:51.789> the<00:04:52.030> air<00:04:52.150> temperature<00:04:52.180> gets<00:04:52.870> cool

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
but if the air temperature gets cool

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.290 
but if the air temperature gets cool
like<00:04:53.410> when<00:04:53.470> I<00:04:53.560> Drive<00:04:53.770> at<00:04:53.889> night<00:04:54.070> but<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.090> amp

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
like when I Drive at night but the amp

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.920 
like when I Drive at night but the amp
draw<00:04:55.419> goes<00:04:55.720> down<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:57.180> when<00:04:58.180> it<00:04:58.270> rains<00:04:58.539> and

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
draw goes down and when it rains and

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.240 
draw goes down and when it rains and
like<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.229> this<00:04:59.349> trip<00:04:59.530> we<00:04:59.650> had<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.770> lot<00:05:00.009> of<00:05:00.160> heavy

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
like in this trip we had a lot of heavy

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.460 
like in this trip we had a lot of heavy
rain<00:05:00.520> that<00:05:00.550> we<00:05:00.759> drove<00:05:00.940> through<00:05:01.000> and<00:05:01.449> of<00:05:02.320> course

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
rain that we drove through and of course

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.900 
rain that we drove through and of course
the<00:05:02.590> air<00:05:02.710> is<00:05:02.830> cooler<00:05:03.160> during<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.520> rain<00:05:03.699> and

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
the air is cooler during the rain and

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.960 
the air is cooler during the rain and
Plus<00:05:04.120> or<00:05:04.270> this<00:05:04.599> is<00:05:04.720> open<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.620> sky<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.759> this

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
Plus or this is open to the sky and this

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.210 
Plus or this is open to the sky and this
gets<00:05:07.180> wet<00:05:07.419> and<00:05:07.449> the<00:05:07.930> water<00:05:08.380> cools<00:05:08.680> it<00:05:08.860> off<00:05:08.979> the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
gets wet and the water cools it off the

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.920 
gets wet and the water cools it off the
cold<00:05:09.460> rain<00:05:09.669> water<00:05:09.970> especially<00:05:10.240> when<00:05:10.630> I<00:05:10.659> was<00:05:10.810> up

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
cold rain water especially when I was up

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.480 
cold rain water especially when I was up
there<00:05:11.050> in<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.289> Northeast<00:05:11.740> up<00:05:11.979> in<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.310> main

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
there in the Northeast up in the main

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.600 
there in the Northeast up in the main
area<00:05:12.699> the<00:05:12.909> rainwater<00:05:13.090> was<00:05:13.479> really<00:05:13.780> cold<00:05:13.960> and

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
area the rainwater was really cold and

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.010 
area the rainwater was really cold and
this<00:05:15.610> thing<00:05:15.759> would<00:05:15.940> drop<00:05:16.300> down<00:05:16.479> to<00:05:16.599> about<00:05:16.690> 40

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
this thing would drop down to about 40

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.559 
this thing would drop down to about 40
amps<00:05:17.259> during<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.560> rain<00:05:18.330> so<00:05:19.330> the<00:05:19.360> other

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569 
amps during the rain so the other

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.689 
amps during the rain so the other
problem<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:19.930> have<00:05:20.080> is<00:05:20.259> on<00:05:20.409> my<00:05:20.590> I<00:05:20.889> realized<00:05:21.550> that

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:21.699 
problem I have is on my I realized that

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:23.040 
problem I have is on my I realized that
I<00:05:21.759> prayed<00:05:22.000> I'm<00:05:22.180> not<00:05:22.330> going<00:05:22.509> to<00:05:22.599> take<00:05:22.720> the<00:05:22.840> cover

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
I prayed I'm not going to take the cover

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.810 
I prayed I'm not going to take the cover
off<00:05:23.169> I<00:05:23.500> film<00:05:23.770> that<00:05:23.949> many<00:05:24.159> times<00:05:24.370> before

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
off I film that many times before

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.029 
off I film that many times before
there's<00:05:25.479> four<00:05:25.690> relays<00:05:26.050> for<00:05:26.349> circuit<00:05:26.710> breakers

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
there's four relays for circuit breakers

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.790 
there's four relays for circuit breakers
in<00:05:27.190> here<00:05:27.400> when<00:05:28.360> I'm<00:05:28.449> pulling<00:05:28.630> 60<00:05:29.080> amps<00:05:29.560> are<00:05:29.680> up

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
in here when I'm pulling 60 amps are up

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.490 
in here when I'm pulling 60 amps are up
but<00:05:30.130> like<00:05:30.340> 65<00:05:30.880> amps<00:05:31.330> one<00:05:31.690> of<00:05:31.840> these<00:05:31.990> circuit

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
but like 65 amps one of these circuit

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.110 
but like 65 amps one of these circuit
breakers<00:05:32.590> along<00:05:33.009> the<00:05:33.130> bottom<00:05:33.310> tends<00:05:34.000> to

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
breakers along the bottom tends to

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.209 
breakers along the bottom tends to
overheat<00:05:34.509> and<00:05:34.630> trip<00:05:34.870> so<00:05:35.500> my<00:05:35.620> amps<00:05:35.889> will<00:05:36.009> drop

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
overheat and trip so my amps will drop

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:37.439 
overheat and trip so my amps will drop
and<00:05:36.400> they'll<00:05:36.520> go<00:05:36.639> back<00:05:36.789> up<00:05:36.969> and<00:05:37.120> they'll<00:05:37.240> drop

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
and they'll go back up and they'll drop

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.629 
and they'll go back up and they'll drop
and<00:05:37.630> that<00:05:37.719> can't<00:05:37.900> be<00:05:37.960> good<00:05:38.020> for<00:05:38.199> anything<00:05:38.639> so

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
and that can't be good for anything so

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.040 
and that can't be good for anything so
to<00:05:39.699> prevent<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.330> from<00:05:40.479> happening<00:05:40.659> I

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
to prevent that from happening I

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.100 
to prevent that from happening I
loosened<00:05:41.770> this<00:05:41.860> cover<00:05:42.190> I<00:05:42.570> used<00:05:43.570> to<00:05:43.690> drive<00:05:43.900> with

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
loosened this cover I used to drive with

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.360 
loosened this cover I used to drive with
the<00:05:44.199> cover<00:05:44.380> completely<00:05:44.830> off<00:05:44.979> but<00:05:45.190> this<00:05:45.310> is

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
the cover completely off but this is

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.790 
the cover completely off but this is
dead<00:05:45.639> leaves<00:05:45.909> this<00:05:46.030> exposed<00:05:46.479> to<00:05:46.599> the<00:05:46.690> rain<00:05:46.870> so

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
dead leaves this exposed to the rain so

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.350 
dead leaves this exposed to the rain so
I<00:05:47.830> loosened<00:05:48.219> the<00:05:48.250> cover<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:48.849> that<00:05:49.180> lets

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
I loosened the cover and that lets

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.640 
I loosened the cover and that lets
enough<00:05:49.570> air<00:05:49.750> to<00:05:49.840> go<00:05:49.930> up<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.169> then<00:05:50.259> I<00:05:50.289> keep<00:05:50.469> that

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
enough air to go up and then I keep that

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.170 
enough air to go up and then I keep that
circuit<00:05:51.070> breaker<00:05:51.190> from<00:05:51.460> tripping<00:05:51.909> when<00:05:52.030> I'm

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
circuit breaker from tripping when I'm

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.180 
circuit breaker from tripping when I'm
pulling<00:05:52.509> 60<00:05:52.990> amps<00:05:54.659> so<00:05:55.659> I'm<00:05:56.409> really<00:05:56.650> anxious<00:05:56.889> to

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
pulling 60 amps so I'm really anxious to

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.149 
pulling 60 amps so I'm really anxious to
get<00:05:57.310> a<00:05:57.370> new<00:05:57.639> brick<00:05:58.060> with<00:05:58.690> a<00:05:58.719> more<00:05:59.320> advanced

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
get a new brick with a more advanced

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.370 
get a new brick with a more advanced
design<00:06:00.460> this<00:06:01.180> is<00:06:01.360> pretty<00:06:01.570> primitive<00:06:01.840> it's<00:06:02.229> not

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
design this is pretty primitive it's not

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.430 
design this is pretty primitive it's not
too<00:06:02.560> mmw<00:06:03.159> is<00:06:03.219> not<00:06:03.340> that<00:06:03.490> great<00:06:03.990> I<00:06:04.990> need

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
too mmw is not that great I need

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.100 
too mmw is not that great I need
something<00:06:05.800> that'll<00:06:06.310> put<00:06:07.210> a<00:06:07.240> lot<00:06:07.539> more<00:06:07.570> amps

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
something that'll put a lot more amps

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.749 
something that'll put a lot more amps
and<00:06:08.320> I<00:06:08.530> need<00:06:08.680> another<00:06:08.770> way<00:06:09.070> to<00:06:09.130> power<00:06:09.490> it

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:09.759 
and I need another way to power it

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:12.779 
and I need another way to power it
obviously<00:06:10.150> but<00:06:10.919> this<00:06:11.919> is<00:06:12.099> pretty<00:06:12.280> good<00:06:12.490> I<00:06:12.550> get

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
obviously but this is pretty good I get

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.510 
obviously but this is pretty good I get
18<00:06:13.240> point<00:06:13.479> 6<00:06:13.750> 2<00:06:13.960> miles<00:06:14.590> per<00:06:14.800> gallon<00:06:15.130> I've<00:06:15.310> never

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
18 point 6 2 miles per gallon I've never

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:25.940 
18 point 6 2 miles per gallon I've never
