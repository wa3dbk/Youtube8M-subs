feet<00:00:59.420> 2<00:01:00.410> inches<00:01:00.440> tall<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.190> I'll<00:01:01.640> do<00:01:01.910> 6<00:01:02.870> times<00:01:03.290> 12

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
feet 2 inches tall so I'll do 6 times 12

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.239 
feet 2 inches tall so I'll do 6 times 12
because<00:01:05.059> there's<00:01:05.269> 12<00:01:05.389> inches<00:01:05.840> in<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.079> foot<00:01:06.380> is

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:07.249 
because there's 12 inches in the foot is

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:13.179 
because there's 12 inches in the foot is
72<00:01:08.060> plus<00:01:09.020> 2<00:01:10.689> is<00:01:11.689> 74<00:01:12.499> inches<00:01:12.709> so<00:01:13.069> I'm

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
72 plus 2 is 74 inches so I'm

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.969 
72 plus 2 is 74 inches so I'm
approximately<00:01:14.030> 74<00:01:14.869> inches<00:01:15.350> tall

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979

approximately 74 inches tall
so<00:01:16.670> as<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.880> rule<00:01:17.119> of<00:01:17.179> thumb<00:01:17.359> for<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.869> paddleboard

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
so as a rule of thumb for a paddleboard

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.190 
so as a rule of thumb for a paddleboard
paddle<00:01:19.270> someone<00:01:20.270> wants<00:01:20.569> a<00:01:20.630> paddleboard

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
paddle someone wants a paddleboard

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.010 
paddle someone wants a paddleboard
paddle<00:01:21.679> that's<00:01:22.369> approximately<00:01:22.759> 8<00:01:23.450> inches

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
paddle that's approximately 8 inches

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.699 
paddle that's approximately 8 inches
taller<00:01:24.350> than<00:01:24.499> they<00:01:24.799> are<00:01:25.389> so<00:01:26.389> 74<00:01:27.170> +<00:01:27.409> 8<00:01:27.829> is<00:01:28.659> 82<00:01:29.709> so

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709 
taller than they are so 74 + 8 is 82 so

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.099 
taller than they are so 74 + 8 is 82 so
my<00:01:30.920> ideal<00:01:31.719> paddle<00:01:32.719> board<00:01:33.340> paddling<00:01:34.340> is

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
my ideal paddle board paddling is

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.779 
my ideal paddle board paddling is
approximately<00:01:36.109> 82<00:01:36.439> inches<00:01:37.039> now<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:37.249> can<00:01:37.579> go<00:01:37.759> a

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789
