 that are the crabs that right now 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.650
 there are in the streams and rivers of the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.570
 province be the season also of 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.520
 of crabs and we take the opportunity to do 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.020
 this recipe that is a very recipe 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.450
 old you will see that there is another recipe for 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.860
 crayfish that are made as a 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.780
 kind of American sauce in which 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.940
 then the crabs are cooked but 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.500
 we are going to make this recipe that 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.739
 is what we do in the inn and that 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.960
 another part is a very elaborate 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.199
 old consists of a short broth that 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.070
 take these onion ingredients the 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.970
 we have here in julienne salt oil water 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.140
 a tip of chilli laurel 2 teeth 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.520
 of garlic for this amount are 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.920
 enough cloves and pepper and pepper 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.990
 black the first thing we have done has been 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.590
 catch the crabs wash them well under 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.690
 of the water jet and make sure that 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.409
 they are all alive you have to be careful 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.469
 that none fall 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.689
 that is dead because that can make us 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.979
 cause problems the process as I say it is 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.579
 very simple first thing we're going to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.959
 do is going to be the short broth 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:43.890
 for this in this casserole we are going to pour 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:46.280
 the water in it we are going to incorporate a 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.280
 good jet 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.330
 of olive oil 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.330
 let's also put the salt 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.100
 and no more we'll also incorporate and 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.940
 all the solid elements 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.240
 to the recipe 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.070
 what is julienne onion 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.720
 the tip of 100 days if you want more 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.450
 spicy because you put more you want it 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.130
 less less laurel garlic cloves 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.640
 I think we've done it has been going with 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.270
 shell and everything open to half do not know 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.270
 but you can see 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.209
 and the spices we're going to let all 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:31.790
 this mixture lift and now lift 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.790
 we will incorporate the two crabs 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.420
 we have had cooking the broth 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.490
 short for about 5 minutes 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.090
 approximately so that they come together 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.010
 all the flavors of spices and all 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.230
 Garrison also plant 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.200
 we go softening and arrived at this 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.700
 point let's incorporate now 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.270
 the crabs 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.800
 well now we just plug in here and go 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.569
 to leave for about five 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.319
 minutes that is the right time for that 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.209
 have already 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.980
 in fact the crabs 15 or 67 minutes 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.959
 Well five minutes have passed and I already 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.650
 we have perfectly known you see that 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.870
 they have turned a red 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.170
 very intense or symptomatic since the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.060
 we have perfect cooking 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.620
 So, without more, we're going to turn off the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.069
 fire let's place here and you 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.659
 we show the final result to the camera 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.440
 and these would be our crayfish 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:33.220
 in short broth 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.220
