to win three out of three games and of

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.820 
to win three out of three games and of
course<00:02:29.769> it's<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.220> massive<00:02:30.579> confidence<00:02:31.060> boost

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
course it's a massive confidence boost

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.800

I<00:02:31.860> don't<00:02:32.640> know<00:02:32.790> if<00:02:32.940> we're<00:02:33.120> mathematically

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
qualified in the next stage but I think

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:50.240 
qualified in the next stage but I think
we're<00:02:36.360> with<00:02:36.720> that

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.430 

next<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:51.400> were<00:02:51.550> Argentina<00:02:52.240> who<00:02:52.810> were<00:02:52.960> still<00:02:53.320> on

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
next on were Argentina who were still on
