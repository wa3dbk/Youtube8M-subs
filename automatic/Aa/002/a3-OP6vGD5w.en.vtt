just cast doubt to her character and
it's<00:05:33.870> just<00:05:34.050> in<00:05:34.169> my<00:05:34.200> opinion<00:05:34.650> which<00:05:34.919> I

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
it's just in my opinion which I

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.119 
it's just in my opinion which I
it<00:05:35.949> was<00:05:36.639> set<00:05:36.909> it<00:05:37.090> up<00:05:37.240> the<00:05:38.020> will<00:05:38.439> set<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.770> future

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:39.129 
it was set it up the will set the future

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.020 
it was set it up the will set the future
up<00:05:39.280> on<00:05:39.729> two<00:05:40.689> ways<00:05:40.900> you<00:05:41.740> know<00:05:41.889> like<00:05:42.069> one<00:05:42.430> it<00:05:42.759> was

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
up on two ways you know like one it was

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.110 
up on two ways you know like one it was
just<00:05:43.300> kind<00:05:43.569> of<00:05:45.029> its<00:05:46.029> supposed<00:05:46.539> to<00:05:46.719> have<00:05:46.930> a

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
just kind of its supposed to have a

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.700 
just kind of its supposed to have a
feeling<00:05:49.120> of<00:05:49.210> sadness<00:05:49.569> towards<00:05:50.409> both

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
feeling of sadness towards both

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.089 
feeling of sadness towards both
characters<00:05:51.159> both<00:05:51.659> Kakashi<00:05:52.659> and<00:05:52.689> over<00:05:53.289> to<00:05:53.469> but

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
characters both Kakashi and over to but

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:55.860 
characters both Kakashi and over to but
I<00:05:54.129> think<00:05:54.189> more<00:05:54.669> than<00:05:54.699> anything<00:05:55.150> people<00:05:55.629> will

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
I think more than anything people will

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.769 
I think more than anything people will
feel<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.469> sadness<00:05:57.069> for<00:05:57.520> kakashi<00:05:57.909> not

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
feel the sadness for kakashi not

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.019 
feel the sadness for kakashi not
necessarily<00:05:59.379> oversold<00:05:59.919> and<00:06:00.129> at<00:06:00.789> the<00:06:00.879> same

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:01.029 
necessarily oversold and at the same

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.709 
necessarily oversold and at the same
time<00:06:01.090> it<00:06:01.509> shows<00:06:01.749> that<00:06:02.139> over<00:06:02.770> told<00:06:03.719> clearly

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:04.719 
time it shows that over told clearly

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:08.820 
time it shows that over told clearly
chose<00:06:05.370> clearly<00:06:06.370> chose<00:06:06.689> the<00:06:07.689> wrong<00:06:07.960> path<00:06:08.439> in

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
chose clearly chose the wrong path in

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.240 
chose clearly chose the wrong path in
