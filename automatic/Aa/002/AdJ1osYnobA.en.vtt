I've seen things have little holes where

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.870 
I've seen things have little holes where
the<00:03:16.500> juice<00:03:16.739> would<00:03:16.889> come<00:03:17.069> up<00:03:17.220> why<00:03:17.549> would<00:03:17.579> you

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
the juice would come up why would you

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.129 
the juice would come up why would you
put<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.150> end<00:03:18.329> that<00:03:18.510> doesn't<00:03:18.780> have<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.989> use

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
put the end that doesn't have to use

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.840 
put the end that doesn't have to use
because<00:03:19.380> people<00:03:19.829> don't<00:03:19.920> always<00:03:20.040> look<00:03:20.280> at<00:03:20.459> how

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
because people don't always look at how

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.949 
because people don't always look at how
the<00:03:21.329> device<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.769> be<00:03:22.889> used<00:03:23.099> they<00:03:23.549> just<00:03:23.959> it's

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
the device is to be used they just it's

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.110 
the device is to be used they just it's
so<00:03:25.260> crazy<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:26.160> like<00:03:26.340> different<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.030> they're

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
so crazy and like different that they're

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.300 
so crazy and like different that they're
like<00:03:27.299> wow<00:03:27.450> how<00:03:28.170> do<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.380> do<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.620> because<00:03:29.130> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
like wow how do I do that because it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.559 
like wow how do I do that because it
makes<00:03:29.430> sense<00:03:29.639> that<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.880> squeeze<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.389> line

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
makes sense that you squeeze the line

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.599 
makes sense that you squeeze the line
this<00:03:30.750> way<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.230> end<00:03:31.440> though<00:03:31.650> because<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.459> would

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
this way and end though because it would

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.170 
this way and end though because it would
fall<00:03:32.849> into<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.650> it's<00:03:34.669> no<00:03:35.669> it<00:03:35.849> doesn't<00:03:36.120> make

fall into the it's no it doesn't make

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.759 
fall into the it's no it doesn't make
any<00:03:36.359> sense<00:03:36.569> at<00:03:36.750> all<00:03:36.870> Oh<00:03:38.959> trying<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.139> try<00:03:40.709> to
