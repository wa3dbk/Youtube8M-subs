electrocute pigments from sugarpill the
first<00:01:55.470> one<00:01:55.680> we're<00:01:55.860> using<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.520> supercharged

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
first one we're using is supercharged

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.280 
first one we're using is supercharged
which<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:57.990> amazing<00:01:58.670> orange<00:01:59.670> neon<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.810> love

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
which is this amazing orange neon I love

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.560 
which is this amazing orange neon I love
this<00:02:01.530> shade<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.579> probably<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> most

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
this shade but it is probably the most

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.749 
this shade but it is probably the most
difficult<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:04.200> work<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.560> my<00:02:04.829> opinion<00:02:04.920> so

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
difficult to work with in my opinion so

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.219 
difficult to work with in my opinion so
of<00:02:05.820> course<00:02:06.000> I'm<00:02:06.240> gonna<00:02:06.329> use<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.719> as<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.020> main

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
of course I'm gonna use it as the main

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.279 
of course I'm gonna use it as the main
lid<00:02:07.500> color

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
lid color

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.080 
lid color
so<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.009> way<00:02:09.129> that<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.369> apply<00:02:09.610> these<00:02:09.879> is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
so the way that you apply these is

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.479 
so the way that you apply these is
absolutely<00:02:10.269> crucial<00:02:11.170> it's<00:02:11.620> really<00:02:11.980> important

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
absolutely crucial it's really important

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.600 
absolutely crucial it's really important
to<00:02:12.670> get<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:12.879> stiff<00:02:13.269> brush<00:02:13.599> and<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.560> Pat<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.099> on<00:02:15.310> as

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
to get a stiff brush and to Pat it on as

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.970 
to get a stiff brush and to Pat it on as
I<00:02:15.849> am<00:02:15.879> doing<00:02:16.450> if<00:02:16.629> you<00:02:16.780> try<00:02:17.049> and<00:02:17.230> just<00:02:17.260> sweep

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
I am doing if you try and just sweep

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.339 
I am doing if you try and just sweep
these<00:02:18.220> on<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.549> lid<00:02:18.760> they<00:02:19.239> won't<00:02:19.540> really<00:02:19.840> stick

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
these on the lid they won't really stick

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.710 
these on the lid they won't really stick
so<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> get<00:02:21.129> the<00:02:21.280> most<00:02:21.579> color<00:02:21.970> payoff<00:02:22.269> and<00:02:22.390> the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
so to get the most color payoff and the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.170 
so to get the most color payoff and the
most<00:02:22.989> glitter<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.739> stick<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.370> eyes<00:02:24.549> it's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
most glitter to stick to the eyes it's

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.610 
most glitter to stick to the eyes it's
really<00:02:25.510> important<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.170> press<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:27.040> on

outside of love buzz just so that it

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.849 
outside of love buzz just so that it

and then I'm gonna take hella tronic and
use<00:03:50.079> it<00:03:50.230> wet<00:03:50.590> with<00:03:50.620> an<00:03:50.980> angle<00:03:51.310> brush<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:51.669> I<00:03:51.730> just

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
use it wet with an angle brush so I just

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.520 
use it wet with an angle brush so I just
applied<00:03:52.180> mixing<00:03:52.540> medium<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.079> brush<00:03:53.290> and

applied mixing medium to the brush and

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.710

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
then picked up the pigment so that it

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.110 
then picked up the pigment so that it
applies<00:03:56.109> more<00:03:56.980> pigmented

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
applies more pigmented

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
I know where the eye shadow should stop

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.119 
I know where the eye shadow should stop
and<00:04:04.599> this<00:04:05.109> is<00:04:05.260> where<00:04:05.409> it's<00:04:05.530> going<00:04:05.709> to<00:04:05.799> be<00:04:05.889> more
