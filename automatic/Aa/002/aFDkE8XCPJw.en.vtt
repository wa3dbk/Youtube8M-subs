00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
recommend one when people come to the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.360 
recommend one when people come to the
East<00:02:33.170> Coast<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.530> feel<00:02:33.710> like<00:02:33.830> they<00:02:33.920> come<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.250> New

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
East Coast I feel like they come to New

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.000 
East Coast I feel like they come to New
York<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.880> they<00:02:35.300> don't<00:02:35.480> come<00:02:35.690> to<00:02:35.840> Boston<00:02:36.020> so<00:02:36.530> it

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
York and they don't come to Boston so it

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.920 
York and they don't come to Boston so it
kind<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.340> gets<00:02:37.520> forgotten<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:38.450> actually<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:38.900> a

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
kind of gets forgotten it actually is a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.570 
kind of gets forgotten it actually is a
really<00:02:39.110> good<00:02:39.320> scene<00:02:39.530> there's<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.860> lot<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.310> spots

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
really good scene there's a lot of spots

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.820 
really good scene there's a lot of spots
it<00:02:41.390> has<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.630> lot<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.870> potential<00:02:42.260> I<00:02:42.470> think<00:02:42.500> it's

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
it has a lot of potential I think it's

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.380 
it has a lot of potential I think it's
just<00:02:42.890> gets<00:02:43.130> left<00:02:43.340> on

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
just gets left on

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.910 
just gets left on
not<00:02:44.720> much<00:02:44.900> about<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.350> but<00:02:45.470> there's<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.740> lot

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
not much about it but there's a lot

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.770 
not much about it but there's a lot
involved<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.700> I<00:02:46.760> think<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.360> just<00:02:47.390> need<00:02:47.690> to

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
involved and I think you just need to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.780 
involved and I think you just need to
give<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.080> chance<00:02:48.459> experience<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.640> good

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
give the chance experience the good

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.090 
give the chance experience the good
spacing<00:02:50.300> of<00:02:50.330> off

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.410 

all<00:02:54.100> right<00:02:54.220> we're<00:02:54.400> gonna<00:02:54.490> keep<00:02:54.730> movin<00:02:55.210> check

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420
