00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.699 
then next you want to have the second
one<00:02:50.439> highlighted<00:02:50.919> not<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.760> first<00:02:52.060> one<00:02:52.709> or

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
one highlighted not the first one or

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.670 
one highlighted not the first one or
both<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.280> them<00:02:54.449> then<00:02:55.449> no<00:02:56.340> browse<00:02:58.169> then<00:02:59.169> find

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
both of them then no browse then find

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.140 
both of them then no browse then find
your<00:02:59.859> desktop<00:03:00.930> which<00:03:02.040> undersea<00:03:03.150> documents

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
your desktop which undersea documents

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.750 
your desktop which undersea documents
are<00:03:04.209> sayings<00:03:04.510> for<00:03:04.599> me<00:03:04.719> and<00:03:04.930> then<00:03:05.549> stuff<00:03:06.549> like

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
are sayings for me and then stuff like

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.619 
are sayings for me and then stuff like
that<00:03:06.939> and<00:03:07.650> then<00:03:08.650> try<00:03:09.609> and<00:03:09.639> go<00:03:10.030> to<00:03:10.090> desktop<00:03:10.359> and

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
that and then try and go to desktop and

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.009 
that and then try and go to desktop and
then<00:03:10.840> try<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.109> find<00:03:11.409> open<00:03:11.919> connect<00:03:12.310> lb

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
then try and find open connect lb

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.909 
then try and find open connect lb
freaking<00:03:14.019> free<00:03:14.469> next<00:03:14.709> then<00:03:15.609> platform<00:03:16.329> and

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
freaking free next then platform and

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.920 
freaking free next then platform and
then<00:03:17.919> Windows<00:03:18.430> or<00:03:18.729> whatever<00:03:19.000> operators<00:03:19.810> from

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
then Windows or whatever operators from

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.710 
then Windows or whatever operators from
you're<00:03:20.079> using<00:03:20.259> then<00:03:21.040> click<00:03:21.699> on<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.269> folder

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
you're using then click on the folder

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.729 
you're using then click on the folder
Xbox<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.739> UI<00:03:24.099> motor<00:03:24.639> and<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.299> click<00:03:25.569> ok<00:03:25.989> then

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
Xbox and UI motor and just click ok then

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.770 
Xbox and UI motor and just click ok then
next<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.840> I'll<00:03:29.079> be<00:03:29.229> working<00:03:29.650> normally<00:03:30.159> and

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
next and I'll be working normally and

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:37.289 
next and I'll be working normally and
then<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.959> do<00:03:32.139> that<00:03:32.349> for<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.650> next<00:03:32.829> three<00:03:36.299> the

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
then you do that for the next three the

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.759 
then you do that for the next three the
next<00:03:37.509> three<00:03:37.629> things<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.989> audio<00:03:38.379> and<00:03:38.620> the

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
next three things the audio and the

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.059 
next three things the audio and the
camera<00:03:38.799> so<00:03:39.459> then<00:03:39.609> they<00:03:39.790> all<00:03:39.939> work<00:03:41.759> and<00:03:42.989> then

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
camera so then they all work and then

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.800 
camera so then they all work and then
you'll<00:03:45.069> have<00:03:45.370> connected<00:03:46.120> connected<00:03:46.569> to<00:03:46.659> your

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
you'll have connected connected to your

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.659 
you'll have connected connected to your
computer<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.319> don't<00:03:47.590> know<00:03:47.680> how<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:47.889> get<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.549> to

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
computer I don't know how to get it to

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.509 
computer I don't know how to get it to
run<00:03:48.930> through<00:03:49.930> like<00:03:50.169> Skype<00:03:50.620> all<00:03:50.889> make<00:03:51.129> a<00:03:51.159> game

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
run through like Skype all make a game

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.520 
run through like Skype all make a game
with<00:03:51.759> it<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:52.060> I'm<00:03:52.629> sure<00:03:52.689> that<00:03:52.870> there<00:03:53.139> are<00:03:53.349> ways

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
with it but I'm sure that there are ways

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.550 
with it but I'm sure that there are ways
and<00:03:53.859> it's<00:03:54.159> just<00:03:54.519> confusing<00:03:54.699> coding<00:03:55.419> but<00:03:56.319> at

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
and it's just confusing coding but at

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.899 
and it's just confusing coding but at
least<00:03:56.769> you<00:03:57.009> now<00:03:57.129> know<00:03:57.340> how<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.519> get<00:03:57.759> it

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
least you now know how to get it

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:04.680 
least you now know how to get it
connected<00:03:58.659> to<00:03:58.870> your<00:03:58.959> computer

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.860 

and<00:04:05.690> there<00:04:05.870> you<00:04:05.990> go<00:04:06.020> goings<00:04:07.270> you've<00:04:08.270> just

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
and there you go goings you've just

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.410 
and there you go goings you've just
connected<00:04:09.380> all<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:10.220> you've<00:04:10.880> just<00:04:11.090> connected

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
connected all of you've just connected

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.600 
connected all of you've just connected
your<00:04:11.570> Kinect<00:04:11.870> camera<00:04:12.740> to<00:04:12.980> your<00:04:13.160> computer<00:04:13.730> and

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
your Kinect camera to your computer and

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.190 
your Kinect camera to your computer and
say<00:04:16.610> yeah<00:04:16.760> go<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.090> have<00:04:17.210> fun<00:04:17.420> trying<00:04:17.660> find<00:04:18.020> out

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
say yeah go and have fun trying find out

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.160 
say yeah go and have fun trying find out
some<00:04:18.350> coding<00:04:18.710> for<00:04:18.980> it<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:19.750> maybe<00:04:20.750> put<00:04:21.020> as<00:04:21.110> a

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
some coding for it and maybe put as a

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.310 
some coding for it and maybe put as a
video<00:04:21.440> response<00:04:21.470> what<00:04:22.190> you've<00:04:22.370> found<00:04:22.400> for<00:04:22.970> it

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
video response what you've found for it

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.030 
video response what you've found for it
all<00:04:24.320> right<00:04:24.380> well<00:04:24.560> thanks<00:04:24.830> guys<00:04:25.040> bye-bye
