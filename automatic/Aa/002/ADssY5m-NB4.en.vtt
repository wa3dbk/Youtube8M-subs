00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
of the infected would eat them so I

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.820

could<00:03:50.850> observe<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.330> document<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:53.260> results

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
could observe and document the results

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.610
