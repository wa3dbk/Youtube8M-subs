00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.929
 yes hello and welcome my 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.750
 love people for a new discussion 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.360
 here on my channel would have it today 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.790
 it's about the Egyptian gods cards 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.500
 from the judo collection card game rather 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.969
 actually about the effects monster and 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.410
 actually only one I have 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.500
 unfortunately not and that is about the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.630
 winged dragon it was the one 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.180
 Unfortunately, I do not say it as e or better 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.350
 luckily not as 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.670
 effect monster because I want that 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.710
 do not insult monster 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.630
 the only window she really looks like 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.880
 cannabis sire the himmelsbach i have 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.309
 just put it on now yes the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.649
 question is rather slight as powerful 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.680
 is answered very easily it is one 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.780
 it has become an absolute zero map 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.090
 Actually, what is the question now? 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.570
 current meaning behind the winged 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.629
 Dragon of Ra is called earlier 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.590
 you still recommend it today 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.420
 I knew that the dragon is mine 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.219
 actually thought is is he is this 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.190
 deity and not that he leads 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.960
 this Egyptian sun deity serves 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.240
 is he what the name is 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.860
 Says it is important that the card can 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.200
 So how do you all know this one? 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.909
 beautiful yellow card I have 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.340
 here's the legendary collection 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.170
 and yes she is a beautiful one 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.360
 Collectible one can say yes 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.040
 Of course, they were on the scene earlier 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.140
 the most coveted yet the cards that it 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.400
 brings something she totally shit 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.049
 that they have again and again 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.150
 come out they are already new again 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.770
 Somewhere out earlier came to the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.299
 gods cards virtually the rarest 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.979
 what you could have it was 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.390
 most coveted cards if we only 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.610
 there was a king on the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.979
 schoolyard and who all three always had 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.659
 practically the emperor there was very much namely 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.369
 just this one special boll 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.619
 play and I think that would have synonymous for 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.540
 everyone should stay eternity to 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.520
 recognize the original gods gave 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.560
 here on this bare back anyway 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.610
 everything if they are so colored 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.500
 and of course the kart can not be used 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.509
 the nature of the sentence down there and so on 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.759
 continue and so on the old maps 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.110
 never had a limited first 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.390
 pad and a few Japanese 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.270
 There are enough videos there 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.280
 so this card yes this card is off 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.410
 through the anime version and you have it 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.080
 Of course always the effects to be sealed 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.270
 which the true 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.490
 So first of course, of course 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.200
 Three monsters must be sacrificed 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.240
 so that he can be called that is 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.310
 Yes, still today with the Seekarten 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.890
 then he takes over the attack points 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.600
 of these three sacrificed monsters or he 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.270
 will be revived by the cemetery if that 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.800
 he has zero attack points and 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.510
 He stays only for a train 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.700
 on the field for example 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.770
 foothills and still applies 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.420
 one knew also as many as you like 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.950
 life points are other points 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.840
 but they will come later 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.450
 does not make any more return basically 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.240
 you have to have one more and yes 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.130
 well there's this phoenix mode 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.459
 you have always translated that the 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.530
 Dragon then for a train or long 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.500
 something either all monsters opponent 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.820
 destroyed, or that he was just an all around 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.650
 defeatable somehow you have one 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.810
 has different abilities in this 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.150
 phoenix mode written to the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.890
 map now the effect is there 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.440
 out of the effect monster as one of 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.050
 weakest ever against 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.370
 So first of all, they met 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.870
 three victims remain 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.910
 but the dragon has it now anyway 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.800
 attack points of the dragon can not 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.820
 More of the cemetery to be revived 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.650
 I can not believe that at all 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.050
 Special Summon Summoned 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.570
 accordingly, this is attributable to this one train 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.550
 regulation 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.370
 he is still vulnerable to falun 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.170
 cards in series was the way to fall 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.620
 of against gods cards not effective 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.870
 well that's my opinion in order 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.459
 You can certainly leave that while 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.100
 the gods cards for a real one 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.780
 then play to the state if you do not 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.220
 to play with falling cards 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.380
 then you can talk to me then this 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.130
 support so he is now everything 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.880
 only legitimate 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.370
 The dragon then has two effects 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.320
 but both brothers can not be 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.090
 Once there, he has zero 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.070
 attack points you can do this 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.290
 perform life points transfer there 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.170
 you have to forcibly all 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.120
 give up life points to 100 and 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.380
 he gets that as attack points 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.910
 that is, they have only 100 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.880
 life's left over that a bit 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.430
 little if you make a mistake then 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.470
 you almost lost the second one 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.710
 possibility is your sacrifice 1000 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:29.140
 life points and destroy one so only 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:33.650
 right belongs a monster of the opponent 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.750
 yes destroy a monster of the opponent for 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.760
 1000 life points that's pretty much 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.980
 I would say expensive 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.320
 before there was the magic card rigid 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:45.050
 the enemy bank was almost there 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.470
 said with pokemon will be the choice 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.080
 more 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.760
 and today 1000 Lebensspunkte not 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.070
 only that he has an inflation in the 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.390
 watch other pumps there must 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.140
 somehow and will make upper 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.910
 maybe the next one 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.340
 no, now we also have one 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.180
 extra a cost explosion for that 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.710
 destroy the opponent's cards so 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.410
 in my opinion, by these effects 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.920
 it had become absolutely weak he is 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.250
 absolutely stunned 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.330
 you need him well 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.480
 admittedly for the creator of 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.520
 There's nothing to play it out 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.580
 as an effect card in real but I think so 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.470
 only in america and japan when he is in 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.830
 america already houses in japan on everyone 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.930
 case 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.660
 he has the effect if you all three 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.240
 gods sacrifices broken monster and the one out 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.220
 game day you won the game 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.930
 Oh well, but I would cover my blanket 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.180
 not to build with such cards because 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.340
 this is a strategy that it is too 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.400
 especially for me now 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.230
 That's why I do not think so 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.700
 appropriate was not appropriate anyway 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.770
 that the gods cards as effects us 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.780
 They always came out with just that 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.280
 Of course, one has mystical oneself 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.320
 somehow desired that one too 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.210
 but I can play properly with them 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.010
 I think you just have an official 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.580
 Settlement for the gods cards 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.170
 are how she had a play 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.690
 may use that would be in 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.740
 but the gods have it 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.530
 to weaken 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.330
 I do not think that drives at all 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.130
 best is still two avoids 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.290
 I think he has the most 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.640
 save effect from the series except 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.440
 maybe that with the fall cards 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.020
 and let the tormentor 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.970
 yes, there have been moments changed 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.620
 you can also tribute two monsters 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.889
 offer and all monsters of the opponent 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.749
 destroy that is 

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.099
 okay that it is also powerful 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:32.039
 then it is fair that he is not 

00:06:29.099 --> 00:06:34.289
 But it is still allowed to attack 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:38.340
 the grinder and can not be 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:39.539
 quite as come of it so that should 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.930
 actually been 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:44.669
 in my opinion I can not find it 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.669
 Change the kata cards the way 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:48.930
 but I would be fine 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:51.419
 very happy if you have yours 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.620
 Opinion in the comments writes and 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.719
 then'll now only once 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.520
 I say thank you very much 

00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:57.990
 she has watched and hope that she 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.129
 to be back for the next time 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.129
 until then and ciao
