gonna<00:00:17.470> make<00:00:17.680> my<00:00:17.890> own<00:00:18.040> bat-signal

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.009 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.870 

alright<00:00:23.009> let's<00:00:23.189> see<00:00:23.310> what's<00:00:23.460> inside<00:00:23.580> these

on

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:12.530 

dunno<00:01:08.390> yeah<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> sounds<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:09.870> broken<00:01:11.540> where

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
dunno yeah it sounds pretty broken where

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:24.010 
dunno yeah it sounds pretty broken where
am<00:01:12.690> I<00:01:12.780> gonna<00:01:12.930> find<00:01:13.020> another<00:01:13.410> one<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> these

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:39.030 

here's<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> normal<00:01:25.259> light<00:01:25.590> bulb<00:01:25.829> for<00:01:26.009> scale

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.730 

so<00:01:39.760> it<00:01:39.820> looks<00:01:40.090> like<00:01:40.180> this<00:01:40.420> would<00:01:40.600> be<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.750> e-40

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
so it looks like this would be a e-40

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.130 
so it looks like this would be a e-40
socket<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:44.170> can<00:01:44.260> even<00:01:44.380> buy<00:01:44.590> those<00:01:44.860> anymore

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
socket you can even buy those anymore

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.840 
socket you can even buy those anymore
but<00:01:47.140> we'll<00:01:47.290> have<00:01:47.410> a<00:01:47.470> look<00:01:47.560> otherwise<00:01:48.130> gonna

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
but we'll have a look otherwise gonna

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.920 
but we'll have a look otherwise gonna
have<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.120> modify<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:51.510> looks<00:01:52.510> like<00:01:52.690> the<00:01:52.780> other

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
have to modify it looks like the other

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.220 
have to modify it looks like the other
ones<00:01:53.110> in<00:01:53.230> a<00:01:53.290> bit<00:01:53.410> rougher<00:01:53.770> shape<00:01:54.930> at<00:01:55.930> least<00:01:55.960> I

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
ones in a bit rougher shape at least I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:11.810 
ones in a bit rougher shape at least I
can<00:01:56.380> take<00:01:56.590> this<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.950> store<00:01:57.280> with<00:01:57.520> me

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.720 
foot-and-a-half cross i'll make quite
the<00:02:15.850> bat-signal

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.850 

clean<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.880> though<00:02:21.030> filthy<00:02:24.470> all<00:02:25.470> right<00:02:25.650> let's

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
clean up though filthy all right let's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:45.130 
clean up though filthy all right let's
grab<00:02:26.010> ourselves<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.670> bat<00:02:26.850> symbol<00:02:39.020> perfect

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.940 

just<00:02:46.140> import<00:02:46.740> that<00:02:46.800> into<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.250> laser<00:02:47.430> software

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.670 

perfect<00:02:53.930> now<00:02:54.930> we're<00:02:55.080> going<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.410> get<00:02:56.400> out<00:02:56.670> line

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
perfect now we're going to get out line

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.600 
perfect now we're going to get out line
and<00:02:58.680> go<00:02:59.210> now<00:03:00.210> we<00:03:00.270> can<00:03:00.600> simply<00:03:01.340> delete<00:03:02.340> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
and go now we can simply delete the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.610 
and go now we can simply delete the
bitmap<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.270> we're<00:03:03.690> left<00:03:03.840> with<00:03:04.050> the<00:03:04.170> outline

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
bitmap and we're left with the outline

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.040 
bitmap and we're left with the outline
of<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:05.010> bat<00:03:05.190> symbol<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:06.420> now<00:03:06.570> we<00:03:06.630> can<00:03:06.810> laser

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
of the bat symbol so now we can laser

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.180 
of the bat symbol so now we can laser
cut<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:07.470> out<00:03:07.680> from<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:09.570> template<00:03:09.990> and<00:03:10.830> put

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
cut this out from the template and put

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.090 
cut this out from the template and put
it<00:03:11.280> on<00:03:11.340> from<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.760> spotlight<00:03:15.920> all<00:03:16.920> right

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
it on from this spotlight all right

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.349 
it on from this spotlight all right
let's<00:03:17.310> turn<00:03:17.430> on<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.640> laser

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.220 

so<00:03:26.359> for<00:03:26.510> now<00:03:26.599> I'm<00:03:26.749> just<00:03:26.870> going<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.109> use<00:03:27.200> some

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
so for now I'm just going to use some

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.440 
so for now I'm just going to use some
MDF<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.859> test<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.459> out<00:03:28.609> and<00:03:28.879> then<00:03:29.060> we'll<00:03:29.209> use

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
MDF to test it out and then we'll use

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.690 
MDF to test it out and then we'll use
something<00:03:29.810> better<00:03:29.989> for<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.349> final<00:03:30.709> final

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
something better for the final final

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.030 
something better for the final final
version<00:03:32.439> so<00:03:33.439> who's<00:03:33.590> going<00:03:33.709> to<00:03:33.769> go<00:03:33.859> ahead<00:03:34.129> and

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
version so who's going to go ahead and

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.020 
version so who's going to go ahead and
focus<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.340> laser<00:03:37.489> using<00:03:38.180> a<00:03:38.209> sandy<00:03:39.109> dandy

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
focus the laser using a sandy dandy

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.060 
focus the laser using a sandy dandy
don't<00:03:41.600> read<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:42.200> autofocus<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.620> touch<00:03:48.800> that

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
don't read it autofocus and touch that

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.390 
don't read it autofocus and touch that
finger

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.190 

and<00:03:52.760> backs<00:03:53.030> off<00:03:53.270> the<00:03:53.540> laser<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.050> right

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
and backs off the laser to the right

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:32.930 
and backs off the laser to the right
focus<00:03:54.670> pretty<00:03:55.670> handy<00:03:55.970> little<00:03:56.090> feature

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:40.910

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
going to test it here with the very

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.590 
going to test it here with the very
little<00:04:43.710> desk<00:04:44.160> lamp<00:04:44.430> won't<00:04:44.880> be<00:04:45.030> nearly<00:04:45.420> as

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
little desk lamp won't be nearly as

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.870 
little desk lamp won't be nearly as
bright<00:04:45.990> as<00:04:46.140> it<00:04:46.170> will<00:04:46.440> be<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:47.520> will<00:04:47.700> at<00:04:47.790> least
