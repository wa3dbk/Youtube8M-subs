front of us it's a pretty easy one to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.880 
front of us it's a pretty easy one to
find<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.719> actually<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:55.379> off<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
find it's actually just right off the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.830 
find it's actually just right off the
side<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> can<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> lamb

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
side of as you can see that's the lamb

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.360 
side of as you can see that's the lamb
just<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.379> over<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:58.829> Juliette<00:00:59.250> I

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
just right over there that's Juliette I

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.340 
just right over there that's Juliette I
think<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.329> actually<00:01:00.510> add<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.050> might<00:01:01.199> be

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
think it's actually add that might be

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
think it's actually add that might be
chilly<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.739> um<00:01:02.070> yeah<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.090> should<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.329> chilly

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
chilly at um yeah that should be chilly

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.570 
chilly at um yeah that should be chilly

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
have full stamina I'm Franklin because I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.359 
have full stamina I'm Franklin because I
always<00:01:33.150> drives<00:01:33.420> cars<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> with

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
always drives cars but if you do it with

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.310 
always drives cars but if you do it with
a<00:01:35.400> scuba<00:01:35.790> suit<00:01:35.820> obviously<00:01:36.450> brings<00:01:36.750> forever<00:01:37.049> no

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
a scuba suit obviously brings forever no

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.960 
a scuba suit obviously brings forever no
problems<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.250> we're<00:01:38.790> gonna<00:01:38.850> see

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
problems there and we're gonna see

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.700 
problems there and we're gonna see
you're<00:01:39.840> gonna<00:01:39.900> want<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.229> look<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.680> is

you're gonna want to look for is

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
you're gonna want to look for is
probably<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.430> tail<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.150> tail<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
probably the tail the tail is the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.179 
probably the tail the tail is the
easiest<00:01:42.930> thing<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.290> spot<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.829> some<00:01:44.009> odd

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189

reason<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.700> don't<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:45.119> why<00:01:45.329> those<00:01:45.720> little

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
reason I don't know why those little

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.300 
reason I don't know why those little
bones<00:01:46.140> right<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.860> then<00:01:46.979> you've<00:01:47.159> got

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
bones right there and then you've got

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.130 
bones right there and then you've got
the<00:01:47.430> rib<00:01:47.729> cage<00:01:48.060> coming<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.840> massive

rib cage not first I thought this might
be<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.570> whale<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.890> went<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.340> saw<00:01:53.430> the
