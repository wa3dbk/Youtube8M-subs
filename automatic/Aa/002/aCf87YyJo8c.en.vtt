00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
 One time I will talk about spreads 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.380
 There are two types of spreads 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.880
 To spread the ribbon spread 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.940
 It is called ordinary spread to spread during 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.340
 First of all, ribbon spread a good one 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.340
 With various grips with the right hand 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.400
 At that time come cb 4 a 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.430
 Please take this side 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.190
 so 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.040
 Put 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.700
 While loosening power with Darcy finger 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.700
 I will go 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.720
 As much as possible 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.720
 Please arrange at equal intervals 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.350
 At regular intervals as long as 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.969
 so 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.969
 The following is a way to spread between the hands 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.880
 When you can't spread it 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.970
 A little harder decision 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.530
 Just tilt it 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.530
 I will pass on the name 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.290
 Try using the thumb will continue to plus physical disorder 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.590
 At that time 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.640
 Urawa 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.640
 Please support well 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.090
 so 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.150
 As a point 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.150
 This request is a pinky 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.010
 with this 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.580
 The front 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.580
 Support 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.800

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.729
 freely 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.210
 With the back finger 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.900
 I can do 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.900
 Vice versa 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.580
 As much as possible 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.260
 The back is with a finger when doing a part 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.580
 In these such Fu 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.630
 The delay is 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.630
 I will come back to the contrary 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.400
 Please practice this
