 sure of his victory but still 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.950

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.540
 too arrogant well friends

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.040
 today's achivka yes maybe she 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.310
 connected with the gods in the game but I could not 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.890
 take it into your program because 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.730
 connected with the game that I spent 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.760
 too much time not honestly I 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.820
 surprised that just now by world of 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.620
 warcraft appeared achivka 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.230
 playing for blood elves if anyone 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.180
 interesting then get to the sawmill me 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.450
 It was generally far away because I 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.360
 last of last save point 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.610
 was in the analysis proper way such 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.870
 was not quite close to me about being killed 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.310
 but it doesn’t matter what I stand for 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.790
 beds and 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.510
 left to use the most important thing 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.570
 desired spells 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.910
 before the jump brought nasa to the roof 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.590
 sawmills and in my collection has increased 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.290
 another achivka 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:26.970
 and let's prove it 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:33.040
 I will write a roll at the table as usual and 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:38.019
 in caps p 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.450
 yeah great seriously i 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.569
 I understand that this achivka was done by 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.250
 fan and unselfish purposes and me this 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.310
 very happy 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.129
 I ran with my great pleasure 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.030
 blood elves from tanaris to this 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.299
 sawmills 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.900
 on the way we meet a lot and alliance and hordes 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.810
 even been in a pair of brawls and once 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.420
 survived out of her winner by the way if 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.090
 suddenly you think you would do an achivka 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.760
 much more interesting and cooler and more exciting 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.150
 then nothing prevents you from sending to 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.299
 video hyphen bubble dog mail.ru link 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:19.120
 on video with her and i will definitely look 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.030
 and most likely I will try to repeat it 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.660
 and in case of my failure you will receive mine 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.630
 personal 500 rubles but in traditional 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.180
 failures while shooting you will see that 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.000
 usually happens when you record without 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.550
 prearranged text and how it 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.949
 I often have the first time doing 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.380
 Achivku I can screw up the video by starting 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:44.169
 speak every heresy and all this because 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.599
 hopes for pure improvisation but for now 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.550

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.310
