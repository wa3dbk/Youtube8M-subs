00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:11.750
 elastic 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.970
 it is from relief 100 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:20.390
 but today I will show you how 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:23.580
 such a crochet rezinochka of course she 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.520
 worse deformed than gum related 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.800
 knitting needles but for those who need knitting knit not 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:33.480
 can this method in general be useful 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:38.460
 for finishing our products we start on 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.680
 knitting a chain of air loops i 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.680
 I will make not a very long chain 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:58.920
 and the first row we knit with single columns 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:02.220
 nakida I made the first row of 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.070
 single crochets come to 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.420
 knitting gum itself do 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:16.220
 lifting air loops and now we 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.220
 knit in turn concave column 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:27.110
 embossed convex column and so 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:33.000
 alternate to the end of the row that is knit 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.540
 We take for cling here for a column with 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.530
 nakidom 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:42.780
 swiping the hook enter it from behind 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:47.700
 the next column is holding a hook under 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:52.950
 him in front and so alternate such here 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:57.710
 columns to the end of the row the last table 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.710
 how do we do in a chain of lifting ordinary 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.930
 3 air loops and in the next row here 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:14.670
 see here we have such a column we 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:17.269
 we also knit him so that they leave us 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:21.260
 such stripes were formed here 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:26.370
 convex column we knit convex 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:31.880
 where concave we knit concave 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.880
 that is, we go so to say in the picture 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:42.010
 you see that such 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.590
 here are the stripes and so knit in general on 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.070
 the height you need 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.250
 I want to say this one's like 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.960
 Corresponds to the drawing 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.920
 rezinochki which is called one on one 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.800
 that is, when knitting knit one 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.620
 loop front 1 purl with elastic band 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.090
 happen the most different that is 2 on 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.620
 1 happens 2 on 2 that is quantity 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.020
 convex and concave columns you have 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.270
 maybe different you can do two 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:17.740
 convex 2 concave it will be 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:21.910
 to match the rubber 2 by 2 that is 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.460
 do any rhythm here in general 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.940
 cunning 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.420
 elasticity is there defined in 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.420
 the result is this 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.420
 rezinochka
