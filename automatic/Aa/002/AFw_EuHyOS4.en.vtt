going to be nice thin platters that
we're<00:00:18.790> going<00:00:18.939> to<00:00:19.090> be<00:00:19.210> using<00:00:19.480> a<00:00:19.840> paper<00:00:20.650> plate

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
we're going to be using a paper plate

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.480 
we're going to be using a paper plate
moved<00:00:21.189> for<00:00:21.630> we<00:00:22.630> are<00:00:22.869> going<00:00:23.260> to<00:00:23.410> be<00:00:23.560> incising

we<00:00:28.150> go<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.330> glaze<00:00:28.630> it<00:00:28.810> we'll<00:00:28.930> have<00:00:29.109> separate

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
we go to glaze it we'll have separate

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.230 
we go to glaze it we'll have separate
areas<00:00:29.830> so<00:00:30.010> we<00:00:30.130> can<00:00:30.279> glaze<00:00:30.490> or<00:00:30.699> different<00:00:31.029> areas

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
areas so we can glaze or different areas

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.979 
areas so we can glaze or different areas
with<00:00:32.199> different<00:00:32.230> glazes<00:00:33.780> we're<00:00:34.780> going<00:00:34.930> to

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
with different glazes we're going to

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.170 
with different glazes we're going to
start<00:00:35.260> off<00:00:35.440> by<00:00:35.710> getting<00:00:36.070> some<00:00:36.550> stoneware<00:00:36.940> clay

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
start off by getting some stoneware clay

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.900 
start off by getting some stoneware clay
now<00:00:37.750> you<00:00:37.870> can<00:00:38.110> wedge<00:00:38.320> your<00:00:38.620> stoneware<00:00:39.040> clay<00:00:39.190> if

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
now you can wedge your stoneware clay if

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.850 
now you can wedge your stoneware clay if
you<00:00:40.090> have<00:00:40.239> scrap<00:00:40.570> especially<00:00:41.200> you<00:00:41.620> want<00:00:41.710> to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
you have scrap especially you want to

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.139 
you have scrap especially you want to
make<00:00:41.950> sure<00:00:41.980> you're<00:00:42.399> wedging<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.820> up

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
make sure you're wedging it up

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.310 
make sure you're wedging it up
it<00:00:43.600> should<00:00:43.870> be<00:00:44.020> a<00:00:45.690> little<00:00:46.690> bit<00:00:46.780> bigger<00:00:47.050> than<00:00:47.260> a

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
it should be a little bit bigger than a

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.680 
it should be a little bit bigger than a
large<00:00:47.649> grapefruit<00:00:48.010> maybe<00:00:48.520> and<00:00:49.000> then<00:00:49.420> what<00:00:49.600> I'm

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
large grapefruit maybe and then what I'm

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.440 
large grapefruit maybe and then what I'm
going<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:49.899> do<00:00:50.050> is<00:00:50.980> I'm<00:00:51.219> going<00:00:51.250> to<00:00:51.550> kind<00:00:52.270> of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
going to do is I'm going to kind of

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.940 
going to do is I'm going to kind of
flatten<00:00:52.840> it<00:00:52.930> with<00:00:52.960> my<00:00:53.200> hands<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.620> little<00:00:53.710> bit

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
flatten it with my hands a little bit

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.770 
flatten it with my hands a little bit
it's<00:00:54.640> going<00:00:54.910> to<00:00:55.000> make<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.239> rolling<00:00:55.629> process

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
it's going to make the rolling process

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.069 
it's going to make the rolling process
much<00:00:56.260> easier<00:00:56.289> now<00:00:57.280> keep<00:00:57.879> in<00:00:58.030> mind<00:00:58.239> that<00:00:58.719> I<00:00:58.870> need

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
much easier now keep in mind that I need

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.979 
much easier now keep in mind that I need
to<00:00:59.199> get<00:00:59.320> something<00:00:59.590> that<00:01:00.070> is<00:01:00.129> a<00:01:00.610> large<00:01:00.940> oval<00:01:01.510> so

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
to get something that is a large oval so

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:02.939 
to get something that is a large oval so
you<00:01:02.050> have<00:01:02.230> to<00:01:02.350> make<00:01:02.469> sure<00:01:02.649> that<00:01:02.829> you're

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
you have to make sure that you're

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.650 
you have to make sure that you're
stretching<00:01:03.250> at<00:01:03.460> both<00:01:03.579> directions<00:01:03.940> both<00:01:04.360> side

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
stretching at both directions both side

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.440 
stretching at both directions both side
to<00:01:04.809> side<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.320> front<00:01:05.379> to<00:01:06.039> back<00:01:06.130> I'm<00:01:07.060> going<00:01:07.390> to

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
to side and front to back I'm going to

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.749 
to side and front to back I'm going to
be<00:01:07.539> using<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.960> red<00:01:08.200> slab<00:01:08.680> sticks<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.520> slop

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
be using the red slab sticks the slop

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.450 
be using the red slab sticks the slop
sticks<00:01:10.149> if<00:01:10.300> you<00:01:10.420> remember<00:01:10.840> help<00:01:11.830> you<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.189> gauge

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
sticks if you remember help you to gauge

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.940 
sticks if you remember help you to gauge
your<00:01:12.820> thickness<00:01:13.360> so<00:01:14.020> when<00:01:14.260> you<00:01:14.409> are<00:01:14.680> rolling

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
your thickness so when you are rolling

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.950 
your thickness so when you are rolling
with<00:01:15.250> your<00:01:15.400> rolling<00:01:15.670> pin<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.119> will<00:01:16.479> get<00:01:16.689> down

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
with your rolling pin you will get down

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.660 
with your rolling pin you will get down
to<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.350> thickness<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.950> side<00:01:18.159> sticks<00:01:18.490> and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
to the thickness of the side sticks and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.660 
to the thickness of the side sticks and
your<00:01:18.729> rolling<00:01:18.939> pin<00:01:19.060> will<00:01:19.390> stop<00:01:19.659> now<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
your rolling pin will stop now you

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.130 
your rolling pin will stop now you
always<00:01:21.939> want<00:01:22.150> to<00:01:22.210> start<00:01:22.450> from<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.780> middle<00:01:22.960> and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
always want to start from the middle and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.270 
always want to start from the middle and
go<00:01:24.100> outward<00:01:24.729> with<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.659> rolling<00:01:25.990> pin<00:01:26.250> after<00:01:27.250> a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
go outward with the rolling pin after a

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.609 
go outward with the rolling pin after a
few<00:01:27.549> rolls<00:01:27.869> you're<00:01:28.869> going<00:01:29.049> to<00:01:29.110> pick<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.290> clay

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
few rolls you're going to pick the clay

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.190 
few rolls you're going to pick the clay
up<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:29.979> you're<00:01:30.670> going<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.240> rotate<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.840> you

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
up and you're going to rotate it you

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.109 
up and you're going to rotate it you
must<00:01:32.500> release<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.189> from<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:33.369> canvas<00:01:33.939> every

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
must release it from the canvas every

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.780 
must release it from the canvas every
few<00:01:34.509> rolls<00:01:34.750> because<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.770> clay<00:01:36.009> will<00:01:36.280> embed

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
few rolls because the clay will embed

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.460 
few rolls because the clay will embed
into<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.360> canvas<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:37.930> will<00:01:38.049> get<00:01:38.200> stuck

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
into the canvas and it will get stuck

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.990 
into the canvas and it will get stuck
we'll<00:01:39.430> do<00:01:39.549> that<00:01:39.700> again

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
we'll do that again

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.810 
we'll do that again
pick<00:01:40.720> it<00:01:40.750> up<00:01:40.930> rotate<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:43.650> again<00:01:44.650> always<00:01:45.610> from

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
pick it up rotate it again always from

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.990 
pick it up rotate it again always from
the<00:01:45.909> middle<00:01:46.150> out<00:01:46.329> there<00:01:47.159> if<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:48.400> go<00:01:48.549> from<00:01:48.850> the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
the middle out there if you go from the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.109 
the middle out there if you go from the
outside<00:01:49.659> coming<00:01:50.619> in<00:01:50.950> you're<00:01:51.460> gonna<00:01:51.549> end<00:01:51.820> up<00:01:52.000> by

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
outside coming in you're gonna end up by

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.670 
outside coming in you're gonna end up by
having<00:01:52.329> it<00:01:52.540> roll<00:01:52.780> up<00:01:53.049> on<00:01:53.320> your<00:01:54.600> rolling<00:01:55.600> pin

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
having it roll up on your rolling pin

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.109 
having it roll up on your rolling pin
and<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.770> kind<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:57.040> wraps<00:01:57.280> around<00:01:57.430> on<00:01:57.790> itself

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
and it kind of wraps around on itself

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.870 
and it kind of wraps around on itself
now<00:01:59.110> I<00:01:59.380> have<00:01:59.710> more<00:02:00.009> clay<00:02:00.340> than<00:02:00.369> I<00:02:00.670> actually

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
now I have more clay than I actually

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.050 
now I have more clay than I actually
need<00:02:01.479> but<00:02:02.290> I<00:02:02.619> would<00:02:03.009> rather<00:02:03.250> have<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.670> mistake

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
need but I would rather have the mistake

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.200 
need but I would rather have the mistake
of<00:02:04.270> having<00:02:04.540> more<00:02:04.780> clay<00:02:05.310> than<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.340> need<00:02:06.610> then<00:02:06.969> not

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
of having more clay than I need then not

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.930 
of having more clay than I need then not
enough<00:02:07.420> clay<00:02:07.810> because<00:02:08.679> if<00:02:09.040> you<00:02:09.310> don't<00:02:09.700> have

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
enough clay because if you don't have

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.580 
enough clay because if you don't have
enough<00:02:10.179> clay<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.509> can't<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:11.019> add<00:02:11.230> on

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
enough clay you can't just add on

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.330 
enough clay you can't just add on
another<00:02:11.769> chunk<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:13.000> actually<00:02:13.450> have<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.720> read

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
another chunk you actually have to read

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:22.400 
another chunk you actually have to read
when<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.660> roll<00:02:18.530> okay<00:02:19.940> and<00:02:20.940> let's<00:02:21.870> try<00:02:22.140> one

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
when and we roll okay and let's try one

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.199 
when and we roll okay and let's try one
more<00:02:22.850> past<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:24.240> direction<00:02:25.430> now<00:02:26.430> you<00:02:26.910> know

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
more past this direction now you know

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.780 
more past this direction now you know
that<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.230> are<00:02:28.260> down<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.310> final<00:02:29.610> thickness

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
that you are down to the final thickness

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.780 
that you are down to the final thickness
when<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.270> hear<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:30.750> rolling<00:02:31.140> pin<00:02:31.380> hit<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
when you hear that rolling pin hit the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.809 
when you hear that rolling pin hit the
slab<00:02:33.030> sticks<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.540> each<00:02:33.930> side<00:02:34.350> so<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.520> case

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
slab sticks on each side so in this case

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.800 
slab sticks on each side so in this case
let's<00:02:36.569> hear<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:36.810> again<00:02:36.959> I<00:02:38.360> know<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.690> I'm

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
let's hear that again I know that I'm

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.800 
let's hear that again I know that I'm
down<00:02:39.989> all<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.410> way<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.800> can<00:02:41.670> set<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.239> rolling<00:02:42.630> pin

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
down all the way I can set a rolling pin

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.229 
down all the way I can set a rolling pin
and<00:02:43.020> my<00:02:43.200> slab<00:02:43.440> sticks<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.160> side<00:02:44.370> now<00:02:45.060> what

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
and my slab sticks to the side now what

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.270 
and my slab sticks to the side now what
I'm<00:02:45.360> ready<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.750> do<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.140> I'm<00:02:46.290> ready<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.769> take<00:02:46.980> a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
I'm ready to do is I'm ready to take a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.420 
I'm ready to do is I'm ready to take a
red<00:02:48.150> rib<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.739> use<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.040> red<00:02:50.070> ribs

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
red rib I like to use the red ribs

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.310 
red rib I like to use the red ribs
because<00:02:50.790> they<00:02:50.910> have<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> nice<00:02:51.269> soft<00:02:51.510> edge<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.260> I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
because they have a nice soft edge and I

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.770 
because they have a nice soft edge and I
use<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.709> round<00:02:52.950> side<00:02:53.280> for<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.760> I'm<00:02:54.150> going<00:02:54.660> to

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
use the round side for this I'm going to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.970 
use the round side for this I'm going to
rib<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:57.060> top<00:02:57.300> side<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.720> clay<00:02:57.959> this<00:02:58.739> does

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
rib the top side of the clay this does

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.130 
rib the top side of the clay this does
two<00:02:59.190> things<00:02:59.220> obviously<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.150> smoothes<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.630> but

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
two things obviously it smoothes it but

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.410 
two things obviously it smoothes it but
that's<00:03:01.260> not<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.709> most<00:03:01.830> important<00:03:02.370> thing<00:03:02.420> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that's not the most important thing the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.729 
that's not the most important thing the
most<00:03:03.660> important<00:03:04.170> thing<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.470> it's

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
most important thing is that it's

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.100 
most important thing is that it's
compressing<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.459> clay<00:03:05.580> particles<00:03:06.180> now<00:03:06.900> once

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
compressing the clay particles now once

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.050 
compressing the clay particles now once
I<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.470> side<00:03:07.920> compressed<00:03:08.400> I'm<00:03:08.819> gonna

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
I have that side compressed I'm gonna

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.259 
I have that side compressed I'm gonna
flip<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:10.130> I'm<00:03:11.130> going<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.489> compress<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
flip it and I'm going to compress the

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.840 
flip it and I'm going to compress the
other<00:03:12.540> side<00:03:13.100> the<00:03:14.100> compression<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.730> the

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
other side the compression of the

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.490 
other side the compression of the
particles<00:03:15.360> will<00:03:15.569> make<00:03:15.720> your<00:03:15.870> slab<00:03:16.140> much

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
particles will make your slab much

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.100 
particles will make your slab much
stronger<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:18.120> don't<00:03:18.299> want<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.690> have<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.019> have

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
stronger you don't want you have to have

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.620 
stronger you don't want you have to have
your<00:03:19.320> plate<00:03:19.709> break<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:21.180> can<00:03:21.360> really

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
your plate break and you can really

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.650 
your plate break and you can really
avoid<00:03:22.049> a<00:03:22.350> lot<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.650> breaking<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.970> have<00:03:24.360> good

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
avoid a lot of breaking if you have good

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.520 
avoid a lot of breaking if you have good
compression<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.590> clay<00:03:26.060> okay<00:03:27.200> now<00:03:28.200> both

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
compression of the clay okay now both

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.160 
compression of the clay okay now both
sides<00:03:28.890> have<00:03:29.160> been<00:03:29.190> compressed<00:03:29.840> now<00:03:30.840> what<00:03:31.049> I'm

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
sides have been compressed now what I'm

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.120 
sides have been compressed now what I'm
going<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.350> do<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.560> I'm<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.860> take<00:03:31.980> my

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
going to do is I'm going to take my

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.300 
going to do is I'm going to take my
paper<00:03:32.340> plate<00:03:32.900> now<00:03:33.900> I'm<00:03:33.959> going<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.380> set<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:35.070> bag

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
paper plate now I'm going to set a bag

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.690 
paper plate now I'm going to set a bag
over<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> top<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.750> want<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.650> put<00:03:38.519> a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
over the top of it I want to put a

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.390 
over the top of it I want to put a
plastic<00:03:39.420> I'm<00:03:40.049> gonna<00:03:40.260> put<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.470> plastic<00:03:41.010> barrier

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
plastic I'm gonna put a plastic barrier

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.599 
plastic I'm gonna put a plastic barrier
between<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.450> clay<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.620> platter<00:03:43.890> because

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
between the clay and the platter because

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.479 
between the clay and the platter because
the<00:03:45.239> platter<00:03:45.570> is<00:03:45.930> made<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.410> paper<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.950> if<00:03:47.370> I

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
the platter is made of paper and if I

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.660 
the platter is made of paper and if I
don't<00:03:47.790> put<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.410> barrier<00:03:49.410> there<00:03:49.709> it's<00:03:50.400> going

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
don't put that barrier there it's going

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.440 
don't put that barrier there it's going
to<00:03:50.820> make<00:03:51.510> the<00:03:51.690> paper<00:03:51.930> get<00:03:52.799> all<00:03:52.920> soggy<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:54.150> I've

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
to make the paper get all soggy so I've

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.569 
to make the paper get all soggy so I've
now<00:03:54.720> draped<00:03:55.170> my<00:03:55.769> slab<00:03:56.100> right<00:03:56.640> into<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.299> mold

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
now draped my slab right into the mold

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.430 
now draped my slab right into the mold
I'm<00:03:59.579> going<00:03:59.820> to<00:03:59.910> gently<00:04:00.239> encourage<00:04:00.959> this<00:04:01.230> and

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
I'm going to gently encourage this and

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.960 
I'm going to gently encourage this and
notice<00:04:01.739> how<00:04:01.890> I'm<00:04:02.040> kind<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.310> lifting<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.760> edge
