00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:08.240
 hello today there will be a review on lego 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.690
 city ​​6003 vehicle for transportation 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:21.140
 There are three figures in the set 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:24.500
 police figurine figurine 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.700
 the prisoner he handcuffed and out of the weights on 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:33.620
 leg and figure accomplice prisoner 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:37.160
 which should free him means 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:41.690
 move on to the vehicle overview 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.190
 this is a police car she is low 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.960
 planted in the sense that if her somewhere 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.800
 on uneven ground try 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.530
 hold it clings bottom now 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:01.219
 for example she clings 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:04.540
 house for cloth if we take the box then 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.540
 she drives well 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:18.340
 So 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:23.000
 about the car itself there is such a door 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.960
 where can I put the prisoner open 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.810
 the door can be with this key 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.810
 just need to stick it and pull 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.590
 grilles on the windows of the car made so 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.070
 in a way that if you pull a little 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:53.410
 they break out that is all mount 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:02:02.000
 these are here in these two elements 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:05.720
 from this side the same car has 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.959
 hatch through which as drawn on 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.709
 I will show this package now 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:20.560
 picture must escape 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.560
 prisoners for this we need a crowbar 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:32.989
 so the hatch opens 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:38.299
 a scrap is installed and a prisoner can 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:42.340
 run away means to land 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:46.239
 a police car is provided here 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.400
 very simple procedure for removing the roof 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.370
 the cover is attached only by two here 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.290
 Now these elements are located 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:01.680
 additional key from the inside 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.680
 driver's seat steering wheel and here these doors 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.640
 Now we put the police there 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:24.500
 and put the prisoner donkey there 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:31.880
 minute to give 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:35.560
 inward let him use the shield there 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.560
 look at the car again 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:53.349
 crowbar pay side and we take now 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.219
 small quad bike for accomplice 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.219
 the prisoner 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.840
 there is such a hook with it 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:11.630
 of which he means first the same 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:14.440
 Salt the wheel with which he 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:19.040
 catching up with a police car 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:24.350
 such a glitch clings to the lattice 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:27.770
 car something is not very good 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.570
 he clings there just does not prolazit but 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.570
 we assume that he caught and 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:39.620
 speeding up he pulls out this here 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:44.660
 lattice thereby freeing the way and 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:47.800
 already fallen through unlocked 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:55.460

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:59.980
 an accomplice to a prisoner well on this review 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.750
 fits the ends of the set are interesting 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.010
 Made from as I think such 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.030
 classic 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:12.520
 details of the old left that is nick Clegg 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:17.210
 equipment here are just these parts 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.740
 the most so simple but that they do not 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:30.360
 become less interesting 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:34.470
 I'll show you the box again here. 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.470
 depicts escape methods 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.569
