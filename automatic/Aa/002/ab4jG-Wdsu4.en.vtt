you how to use a cable guard cable

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.690 
you how to use a cable guard cable
guards<00:00:11.340> are<00:00:11.519> great<00:00:11.759> because<00:00:13.250> they<00:00:14.250> cushion

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
guards are great because they cushion

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.450 
guards are great because they cushion
the<00:00:14.849> cable<00:00:15.240> wear<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.049> clasp<00:00:16.379> joins<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.310> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
the cable wear the clasp joins to the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.150 
the cable wear the clasp joins to the
necklace<00:00:17.850> or<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> bracelet<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.470> they

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
necklace or to the bracelet and they

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.429 
necklace or to the bracelet and they
create<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> less<00:00:21.180> friction<00:00:21.570> based<00:00:21.990> area<00:00:22.320> so

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
create a less friction based area so

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.759 
create a less friction based area so
your<00:00:22.590> cable<00:00:22.980> wears<00:00:23.160> out<00:00:23.369> less<00:00:23.640> frequently<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
your cable wears out less frequently and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.259 
your cable wears out less frequently and
most<00:00:25.769> time<00:00:25.980> when<00:00:26.220> necklaces<00:00:26.670> break<00:00:26.880> they<00:00:27.060> tend

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
most time when necklaces break they tend

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.060 
most time when necklaces break they tend
to<00:00:27.330> break<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> rear<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.680> also<00:00:28.800> looks

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
to break in the rear it also looks

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.820 
to break in the rear it also looks
pretty<00:00:29.160> nice<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.000> I'm<00:00:30.269> gonna<00:00:30.449> put<00:00:30.810> my<00:00:31.529> crimp
