00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:14.800
 but a 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.690
 they are dead or alive but lose one 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.600
 psychologist 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.980
 you feel observed then you are not crazy 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.700
 Also for me it is 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.780
 they exist and these do not exist what 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.980
 it can happen to us particles 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:37.629
 quantum jd I'll show you the world of gods 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:42.850
 which ones but we are prisoners and if he 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:45.820
 experimental about similar benefits I love them 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.860
 all roads set and much 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:53.710
 probably it's absolutely not 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.320
 bartering naples are low if i don't know 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.320
 like but just a little awake 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:17.890
 and having seen the Senate we love to ask myself how 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:20.420
 come on you will understand we have to tell them ourselves 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.530
 thinking about the experiments here I am 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.530
 experiment water doves 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.420
 the wave passing through hole 1 interferes 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.410
 with the wave passing through the hole 2 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.990
 the intensity of the two waves that is 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.630
 overlap is not equal to the sum 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.700
 of the intensities of the two waves taken 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.790
 individually as the sole principal 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.730
 lamination is not sincerely chad e 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.060
 freedom begins to understand how 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.240
 things work but then there are 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.270
 particles which are also waves and which 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.000
 temporarily pass for two outside 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.910
 we say that it is not overlaps 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.970
 distant and teaching a lot of 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.300
 thanks but i do n't know how you do it yet 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.180
 call i'm felix sorry but me 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.490
 they are simply a photon elate us 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.650
 in short, if you exchange a post of no 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.110
 as I realize it applies to all 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.330
 particles of the same type also for 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.350
 the electrons I advise you to go 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.960
 with them because it will be very interesting 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.020
 we will meet there every time I 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.020
 will put the photon bye soon 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.230
 it is not a question of racism but of state 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.260
 you mean the social class 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.920
 I mean it's not forbidden to us 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.790
 occupy the same state for the 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.630
 exclusion principle of cavani naples 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.120
 2 worrying about the spam itself 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:20.600
 6 basin I have to say even as a joke 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:24.030
 don't you see I'm at him and ai 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.270
 we are very different and therefore we are not 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.660
 in the same state a photon told me 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.560
 that you are all a photon to you 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.700
 fortunes of towards Turin are not engines 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:47.070
 you are subject to exclusion you do not 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:49.500
 you are bosons an effect of the principle of 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.350
 exclusion is the variety of the system 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.930
 periodic of the elements in fact in the 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.240
 atoms the electrons must be distributed 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.000
 on different levels giving rise to 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.370
 different elements 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.220
 moreover from the exclusion principle 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.620
 depends on the stability of the matter ad 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.600
 example two hydrogen atoms stand 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.940
 distant from each other 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.310
 to prevent their external electrons 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.760
 they are exactly in the same 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.920
 state 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.989
 bosons are much more likely 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.669
 high to be in the same state 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.770
 rather than in different states fermions 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.230
 and bosons behave very much 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.230
 different because they have spin value 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:39.360
 different there is a spin connection 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:42.030
 statistics in a boson system in the 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.770
 state of minimum energy each particle 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.990
 and in its minimum energy state in a 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.900
 fermion system in the state of 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:56.000
 minimum energy the individual particles do not 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.410
 they are in their lowest energy state 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.110
 the minimum energy of a system of 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.330
 fermions is enormously greater 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.780
 minimum energy of a system of 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.780
 bosons 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.710
 in superconductors the electrons e 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:16.580
 paired year spini whole and yes 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:20.039
 behave as busoni knows depends on us 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.280
 dogwood if there is a structure like the 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:26.759
 matter but where we are going 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:31.680
 the Trojans there is an important process on the 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:35.539
 quarrel mystery does not expect violated 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.539
 the law places 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:46.400
 I will prove to the jury that this theory 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:52.880
 his death is incomplete 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:54.260
 bye at the lawyer's salon face us 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.260
 understand where he wants to go 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.200
 if the test tells the truth and the Latvian 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.970
 he had none before the measure 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.890
 objective property 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.600
 I must conclude then that it was the 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.850
 accomplished measure that caused 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.850
 the emergence of this property on a 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.760
 electron is very far away therefore it would be 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.600
 of a size local laws I have to 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.110
 reflect 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.210
 the court withdraws to deliberate 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.819
 we won the case 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:26.539
 I would call to witness the cat 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:28.910
 felix on the objection measurement process 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:30.410
 actually we mean it 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.800
 we find in a state that the 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:36.949
 superposition of two states one in which 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.750
 I'm in it and the cat died one in 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:42.319
 which I have not been issued 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:45.020
 and the crime is alive the photon is in one 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:47.240
 superimposed state issued is not put if 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.289
 the photon is not emitted the cat is alive 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:54.770
 he put the cat dead 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:58.309
 I do not see where is the problem since 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:07:00.319
 we will never see it, no dinner forbid 

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:03.379
 that the cat is also in one 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:04.939
 however, overlapping states is not 

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:07.249
 decent that the cat goes around not 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:09.349
 similar state superimposed condemn 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:11.499
 therefore the felix cat to be alive or 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:11.499
 dead
