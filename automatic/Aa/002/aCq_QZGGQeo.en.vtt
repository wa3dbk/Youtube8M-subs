good<00:02:39.300> at<00:02:39.510> that<00:02:39.750> but<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.350> does<00:02:40.620> look<00:02:40.980> like<00:02:41.010> it's

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
good at that but it does look like it's

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.010 
good at that but it does look like it's
going<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.880> something<00:02:42.180> revolving<00:02:42.900> around

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
going to be something revolving around

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.440 
going to be something revolving around
your<00:02:43.290> gun<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.860> right<00:02:44.340> there<00:02:44.550> we<00:02:44.730> actually<00:02:45.180> see

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
your gun and right there we actually see

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.770 
your gun and right there we actually see
the<00:02:46.080> new<00:02:46.770> Wonder<00:02:47.100> weapon<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.459> looks<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.850> but

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
the new Wonder weapon it looks like but

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.360 
the new Wonder weapon it looks like but
the<00:02:48.900> speculation<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.650> I've<00:02:49.770> been<00:02:49.920> hearing

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
the speculation that I've been hearing

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.220 
the speculation that I've been hearing
is<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.940> when<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.209> upgrade<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.810> wave<00:02:51.989> gun

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
is that when you upgrade the wave gun

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.990 
is that when you upgrade the wave gun
when<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.470> pack<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> punch<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.160> wave<00:02:53.340> gun<00:02:53.610> you

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
when you pack a punch the wave gun you

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.850 
when you pack a punch the wave gun you
can<00:02:54.120> actually<00:02:54.300> break<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.840> wave<00:02:55.260> gun<00:02:55.500> apart

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
can actually break the wave gun apart

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.100 
can actually break the wave gun apart
and<00:02:56.130> put<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.820> into<00:02:56.940> two<00:02:57.209> pieces<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.690> those<00:02:57.900> two

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
and put it into two pieces and those two

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.360 
and put it into two pieces and those two
pieces<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:58.980> seen<00:02:59.130> where<00:02:59.280> they

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
pieces that you just seen where they

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.040 
pieces that you just seen where they
were<00:02:59.459> shooting<00:02:59.760> out<00:02:59.820> electricity<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.989> is

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
were shooting out electricity that is

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.290 
were shooting out electricity that is
the<00:03:01.500> pack<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.800> punch<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.190> wave<00:03:02.400> gun<00:03:02.670> just<00:03:02.880> broken

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
the pack a punch to wave gun just broken

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.690 
the pack a punch to wave gun just broken
apart<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:04.080> can<00:03:04.260> break<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.620> apart<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:05.310> shoot

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
apart you can break it apart you shoot

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.490 
apart you can break it apart you shoot
it<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.420> does<00:03:06.600> look<00:03:06.810> pretty<00:03:07.019> much<00:03:07.230> what<00:03:07.380> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
it and it does look pretty much what the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.780 
it and it does look pretty much what the
Wunderwaffe<00:03:07.920> does<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.610> just

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
Wunderwaffe does and it just

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.640 
Wunderwaffe does and it just
electrocutes<00:03:09.420> them<00:03:09.600> it<00:03:09.810> can<00:03:10.200> go<00:03:10.320> through<00:03:10.620> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
electrocutes them it can go through a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.080 
electrocutes them it can go through a
couple<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.160> zombies<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.610> definitely<00:03:11.910> don't

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
couple of zombies I definitely don't

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.400 
couple of zombies I definitely don't
think<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.420> going<00:03:12.510> to<00:03:12.570> go<00:03:12.660> through<00:03:12.959> as<00:03:13.140> many

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
think it's going to go through as many

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.320 
think it's going to go through as many
as<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.769> Wunderwaffe<00:03:14.190> did<00:03:14.459> but<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.150> looks

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
as the Wunderwaffe did but that looks

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.240 
as the Wunderwaffe did but that looks
epic<00:03:15.570> it's<00:03:16.080> one<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.590> first<00:03:16.830> times<00:03:17.010> I've

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
epic it's one of the first times I've

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.890 
epic it's one of the first times I've
ever<00:03:17.280> seen<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:17.880> pack<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> punch<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.510> gun<00:03:18.720> and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
ever seen you can pack a punch a gun and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.259 
ever seen you can pack a punch a gun and
turn<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.170> into<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.440> new<00:03:19.709> gun<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.880> one<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.209> my

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
turn it into a new gun and one of my

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.900 
turn it into a new gun and one of my
biggest<00:03:21.480> complaints<00:03:22.079> about<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.910> American

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
biggest complaints about the American

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.180 
biggest complaints about the American
gun<00:03:24.120> or<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.390> wave<00:03:24.780> gun<00:03:25.049> is<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.769> it<00:03:25.920> looks

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
gun or the wave gun is that it looks

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.560 
gun or the wave gun is that it looks
like<00:03:26.430> it's<00:03:26.610> going<00:03:26.760> to<00:03:26.880> be<00:03:27.060> one<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.420> those

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
like it's going to be one of those

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.539 
like it's going to be one of those
weapons<00:03:27.840> where<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:28.350> shoot<00:03:28.620> one<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.519> can

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
weapons where you shoot one and you can

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.180 
weapons where you shoot one and you can
only<00:03:29.790> kill<00:03:30.150> one<00:03:30.390> kind<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.110> like<00:03:31.230> how<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.410> VR<00:03:31.799> 11

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
only kill one kind of like how the VR 11

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.430 
only kill one kind of like how the VR 11
was<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.610> called<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.060> debt<00:03:33.269> as<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:34.079> all<00:03:34.230> seen

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
was and called the debt as we all seen

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.280 
was and called the debt as we all seen
the<00:03:34.590> VR<00:03:34.860> 11<00:03:35.250> looked<00:03:35.430> epic<00:03:35.820> at<00:03:35.940> first<00:03:36.209> but<00:03:37.110> as

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
the VR 11 looked epic at first but as

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.620 
the VR 11 looked epic at first but as
you<00:03:37.470> got<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.769> actually<00:03:38.160> use<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.430> being<00:03:39.209> able<00:03:39.540> to

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
you got to actually use it being able to

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.020 
you got to actually use it being able to
only<00:03:39.780> kill<00:03:40.110> one<00:03:40.410> zombie<00:03:40.890> /<00:03:41.130> every<00:03:41.459> one<00:03:41.640> shot

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
only kill one zombie / every one shot

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.210 
only kill one zombie / every one shot
really<00:03:42.900> made<00:03:43.079> it<00:03:43.200> extremely<00:03:43.470> underpowered

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
really made it extremely underpowered

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.310 
really made it extremely underpowered
and<00:03:44.459> hardly<00:03:44.790> anybody<00:03:45.120> ever<00:03:45.360> used<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:46.019> they

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
and hardly anybody ever used it they

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.900 
and hardly anybody ever used it they
were<00:03:46.440> always<00:03:46.620> using<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.100> scavenger<00:03:47.700> the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
were always using the scavenger the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.759 
were always using the scavenger the
Reagan<00:03:48.269> or<00:03:48.360> something<00:03:48.780> else<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.110> right<00:03:49.560> there

Reagan or something else and right there

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.229 
Reagan or something else and right there
we<00:03:49.890> actually<00:03:50.190> see<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.459> death<00:03:50.670> machine<00:03:50.850> make

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
we actually see the death machine make

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.569 
we actually see the death machine make
its<00:03:51.390> return<00:03:51.450> which<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.410> cool<00:03:52.650> definitely

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
its return which is cool definitely

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:54.500 
its return which is cool definitely
going<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.760> be<00:03:53.850> something<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.180> I'm<00:03:54.299> going<00:03:54.420> to

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
him floating and he's actually inside

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.130 
him floating and he's actually inside
right<00:04:08.640> now<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.880> he's<00:04:09.000> still<00:04:09.239> floating<00:04:09.540> so

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
right now and he's still floating so

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.780 
right now and he's still floating so
that's<00:04:10.260> definitely<00:04:10.709> going<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.130> be<00:04:11.220> epic<00:04:11.370> it

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
that's definitely going to be epic it

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.160 
that's definitely going to be epic it
looks<00:04:12.269> like<00:04:12.329> it's<00:04:12.510> going<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.690> be<00:04:12.810> one<00:04:12.959> of<00:04:12.989> those

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
looks like it's going to be one of those

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.870 
looks like it's going to be one of those
things<00:04:13.350> that<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.680> definitely<00:04:13.980> cool<00:04:14.190> but<00:04:14.700> right

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
things that is definitely cool but right

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.159 
things that is definitely cool but right
there<00:04:15.060> we<00:04:15.239> actually<00:04:15.600> seen<00:04:15.780> him<00:04:15.930> with<00:04:16.049> his

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
there we actually seen him with his

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.110 
there we actually seen him with his
helmet<00:04:16.410> off<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:16.919> I<00:04:17.310> think<00:04:17.579> when<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:17.940> have

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
helmet off and I think when you have

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.849 
helmet off and I think when you have
your<00:04:18.239> helmet<00:04:18.600> on<00:04:18.660> it's<00:04:19.260> going<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.500> kind<00:04:19.680> of

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
your helmet on it's going to kind of

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.800 
your helmet on it's going to kind of
abstract<00:04:20.220> your<00:04:20.609> view<00:04:20.940> it's<00:04:21.419> going<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.630> be<00:04:21.690> one

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
abstract your view it's going to be one

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.089 
abstract your view it's going to be one
of<00:04:21.840> those<00:04:21.989> things<00:04:22.200> where<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.740> can't<00:04:22.950> really

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
of those things where you can't really

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.740 
of those things where you can't really
see<00:04:23.220> that<00:04:23.640> good<00:04:23.880> if<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.090> have<00:04:24.210> your<00:04:24.330> helmet<00:04:24.660> on

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
see that good if you have your helmet on

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.690 
see that good if you have your helmet on
and<00:04:24.960> that's<00:04:25.470> why<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.830> have<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.280> ability<00:04:26.669> to

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
and that's why you have the ability to

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.420 
and that's why you have the ability to
take<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.090> off

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
take it off

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.279 
take it off
because<00:04:27.970> if<00:04:28.090> it<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.240> like<00:04:28.630> that<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:29.050> can't

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
because if it is like that you can't

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.570 
because if it is like that you can't
really<00:04:29.350> see<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:29.889> well<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.250> it<00:04:30.310> kind<00:04:30.490> of

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
really see that well and it kind of

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.159 
really see that well and it kind of
abstract<00:04:30.789> your<00:04:31.150> view<00:04:31.389> then<00:04:31.570> people<00:04:32.110> are

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
abstract your view then people are

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.300 
abstract your view then people are
definitely<00:04:32.380> going<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.770> want<00:04:32.889> to<00:04:32.979> take<00:04:33.100> it<00:04:33.160> off

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
definitely going to want to take it off

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.159 
definitely going to want to take it off
when<00:04:33.520> they're<00:04:33.610> inside<00:04:34.030> as<00:04:34.330> opposed<00:04:34.930> when

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
when they're inside as opposed when

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.930 
when they're inside as opposed when
they're<00:04:35.289> floating<00:04:35.500> around<00:04:35.710> outside<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.580> I

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
they're floating around outside and I

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.060 
they're floating around outside and I
definitely<00:04:37.330> think<00:04:37.660> all<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.800> most

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
definitely think all of the most

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.800 
definitely think all of the most
important<00:04:39.610> things<00:04:39.789> are<00:04:39.970> going<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.240> be<00:04:40.360> outside

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
important things are going to be outside

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.379 
important things are going to be outside
a<00:04:41.229> lot<00:04:41.979> of<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.190> boxes<00:04:42.639> a<00:04:42.699> lot<00:04:42.910> of<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.120> perks

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
a lot of the boxes a lot of the perks

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.939 
a lot of the boxes a lot of the perks
because<00:04:43.900> if<00:04:44.050> they're<00:04:44.139> all<00:04:44.289> outside<00:04:44.530> that's

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
because if they're all outside that's

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.290 
because if they're all outside that's
going<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.250> force<00:04:45.550> people<00:04:45.759> to<00:04:45.940> go<00:04:46.090> out<00:04:46.120> there

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
going to force people to go out there

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.330 
going to force people to go out there
and<00:04:46.570> it<00:04:47.020> might<00:04:47.139> actually<00:04:47.320> be<00:04:47.560> harder<00:04:47.979> once

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
and it might actually be harder once

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.920 
and it might actually be harder once
you're<00:04:48.490> out<00:04:48.580> there<00:04:48.789> because<00:04:49.210> of<00:04:49.600> that<00:04:49.720> low

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
you're out there because of that low

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.900 
you're out there because of that low
gravity<00:04:50.229> who<00:04:50.860> knows<00:04:51.070> this<00:04:51.490> is<00:04:51.610> just<00:04:51.759> me

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
gravity who knows this is just me

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.790 
gravity who knows this is just me
speculating<00:04:52.570> but<00:04:52.930> right<00:04:53.110> here<00:04:53.350> we're<00:04:53.530> seeing

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
speculating but right here we're seeing

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.409 
speculating but right here we're seeing
a<00:04:53.889> lot<00:04:53.919> more<00:04:54.130> gameplay<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:54.880> this<00:04:54.970> all<00:04:55.150> looks

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
a lot more gameplay and this all looks

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.870 
a lot more gameplay and this all looks
just<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.229> epic<00:04:56.620> can't<00:04:57.100> wait<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.400> get<00:04:57.490> this<00:04:57.550> map

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
just so epic can't wait to get this map

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.640 
just so epic can't wait to get this map
pack<00:04:58.180> one<00:04:58.810> of<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:58.960> things<00:04:59.139> that<00:04:59.199> I<00:04:59.320> definitely

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
pack one of the things that I definitely

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.770 
pack one of the things that I definitely
like<00:04:59.860> to<00:04:59.979> see<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.430> the<00:05:00.820> ability<00:05:01.060> to<00:05:01.360> get<00:05:01.509> any

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
like to see is the ability to get any

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.020 
like to see is the ability to get any
wonder<00:05:02.320> weapon<00:05:02.620> from<00:05:02.770> any<00:05:03.009> previous<00:05:03.310> map<00:05:03.789> in

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
wonder weapon from any previous map in

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.110 
wonder weapon from any previous map in
the<00:05:04.090> box<00:05:04.750> i'm<00:05:05.050> talking<00:05:05.380> about<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.740> VR<00:05:06.520> 11<00:05:06.940> the

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
the box i'm talking about the VR 11 the

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.300 
the box i'm talking about the VR 11 the
scavenger<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.289> wonder<00:05:08.560> waffle<00:05:08.680> everything

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
scavenger the wonder waffle everything

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.950 
scavenger the wonder waffle everything
that<00:05:09.340> would<00:05:09.550> be<00:05:09.669> pretty<00:05:09.849> cool<00:05:10.000> highly<00:05:10.780> doubt

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
that would be pretty cool highly doubt

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.659 
that would be pretty cool highly doubt
they're<00:05:11.139> going<00:05:11.229> to<00:05:11.320> do<00:05:11.500> that<00:05:11.710> but<00:05:12.130> then<00:05:12.160> we<00:05:12.430> see

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
they're going to do that but then we see

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.580 
they're going to do that but then we see
the<00:05:12.849> electrifying<00:05:13.479> gun<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:13.810> little<00:05:14.020> bit<00:05:14.320> more

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
the electrifying gun a little bit more

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.560 
the electrifying gun a little bit more
and<00:05:14.949> now<00:05:15.460> right<00:05:15.639> here<00:05:15.789> we're<00:05:15.970> seeing<00:05:16.180> some<00:05:16.389> old

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
and now right here we're seeing some old

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.659 
and now right here we're seeing some old
maps<00:05:16.870> definitely<00:05:17.770> can't<00:05:17.949> get<00:05:18.130> wait<00:05:18.340> to<00:05:18.490> play

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
maps definitely can't get wait to play

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.610 
maps definitely can't get wait to play
these<00:05:18.849> as<00:05:19.060> well<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.539> don't<00:05:20.229> know<00:05:20.380> about<00:05:20.440> you

prestige or hardened edition so I did

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.450 
prestige or hardened edition so I did
not<00:05:25.479> get<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.720> play<00:05:25.900> these<00:05:26.110> right<00:05:27.070> there<00:05:27.250> if<00:05:27.370> you

not get to play these right there if you

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.980 
not get to play these right there if you
