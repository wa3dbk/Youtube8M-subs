we have not always been food insecure I

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
we have not always been food insecure I
think<00:00:42.570> what<00:00:42.720> has<00:00:42.930> happened<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.560> that<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.890> have

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
think what has happened is that we have

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.930 
think what has happened is that we have
not<00:00:44.220> kept<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.200> wire<00:00:46.590> events<00:00:47.280> with

not kept up with the wire events with

not kept up with the wire events with
the<00:00:48.090> technologies<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.230> don't<00:00:50.040> know<00:00:50.190> any

country which is developed without using

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.290 
country which is developed without using
science<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:55.500> technology<00:00:56.310> and<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.880> I<00:00:56.910> believe

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
science and technology and so I believe

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.620 
science and technology and so I believe
that<00:00:57.540> it<00:00:58.470> is<00:00:58.530> incumbent<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.760> our<00:00:59.940> governments

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630 
that it is incumbent on our governments

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.960 
that it is incumbent on our governments
and<00:01:00.900> on<00:01:01.320> our<00:01:01.470> scientists<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.550> bring<00:01:02.790> a

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:02.970 
and on our scientists to bring a

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.169 
and on our scientists to bring a
technology<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:03.810> can<00:01:04.079> address<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:05.179 
technology which can address a

small-scale former they need different

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.249 
small-scale former they need different
kinds<00:01:08.039> of<00:01:08.310> information<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.780> believe<00:01:10.229> that

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:10.259 
kinds of information and I believe that

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.830 
kinds of information and I believe that
tear<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.009> science<00:01:11.460> has<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:12.270> come<00:01:12.509> up<00:01:12.659> with

tear the science has now come up with

tear the science has now come up with
this<00:01:12.960> technology<00:01:13.490> biotechnology<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:15.060> not

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
this technology biotechnology I'm not

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.529 
this technology biotechnology I'm not
saying<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.139> going<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.499> be<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> magic<00:01:17.189> bullet<00:01:17.549> but

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
saying is going to be a magic bullet but

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.569 
saying is going to be a magic bullet but
surely<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.350> should<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> major

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
surely it should be one of the major

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.270 
surely it should be one of the major
