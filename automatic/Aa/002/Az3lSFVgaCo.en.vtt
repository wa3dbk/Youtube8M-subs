00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
hydrated and as a result your true curl

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.380 
hydrated and as a result your true curl
pattern<00:01:40.259> or<00:01:40.470> coil<00:01:40.890> pattern<00:01:41.250> reaches<00:01:42.210> its

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
pattern or coil pattern reaches its

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.530 
pattern or coil pattern reaches its
maximum<00:01:42.840> potential<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.270> always

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
maximum potential and it is always

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.260 
maximum potential and it is always
present<00:01:46.049> whether<00:01:46.439> your<00:01:46.649> hair<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:47.189> wet<00:01:47.610> or<00:01:47.820> dry
