00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
death and drawing the same amount my

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.390 
death and drawing the same amount my
opponent<00:02:20.469> has<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.590> be<00:02:20.799> stunned<00:02:21.099> ashore

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
opponent has to be stunned ashore

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.209 
opponent has to be stunned ashore
because<00:02:21.700> he's<00:02:22.239> playing<00:02:22.540> chamber<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.530> have<00:02:23.709> five

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
because he's playing chamber I have five

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.800 
because he's playing chamber I have five
monsters<00:02:24.730> on<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:24.879> field<00:02:24.939> so<00:02:25.510> that's<00:02:25.659> two

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
monsters on the field so that's two

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.839 
monsters on the field so that's two
thousand<00:02:26.140> damage<00:02:26.469> I<00:02:26.620> would<00:02:26.799> take<00:02:27.040> but<00:02:27.640> guess

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
thousand damage I would take but guess

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.330 
thousand damage I would take but guess
what<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.420> activate<00:02:29.170> mystical<00:02:29.349> wreck<00:02:29.799> panel

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
what I activate mystical wreck panel

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.569 
what I activate mystical wreck panel
he'd<00:02:30.549> take<00:02:30.760> 2,000<00:02:31.329> damage<00:02:31.689> instead<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:33.370> how

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
he'd take 2,000 damage instead so how

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.089 
he'd take 2,000 damage instead so how
would<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.879> use<00:02:34.049> mystical<00:02:35.049> relic<00:02:35.260> panel<00:02:35.739> leave

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099
