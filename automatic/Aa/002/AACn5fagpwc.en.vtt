00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
was looking quite white except she had

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.800 
was looking quite white except she had
good<00:01:25.619> big<00:01:26.340> lips<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.090> when<00:01:27.479> she<00:01:27.659> was<00:01:27.780> about

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
good big lips and when she was about

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.050 
good big lips and when she was about
nine<00:01:28.049> years<00:01:28.290> old<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.009> mother<00:01:29.250> cut<00:01:29.640> her<00:01:29.850> hair

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
nine years old a mother cut her hair

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.929 
nine years old a mother cut her hair
short<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.460> before<00:01:32.460> her<00:01:32.579> hair<00:01:32.790> was

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
short like here and before her hair was

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.200 
short like here and before her hair was
like<00:01:33.150> straight<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.110> shiny<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.310> pretty<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
like straight and shiny and pretty and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
like straight and shiny and pretty and
sister<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.960> never<00:01:37.200> grew<00:01:37.409> back<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.009> was

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
sister it never grew back as it was

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.870 
sister it never grew back as it was
before<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:39.030> grew<00:01:39.180> back<00:01:39.329> frizzy<00:01:39.840> frizzy<00:01:40.259> curly

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
before it grew back frizzy frizzy curly

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.350 
before it grew back frizzy frizzy curly
not<00:01:41.880> pretty

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
not pretty

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.899 
not pretty
until<00:01:42.869> now<00:01:43.380> she<00:01:43.409> has<00:01:43.890> trouble<00:01:44.369> with<00:01:44.490> her<00:01:44.670> hair

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
until now she has trouble with her hair

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.660 
until now she has trouble with her hair
so<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.869> proof<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:47.009> my<00:01:47.159> father<00:01:47.399> say

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so this is proof that what my father say

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.539 
so this is proof that what my father say
it<00:01:47.729> works<00:01:48.090> because<00:01:48.360> there's<00:01:48.689> no<00:01:48.810> other<00:01:49.549> reason

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it works because there's no other reason

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.969 
it works because there's no other reason
why<00:01:50.579> her<00:01:51.390> hair<00:01:51.570> would<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.930> suddenly<00:01:52.140> turn

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
why her hair would have suddenly turn

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.580 
why her hair would have suddenly turn
like<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.939> never<00:01:54.240> cut<00:01:54.689> my<00:01:55.140> hair<00:01:55.380> short

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
like this so I never cut my hair short

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.100 
like this so I never cut my hair short
the<00:01:56.280> only<00:01:56.579> thing<00:01:56.700> I've<00:01:56.850> done<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.329> my<00:01:57.479> hair<00:01:57.659> it's

the only thing I've done to my hair it's

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.880 
the only thing I've done to my hair it's
my<00:01:58.320> hair<00:01:58.560> ever<00:01:58.860> was<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.729> get<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.560> hands<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.740> my

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
kids mixed babies and kids because I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.370 
kids mixed babies and kids because I
guess<00:02:41.910> when<00:02:42.120> you<00:02:42.240> were<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.390> bit<00:02:42.630> old<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.170> too

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
guess when you were a bit old it's too

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.500 
guess when you were a bit old it's too
late<00:02:43.590> when<00:02:43.920> you're<00:02:44.070> like<00:02:44.190> 15<00:02:44.730> or<00:02:45.030> 20<00:02:45.480> or

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
late when you're like 15 or 20 or

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.180 
late when you're like 15 or 20 or
something<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.020> too<00:02:46.140> late<00:02:46.320> because<00:02:46.500> your

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
something it's too late because your

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.250 
something it's too late because your
parents<00:02:47.370> already<00:02:47.640> cut<00:02:48.000> your<00:02:48.210> hair<00:02:48.390> or<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.020> did

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
parents already cut your hair or you did

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.560 
parents already cut your hair or you did
yourself<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.490> guess<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:50.880> too<00:02:51.030> late<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:51.360> if

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
yourself so I guess it's too late but if

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.320 
yourself so I guess it's too late but if
parents<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.290> mixed<00:02:52.770> babies<00:02:53.190> watch<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.060> video
