of those items which i think is really
undervalued<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.840> industry<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:14.160> know

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
undervalued in the industry and you know

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
a top opening enclosure I really like to

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.269 
a top opening enclosure I really like to
like<00:00:21.119> recommend<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.869> product<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.650> reason

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
like recommend this product the reason

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.570 
like recommend this product the reason
why<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.580> because<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:25.170> holds<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.859> brooder<00:00:26.310> or

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
why is because it holds the brooder or

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.460 
why is because it holds the brooder or
whatever<00:00:27.420> kind<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.720> dome<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.109> you're<00:00:28.260> using

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
whatever kind of dome that you're using

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.700 
whatever kind of dome that you're using
off<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.580> top<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.150> therefore<00:00:30.929> since<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
off of the top and therefore since you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.639 
off of the top and therefore since you
can't<00:00:32.040> get<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.550> through<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.750> front<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.350> get<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
can't get in through the front to get to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.870 
can't get in through the front to get to
your<00:00:34.739> reptile<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.250> got<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.520> get<00:00:35.610> through<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
your reptile you got to get through the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.430 
your reptile you got to get through the
top<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.300> then<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.690> if<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
top and then you like if you have the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.740 
top and then you like if you have the
dome<00:00:37.680> on<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.920> top<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:39.000> do<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
dome on the top what do you do with it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.660 
dome on the top what do you do with it
you<00:00:39.840> know<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.260> average<00:00:40.410> bulb<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.100> 300

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
you know the average bulb is like 300

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.400 
you know the average bulb is like 300
degrees<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> surface<00:00:42.629> temperature<00:00:43.020> so

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
degrees in the surface temperature so

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.020 
degrees in the surface temperature so
what<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.980> can't<00:00:44.190> put<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.489> carpet<00:00:44.789> you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
what you can't put it on carpet you

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.360 
what you can't put it on carpet you
can't<00:00:45.420> really<00:00:45.840> move<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.829> things<00:00:47.039> until

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
can't really move it on to things until

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.840 
can't really move it on to things until
it<00:00:47.430> gets<00:00:47.730> cooler<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.530> allows<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
it gets cooler so this allows you to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.709 
it gets cooler so this allows you to
basically<00:00:51.059> have<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> dome<00:00:52.260> off<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.309> then<00:00:53.719> you

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
basically have the dome off and then you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.240 
basically have the dome off and then you
just<00:00:55.079> simply<00:00:55.289> take<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.829> off<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.129> don't

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
just simply take it off and you don't

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.830 
just simply take it off and you don't
have<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.610> worry<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.300> guess<00:00:57.570> what

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
have to worry about it and guess what

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.970 
have to worry about it and guess what
then<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.980> simply<00:00:59.840> take<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.440> it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
then you can simply take this and it

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.579 
then you can simply take this and it
actually<00:01:02.160> swings<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.140> swing<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.379> out

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
actually swings out you can swing it out

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.260 
actually swings out you can swing it out
of<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:04.799> way<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.280> then<00:01:05.549> work<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.060> whatever

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
of your way and then work with whatever

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.390 
of your way and then work with whatever
you<00:01:06.570> want<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> work<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> also<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you want to work with but the also the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.120 
you want to work with but the also the
other<00:01:08.549> great<00:01:08.850> thing<00:01:09.060> about<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.890> is<00:01:10.890> it's

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
other great thing about this is it's

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.539 
other great thing about this is it's
completely<00:01:11.909> adjustable<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.189> swing

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
completely adjustable so you can swing

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.570 
completely adjustable so you can swing
this<00:01:15.450> let's<00:01:16.229> say<00:01:16.409> your<00:01:16.560> temperatures<00:01:17.159> too<00:01:17.369> hot

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
this let's say your temperatures too hot

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.600 
this let's say your temperatures too hot
or<00:01:18.330> let's<00:01:18.689> say<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.650> want<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:19.920> mercury<00:01:20.340> vapor

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
or let's say you want your mercury vapor

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
or let's say you want your mercury vapor
bowl<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> little<00:01:21.630> further<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
bowl to be a little further I have to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.640 
bowl to be a little further I have to
unhook<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.950> oops<00:01:23.729> but<00:01:24.299> anyway<00:01:24.689> let's<00:01:25.470> say

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
you're determining heat when you're

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.030 
you're determining heat when you're
determining<00:01:45.390> how<00:01:45.540> much<00:01:45.659> UV<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.290> want<00:01:46.530> it's

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
determining how much UV you want it's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.069 
determining how much UV you want it's
just<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.310> great<00:01:47.729> item<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.720> other<00:01:48.869> thing
