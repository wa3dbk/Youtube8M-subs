00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
this right here is the basic you know

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.689 
this right here is the basic you know
freezer<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:14.450> you<00:00:15.450> know<00:00:15.599> slash<00:00:16.400> cooler<00:00:17.400> that

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
freezer and you know slash cooler that

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.179 
freezer and you know slash cooler that
does<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.240> D<00:00:18.420> properties<00:00:18.840> you'd<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.189> think

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
does have D properties you'd like think

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.210 
does have D properties you'd like think
about<00:00:20.220> never<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.910> include<00:00:21.859> they<00:00:22.859> don't<00:00:23.070> have

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
about never to include they don't have

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.330 
about never to include they don't have
fan<00:00:23.550> terminators<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.260> don't<00:00:25.980> know<00:00:26.099> how<00:00:26.279> to

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
fan terminators and I don't know how to

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.519 
fan terminators and I don't know how to
prepare<00:00:26.699> terminating<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.269> fan<00:00:27.449> runs<00:00:27.720> theory

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
prepare terminating the fan runs theory

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.959 
prepare terminating the fan runs theory

of refrigeration on the control side of
the<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:34.070> firstly<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.160> power<00:00:36.230> okay

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.650 

suppressor<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.640> mean<00:00:41.790> though<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.450> could

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
suppressor on I mean though they could

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.760 
suppressor on I mean though they could
solenoid<00:00:43.520> do<00:00:44.520> which<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.090> turn<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.770> rest

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
solenoid do which you turn that on rest

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.180 
solenoid do which you turn that on rest
of<00:00:46.890> me<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.660> think<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.780> saw<00:00:48.960> an<00:00:49.110> oil<00:00:49.260> opens<00:00:49.649> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
of me I think I saw an oil opens and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.920 
of me I think I saw an oil opens and
then<00:00:50.730> low<00:00:51.570> pressure<00:00:51.899> switch<00:00:52.460> go<00:00:53.460> closes<00:00:54.420> cuz

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
then low pressure switch go closes cuz

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.500 
then low pressure switch go closes cuz
turns<00:00:55.739> compress<00:00:56.219> wrong<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.239> start

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
turns compress wrong and then you start

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.319 
turns compress wrong and then you start
freezing<00:00:58.039> okay<00:00:59.039> once<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.430> start<00:00:59.730> freezing<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
freezing okay once you start freezing a

the<00:01:35.830> clients<00:01:36.520> all<00:01:36.700> know<00:01:36.940> it<00:01:37.350> shuts<00:01:38.350> off<00:01:38.940> and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
the clients all know it shuts off and

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:40.770

our fans
oh<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.670> then<00:01:42.850> I<00:01:43.030> heat<00:01:43.300> or<00:01:43.450> something<00:01:44.970> okay<00:01:46.259> now

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
oh and then I heat or something okay now

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.700 
oh and then I heat or something okay now
there's<00:01:47.530> defrosted<00:01:48.660> all<00:01:49.660> right<00:01:49.810> then<00:01:50.229> he<00:01:50.440> gets

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
there's defrosted all right then he gets

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.420 
there's defrosted all right then he gets
sold<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.910> then<00:01:52.180> you<00:01:53.110> have<00:01:53.320> a<00:01:53.350> time<00:01:53.800> that's<00:01:54.310> a

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
sold and then you have a time that's a

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.070 
sold and then you have a time that's a
good<00:01:54.610> thing<00:01:54.850> about<00:01:55.000> these<00:01:55.300> times<00:01:55.630> right<00:01:55.900> here

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
good thing about these times right here

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.680 
good thing about these times right here
you<00:01:56.259> can<00:01:56.410> say<00:01:56.590> look<00:01:56.770> 45<00:01:57.250> months<00:01:57.759> and<00:01:59.580> but<00:02:00.690> see

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
you can say look 45 months and but see

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.469 
you can say look 45 months and but see
back<00:02:01.899> Bank<00:02:02.170> is<00:02:02.380> hot<00:02:02.680> too<00:02:03.340> hot<00:02:03.550> for<00:02:03.880> being<00:02:04.119> 45

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
back Bank is hot too hot for being 45

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.320 
back Bank is hot too hot for being 45
for<00:02:04.990> for<00:02:05.170> 45<00:02:05.680> minutes<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.670> have<00:02:06.789> a<00:02:06.880> defrost

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
for for 45 minutes you have a defrost

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.160 
for for 45 minutes you have a defrost
Terminator<00:02:07.930> which<00:02:08.739> will<00:02:09.300> once<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.509> energize

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
Terminator which will once you energize

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.240 
Terminator which will once you energize
this<00:02:11.530> it<00:02:12.430> will<00:02:12.610> go<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.120> your<00:02:13.570> ex<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.920> your

this it will go to your ex on your

this it will go to your ex on your
default<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.910> which<00:02:16.209> you<00:02:16.330> had<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.510> kick<00:02:16.840> out<00:02:17.020> so

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
default on which you had a kick out so

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.070 
default on which you had a kick out so
nobody<00:02:17.560> teaches<00:02:18.010> ID<00:02:18.550> pro<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.570> custom

compression<00:02:20.560> back<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.840> therefore<00:02:23.760> and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
compression back on so therefore and

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.440 
compression back on so therefore and
this<00:02:24.970> my<00:02:25.720> theory<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.500> terminator

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
this my theory that terminator

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.420 
this my theory that terminator
the<00:02:28.450> call<00:02:28.959> has<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.320> be<00:02:29.560> pretty<00:02:29.830> much<00:02:29.890> clear

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
the call has to be pretty much clear

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.759 
the call has to be pretty much clear
before<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.060> term<00:02:31.239> Roger<00:02:31.510> come<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:32.049> and<00:02:32.500> can't

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
before that term Roger come on and can't

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.140 
before that term Roger come on and can't
get<00:02:32.860> out<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.220> therefore<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.730> even<00:02:33.940> set<00:02:34.120> that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
get out so therefore you even set that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.710 
get out so therefore you even set that
timer<00:02:34.540> two<00:02:35.500> hours<00:02:35.920> if<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.190> wanted<00:02:36.570> but<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.600> was

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
timer two hours if you wanted but I was

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.650 
timer two hours if you wanted but I was
said<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.200> them<00:02:38.380> no<00:02:38.739> more<00:02:38.950> no<00:02:39.280> less<00:02:39.310> than<00:02:39.790> 35<00:02:40.209> to

said to them no more no less than 35 to

40 minutes out

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.920 
40 minutes out
you<00:02:42.040> know<00:02:42.160> never<00:02:42.370> would<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.450> right<00:02:43.660> here

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
you know never would and this right here

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.810
