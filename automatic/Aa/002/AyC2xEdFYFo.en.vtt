00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
phone to charge overnight which is also

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.240

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.940 
well if you've got anything else to
charge<00:04:36.419> then<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.840> guess<00:04:37.020> it's<00:04:37.229> going<00:04:37.380> over<00:04:37.740> here

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950
