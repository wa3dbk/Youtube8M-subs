00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.939
 Y 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.920
 and 600 games is 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.410
 a historical aspect are many parties 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.910
 they are many seasons and very happy 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.920
 get here there are not many people 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.480
 that I can say this and set aside in it 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.360
 in my club forever 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.660
 stay with a difficult game I have 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.460
 I was lucky to have many matches 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.530
 What are the titles of leagues? 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.239
 maybe I already said at the time then the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.890
 match against madrid here at home that 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.710
 I did forty-odd devaluation or 41 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.090
 I also remember one in Galicia the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.820
 last basket with a hook 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.040
 left and also a pretty value 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.130
 good luck and there are many too 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.439
 there are others that have not come out 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.439
 everything is fine but everything is learned 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.060
 reach 600 and get to the track of 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.790
 madrid to win is ideally that without a doubt 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.650
 It is always a classic always people 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.560
 she is super motivated 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.650
 both on the team and they as the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.120
 environment and it would be 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.950
 very nice 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.850
 good that this noise and for them is a 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.729
 low important that no doubt but he 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.920
 the madrid team is very broad today and 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.799
 will have solutions I do not know if finally 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.250
 will play or not 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.960
 but wish him a speedy recovery 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.120
 the steals of the ball the losses of 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.040
 balls I think are important 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.830
 against a team that takes advantage of them 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.290
 well and it goes very well to counterattack 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.810
 I get to the game 1000 does not make it 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.690
 nobody sure that what I 'm 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.670
 completely sure that 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.770
 and this is not going to be my last season and 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.000
 I'm going to add more I've had bad 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.370
 luck especially this year I lost 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.370
 Endesa League matches 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.420
 but we're working for 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.240
 keep this line that came the truth 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.280
 that ivory has been a good month for me 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.730
 after the problems that have gone and 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.730
 to continue like this
