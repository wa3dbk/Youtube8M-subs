00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.799
 Hello, how are you doing? 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.280
 I am going to teach today in a very simple way 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:14.740
 how can you make a led lights for 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.960
 your car and replace them by 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.580
 that brings from home that they consume more and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.280
 they light up less by then as you see 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.260
 I made an insert with six lady 6 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.789
 resistance is worth to look at the color 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.300
 because now we're going to explain how 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:33.730
 teach it very fast very easy and how 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.199
 how it works, it's worth a lot of people 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.730
 he says is that they never explain things 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.980
 Well, today we are going to explain it 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.510
 and as you can see it would be that way 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.690
 connected to the contacts of our 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.140
 dessert 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.969
 let's see how it works 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.730
 idea would be this insert which 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.070
 we would have already used in several videos and 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.960
 as you see then from the back 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.579
 question the little squares that or 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.519
 well we can join 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.430
 in this way it is worth saying that welding in 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.979
 the end and in another and that this piece 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.520
 patita because of resistance ladero 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.530
 or of cable then make union is worth or 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.770
 we can join little squares with the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.649
 welder so that in the end then 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.690
 let's make a cable equally worth it is already 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.960
 in the type of insert used 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.750
 to design the insert that I have 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.670
 used for my car is worth in this case 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.030
 I have put the blue ones and now we are going to 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.880
 explain 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.930
 very simple very easy because how is it done 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.000
 the whole process 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.860
 good and let's move on to see a bit then 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.500
 how would the design of the circuit be worth 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.020
 I am simulated here, what would be the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.420
 12 volt car battery is worth one 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.030
 pile of nine and one and a half is worth 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.830
 it would be eleven and a half a switch and 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.080
 our circuit of LEDs that good each 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.710
 one can put the ones you want worth 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.600
 then we will do 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.460
 as quickly as would be the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.640
 real circuit that we can 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.340
 design very easily so then 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.010
 put it in your plate to weld them and 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.200
 to be able to make light, then we have 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.450
 11 volts and a half here the switch 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.340
 symbolizes symbolizes then the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.780
 switch that the car has for 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.430
 turn off and turn on the light 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.250
 it's good then when we see the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.470
 car switch automatically it 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.750
 turn on the LEDs as you see each one 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.700
 It has an associated resistance and everything goes 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.090
 connected in parallel in such a way 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.310
 that if this iodine then melts the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.340
 others are still working worth then 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.660
 well let's see what it would be like 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.370
 circuit is worth more schematic 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.050
 to put it some way then 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.830
 we would have our source here 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.269
 that would be 12 volts and then 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.209
 we would have a resistance that would be 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.970
 470 ummnium is worth approximately each 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.030
 depending on the color of the diodes that 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.880
 use 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.370
 and will put them in another's value what 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.930
 I will leave here below in the description for 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.110
 that you can see it good I for example 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.300
 I'm going to take out LED diodes, red 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.920
 ok and what I'm going to do is copy and 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.920
 hit as many times as 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.040
 diodes leds because I have in my circuit 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.690
 that I showed you earlier that in 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.550
 my case is 6 but well I tell you 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.960
 you can put the ones you want 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.470
 ok I 'm going to make a scheme 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.480
 How have I mounted my circuit 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.220
 initially worth then then here would go the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.330
 switch that would be the switch of the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.560
 car and well then let's go joining 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.240
 the circuit so that as is left by 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.220
 true this little program is called 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.200
 crocodiles clips okay I'm going to leave 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.020
 here a link so you can see 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.810
 two or three tutorials that went up to 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:52.130
 channel then how to how to install it 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.540
 it's very very light weight a mega or so and 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.610
 it is very good for us to try 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.590
 small circuits because like this one 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.080
 So then, as you can see, all the 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.120
 diodes in parallel so that if any 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.890
 stops working, the 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.110
 others and we always have light in our 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.200
 car this would symbolize the battery of 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.330
 car that are always 12 volts worth and 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.890
 the switch then of the lights of the 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.200
 car when we turn on the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.570
 switch because we already have our 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.609
 LEDs working in such a way that if 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.709
 it breaks or a resistance is 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.750
 burning for example is therefore others 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.420
 as you see, they are still working 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.950
 and good for you to see what voltage and 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.730
 well here in our idol we can 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.010
 connect a voltmeter is worth and here 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.880
 we are measuring then what voltage we 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:41.430
 is falling in our in this case 192 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.630
 volts good because both are made 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.190
 to drop a voltage between 2 and 4 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.860
 volts depending on the color of the 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.620
 atlantic all all resistances 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.050
 In this case, I use one of 470 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.730
 because my leds are blue but good 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.580
 us depending on if you put them 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.040
 white or red or yellow greens 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.890
 color you want, then you should place 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.990
 one resistance or another so that the 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.840
 voltage that falls on the knet be the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.050
 convenient and we do not run out melting 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.659
 The led 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.599
 and well , here we have the resistances 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:18.129
 depending on the type of led we want 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.039
 use of color 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.500
 if we want to use amber red colors or 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:26.319
 orange so we can use a 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.270
 510 om resistance is worth the 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:31.120
 recommended and this is the green brown 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.639
 brown instead if we want to use leds 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.860
 blue green whites as in my case 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.280
 ultraviolet roses is worth then we will use 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:43.150
 resistance 470 ohms or so 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.440
 it's the same yellow lilac and brown like that 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.819
 is that nothing I hope you liked 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.039
 much the video remember that it is very 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.229
 simple to do the circuit and you can 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.030
 try it on all cars and also 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.000
 that these student lights more than those that 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:01.330
 they come from home in cars worth 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.639
 then they will save more battery and 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.590
 they'll also light up more, so 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.840
 nothing I hope you liked it a lot 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.870
 forget us about the little hand above 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.360
 support the video to share it and nothing 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.650
 Merry Christmas to all I hope to see you 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.139
 next year with more desire 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.000
 and that we enjoy all of the videos and 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.490
 let us learn and follow 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.800
 advancing in this interesting world 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.250
 how is the electronics a greeting 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.250
 see you
