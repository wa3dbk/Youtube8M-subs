thing's<00:00:35.550> probably<00:00:35.700> gonna<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.149> modular

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
thing's probably gonna be modular

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.600 
thing's probably gonna be modular
probably<00:00:37.230> semi<00:00:37.590> modular<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> last<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.579> saw

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
probably semi modular the last one I saw

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.670 
probably semi modular the last one I saw
was<00:00:38.940> semi<00:00:39.270> modular<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.050> only<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.530> them

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
was semi modular but I only like them

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.020 
was semi modular but I only like them
that<00:00:40.829> way<00:00:40.860> anyways<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:41.790> fully

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
that way anyways I don't like fully

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.549 
that way anyways I don't like fully
modular<00:00:42.210> because<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> power<00:00:43.140> connection

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
modular because the power connection

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.010 
modular because the power connection
should<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.489> anyways<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.510> don't<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:45.989> a

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
should be so anyways I don't have a

might be interested in this now in the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.149 
might be interested in this now in the
back<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> box<00:01:39.409> they<00:01:40.409> show<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.009> most

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
back of the box they show the most

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.830 
back of the box they show the most
advanced<00:01:41.640> technology<00:01:42.180> being<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> power

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
advanced technology being that the power

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
advanced technology being that the power
supply<00:01:42.960> runs<00:01:43.380> very<00:01:43.619> cool<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.070> very<00:01:44.130> quiet

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
supply runs very cool and very quiet

supply runs very cool and very quiet
with<00:01:44.610> their<00:01:44.759> vortex<00:01:45.240> technology<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.829> guys

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
with their vortex technology so you guys

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.440 
with their vortex technology so you guys
can<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.610> right<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> back

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
this box actually weighs quite a bit so

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
this box actually weighs quite a bit so
I'm<00:01:54.210> gonna<00:01:54.329> go<00:01:54.509> ahead<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.720> start<00:01:54.960> unboxing<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
I'm gonna go ahead and start unboxing it

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.569

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.550 
out here it's kind of interesting type
of<00:03:28.670> unboxing<00:03:29.120> out<00:03:29.270> here<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.450> usually<00:03:29.810> sit<00:03:30.380> down

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
of unboxing out here I usually sit down

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.660 
of unboxing out here I usually sit down
but<00:03:30.800> I<00:03:30.830> didn't<00:03:31.070> feel<00:03:31.160> like<00:03:31.280> doing<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.460> today

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
different means unusual and harder

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.480 
different means unusual and harder

don't have bollocks I do like to have
the<00:05:07.719> option<00:05:07.840> of<00:05:08.080> molex<00:05:08.439> because<00:05:09.159> sometimes

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
the option of molex because sometimes

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.110 
the option of molex because sometimes
you<00:05:09.639> need<00:05:09.759> them

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120

got that let me actually get out next
part<00:05:16.090> of<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.210> power<00:05:16.330> supply<00:05:18.930> by<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:20.050> way

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
part of the power supply by the way

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.019 
part of the power supply by the way
here's<00:05:20.349> the<00:05:20.469> giant<00:05:21.069> power<00:05:21.219> plug<00:05:21.520> as<00:05:21.669> well<00:05:21.819> in

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.029 
here's the giant power plug as well in

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:23.850 
here's the giant power plug as well in
case<00:05:22.060> you're<00:05:22.360> interested<00:05:22.449> in<00:05:22.749> than<00:05:23.680> their

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
case you're interested in than their

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.790 
case you're interested in than their
power<00:05:24.219> plug<00:05:24.460> so<00:05:25.169> here's<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.319> power<00:05:26.499> supply

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
power plug so here's the power supply

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.559 
power plug so here's the power supply
itself<00:05:27.189> and<00:05:27.580> as<00:05:27.729> you<00:05:27.849> can<00:05:27.999> see<00:05:28.150> it's<00:05:28.270> semi

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
itself and as you can see it's semi

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.329 
itself and as you can see it's semi
modular<00:05:29.020> all<00:05:29.259> the<00:05:29.620> power<00:05:29.770> cables<00:05:30.219> are

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:30.339 
modular all the power cables are

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:32.129 
modular all the power cables are
connected<00:05:30.430> I<00:05:30.939> think<00:05:31.569> this<00:05:31.719> is<00:05:31.839> the<00:05:31.930> best

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
connected I think this is the best

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.589 
connected I think this is the best
design<00:05:32.499> some<00:05:32.949> people<00:05:33.189> disagree<00:05:33.370> but<00:05:34.029> I<00:05:34.210> don't

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
design some people disagree but I don't

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.929 
design some people disagree but I don't
I<00:05:34.749> think<00:05:35.050> this<00:05:35.139> is<00:05:35.259> the<00:05:35.319> best<00:05:35.469> so<00:05:35.759> let<00:05:36.759> me<00:05:36.819> go

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:36.939 
I think this is the best so let me go

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:43.709 
I think this is the best so let me go
ahead<00:05:37.029> and<00:05:37.210> take<00:05:37.330> this<00:05:37.419> out<00:05:37.629> here<00:05:42.449> this<00:05:43.449> power

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
ahead and take this out here this power

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.230 
ahead and take this out here this power
supply<00:05:44.110> by<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:44.589> way<00:05:44.800> weighs<00:05:45.159> a<00:05:45.189> freaking<00:05:45.789> ton

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
supply by the way weighs a freaking ton

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.809 
supply by the way weighs a freaking ton
so<00:05:46.689> let's<00:05:46.810> check<00:05:46.990> it<00:05:47.020> out<00:05:47.229> I<00:05:47.699> know<00:05:48.699> if<00:05:48.759> the

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:48.819 
so let's check it out I know if the
