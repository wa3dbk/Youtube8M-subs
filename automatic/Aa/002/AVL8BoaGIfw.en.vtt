00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
of game and it's really for us a big

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.969 
of game and it's really for us a big
evolutionary<00:01:18.520> leap<00:01:18.820> in<00:01:19.479> terms<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:20.110> scope<00:01:20.680> and

evolutionary leap in terms of scope and
depth<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.060> content<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:23.440> big<00:01:23.680> change<00:01:24.070> is<00:01:24.369> that

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
depth and content the big change is that

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.540 
depth and content the big change is that
we<00:01:24.670> have<00:01:24.759> made<00:01:25.060> it<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.600> server-based<00:01:26.290> game<00:01:26.770> so

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550

we release dough to a battle Shogun a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.270 
we release dough to a battle Shogun a
couple<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.030> years<00:02:14.180> ago<00:02:14.560> there<00:02:15.560> were<00:02:15.650> about<00:02:15.680> six

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
couple of years ago there were about six

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.430 
couple of years ago there were about six
people<00:02:16.490> who<00:02:16.760> were<00:02:16.850> then<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.390> we<00:02:17.840> are<00:02:17.990> 20

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
people who were then and we are 20

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.410 
people who were then and we are 20
people<00:02:18.710> now<00:02:18.860> it<00:02:19.190> means<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.490> we<00:02:19.700> can<00:02:19.850> focus<00:02:20.120> on

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
people now it means that we can focus on

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.990 
people now it means that we can focus on
making<00:02:20.570> them<00:02:20.870> bigger<00:02:21.230> richer<00:02:21.740> deeper<00:02:22.610> game

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
making them bigger richer deeper game

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.060 
making them bigger richer deeper game
with<00:02:23.360> more<00:02:23.570> gameplay<00:02:23.990> which<00:02:24.620> i<00:02:24.770> think<00:02:24.830> is

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
with more gameplay which i think is

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
with more gameplay which i think is
something<00:02:25.280> that's<00:02:25.430> missing<00:02:25.910> from

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
something that's missing from

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.020 
something that's missing from

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
deeper than Shogun was it's a bigger

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.240 
deeper than Shogun was it's a bigger
