00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.189
 sir thomas he on what for 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.610
 remote control it's she stopped this 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.080
 week 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.759
 this week double punishment because 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.769
 I had to watch two shows when 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.820
 even two shows that make each night 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.080
 the pitch is normal between two 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.359
 emissions that make a real cardboard 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.410
 in young people aged 15 to 25 I know 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.240
 not if you have you and children 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.090
 I have children and listeners on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.740
 this age this provides the cia there is 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.869
 good chances they are watching these 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.369
 programs and in particular the Marseilles 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.369
 in miami it's on w9 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.880
 miami it's the related pop 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.739
 no no and he prefers to look at line of 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.690
 truths that is on nrj12 not who I 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.350
 want when I want where I want 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.260
 hatred must not remain a zaki symbol 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.000
 center or not yeah but but nobody 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.350
 do not say but do not you have to 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.060
 born with this not a girl who 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.979
 crying and sensuality of models thing 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.300
 like the eros I go to whoever I want 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.300
 when you are why you cries actually 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.770
 in any case it 's docu-reality are 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.990
 in frontal competition every night in 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.090
 access on these two chains we are in 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.000
 programs totally tailored to 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.680
 the teens are young people who are a 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.840
 crazy in their heads that make the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.180
 party every day they sleep 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.130
 together evening eventually that's it and 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.130
 all in places that make you dream 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.509
 the young tahiti on a miami side of 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.740
 the other then more miami 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.479
 obviously it allows 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.619
 young people to practice English and that 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.330
 it's important for a program and a 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.520
 leg of a fair price go to school 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.180
 it's important it would not be cool 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.180
 to have a camera 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:05.600
 look at it at the m 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:07.670
 cool did not warn but the other 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.840
 common point between these two emissions to 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.220
 it is that they are young people who have 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.200
 spent a lot more time at the med club 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.450
 gym that at school was going first and 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.400
 be careful the end not both sides we have 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.950
 added a goal to all that is not 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.020
 only obviously useful for the island 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.510
 truths about nrj 12 the goal is 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.120
 humanitarian so good since these young 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.880
 did not come to Tahiti only 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.420
 to seduce no between two pina colada 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.550
 they will build a school for them 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.560
 young people for the children of tahiti 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.240
 for that they will raise funds by 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.450
 example by painting beautiful 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.910
 crottaz of first choice for then 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.900
 sell in the street there is someone who 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.060
 let go of that they did not show his face 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.770
 nor his house besides this once 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.450
 that they made a lot of money at the 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.700
 sweat of their talents and here they are 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.190
 return to their villa and have fun 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.300
 to swing their bed to the fleet by 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.709
 example and their mattresses 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.910
 because I think children of 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.480
 peasants is not really needed 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.489
 yet on the Marseille side in miami 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.750
 a goal yes so that's a goal that's 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.519
 a little bit more personal because 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.769
 that they all want to make a career out of 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.330
 united states they want to live the dream 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.709
 American so what is the dream 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.720
 American for those who do not know 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.459
 not that's for example you're going 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.440
 in a restaurant at random in the United States 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.480
 you put a little bit of singing on 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.980
 the music of the restaurant and there paf you have 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.640
 the owner of the restaurant that comes to you 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.640
 offer a job 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.910
 honda honda it's a little bit and everything 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.069
 and that's when, like balladur 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.209
 number names begin to speak in this 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.150
 who was French they were 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.160
 Marseille and indexes to the 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.830
 training of young French 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:51.290
 confess if you're leaving the oise 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.459
 is still hurt 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.680
 I have 3 he is Marseille feels all 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.459
 little bit the scenario anyway the 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.959
 camera that is not far 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.159
 attention because the conditions of 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.810
 work there in the united states that and 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.909
 it's difficult there can be real 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.959
 frustration especially when the boss 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.959
 ask you to stay classy 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.590
 it's not good douala 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.810
 there I feel frustrated I am in a 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.170
 dress I'm not comfortable I can not 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.790
 dance 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.370
 I have to fire the fire at the same time 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.610
 two classes it's not possible I can 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.270
 not doing my job properly 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.350
 poor can not do his job 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.130
 correctly fortunately happily 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.390
 what's left 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:48.680
 he still has the street to be able to 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:50.510
 to express all his talent I have no bar 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.490
 here again to train that annoys me 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.960
 so deduct a pole a bar 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.240
 I am obliged to climb on it by 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.840
 figures it's a crazy thing that's also the 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.580
 American dream 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.590
 so you know what your eyes are watching 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.550
 kids every night now I 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.960
 I'm not sure they have access to the 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.940
 TV every night 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.240
 oh well you are a bit strict first 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.890
 under layer you there now it's 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.030

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.410
