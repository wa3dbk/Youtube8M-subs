00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.380
 there is a legend that the device about which 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.310
 we talk today was invented 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.010
 by chance 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.020
 and scientists who did it back in 1945 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.910
 year in general developed the radar and in 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.949
 test time of one of the magnetrons 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.410
 he was told in his pocket by a chocolate or 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:24.999
 sandwich that lay next nobody 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.279
 knows to the end what happened that day 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.439
 but one thing is for sure this invention 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.539
 very influenced the idea of 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.100
 equipping a modern kitchen and how you 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.170
 could guess we talk about 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.160
 microwave ovens or rather about advanced 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.399
 lg models 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:44.109
 m &amp; g 6343 bmr outside the stove looks like 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.030
 stylish and will be able to complement the kitchen with 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.859
 modern door design practically 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.600
 full mirror control panel 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.039
 touch and placed on fully 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.170
 mirror plastics sensor works 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.030
 precisely and without delay the main part 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.589
 Matte gray hull is 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.510
 microwave is in three color 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.640
 interpretations like this with dark 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.469
 glass more mirrored with light yet 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.010
 one dark with an advanced style from 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.079
 designer karim rashid as in the distant 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.909
 1945 with the heart and kidneys of this device 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.950
 is a magnetron and this is not a name 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.540
 new transformer in fact small 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.310
 vacuum tube with magnets 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.140
 generating electromagnetic waves 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.720
 who warmed up the food here 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.369
 Intel ivy technology implemented by 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.290
 her microwaves inside the heating chamber 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.030
 spread along a special spiral 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.310
 trajectories and food warmed up 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.290
 uniformly output microwave power 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.549
 our specimen 800 watts and power 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.920
 grill 2006 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.689
 by the way there are two grills here and they work by 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.610
 different principle of lateral pivoting 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.600
 represents there that is pipe 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.610
 electric heater 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.469
 and the top two quartz heaters 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.119
 use of two different types of grill 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.700
 well so that the dish will be cooked 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.500
 uniformly chamber volume 23 liters of this 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.840
 enough to place the middle 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.939
 the chicken internal coating is special and 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.969
 called izi wedge his name 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.310
 hint my mini my me completely 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.320
 we are completely and easily shorter than me 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.270
 wipe away the remnants of food splatter fat and the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.950
 similar obscenity is very easy and 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.180
 Now I have a question that men more often 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.969
 just do after the acquisition 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.600
 any device with waste paper 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.840
 accompanying this acquisition 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.819
 correctly thrown away in words and 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.500
 man, I'll figure it out myself but it's not like that 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.209
 get better you can do that 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.489
 but then you still have to collect by 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.379
 instructions before how to turn on and warm up 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.700
 mouse dumplings you figure it out but here's how 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.680
 take advantage of all proposed 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.780
 sanctions are quite difficult for me, for example 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.890
 tried to turn on dual grill mode 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.890
 to warm my coffee 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.100
 I will not spend much time 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.630
 tell you how to enable that 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.520
 or another mode is better to tell what 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.200
 This thing is capable of starting a whole 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.970
 set of cooking programs 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.110
 different national cuisines have a choice 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.060
 between russian and french and 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.320
 Italian and Oriental cuisine also have 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.420
 as many as four different programs and 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.520
 defrost multiple modes combination 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.380
 microbes and grilling and the most important i'm not 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.390
 can not mention the new phenomenal 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.520
 mega tech features which 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.360
 compiled and a in dust all pan 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.670
 the globe 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.040
 this is what we have been waiting for these three 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:05.750
 green letters will change the course of history 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:08.210
 this eco button that turns off the display 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.010
 as if that's what you were waiting for 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.750
 function turns off the camera light after 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.230
 five minutes of inactivity when open 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.760
 the door 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.530
 This, too, that they will say thank you all 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.940
 king penguins in arctic but 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.500
 let's set aside a day and 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.830
 look with suspicion on this 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.830
 microwave 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.040
 yes it is definitely good 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.140
 microwave with great variety 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.239
 appreciate and it is meant to be not easy 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.160
 a utility device in the kitchen is over 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.780
 frequency oven hide itself huge 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.190
 potential and she will help you become 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.870
 skilful cook 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.910
 thanks for watching subscribe 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.330
 channel comfy like her on YouTube 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.330
 bye everyone
