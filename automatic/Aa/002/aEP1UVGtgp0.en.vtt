I<00:01:56.570> needed<00:01:56.660> to<00:01:56.960> do<00:01:57.110> something<00:01:57.320> for<00:01:57.590> him<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:58.010> make

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
I needed to do something for him to make

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.980 
I needed to do something for him to make
his<00:01:58.310> life<00:01:58.550> better<00:01:59.150> because<00:01:59.510> of<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.690> fact<00:01:59.870> that

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
his life better because of the fact that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.040 
his life better because of the fact that
he<00:02:00.430> doesn't<00:02:01.430> have<00:02:01.550> that<00:02:01.760> long<00:02:01.970> life<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.900> live

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
he doesn't have that long life to live

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.330 
he doesn't have that long life to live
and<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:03.410> just<00:02:03.560> wanted<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:03.860> make<00:02:04.040> his<00:02:04.190> life

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
and I just wanted to make his life

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.970 
and I just wanted to make his life
better<00:02:04.790> already<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.570> think<00:02:06.110> Leslie<00:02:06.620> is<00:02:06.800> the
