00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.579
 do not read 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.739

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.030
 she had chased 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.410
 the volume of a second life 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.530
 the more you go higher and therefore less expensive in the north of the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.630
 tunisia 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.780

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.740

 once there to be honest 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.620
 sometimes I feel

 it is light to give up their results among the faithful 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.530
