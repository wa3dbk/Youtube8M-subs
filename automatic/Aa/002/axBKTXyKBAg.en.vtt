00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
Baltimore some some negatives that I'm

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.200 
Baltimore some some negatives that I'm
seeing<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.490> know<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> probably<00:01:47.790> won't<00:01:48.000> bet

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
seeing you know I probably won't bet

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.270 
seeing you know I probably won't bet
this<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:49.079> had<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.350> make<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.530> play<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.979> think

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
this but if I had to make a play I think

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
this but if I had to make a play I think
I<00:01:50.430> would<00:01:50.700> take<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> shot<00:01:51.180> with<00:01:51.210> Dalton<00:01:51.899> being

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
I would take a shot with Dalton being

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
I would take a shot with Dalton being
okay<00:01:52.500> or<00:01:52.829> maybe<00:01:53.009> even<00:01:53.130> very<00:01:53.460> good<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.909> take

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
okay or maybe even very good and take

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.330 
okay or maybe even very good and take
Cincinnati<00:01:54.600> plus<00:01:55.140> two<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:55.979> true<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
Cincinnati plus two but it is true that

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
Cincinnati plus two but it is true that
you<00:01:56.969> know<00:01:57.090> dalton<00:01:57.450> has<00:01:57.570> not<00:01:58.049> historically

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
you know dalton has not historically

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.770 
you know dalton has not historically
done<00:01:58.920> well<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.399> games<00:01:59.729> at<00:01:59.939> Baltimore<00:02:00.570> but

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
done well in games at Baltimore but

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.050 
done well in games at Baltimore but
what's<00:02:01.049> your<00:02:01.170> take<00:02:01.290> on<00:02:01.380> these<00:02:01.799> lines<00:02:02.009> Joan<00:02:02.280> now

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
what's your take on these lines Joan now

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.090 
what's your take on these lines Joan now
that<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.630> true<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:04.140> actually<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
that that is true I actually like the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.039 
that that is true I actually like the
over<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:06.119> probably<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.869> few

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
over and it's probably one of the few

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.020 
over and it's probably one of the few
games<00:02:07.320> where<00:02:07.710> maybe<00:02:07.979> my<00:02:08.220> number<00:02:08.489> one<00:02:08.610> reason

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
games where maybe my number one reason

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.360 
games where maybe my number one reason
is<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.330> two<00:02:09.840> offensive<00:02:10.530> coordinators<00:02:11.220> were

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
is the two offensive coordinators were

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.770 
is the two offensive coordinators were
you<00:02:11.580> Jackson<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> new<00:02:12.450> offensive

you Jackson the new offensive

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.370 
you Jackson the new offensive
coordinator

offensive coordinator is going to be

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.190 
offensive coordinator is going to be
more<00:03:08.520> aggressive<00:03:08.820> than<00:03:09.210> these<00:03:09.420> teams<00:03:09.690> have<00:03:09.840> in

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
more aggressive than these teams have in

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.440 
more aggressive than these teams have in
previous<00:03:10.350> years<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:11.280> they<00:03:11.730> still<00:03:12.000> have

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
previous years and they still have

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.900 
previous years and they still have
enough<00:03:13.080> weapons<00:03:13.380> where<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:14.070> do<00:03:14.310> believe<00:03:14.700> that

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
enough weapons where I do believe that

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.880 
enough weapons where I do believe that
the<00:03:15.090> total<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.570> low<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:15.990> often<00:03:16.230> that<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.410> over

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
the total is low and often that the over

the total is low and often that the over
is<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.280> play<00:03:17.460> here<00:03:17.850> all<00:03:18.060> right<00:03:18.210> well<00:03:18.420> Joe<00:03:18.660> you

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.500 
is the play here all right well Joe you
know<00:03:19.170> great<00:03:19.860> minds<00:03:20.160> or<00:03:20.490> mediocre<00:03:20.820> minds<00:03:21.240> or

slightly<00:03:21.750> above<00:03:21.870> mediocre<00:03:22.410> lines<00:03:22.860> do<00:03:23.130> tend<00:03:23.400> to

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
slightly above mediocre lines do tend to

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.100 
slightly above mediocre lines do tend to
think<00:03:23.730> alike<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.150> guess<00:03:24.180> because<00:03:24.720> that<00:03:24.990> is

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
think alike I guess because that is

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.140 
think alike I guess because that is
exactly<00:03:25.140> what<00:03:26.040> might<00:03:26.250> notice<00:03:26.550> here<00:03:26.760> here's<00:03:26.970> my
