00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.000 
here which is done by the way I still
need<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.000> add<00:02:45.030> about<00:02:45.390> two<00:02:45.690> more<00:02:46.410> houses<00:02:46.620> I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
need to add about two more houses I

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.010 
need to add about two more houses I
think<00:02:47.310> plus<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:47.970> small<00:02:48.240> little<00:02:48.600> farm<00:02:48.750> with<00:02:48.990> a

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
think plus a small little farm with a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.420 
think plus a small little farm with a
few<00:02:49.230> animals<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.260> way<00:02:52.710> to<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.950> farms<00:02:53.310> of

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
few animals all the way to the farms of

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.370 
few animals all the way to the farms of
Whiterun<00:02:53.940> where<00:02:54.240> you'll<00:02:54.420> find<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.780> giant<00:02:55.020> and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
Whiterun where you'll find a giant and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.710 
Whiterun where you'll find a giant and
he'll<00:02:55.500> probably<00:02:55.710> kill<00:02:56.070> you<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.720> that's

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
he'll probably kill you because that's

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.580 
he'll probably kill you because that's
the<00:02:57.900> way<00:02:58.020> life<00:02:58.490> handles<00:02:59.490> things<00:02:59.700> right<00:03:00.590> you

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the way life handles things right you

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.320 
the way life handles things right you
get<00:03:01.740> squat<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.160> down<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.490> fly<00:03:03.530> yeah<00:03:05.330> so

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
get squat it down like a fly yeah so

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.900 
get squat it down like a fly yeah so
there's<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.870> also<00:03:07.740> this<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.130> done<00:03:08.340> by<00:03:08.490> level

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
there's that also this is done by level

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.150 
there's that also this is done by level
streaming<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.990> over<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.590> done<00:03:10.980> by

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
streaming that over there is done by

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.450 
streaming that over there is done by
level<00:03:11.580> streaming<00:03:11.970> as<00:03:12.090> well<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.500> that's<00:03:14.130> why

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
level streaming as well so that's why

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.030 
level streaming as well so that's why
the<00:03:14.520> frames<00:03:14.940> are<00:03:15.150> actually<00:03:15.350> okay<00:03:16.350> considering

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.260 

so<00:03:20.040> if<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.580> played

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.960 

we're<00:03:23.930> at<00:03:24.080> 70<00:03:24.430> FPS

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.220 

and<00:03:30.310> as<00:03:31.310> you<00:03:31.640> can<00:03:31.760> see<00:03:31.940> everything<00:03:32.630> has<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.900> nice

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
and as you can see everything has a nice

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.910 
and as you can see everything has a nice
little<00:03:33.770> detail<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.460> it<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:36.440> can't<00:03:36.620> really<00:03:36.650> see

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
little detail to it you can't really see

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.260 
little detail to it you can't really see
those<00:03:37.100> mountains<00:03:37.280> but<00:03:37.580> those<00:03:37.760> mountains<00:03:38.180> are

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
those mountains but those mountains are

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.650 
those mountains but those mountains are
extremely<00:03:38.960> detailed<00:03:40.120> except<00:03:41.120> for<00:03:41.270> that<00:03:41.360> weird

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
extremely detailed except for that weird

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.480 
extremely detailed except for that weird
little<00:03:41.960> rip<00:03:42.260> right<00:03:42.500> there<00:03:42.740> but<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.160> was<00:03:43.310> my

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
little rip right there but that was my

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.570
