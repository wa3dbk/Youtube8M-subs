00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.440
 on the beach suman presents 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.769
 how to check the switch on the 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.199
 door 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.139
 let me show you how to check the 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:16.590
 door switch disconnect the 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.090
 wall outlet dryer 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.250
 open the door of the dryer for 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.009
 expose the door switch 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.140
 use a small flat screwdriver 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:29.079
 to unhook the switch from the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:33.160
 front panel to cheek and pull it towards 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.739
 outside and let it hang from the wires 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.280
 set your multimeter on the scale more 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.350
 low to read union 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.690
 touch the test tips to the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.780
 blue wire terminals and wire 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.390
 yellow in this way make sure that 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.489
 the test tips are making a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.890
 good contact with the terminals of the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.110
 two wires press the button of the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.170
 switch and check the reading on the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.010
 multimeter the reading should be close 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.649
 of 0 years if the reading is infinite the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.799
 door switch is bad and it 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:11.399
 you must replace stop pushing the button 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.210
 and take another reading the reading should be 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.369
 infinite 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.520
 if you get another reading that is not 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.399
 infinite the switch is bad and it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.350
 should replace touch the tips of 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.569
 tests to wire terminals 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.060
 blue and gray wire in this way 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.520
 make sure that the test tips 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.369
 they are making good contact with the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.590
 terminals of the two wires press 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.860
 the switch button and check the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.510
 reading on the multimeter the reading should 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.690
 be infinite 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.330
 stop pushing the button and take another 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.290
 reading 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.450
 the reading should be about 0 years if 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.690
 the reading is infinite with the button 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.350
 outside the switch is bad and it 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.350
 must replace 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.060
 before disconnecting the wires from 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.980
 switch take a photo to use it 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.290
 as a reference for the position of 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.360
 wires on the switch with a 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.649
 small screwdriver disconnect the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.649
 switch wires 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.770
 with your multimeter on the lowest scale 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.710
 to read union 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.430
 put the tips of the multimeter touching 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.230
 the terminals marked on it and with 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.420
 push the switch button and 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.150
 keep him pushed 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.440
 the reading on the multimeter should be 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.010
 close to zero years 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.430
 if you read infinity the switch is bad 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.989
 and it must be replaced because of pushing 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.989
 the button and take another reading 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.310
 the multimeter read infinite if the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.150
 reading is any other that is not 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.480
 infinite the switch is bad and you should 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.520
 be replaced put the tips of the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.790
 multimeter touching the terminals 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.550
 marked on that and with push the button 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.680
 of the switch and keep it pushed 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.960
 reading on the multimeter to be 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.050
 infinite if the reading is any 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:21.130
 another one that is not infinite the switch 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:24.700
 is bad and should be replaced stop 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.459
 push the button and take another reading 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.830
 the multimeter read near zero or 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.950
 mios 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.230
 chile and infinity the switch is 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.230
 bad and must be replaced 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.940
 to replace the switch on the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.460
 door do the following make sure 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.070
 that the dryer is disconnected from 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.230
 outlet on the wall use a 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.240
 small flat screwdriver for 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.520
 unhook the switch from the panel 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.520
 front and remove what 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.780
 I took a picture of the cables 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.260
 connected to the switch for 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.920
 reference and disconnect the wires from 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.920
 switch 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.090
 this is the way of how the wires 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.850
 they connect to the switch 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.060
 the yellow connects the marked terminal 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.060
 in him 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:40.189
 the gray connects to the terminal marked in s 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.370
 and the blue connects to the marked terminal 

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.370
 with 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.150
 with the wires to the switch again 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.730
 put the switch in the hole 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.600
 time until it fits in your 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.760
 place 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.010
 this was the way to check and 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.010
 replace the door switch 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:24.150
