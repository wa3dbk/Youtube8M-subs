you you care about me these are

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.780 
you you care about me these are
principles<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:29.750> hundred<00:01:30.750> years<00:01:31.020> from<00:01:31.170> now

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
principles a hundred years from now

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.190 
principles a hundred years from now
someone<00:01:32.790> will<00:01:33.030> stand<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.810> this<00:01:34.079> will

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
someone will stand up here this will

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.580 
someone will stand up here this will
probably<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.590> hologram<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:37.140> used<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.560> a

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
probably be a hologram it used to be a

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.539 
probably be a hologram it used to be a
flip<00:01:37.860> chart<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> chalkboard

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
flip chart and then it was a chalkboard

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.980 
flip chart and then it was a chalkboard
okay<00:01:43.939> but<00:01:44.939> these<00:01:45.090> principles<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.689> still<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
okay but these principles are still the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.530 
okay but these principles are still the
same<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.350> technologies<00:01:46.950> fancy<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:48.390> these

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
same the technologies fancy but these

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.880 
same the technologies fancy but these
principles<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.079> still<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> same<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
principles are still the same are you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.980 
principles are still the same are you
guys<00:01:49.979> with

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
guys with

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.049
