00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.420 

see<00:02:55.599> if<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:56.379> know<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.590> takes<00:02:56.620> triple<00:02:56.980> A's<00:02:57.190> that's

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
see if I know it takes triple A's that's

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:09.960 
see if I know it takes triple A's that's
all<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.610> saw<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.870> can<00:02:58.989> see<00:02:59.110> tiara<00:02:59.379> 03<00:03:08.970> that's

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
all I saw you can see tiara 03 that's

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.620 
all I saw you can see tiara 03 that's
weird<00:03:10.209> look<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:13.290> yeah<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:16.120> hard<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.360> see<00:03:16.510> but

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
weird look it yeah it's hard to see but

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.559 
weird look it yeah it's hard to see but
the<00:03:16.930> springs<00:03:17.349> are<00:03:17.560> all<00:03:17.680> going<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.040> same<00:03:18.130> way

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
the springs are all going the same way

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.670 
the springs are all going the same way
once<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:19.690> put<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:19.840> batteries<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.380> it'll<00:03:20.560> be

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
once I put the batteries and it'll be

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.789 
once I put the batteries and it'll be
easier<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:20.980> tell<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:26.110> batteries<00:03:26.470> all<00:03:26.650> go

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
easier to tell that the batteries all go

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.740 
easier to tell that the batteries all go
the<00:03:26.920> same<00:03:26.950> way<00:03:27.160> they<00:03:27.819> don't<00:03:27.940> like<00:03:28.709> reverse

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
the same way they don't like reverse

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.620 
the same way they don't like reverse
like<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> checkers<00:03:32.260> thing<00:03:33.299> actually<00:03:34.299> might

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
like a checkers thing actually might

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.970 
like a checkers thing actually might
read<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.930> manual<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.380> see<00:03:35.410> if<00:03:35.590> these<00:03:35.709> are<00:03:35.860> like

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
read the manual to see if these are like

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.710 
read the manual to see if these are like
the<00:03:36.010> ZipZap<00:03:36.519> things<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.209> charge<00:03:37.450> really

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
that makes it even worse I was a

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.529 
that makes it even worse I was a
horrible<00:05:42.320> idea<00:05:44.740> okay<00:05:46.240> yeah<00:05:47.240> like<00:05:47.330> I'm<00:05:47.479> a

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
horrible idea okay yeah like I'm a

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.210 
horrible idea okay yeah like I'm a
gyroscope<00:05:48.080> video<00:05:48.350> at<00:05:48.470> the<00:05:48.560> end<00:05:48.590> it<00:05:48.919> was<00:05:49.039> like

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
gyroscope video at the end it was like

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.760 
gyroscope video at the end it was like
like<00:05:50.060> see<00:05:50.479> my<00:05:50.570> go<00:05:50.720> skipping<00:05:51.110> because<00:05:51.500> I<00:05:51.530> was<00:05:51.710> a

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
like see my go skipping because I was a

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.860 
like see my go skipping because I was a
low<00:05:52.070> frame<00:05:52.370> way<00:05:52.520> when<00:05:52.729> it<00:05:52.850> zoomed<00:05:53.180> in<00:05:53.419> all<00:05:53.660> the

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
low frame way when it zoomed in all the

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.310 
low frame way when it zoomed in all the
way<00:05:54.100> sounds<00:05:55.100> good<00:05:55.220> to<00:05:55.310> find<00:05:55.490> out<00:05:55.640> yeah<00:05:56.090> oh<00:05:56.539> yeah

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
way sounds good to find out yeah oh yeah

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.310 
way sounds good to find out yeah oh yeah
and<00:05:57.760> or<00:05:58.760> I<00:05:58.789> go<00:05:59.180> I<00:05:59.510> thought<00:05:59.870> this<00:06:00.020> was<00:06:00.200> an

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
and or I go I thought this was an

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.060 
and or I go I thought this was an
outstanding<00:06:01.060> thing<00:06:02.060> that<00:06:02.630> they<00:06:02.750> did<00:06:02.950> turn<00:06:03.950> it

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
outstanding thing that they did turn it

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.659 
outstanding thing that they did turn it
off<00:06:04.130> but<00:06:04.700> what<00:06:04.820> you<00:06:04.909> could<00:06:05.030> do<00:06:05.240> is<00:06:06.460> like<00:06:07.460> what

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
off but what you could do is like what

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:08.320 
off but what you could do is like what
would<00:06:07.789> on<00:06:07.940> top

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
would on top

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.700 
would on top
with<00:06:08.419> mine<00:06:08.599> like<00:06:08.810> my<00:06:08.930> last<00:06:09.050> one<00:06:09.229> broke<00:06:09.439> because

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
with mine like my last one broke because

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.249 
with mine like my last one broke because
too<00:06:10.009> much<00:06:10.099> hair<00:06:10.460> got<00:06:10.699> in<00:06:10.729> the<00:06:10.879> years<00:06:11.210> but<00:06:11.840> they

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
too much hair got in the years but they

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.939 
too much hair got in the years but they
made<00:06:12.439> it<00:06:12.590> so<00:06:12.710> you<00:06:12.770> could<00:06:13.210> pop<00:06:14.210> out<00:06:14.949> very

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
made it so you could pop out very

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.309 
made it so you could pop out very
careful<00:06:16.340> if<00:06:16.400> you<00:06:16.520> do<00:06:16.639> it<00:06:16.789> you<00:06:17.509> could<00:06:17.629> pop<00:06:18.139> out

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
careful if you do it you could pop out

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.230 
careful if you do it you could pop out
the<00:06:18.560> back<00:06:18.740> wheels<00:06:19.069> to<00:06:19.310> clean<00:06:19.580> out<00:06:19.759> hair<00:06:20.060> and

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
the back wheels to clean out hair and

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.369 
the back wheels to clean out hair and
stuff<00:06:20.449> which<00:06:20.629> are<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:20.840> ones<00:06:20.960> with<00:06:21.110> the<00:06:21.139> motor

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:21.379 
stuff which are the ones with the motor

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:22.839 
stuff which are the ones with the motor
the<00:06:21.919> front<00:06:22.159> ones<00:06:22.310> don't<00:06:22.430> really<00:06:22.699> matter

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
the front ones don't really matter

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.249 
the front ones don't really matter
because<00:06:23.090> they<00:06:23.419> don't<00:06:23.599> they<00:06:23.990> don't<00:06:24.020> have<00:06:24.229> a

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:24.259 
because they don't they don't have a

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.080 
because they don't they don't have a
motor<00:06:24.530> and<00:06:24.680> they<00:06:24.770> don't<00:06:24.860> spin<00:06:25.219> so<00:06:25.849> you<00:06:25.939> could

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
motor and they don't spin so you could

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.610 
motor and they don't spin so you could
pop<00:06:26.300> out<00:06:26.419> the<00:06:26.479> back<00:06:26.719> wheel<00:06:26.930> so<00:06:27.110> like<00:06:27.229> clean<00:06:27.469> off

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620 
pop out the back wheel so like clean off

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.140 
pop out the back wheel so like clean off
the<00:06:27.740> motor<00:06:27.919> and<00:06:28.039> fix<00:06:28.340> it<00:06:28.520> which<00:06:28.759> I<00:06:28.879> thought<00:06:29.030> was

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150 
the motor and fix it which I thought was

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.219
