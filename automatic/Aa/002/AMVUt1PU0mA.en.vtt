00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 it is 18 hours the taking of service 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.690
 for the pilots of the fast brigade 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.990
 of intervention near the viaduct of 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.120
 millau 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.630
 they are here to show themselves and sometimes 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.400
 sanctioned by a motorist to 160 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.509
 kilometers / hour obviously he knows that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.190
 it's for him because see them 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.580
 even stop will be stop band 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.189
 emergency 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.930
 so we're going to put the board to him 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.980
 Variable message Follow us have their 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.980
 asked to follow 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.560
 so that's the typical cliché of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.480
 the motorist who knows to be in 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.590
 offense since in view of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.970
 gendarmes when we made him no 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.970
 sign stand alone 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.420
 the offense in gear and tax rises 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.330
 at 135 hours at the quay less than 90 it's 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 peritonitis today one of the three 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.220
 opportunities to pay him right away 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.390
 or later it's you who see 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.580
 had to one day the man that 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.559
 turns it turns anyway on the 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.350
 roads are well right there and that's good 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.150
 a little in a hurry to get to the right 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.280
 car so it's radical it calms well 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.140
 160 do not know it's not a big 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 offense but it still requires 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:16.710
 a penalty 8 and day its pilots 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.260
 trained if there is a 75 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.820
 north-south axis frequented especially the summer of 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.040
 larzac lozère they track down the 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.229
 lesser breach security distances 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.360
 disrespected speeding their 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.229
 mission and especially dissuasive on the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.540
 edge of the highway 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.000
 impossible not to see the subaru a 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.170
 car that arouses hatred and passion 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.750
 First there is the look of the one who is 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.580
 verbalized and who does not look at her 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.820
 with eyes filled with love if I can 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.520
 say 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.110
 and then also the crowd of curious people 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.150
 who when she is stopped or 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.100
 when using it in the forums of 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.330
 prevention come to learn 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.800
 we are always asked this question 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.820
 but she is much more powerful 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.210
 than those sold in the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.670
 trade 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.380
 so I will silence this legend all 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.400
 right away it's the model that is 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.780
 sold commercially with the same 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.890
 number of horses the only difference 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.950
 it's the person behind the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.570
 historic record flying 248 kilometers 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.960
 hour but his speeding is still 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.640
 outstanding 150 to 170 this is for the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.470
 average under the gaze of men in 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.470
 blue the motorists lift the foot
