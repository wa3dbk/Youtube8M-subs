plus this is the one that has the broken
space<00:00:12.360> bar<00:00:12.710> it<00:00:13.710> does<00:00:13.980> actuate<00:00:14.610> if<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.969> press

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330

space bar it does actuate if you press
it<00:00:15.540> just<00:00:16.260> right<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> middle<00:00:17.100> but<00:00:18.000> if<00:00:18.240> you

you actually press it normally when
you're<00:00:23.100> typing<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.970> half<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.330> time<00:00:24.420> doesn't

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
you're typing it half the time doesn't

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.900 
you're typing it half the time doesn't
work<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.410> very<00:00:25.680> very<00:00:26.099> frustrating

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
work and it is very very frustrating

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.019 
work and it is very very frustrating
when<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.150> try<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.449> talk<00:00:27.689> fast<00:00:28.490> anyway<00:00:29.490> this

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
when you try and talk fast anyway this

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.060 
when you try and talk fast anyway this
video<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.630> mostly<00:00:31.050> comparison<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> show<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
video is mostly comparison to show you

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.709 
video is mostly comparison to show you
the<00:00:32.160> difference<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.520> volume<00:00:32.940> between<00:00:33.120> typing

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the difference in volume between typing

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:44.000 
the difference in volume between typing
on<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> newer<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.860> old<00:00:34.980> ones<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:43.010> that's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
on the newer and the old ones so that's

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.760 
on the newer and the old ones so that's
it<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:45.270> new<00:00:45.450> one<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.719> probably<00:00:45.960> slightly

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
it the new one is probably slightly

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.060 
it the new one is probably slightly
louder<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.320> actually<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
louder but you don't actually have to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340 
louder but you don't actually have to
push<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> key<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> whole<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.120> down<00:00:51.420> for<00:00:52.289> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
push the key the whole way down for it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.850 
push the key the whole way down for it
to<00:00:52.500> register<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.129> press<00:00:53.570> which<00:00:54.570> means<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to register the press which means with a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.799 
to register the press which means with a
bit<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.039> training<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.789> could<00:00:57.270> probably<00:00:57.449> teach

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
bit of training I could probably teach

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
bit of training I could probably teach
myself<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.350> type<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.739> bit<00:00:58.890> quieter<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
myself to type a bit quieter with the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150 
myself to type a bit quieter with the
new<00:00:59.579> one<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.079> old<00:01:01.230> one<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.920> also

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
new one then with the old one you also

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
new one then with the old one you also
don't<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.879> place<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.390> much<00:01:03.570> pressure<00:01:03.960> on

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
don't have to place as much pressure on

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.090 
don't have to place as much pressure on
the<00:01:04.379> key<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:05.850> type<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> older

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the key to type as you do with the older

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.580 
the key to type as you do with the older
keyboard<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.240> very<00:01:09.479> different<00:01:09.840> feeling

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
keyboard it's a very different feeling

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
keyboard it's a very different feeling
and<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.890> gotta<00:01:11.159> say<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.390> hell<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.840> lot

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and I gotta say it's a hell of a lot

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.050 
and I gotta say it's a hell of a lot
nicer<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.560> now<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.340> everybody<00:01:14.700> raves

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
nicer I now see what everybody raves

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.760 
nicer I now see what everybody raves
about<00:01:15.240> when<00:01:15.630> they<00:01:15.750> speak<00:01:15.990> about<00:01:16.110> mechanical

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
about when they speak about mechanical

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.520 
about when they speak about mechanical
keyboards<00:01:17.390> probably<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.780> gripe<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.500> have

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
keyboards probably the one gripe I have

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.609 
keyboards probably the one gripe I have
with<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.159> new<00:01:20.340> keyboard<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.540> one<00:01:21.780> bit<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.560> a

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
with the new keyboard the one bit of a

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.080 
with the new keyboard the one bit of a
complaint<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.189> I'll<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.490> turn<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> light

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
complaint so I'll just turn the light

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.980 
complaint so I'll just turn the light
off<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.840> see<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> Visia<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.990> maybe

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
off so you can see the Visia and maybe

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.870 
off so you can see the Visia and maybe
minimize<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.710> big<00:01:31.920> white<00:01:32.220> window<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
minimize this big white window so the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.310 
minimize this big white window so the
screen<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.299> not<00:01:33.420> showing<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.900> much<00:01:34.049> light<00:01:34.290> on

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
screen is not showing so much light on

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.410 
screen is not showing so much light on
it<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:36.479> backlight<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.500> new<00:01:37.680> keyboard

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
it is the backlight on the new keyboard

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.600 
it is the backlight on the new keyboard
yes<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.900> independently<00:01:40.710> control<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
yes you can independently control the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.050 
yes you can independently control the
main<00:01:41.880> buttons<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.320> WASD<00:01:43.950> Keys<00:01:44.369> that's

of most keyboards because I use this
number<00:02:04.180> pad<00:02:04.390> quite<00:02:04.840> a<00:02:04.869> lot<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.790> means<00:02:07.920> that's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
number pad quite a lot this means that's

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.529 
number pad quite a lot this means that's
going<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.190> be<00:02:09.310> very<00:02:09.550> very<00:02:09.940> bright<00:02:10.270> in<00:02:10.450> the

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
going to be very very bright in the

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.479 
going to be very very bright in the
middle<00:02:10.750> of<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.899> night<00:02:11.080> when<00:02:11.440> you've<00:02:11.650> got<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
middle of the night when you've got the

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.250 
middle of the night when you've got the
keyboard<00:02:12.670> like<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.420> normally<00:02:13.810> leave<00:02:14.020> the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
keyboard like this I normally leave the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.199 
keyboard like this I normally leave the
backlight<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:14.890> fairly<00:02:15.160> low<00:02:15.459> light<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.030> it's

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
backlight on a fairly low light so it's

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.600 
backlight on a fairly low light so it's
not<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.620> eyes<00:02:17.800> like<00:02:18.069> bright<00:02:18.400> light

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
not so that the eyes like bright light

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.300 
not so that the eyes like bright light
tends<00:02:18.880> to<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.120> at<00:02:19.209> night<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:20.290> that<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:20.920> very

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
tends to do at night and that is very

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.820 
tends to do at night and that is very
jarring<00:02:21.910> because<00:02:22.300> it's<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.380> much<00:02:23.590> brighter

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
jarring because it's so much brighter

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.670 
jarring because it's so much brighter
than<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.370> rest<00:02:24.550> of<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> keyboard<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:26.380> far

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
than the rest of the keyboard so far

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.680 
than the rest of the keyboard so far
that's<00:02:26.980> pretty<00:02:27.220> much<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.519> only<00:02:27.550> complaint<00:02:28.390> I

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
that's pretty much the only complaint I

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.970 
that's pretty much the only complaint I
haven't<00:02:29.410> really<00:02:29.800> found<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:31.480> clear<00:02:31.840> shiny<00:02:32.709> bit

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
haven't really found the clear shiny bit

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.280 
haven't really found the clear shiny bit
down<00:02:33.220> here<00:02:33.459> to<00:02:33.580> be<00:02:33.730> particularly

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
down here to be particularly

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.440 
down here to be particularly
fingerprints<00:02:35.290> prone<00:02:35.709> so<00:02:36.100> far<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:36.730> maybe

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
fingerprints prone so far so maybe

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.400 
fingerprints prone so far so maybe
that'll<00:02:37.780> happen<00:02:37.900> with<00:02:38.170> time<00:02:38.440> but<00:02:38.880> not<00:02:39.880> yet

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
that'll happen with time but not yet

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.170 
that'll happen with time but not yet
aside<00:02:41.410> from<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.739> on<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.160> far<00:02:42.340> very<00:02:42.610> happy<00:02:43.000> if

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
aside from that on so far very happy if

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.390 
aside from that on so far very happy if
I<00:02:43.300> do<00:02:43.360> think<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.840> anything<00:02:43.930> else<00:02:44.350> maybe<00:02:45.220> I'll

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
I do think of anything else maybe I'll

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.090 
I do think of anything else maybe I'll
put<00:02:45.580> up<00:02:45.670> another<00:02:45.880> video<00:02:46.030> but<00:02:46.480> for<00:02:46.720> now<00:02:47.100> that's

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
put up another video but for now that's

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.570 
put up another video but for now that's
