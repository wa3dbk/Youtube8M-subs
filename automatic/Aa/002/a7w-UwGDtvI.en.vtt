00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
figure it out where it was so this case

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.559 
figure it out where it was so this case
with<00:04:13.069> this<00:04:13.159> case<00:04:13.459> you<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:13.849> kind<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.090> figure<00:04:14.419> it

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
with this case you can kind of figure it

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.170 
with this case you can kind of figure it
out<00:04:14.689> where<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.930> is<00:04:15.079> because<00:04:15.439> that's<00:04:15.769> what<00:04:15.889> the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
out where it is because that's what the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.999 
out where it is because that's what the
cutout<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.389> so<00:04:17.780> it's<00:04:17.989> easier<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.470> find<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.829> power

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.009 
cutout is so it's easier to find a power

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:23.860 
cutout is so it's easier to find a power
button<00:04:19.389> this<00:04:20.389> got<00:04:20.720> the<00:04:21.550> open<00:04:22.550> here<00:04:22.789> so<00:04:23.599> that

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
button this got the open here so that

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.580 
button this got the open here so that
the<00:04:23.900> speakers<00:04:24.500> are<00:04:25.160> not<00:04:25.370> blocked<00:04:26.270> and<00:04:26.630> it's

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.800 
be some getting used to when you put
this<00:05:03.169> case<00:05:03.409> on<00:05:03.620> because<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:05.060> sides<00:05:05.330> kind<00:05:05.720> of

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
this case on because the sides kind of

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.939 
this case on because the sides kind of
smooth<00:05:06.699> it<00:05:07.699> will<00:05:07.789> tend<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.650> slip<00:05:09.650> from<00:05:09.889> your

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
smooth it will tend to slip from your

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.070 
smooth it will tend to slip from your
hand<00:05:10.190> so<00:05:11.150> it's<00:05:11.330> going<00:05:11.419> to<00:05:11.509> take<00:05:11.659> some<00:05:11.690> time<00:05:12.050> for

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
hand so it's going to take some time for

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.740 
hand so it's going to take some time for
you<00:05:12.409> to<00:05:12.500> get<00:05:12.590> used<00:05:12.860> to<00:05:13.009> the<00:05:13.190> slippery<00:05:14.000> sides

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
you to get used to the slippery sides

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.050 
you to get used to the slippery sides
here<00:05:15.020> they<00:05:15.830> should<00:05:16.099> have<00:05:16.220> continued<00:05:16.909> the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
here they should have continued the

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.060 
here they should have continued the
pattern<00:05:17.509> on<00:05:17.750> this<00:05:17.930> side<00:05:18.199> I<00:05:18.530> don't<00:05:18.800> know<00:05:18.860> why

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
pattern on this side I don't know why

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.300 
pattern on this side I don't know why
they<00:05:19.220> didn't<00:05:19.490> do<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:20.650> because<00:05:21.650> for<00:05:21.979> me

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
they didn't do that because for me

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.680 
they didn't do that because for me
that's<00:05:22.639> the<00:05:22.820> biggest<00:05:23.030> problem<00:05:23.509> with<00:05:23.630> this

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
that's the biggest problem with this

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.300 
that's the biggest problem with this
case<00:05:23.930> is<00:05:24.199> that<00:05:24.320> it's<00:05:24.469> smooth<00:05:24.830> on<00:05:25.009> the<00:05:25.039> side<00:05:25.280> and

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
case is that it's smooth on the side and

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.709 
case is that it's smooth on the side and
it<00:05:25.639> shouldn't<00:05:25.909> be<00:05:26.030> there<00:05:26.240> should<00:05:26.419> be<00:05:26.539> some

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
it shouldn't be there should be some

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.899 
it shouldn't be there should be some
grip<00:05:26.990> in<00:05:27.139> here<00:05:27.320> I've<00:05:28.280> heard<00:05:28.580> from<00:05:28.669> some<00:05:28.759> people

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
grip in here I've heard from some people

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.870 
grip in here I've heard from some people
that<00:05:29.240> using<00:05:29.990> sandpaper<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:30.770> they'll<00:05:31.490> stand

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
that using sandpaper and they'll stand

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.420 
that using sandpaper and they'll stand
the<00:05:32.449> size<00:05:32.750> a<00:05:32.780> little<00:05:33.110> bit<00:05:33.349> that<00:05:33.740> seems<00:05:34.250> like<00:05:34.340> a

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
the size a little bit that seems like a

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.170 
the size a little bit that seems like a
good<00:05:34.580> idea<00:05:34.639> I<00:05:35.090> might<00:05:35.449> try<00:05:35.630> that<00:05:35.840> out<00:05:37.030> and<00:05:38.030> let

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
good idea I might try that out and let

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.159 
good idea I might try that out and let
you<00:05:38.330> know<00:05:38.360> I<00:05:38.690> have<00:05:39.169> a<00:05:39.199> sandbox<00:05:40.159> our<00:05:40.490> sandbox

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
you know I have a sandbox our sandbox

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.010 
you know I have a sandbox our sandbox
sandstone<00:05:42.580> case<00:05:43.580> coming<00:05:43.849> in<00:05:44.030> i'll<00:05:44.780> do<00:05:44.990> a

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
sandstone case coming in i'll do a

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.110 
sandstone case coming in i'll do a
number

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
number

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.300 
number
in<00:05:46.270> a<00:05:46.300> review<00:05:46.600> on<00:05:46.810> that<00:05:46.960> one<00:05:47.050> as<00:05:47.139> well<00:05:47.190> see<00:05:48.190> you
