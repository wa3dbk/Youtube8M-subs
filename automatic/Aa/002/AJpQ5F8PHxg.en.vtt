00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
live stream it is oil you can see that

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.370 
live stream it is oil you can see that
the<00:00:17.970> guy<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.119> just<00:00:18.420> died<00:00:18.630> was<00:00:18.840> Jake<00:00:19.020> nasty

the guy that just died was Jake nasty
but<00:00:20.180> guys<00:00:21.529> my<00:00:22.529> precision<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.609> gun<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
but guys my precision with this gun is

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.509 
but guys my precision with this gun is
amazing<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.109> don't<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:25.500> anybody<00:00:25.890> could<00:00:26.310> be

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.880 
amazing I don't think anybody could be
this<00:00:26.730> precise<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.570> gun<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:28.619> see<00:00:28.800> how

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
this precise with this gun you see how

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.769 
this precise with this gun you see how
gently<00:00:29.279> I'm<00:00:29.490> shooting<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.029> aluminum<00:00:30.570> wall

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
gently I'm shooting that aluminum wall

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.180 
gently I'm shooting that aluminum wall
in<00:00:30.990> front<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.289> me<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.350> perfect

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
in front of me like it's just so perfect

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030 
in front of me like it's just so perfect
I<00:00:35.670> mean<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.600> way<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.870> I'm<00:00:37.200> holding<00:00:37.739> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
this precision guys look at it it you

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.690 
this precision guys look at it it you
cannot<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.290> like<00:01:28.470> me<00:01:28.680> I'm<00:01:28.860> sorry<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.549> inform
