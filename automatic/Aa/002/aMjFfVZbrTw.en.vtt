00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320 

I<00:00:02.179> fitted<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.710> smoke<00:00:04.710> eye<00:00:05.120> to<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.870> front<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.350> an

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.330 
I fitted a smoke eye to the front of an

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.850 
I fitted a smoke eye to the front of an
electric<00:00:09.330> oven<00:00:09.800> and<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:11.250> allows<00:00:11.490> me<00:00:11.519> to

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
electric oven and that allows me to

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.010 
electric oven and that allows me to
smoke<00:00:13.860> meat<00:00:14.190> very<00:00:14.700> effectively<00:00:15.179> good

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
smoke meat very effectively good

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.390 
smoke meat very effectively good
temperature<00:00:16.470> control<00:00:18.740> this<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.949> normally

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
temperature control this is normally

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.720 
temperature control this is normally
bolted<00:00:20.910> on<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.330> side<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.070> I<00:00:23.070> thought<00:00:23.490> that

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
bolted on to the side and I thought that

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.429 
bolted on to the side and I thought that
that<00:00:23.820> would<00:00:23.939> be<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.359> little<00:00:24.689> difficult<00:00:24.900> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
that would be a little difficult to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.160 
that would be a little difficult to
clean<00:00:26.250> each<00:00:26.550> time<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.840> see<00:00:29.330> just<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.480> there

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
clean each time so see just in there

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.299 
clean each time so see just in there
that's<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.980> rare-earth<00:00:32.369> magnet<00:00:34.070> and<00:00:35.070> there's

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
that's a rare-earth magnet and there's

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.319 
that's a rare-earth magnet and there's
one<00:00:35.489> on<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> inside<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:37.460> took<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.640> took<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
one on the inside I took this took the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.310 
one on the inside I took this took the
cover<00:00:39.690> off<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.640> put<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.850> rare<00:00:42.239> route<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
cover off and put a rare route of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.799 
cover off and put a rare route of
rare-earth<00:00:43.530> magnet<00:00:44.219> onto<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> inside<00:00:45.360> of

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
rare-earth magnet onto the inside of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.830 
rare-earth magnet onto the inside of
this<00:00:46.260> cover<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:47.309> lines<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.149> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
this cover which lines up with this so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.959 
this cover which lines up with this so
it<00:00:48.899> allows<00:00:49.140> me<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.340> want<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.579> tilt<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
it allows me if I just want to tilt the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.029 
it allows me if I just want to tilt the
ash<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:52.530> allows<00:00:52.829> me<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.719> simply<00:00:54.719> tilt<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.500> I

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
ash it allows me to simply tilt and I

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.660 
ash it allows me to simply tilt and I
can<00:00:56.809> clean<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> ash<00:00:58.079> shirt<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> fell

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
can clean the ash shirt you see I fell

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.039 
can clean the ash shirt you see I fell
down<00:00:59.789> there<00:01:04.640> or<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.330> want<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.630> remove<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.870 

line<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.369> properly<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.229> allows

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
line that up properly and so it allows

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.289 
line that up properly and so it allows
there<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.030> line<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.920> underneath<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.299> I've

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
there to line up underneath it I've

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.789 
there to line up underneath it I've
mounted<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:53.299> air<00:01:54.299> pump<00:01:54.570> directly<00:01:55.110> beneath<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
mounted the air pump directly beneath it

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.530 
mounted the air pump directly beneath it
I've<00:01:55.979> put<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> piece<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.640> timber<00:01:56.820> against<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.420> as

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
I've put a piece of timber against it as

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.780 
I've put a piece of timber against it as
a<00:01:57.740> insulator<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.729> got<00:02:00.600> some<00:02:00.780> toys<00:02:01.790> directly

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
a insulator it's got some toys directly

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.679 
a insulator it's got some toys directly
beneath<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> setup<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
beneath it so you can see the setup is

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.919 
beneath it so you can see the setup is
it's<00:02:06.689> quite<00:02:06.930> neat<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:08.369> allows<00:02:08.700> me<00:02:08.970> easy<00:02:09.360> access

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
it's quite neat it allows me easy access

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.940 
it's quite neat it allows me easy access
to<00:02:10.110> adjust<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> temperature

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
to adjust the temperature

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.530 
to adjust the temperature
although<00:02:16.200> good<00:02:17.200> luck<00:02:17.349> with<00:02:17.500> it
