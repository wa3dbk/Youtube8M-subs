00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
image and so yeah I'm just gonna speed

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.950 
image and so yeah I'm just gonna speed
up<00:00:29.039> certain<00:00:29.340> parts<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.390> video<00:00:30.750> in

up certain parts of the the video in
order<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.380> shorten<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.949> length<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.399> video

logo I'm going to create a new layer and
I'm<00:00:38.280> going<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.520> duplicate<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:39.090> layer<00:00:39.120> that

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
I'm going to duplicate the layer that

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.360 
I'm going to duplicate the layer that
I'm<00:00:39.570> working<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.200> cannot<00:00:40.800> get<00:00:41.100> into

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
I'm working on on this cannot get into

00:00:41.370 --> 00:01:51.230 
I'm working on on this cannot get into
it

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.550 

okay<00:01:52.240> guys<00:01:52.420> that's<00:01:52.689> basically<00:01:53.079> how<00:01:53.200> they

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
okay guys that's basically how they

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.469 
okay guys that's basically how they
remove<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.220> logo<00:01:54.579> I'm<00:01:54.880> sure<00:01:55.090> they<00:01:55.329> probably

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
remove the logo I'm sure they probably

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.389 
remove the logo I'm sure they probably
spent<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.869> lot<00:01:56.020> more<00:01:56.049> time<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:57.189> lot<00:01:57.340> more

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
spent a lot more time and a lot more

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.490 
spent a lot more time and a lot more
effort<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.119> order<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.570> get<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:58.960> look<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.380> lot

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
effort in order to get it to look a lot

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.920 
effort in order to get it to look a lot
more<00:01:59.560> realistic<00:02:00.159> but<00:02:00.939> you<00:02:01.360> know<00:02:01.479> that's<00:02:01.780> a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
more realistic but you know that's a

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.080 
more realistic but you know that's a
quick<00:02:02.110> idea<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.740> how<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.950> was<00:02:03.100> done<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.640> they

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
quick idea so how it was done and they

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.190 
quick idea so how it was done and they
probably<00:02:04.119> spent<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.600> lot<00:02:04.720> more<00:02:04.750> time<00:02:05.020> obviously

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
probably spent a lot more time obviously

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.330 
probably spent a lot more time obviously
so<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.039> next<00:02:06.070> thing<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.930> would<00:02:08.140> have<00:02:08.289> done

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
so the next thing they would have done

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.550 
so the next thing they would have done
was<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.970> okies<00:02:10.660> i'm<00:02:10.810> gonna<00:02:10.929> put<00:02:11.080> this<00:02:11.140> Leon

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
was to okies i'm gonna put this Leon

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.100 
was to okies i'm gonna put this Leon
talk<00:02:11.830> about<00:02:12.069> it<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.400> don't<00:02:12.580> affect<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.060> and<00:02:13.239> i'm

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
talk about it I don't affect it and i'm

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.080 
talk about it I don't affect it and i'm
going<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.500> show<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:14.769> what<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.130> does<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.519> I<00:02:15.700> kind

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
going to show you what it does it I kind

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.089 
going to show you what it does it I kind
of<00:02:16.150> match<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.510> lighting<00:02:17.019> so<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.739> public

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
of match the lighting so this the public

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.190 
of match the lighting so this the public
created<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.519> levels<00:02:18.849> adjustment<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.050> just

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
created a levels adjustment this is just

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.930 
created a levels adjustment this is just
one<00:02:20.440> way<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.950> how<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.400> could<00:02:21.519> have<00:02:21.610> been<00:02:21.760> done

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
one way of how it could have been done

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.520 
one way of how it could have been done
and<00:02:22.590> basically<00:02:23.590> reduce<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.100> contrast

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.500 

it<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.310> zoom<00:02:29.520> out<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.670> bit<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.360> get<00:02:30.450> a

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it is zoom out a bit so I can get a

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.000 
it is zoom out a bit so I can get a
overview

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.399 

yeah<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:35.909> basically<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:37.110> reduce<00:02:37.319> the

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
yeah that's basically it to reduce the

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.640 
yeah that's basically it to reduce the
contrast<00:02:37.939> and<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.209> next<00:02:39.420> thing<00:02:39.780> okay<00:02:40.470> maybe

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
contrast and the next thing okay maybe

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.850 
contrast and the next thing okay maybe
it<00:02:40.829> needs<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.189> little<00:02:41.340> bit<00:02:41.519> less<00:02:42.470> hey<00:02:43.470> that's<00:02:43.650> it

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
it needs a little bit less hey that's it

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.440 
it needs a little bit less hey that's it
and<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.489> next<00:02:44.670> thing<00:02:44.790> they<00:02:44.970> would<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.180> done

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and the next thing they would have done

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.170 
and the next thing they would have done
was<00:02:45.810> obviously<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.379> liquefy<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.970> shape<00:02:47.970> of

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
was obviously to liquefy the shape of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.289 
was obviously to liquefy the shape of
the<00:02:48.299> body<00:02:48.480> um<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:50.400> know<00:02:50.519> how<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.670> do<00:02:50.879> that<00:02:50.909> you

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
the body um you know how to do that you

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.660 
the body um you know how to do that you
just<00:02:51.329> just<00:02:52.290> I'm<00:02:53.069> just<00:02:53.190> going<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.400> show<00:02:53.519> you<00:02:53.579> how

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
just just I'm just going to show you how

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
as this yeah that's what they did really

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.980 
as this yeah that's what they did really
and<00:03:54.910> they<00:03:55.000> claimed<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.510> was<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.840> original

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
and they claimed it was the original

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.910 
and they claimed it was the original
it's<00:03:58.990> very<00:03:59.260> simple<00:03:59.560> procedure<00:04:01.800> so<00:04:02.800> yeah

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
it's very simple procedure so yeah

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.830 
it's very simple procedure so yeah
that's<00:04:03.130> basically<00:04:03.670> what<00:04:04.120> they<00:04:04.210> did<00:04:04.420> it's<00:04:04.570> not

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
that's basically what they did it's not

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.200 
that's basically what they did it's not
actually<00:04:05.740> it's<00:04:06.340> not<00:04:06.400> actually<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:06.970> original

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
actually it's not actually the original

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.360 
actually it's not actually the original
well<00:04:08.110> obviously<00:04:08.290> it's<00:04:08.650> not<00:04:08.680> exactly<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.250> same

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
well obviously it's not exactly the same

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.640 
well obviously it's not exactly the same
but<00:04:09.760> you<00:04:10.240> get<00:04:10.330> an<00:04:10.420> idea<00:04:10.600> as<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:10.990> what<00:04:11.230> was<00:04:11.440> done

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
but you get an idea as to what was done

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.390 
but you get an idea as to what was done
I'm<00:04:11.770> how<00:04:11.920> it<00:04:12.070> could<00:04:12.280> have<00:04:12.370> been<00:04:12.550> done
