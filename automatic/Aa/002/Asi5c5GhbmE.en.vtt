00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.040
 in the world of industry 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.569
 sixty million produced 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.569
 gas tanks each year only for new 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:10.620
 and passenger cars 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.389
 a few more million design on 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.799
 damaged gas tanks 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.050
 for used cars 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.920
 considering how much it costs to fill the tank 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.040
 no wonder modern tanks 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.619
 have an increased margin of safety 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.249
 Chechnya gas tank production begins 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.579
 from ordinary steel sheet met 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.579
 even layer against giving birth 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.879
 workers puts steel sheet 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.299
 victory hairstyle travel put 

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:39.270
 800 tons bills 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.790
 he clamps a sheet between two forum 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.230
 bottom half shaped blocks 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.150
 banks 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.490
 bailiffs yes were out the incoming part 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.920
 block shapes close 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 and in the cavity the volume pouring the form of the block 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.030
 for making the upper part of the tank 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.970
 or a tank of a different shape is enough to replace in 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.970
 press form blocks 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.840
 at the top of the punching tanks passage 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.040
 provide information about 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.060
 production model number im number 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.820
 parties and manufacturer's stamp 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.159
 hydraulic punch do 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.550
 Tanks two holes for the tube 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.840
 on which gasoline is poured and from the heart 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.290
 MW this machine makes holes for 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.270
 parts called fuel delivery modules 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.270
 which supplies fuel to the engine 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.980
 so the pipeline to the next stage 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.900
 production now passes get 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.050
 media of ten such details 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.080
 here are the workers using the lock 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.570
 so steel ring for feed module 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.250
 fuel 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.740
 he weld the top rings 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.490
 dots gas tank went 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.540
 two serifs on the ring ttk will allow 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.540
 align the fuel delivery module 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.700
 workers welded to the top and bottom 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.819
 half aligns them for welding 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:20.669
 two metal it seems clutching 200 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:22.269
 excite each other 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.319
 black welding machine 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.409
 soldering between the top and bottom 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.469
 half cooling 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.469
 invest 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.749
 by gas welding 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.799
 apparatus workers weld steel 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.180
 lead surf tank 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.690
 this is the filler pipe that you 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.840
 insert the hose to the gas station 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.970
 to fill the tank 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.370
 when gasoline flows inside the air goes 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.100
 from the tank through the vent 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.530
 the center automatically turns off the column 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.700
 when the pressure in the tube exceeds 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.069
 allowable values 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.359
 most gas tanks 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.069
 filled to 80 percent lift 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.029
 to leave room for vapors 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:04.559
 caused by heating 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:05.959
 in the gas tank for new cars 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.209
 weld robotic 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.309
 manipulators 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:12.159
 increased welding accuracy is required for 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.159
 assembly line at the car factory 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.609
 hand-welded tanks and sell in 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.040
 car repair shops where they are put under replacement 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.359
 damaged gas tanks are not here 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.389
 high accuracy is required whereas 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.199
 mechanics anyway will be customized 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.919
 Baksan CTP 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.219
 after welding the bate arrive at 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.219
 next stage 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.069
 here the worker is mounted inside a puddle 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.439
 smart vents 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.689
 position makes him steady handsome 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.679
 then the inside of the park 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.159
 steel is installed 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.999
 distribute which hinder 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:56.450
 Rosbalt has his fuel 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.400
 as a result 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.470
 noise level decreases and decreases 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.799
 metal wear 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.859
 such distributors usually put large 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.289
 cars like SUVs 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:07.639
 workers sets 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.379
 the upper part to the bottom leaving the hose 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.060
 in the hole at the top 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.250
 the hose will be connected to the module 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.250
 fuel supply 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.449
 after pairing two parts another machine 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:25.449
 bends the edges of afghanistan 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:28.709
 all this gives engineers and more 

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:31.860
 free space 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.379
 each tank is checked for seepage 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.090
 plunging into the year closing all the holes 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.409
 air is pumped into the tank 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.189
 if in the light of bright lanterns appear 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.839
 air bubbles mean tank not 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:47.240
 tight 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.419
 if there are no bubbles 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.999
 undergoing inspection 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.069
 and only after that it is ready to be shipped and 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.619
 at installation on the car
