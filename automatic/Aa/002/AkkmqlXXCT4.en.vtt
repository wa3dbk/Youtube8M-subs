00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.919
 Hello dear friends, we are now 32 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.090
 and welcome you 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:29.820
 to paint flowers with our theme 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:35.160
 our aim today is about it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.309
 flower shown here we see 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.910
 You can do it yourself with the help of a circus too 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.910
 to draw 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.550
 First, we will take a few steps 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.410
 the last time shortly when we repeat 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.180
 set in the middle of the square and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.180
 first a circle 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.509
 next we stand in an ex 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.909
 arbitrary crysis 1 10 one 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.909
 bow from one side to the other 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.040
 then we are stuck at a point where they 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.560
 our bow with the railway arrives and 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.720
 repeat the whole thing until we 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.080
 the first six petals set 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.080
 to have 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.170
 then we learn how to do extra 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.170
 petals can be inserted 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.890
 we'll take it as we go about it 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.520
 insert additional petal 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.920
 we are looking for the middle between the before 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:34.040
 set flowers on the edge of our tips 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:37.910
 circle that goes with the naked eye 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.700
 on better as with the measure with 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.890
 technical aids do not fear that 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.390
 Eye is more accurate than we think 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.390
 Just try it 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.100
 Now we are in the found 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.980
 center and you only from the edge of the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.390
 previously placed leaves to the old 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.390
 in our bow 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:44.389
 We repeat this until we 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:47.439
 finished from the edge of the third place 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.439
 to the old man 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:53.680
 now we can even smaller blossoms 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.680
 put leaves 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.069
 now he will be the medium 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:29.449
 and so on you are not so long 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:36.710
 it takes one already done 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:38.229
 prepared it looks like that then 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.639
 when we are ready 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:43.449
 at the conclusion we can all still 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.449
 imagine 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.590
 then you can look like this 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.120
 Thank you for watching 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.949
 The next time I show you how to 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:17.419
 Include also the perspective with 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:20.860
 can, for example so I say goodbye 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:20.860
 Until next time
