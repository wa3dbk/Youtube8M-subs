can adjust its settings here so here are

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.020 
can adjust its settings here so here are
all<00:03:34.100> those<00:03:34.310> different<00:03:36.340> themes<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:37.580> was<00:03:37.700> talking

all those different themes I was talking

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.270 
all those different themes I was talking

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
about so you can adjust it I like the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
about so you can adjust it I like the
last<00:03:40.459> one<00:03:40.640> because<00:03:40.850> it<00:03:40.970> has<00:03:41.060> no<00:03:41.090> borders<00:03:41.870> there

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
last one because it has no borders there

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.300 
last one because it has no borders there
and<00:03:44.300> you<00:03:44.510> could<00:03:44.630> reset<00:03:45.170> auto<00:03:45.380> layout<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.160> it

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
and you could reset auto layout so it

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.710 
and you could reset auto layout so it
actually<00:03:46.459> rearranges<00:03:47.150> everything<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.630> make

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
actually rearranges everything to make

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.480 
actually rearranges everything to make
it<00:03:47.840> look<00:03:47.959> nice<00:03:48.170> and<00:03:50.620> when<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:51.709> get<00:03:52.220> everything
