00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
patterns here on top of the vegetation I

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.910 
patterns here on top of the vegetation I
like<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.210> give<00:02:02.450> casts<00:02:03.080> that<00:02:03.530> will<00:02:03.650> give<00:02:03.770> away

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920

so<00:02:07.670> I<00:02:07.700> can<00:02:07.909> cover<00:02:08.119> most<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.110> water<00:02:09.349> and<00:02:09.830> you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
so I can cover most of the water and you

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.949 
so I can cover most of the water and you
know<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:10.580> type<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:11.000> quiet<00:02:11.269> aquatic
