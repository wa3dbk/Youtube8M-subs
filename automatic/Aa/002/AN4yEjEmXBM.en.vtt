00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.380
 one 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:10.330
 Manila one 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.860
 every year the hardest point in the football manager 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.739
 because she is especially difficult 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.739
 Beginners and percent professionals so to bring together 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.939
 If you are such a coup as complicated this area is them 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.449
 First my manager plays Kik Basler quite a bit weird how many 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.190
 Stylus possibilities that are just in this area 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.580
 and l is often really only for absolute windows to hide 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.270
 We thought we would get something good this year 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.770
 and want to start with that 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.600
 the circle is important first the tactics screen here it is so Bremer 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.340
 Professionals have quite a lot of settings options 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.350
 and that others are adorned on the very simple screen where you get the "Man 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.750
 It has a few things that are really important 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.670
 and these things you can explain yourself again with the desert exactly 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.160
 let's just dump this and if you have done that you have 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.750
 ever meaningful basis Â»attitudes to the crew then 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.180
 also fit accordingly 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.380
 very important in the area it is therefore this year 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.360
 while the whole area is not as small as all frustrated though 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.570
 Lineups were frilly around the youth and everything is somehow 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.469
 overlap 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.780
 but we must have the full resolution of a unique beauty 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.270
 then you can really follow that 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.450
 lower 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.370
 The most important thing at home is that you get those prices 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.380
 not too often on calls in the past games has hurt 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.770
 fit Giant Work and Barmer GEK Oct 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.870
 to simplify the weather so that for example when going from 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.040
 Friendlies is not just a mouse click makes and then that is 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.300
 Lineup and the dance guard game system already optimized for this 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.710
 Task that means at the beginning of the season with my down and says I have as 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.170
 Play four friendlies I have game against heavy opponents in the league 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.930
 Home games by most likely to play again Mr. Dietmar Steiner 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.290
 that is, one is called the world game system one chooses the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.340
 appropriate player and one also thinks of those in the case of one 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.810
 Injury or a barrier 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.030
 because the replace so that you definitely 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.020
 for perfect system that would have been that way you just have a lot of it 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.759
 less work that makes you think 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.089
 cool thing 

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:14.129
 Of course, there are a few more things for the professionals beyond that 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.709
 built in which still goes a bit more in depth especially attacks 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.599
 So you can choose corners 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.189
 Slow or short 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.400
 you can set off with shots that I would rather immediately put you on the offensive 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.829
 or do I slow down first there is the opportunity to look now 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.069
 how are they 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.049
 So who are action areas of the players that are in parallel with the purchase over the 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.339
 Whole place or customers feel their position or reversal in Haiti 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:41.649
 Of course the most important thing is the possibility 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:45.489
 For example, a player can specify exact paths to be determined 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.959
 then runs there or solvency goes around in the other direction 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.049
 take a defensive position accordingly and I think this is a nice one 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.499
 Thing that it does not have too much kick effort one has to in principle one has his 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:58.220
 player 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.329
 to 22 especially where to move 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.059
 and then they run away too 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.839
 and in this way you have packed perfectly 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:05.829
