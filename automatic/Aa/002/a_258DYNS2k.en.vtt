00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:11.399
 Hi all 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:15.879
 at the request of many says this tutorial on how to remove guil 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.779
 of videos in high quality 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.439
 this is very easy and this time he will teach you how to capture it from a 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.000
 page up how to convert it here 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.009
 for this we will only need two programs 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.490
 the jamper campoo and adobe photoshop cs3 or cds 4 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.020
 I recommend that you look for them exportable 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.380
 once they have the programs they go to exchange 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.380
 this one will not serve to capture the video from youtube 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.070
 this step is optional because if you do not want to do it no more important devised 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.780
 from your pc 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.010
 in the piper cam 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.940
 we go to the select region button and select the region or space 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 who want to record 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.439
 we do this playing well 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.520
 at the beginning and at the end of the region that we want to select 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.259
 once done we headed again nothing intercam 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.129
 we click on the start network button and it will start recording 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.670
 Since they have recorded what they want, they go to the country and give them these challenges. 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.140
 immediately save them the video 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.020
 they go to the folder that has by default the country but also to 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.000
 save the videos 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.680
 it is in these positive moments including seven will keep them a document 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.810
 if what they want is to record videos from a page and make it upload this 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.030
 program is the ideal as they save them by default without audio 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.870
 now we will proceed to edit the video 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.750
 As I said before, you do not need to capture the video, but rather 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.230
 can start with the wind from this step 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.879
 open a video editor whatever they have and avoid the video 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.259
 leaving only the treatment they want as bic 

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.349
 and if they do so, do not forget to remove the audio 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:21.779
 I will not stop to explain in this step since I already explained my tutorial 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.779
 past how to make money easy and fast 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.609
 Be sure to export the video fragment at least Senate 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:31.179
 since if not 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:33.739
 will not recognize the photoshop 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.879
 since we have our video we open photoshop cs3 or cds 4 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.879
 because if not, what we're going to do will not work 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.409
 I do not have portable so that's why these messages appear to me at the beginning 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.379
 Once here we will open and open our video 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.519
 here it will tell you that the pixels are incorrect and asks them if they want 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.449
 fix 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.449
 you say no 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:11.889
 very well since they have the imported video they go the file menu and they 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.159
 they give the option to save for the judge and devices 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.609
 in these controls manipulate we have the size of the image 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.779
 I'll put him 400 wide and he just looks for the height 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.989
 and then they give you to understand 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.129
 once they are satisfied with the size they give you to save and they 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.129
 select the destination 

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:47.539
 and here we have our team 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.449
 I recommend that you save the step of capturing the screen and better 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:57.550
 import a video from your PC since the quality decreases enough 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:08.929
 this second I took it out of a mp4 video if they look good has better quality than 

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:11.759
 the one we did capturing the screen 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:15.099
 but good that already left it to his whim 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.099
 do not forget to subscribe to my channel 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.759
 agencies 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.569
 this has not been easy 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:33.669
 almost nothing
