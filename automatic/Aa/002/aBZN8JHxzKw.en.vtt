00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.949 
were not so great like Engadget's but I
tend<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.640> think<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:07.120> some<00:03:07.299> of<00:03:07.330> these<00:03:07.630> gamers

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
tend to think that some of these gamers

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.390 
tend to think that some of these gamers
don't<00:03:08.380> know<00:03:08.530> anything<00:03:08.739> about<00:03:08.920> audio<00:03:09.340> and

it<00:03:39.130> feels<00:03:39.340> very<00:03:39.549> nice<00:03:40.329> I<00:03:40.630> like<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:41.019> design

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
it feels very nice I like the design

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.590 
it feels very nice I like the design
some<00:03:41.920> things<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.310> note<00:03:42.549> are<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.420> does

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
some things to note are that this does

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.870 
some things to note are that this does
have<00:03:43.780> passive<00:03:44.170> noise<00:03:44.320> reduction<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.790> we

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
have passive noise reduction and we

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.229 
have passive noise reduction and we
mentioned<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.239> retractable<00:03:46.660> boom<00:03:46.870> mic<00:03:47.170> and

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
mentioned a retractable boom mic and

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.910 
mentioned a retractable boom mic and
yeah<00:03:49.239> I<00:03:49.480> mean<00:03:49.660> it's<00:03:49.720> supposed<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.440> isolate

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
yeah I mean it's supposed to isolate

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.500 
yeah I mean it's supposed to isolate
audio<00:03:51.310> too<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.940> we'll<00:03:52.090> see<00:03:52.269> if<00:03:52.299> that<00:03:52.390> actually

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
audio too so we'll see if that actually

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.930 
audio too so we'll see if that actually
does<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.260> they're<00:03:53.410> on<00:03:53.590> ears<00:03:54.070> not<00:03:54.310> over<00:03:54.730> here

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
does that they're on ears not over here

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.789 
does that they're on ears not over here
so<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:55.720> might<00:03:55.900> not<00:03:55.930> work<00:03:56.079> out<00:03:56.290> as<00:03:56.470> well<00:03:56.500> but

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
so that might not work out as well but

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.170 
so that might not work out as well but
these<00:03:57.069> pads<00:03:57.340> seem<00:03:57.579> like<00:03:57.730> they<00:03:57.850> might<00:03:58.000> do<00:03:58.150> that

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
these pads seem like they might do that

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.270 
these pads seem like they might do that
very<00:03:58.569> well<00:03:58.930> and<00:03:59.230> it's<00:04:00.040> completely

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
very well and it's completely

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.610 
very well and it's completely
collapsible<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.750> you<00:04:01.870> can<00:04:01.989> see<00:04:02.109> it's<00:04:02.230> really

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
collapsible so you can see it's really

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.710 
collapsible so you can see it's really
really<00:04:03.100> made<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.400> be<00:04:03.519> on<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.970> go<00:04:04.150> then<00:04:04.690> I

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
really made to be on the go then I

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.740 
really made to be on the go then I
mentioned<00:04:05.079> that<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.260> looks<00:04:05.500> fantastic<00:04:05.680> and

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
mentioned that it looks fantastic and

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.870 
mentioned that it looks fantastic and
yeah<00:04:07.750> that's<00:04:08.019> this<00:04:08.799> is<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.190> headset<00:04:09.639> right

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
yeah that's this is the headset right

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.090 
yeah that's this is the headset right
here<00:04:10.209> so<00:04:10.480> now<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.989> headset<00:04:11.440> on<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.920> side

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
here so now the headset on the side

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
micro USB here snaps in and this just

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.499 
micro USB here snaps in and this just
snaps<00:04:39.860> onto<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.340> controller<00:04:40.789> and<00:04:41.090> then<00:04:41.389> this

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509 
snaps onto the controller and then this

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:42.969 
snaps onto the controller and then this
is<00:04:41.599> going<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.780> give<00:04:41.930> you<00:04:42.020> your<00:04:42.169> inline<00:04:42.650> mic

is going to give you your inline mic

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.770 
is going to give you your inline mic
control<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.759> only<00:04:43.940> thing<00:04:44.090> bad<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.270> can<00:04:44.509> see

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
control the only thing bad I can see

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.150 
control the only thing bad I can see
about<00:04:45.020> this<00:04:45.259> right<00:04:45.470> now<00:04:45.530> is<00:04:45.680> that<00:04:45.919> you're<00:04:46.069> not

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
about this right now is that you're not

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.320 
about this right now is that you're not
gonna<00:04:46.280> be<00:04:46.400> able<00:04:46.430> to<00:04:46.580> use<00:04:46.669> the<00:04:46.819> wireless<00:04:46.970> keypad

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
gonna be able to use the wireless keypad

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.909 
gonna be able to use the wireless keypad
if<00:04:47.569> you<00:04:47.660> have<00:04:47.870> one<00:04:48.110> and<00:04:49.960> what<00:04:50.960> happens<00:04:51.349> is<00:04:51.590> you

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
if you have one and what happens is you

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.360 
if you have one and what happens is you
also<00:04:52.190> get<00:04:52.400> an<00:04:52.810> optical<00:04:53.810> audio<00:04:54.110> adapter<00:04:54.979> so

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
also get an optical audio adapter so

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.040 
also get an optical audio adapter so
this<00:04:55.520> actually<00:04:55.729> works<00:04:56.060> over<00:04:56.449> your<00:04:56.599> optical

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
this actually works over your optical

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.040 
this actually works over your optical
cable<00:04:57.470> on<00:04:57.620> your<00:04:58.009> system<00:04:58.789> which<00:04:59.509> is<00:04:59.690> great

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
cable on your system which is great

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.260 
cable on your system which is great
because<00:05:00.289> optical<00:05:00.919> audio<00:05:01.069> TOS<00:05:01.699> link<00:05:01.970> tends<00:05:02.120> to

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
because optical audio TOS link tends to

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.420 
because optical audio TOS link tends to
be<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.449> best<00:05:02.599> sound<00:05:02.870> you<00:05:03.530> plug<00:05:03.770> this<00:05:03.919> in<00:05:04.220> to

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
be the best sound you plug this in to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.399 
be the best sound you plug this in to
the<00:05:04.940> optical<00:05:05.300> cable<00:05:05.569> which<00:05:05.690> they've<00:05:05.900> included

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
the optical cable which they've included

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:07.839 
the optical cable which they've included
a<00:05:06.650> lot<00:05:06.889> of<00:05:06.979> companies<00:05:07.280> won't<00:05:07.370> do<00:05:07.580> that<00:05:07.610> because

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
a lot of companies won't do that because

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.339 
a lot of companies won't do that because
those<00:05:08.000> cables<00:05:08.270> are<00:05:08.360> kind<00:05:08.509> of<00:05:08.569> expensive<00:05:08.810> and

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
those cables are kind of expensive and

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.450 
those cables are kind of expensive and
then<00:05:10.250> you<00:05:10.639> plug<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.180> headset<00:05:11.360> into<00:05:12.039> this<00:05:13.039> so

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
then you plug the headset into this so

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.860 
then you plug the headset into this so
you're<00:05:13.580> getting<00:05:13.669> optical<00:05:14.270> sound<00:05:14.449> if<00:05:14.750> you're

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
you're getting optical sound if you're

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.719 
you're getting optical sound if you're
playing<00:05:15.139> digital<00:05:15.889> games<00:05:16.099> which<00:05:16.340> is<00:05:16.490> awesome

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729 
playing digital games which is awesome

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.180 
playing digital games which is awesome
and<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.449> length<00:05:17.659> on<00:05:17.810> the<00:05:17.930> cable<00:05:18.110> is<00:05:18.349> extremely

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
and the length on the cable is extremely
