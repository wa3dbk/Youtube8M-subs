00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
everyone how much quicker it is for a

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.919 
everyone how much quicker it is for a
person<00:00:08.130> that<00:00:08.309> doesn't<00:00:08.429> have<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.360> Pathfinder

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
person that doesn't have the Pathfinder

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.570 
person that doesn't have the Pathfinder
ability<00:00:10.230> on<00:00:10.380> compared<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.280> person<00:00:11.460> that

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
ability on compared to the person that

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.350 
ability on compared to the person that
does<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.300> how<00:00:12.570> quick<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.170> overheats<00:00:14.130> okay<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.330> a

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
does on how quick it overheats okay so a

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.029 
does on how quick it overheats okay so a
bottom<00:00:15.750> screen<00:00:16.049> does<00:00:16.260> not<00:00:16.289> have<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.830> top

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
bottom screen does not have it top

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:35.920 
bottom screen does not have it top
screen<00:00:17.340> does<00:00:17.580> ready

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.240 

so<00:00:36.930> there's<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.260> complete<00:00:37.620> difference<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
so there's a complete difference on that

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.899 
so there's a complete difference on that
one<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.940> usually<00:00:39.390> don't<00:00:39.750> overheat<00:00:43.430> yeah<00:00:44.430> all

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
one you usually don't overheat yeah all

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.200 
one you usually don't overheat yeah all
right<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.449> I'm<00:00:45.539> gonna<00:00:45.659> show<00:00:45.780> everyone

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
right so now I'm gonna show everyone

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.670 
right so now I'm gonna show everyone
from<00:00:48.210> button<00:00:48.420> now<00:00:49.199> I'm<00:00:49.260> gonna<00:00:49.350> show<00:00:49.500> everyone

from button now I'm gonna show everyone

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.560 
from button now I'm gonna show everyone
how<00:00:49.949> much<00:00:49.980> faster<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.269> run<00:00:51.540> with

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
how much faster it is when you run with

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.310 
how much faster it is when you run with
it<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:51.899> it

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it for it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.439 
it for it
so<00:00:52.860> speed<00:00:53.640> over<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.879> little<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.089> all<00:00:54.239> right

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
so speed over a little bit all right

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.209 
so speed over a little bit all right
okay<00:00:59.059> now<00:01:00.059> there's<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.329> huge<00:01:00.690> difference<00:01:01.409> huge

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
okay now there's a huge difference huge

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.880 
okay now there's a huge difference huge
difference<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.149> almost<00:01:03.930> run<00:01:04.409> as<00:01:04.530> fast<00:01:04.710> as

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
difference I can almost run as fast as

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.810 
difference I can almost run as fast as
on<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.190> sprinting<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:07.340> this<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.490> really

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
on the sprinting so this is really

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.560 
on the sprinting so this is really
really<00:01:09.090> helpful

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
really helpful

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.340 
really helpful
like<00:01:10.050> any<00:01:10.380> map<00:01:10.679> that<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.039> a<00:01:11.070> turtle<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.360> mean<00:01:13.259> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
like any map that has a turtle I mean I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.359 
like any map that has a turtle I mean I
can<00:01:13.590> keep<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.950> with<00:01:14.100> someone<00:01:14.280> that's

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
can keep up with someone that's

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.389 
can keep up with someone that's
sprinting<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.179> as<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.530> see<00:01:16.800> there's<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
sprinting so as you can see there's a

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.340 
sprinting so as you can see there's a
huge<00:01:17.729> difference<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.270> he's<00:01:18.539> all<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.259> way

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
huge difference because he's all the way

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.969 
huge difference because he's all the way
back<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:19.800> all<00:01:20.729> right<00:01:20.789> so<00:01:21.710> we're<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.920> of

back there all right so we're kind of

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.169 
back there all right so we're kind of
using<00:01:23.789> two<00:01:24.539> hands<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:25.860> controllers<00:01:26.399> so<00:01:29.179> I'll

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
using two hands to controllers so I'll

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.460 
using two hands to controllers so I'll
be<00:01:30.300> able<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.479> catch<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.690> to<00:01:30.869> him<00:01:31.110> now<00:01:31.289> I'm<00:01:31.380> gonna

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
now here's a speed boost and damage

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.180 
now here's a speed boost and damage
boost<00:01:57.020> I'm<00:01:58.020> gonna<00:01:58.259> show<00:01:58.500> everyone<00:01:58.800> what<00:01:59.099> is

boost with a turret so they're gonna

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.210 
boost with a turret so they're gonna

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.350 

all<00:04:55.840> right<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.440> I<00:04:57.040> don't<00:04:57.730> know<00:04:58.060> if<00:04:58.180> this<00:04:58.330> is

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
all right so I don't know if this is

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.520 
all right so I don't know if this is
gonna<00:04:58.480> make<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:58.660> difference<00:04:58.810> but<00:04:59.140> I<00:04:59.200> still<00:04:59.380> find

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
gonna make a difference but I still find

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.490 
gonna make a difference but I still find
out<00:04:59.710> if<00:04:59.800> it's<00:04:59.950> time<00:05:00.190> we'll<00:05:00.400> just<00:05:00.520> put<00:05:00.670> it<00:05:00.760> out

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
out if it's time we'll just put it out

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.430 
out if it's time we'll just put it out
payment<00:05:02.500> at<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:02.950> mill<00:05:03.100> over<00:05:03.220> the<00:05:03.280> rock<00:05:04.170> we<00:05:05.170> go

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.470 

so<00:05:08.440> that's<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.710> same<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:09.250> now<00:05:09.700> you<00:05:09.760> know<00:05:10.090> that

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
so that's the same so now you know that

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.900 
so that's the same so now you know that
that<00:05:10.690> doesn't<00:05:11.140> matter

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
that doesn't matter

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.790 
that doesn't matter
it<00:05:12.910> only<00:05:13.090> matters<00:05:13.390> about<00:05:13.990> anything<00:05:14.470> that's<00:05:14.680> a

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
it only matters about anything that's a

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.920 
it only matters about anything that's a
turret<00:05:15.160> but<00:05:15.940> we'll<00:05:16.060> leave<00:05:16.210> my<00:05:16.360> buddy<00:05:16.570> there

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
turret but we'll leave my buddy there

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:23.430 
turret but we'll leave my buddy there
we'll<00:05:17.890> fly<00:05:18.130> back<00:05:18.400> over<00:05:18.430> here<00:05:21.450> what<00:05:22.450> I<00:05:22.780> do<00:05:23.020> know
