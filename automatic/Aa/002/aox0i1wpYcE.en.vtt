 to the cookies and the ingredients for 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.620
 the cookies are a cup and a half of 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.540
 butter, this is margarine, but 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.239
 it did not work two cups of sugar 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.700

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.199
 teaspoons baking powder 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.600
 the big thing the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 put all the butter that we said and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.920
 then we add the two cups of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.600
 sugar impalpable since I did that I'm going to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.740
 stir everything up very well so that we 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.740
 be well mixed 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.899
 add the egg I will break the eggs 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.670
 very carefully and I will put the 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.290
 four inside the bowl 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.290
 so the vanilla extract that 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.479
 Smells delicious truth and now 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.460
 stir all super medicare well 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.189
 on another plate I will put the 5 cups of 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.439
 flour a teaspoon of salt and then you 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.030
 I'm going to put the 2 teaspoons of powder 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.670
 to bake 12 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.310
 and I'm going to make sure it's that good 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.930
 scrambled and now I'm going to add this 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.210
 line we just made to the mix 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.479
 we already had very carefully by 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.479
 favor 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.860
 ok here comes the part a bit difficult 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.420
 let's mix everything very well but so 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.410
 with a mixing spoon mixing 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.840
 mixing until a 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.760
 coincidence like this is going to be a bit 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.890
 tired for your arms but they will have 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.440
 now muscle without having had row of 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.020
 fitness center 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.020
 that I have muscles but yes 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.640
 in the refrigerator to cool with 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.590
 something hiding the leave it right there one or 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.760
 two hours but if you can leave it all 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.440
 much better night 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.540
 ok now the wax paper I'm going to scatter 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.540
 well a lot of flour and this is going to be our 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.700
 workspace cookies after you 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.700
 The only thing he does is grab a piece of 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.600
 the plasticine mass that we made and throw 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.120
 I made it to our wax paper later 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.860
 we crush well 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.290
 and we will use our cutter 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.569
 cookies and we just press it 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.280
 about our mass so it's going to 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.799
 cut the cookie alone and nothing more 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.780
 removing the excess of the edges and that 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.879
 they return it to the bowl to do more 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.709
 cookies if they have many counters 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.209
 figures can do so many shapes 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.099
 different for this occasion only 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.099
 area of ​​circle and square 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.629
 since it has already cut its clients already 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.540
 they're ready to bake it so I'm going 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.400
 to put more paper in a container 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.650
 wax and I'm going to put the cookies on top 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.180
 carefully and now ready to get 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.090
 baked so they open the oven with 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.810
 very careful and put cookies 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.700
 we leave in the oven at 180 degrees 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.080
 approximately 15 minutes but 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.170
 you are shrinking a bit in 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.480
 little bit so they do not burn 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.830
 since they are ready, we take them out 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.050
 oven and we have many cookies ready 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.610
 to be decorated with colored bitumen 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.410
 they just put a line like that 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.720
 around the cookie to make it your 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.520
 margin and then also fill and 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.020
 spreading the bitumen throughout the 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.239
 cookie since they have their cookie 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.730
 covered like that with the colored bitumen is 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.190
 what's interesting about writing the 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.560
 lyrics in a duya I put the kind of 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.540
 bitumen that says it's for margins and 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.700
 to make cake roses because it's 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.410
 harder and with much care and little to 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.360
 little I'm going to write here that 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.560
 it means eating me what they said 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.519
 the cookies in the book and in the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.519
 alice movie 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.030
 and with this we have ready these 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.300
 delicious cookies ready to make us 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.300
 grow
