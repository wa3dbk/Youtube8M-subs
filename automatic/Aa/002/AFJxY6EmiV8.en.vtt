the<00:00:24.810> tension<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.500> really<00:00:26.160> really<00:00:26.699> hard<00:00:27.029> at<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the tension is really really hard at the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:54.220 
the tension is really really hard at the
MGM<00:00:27.480> Grand

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.240 

I<00:00:54.579> don't<00:00:55.579> like<00:00:55.700> it<00:00:56.020> the<00:00:57.020> first<00:00:57.500> fight<00:00:57.739> ended<00:00:58.160> in

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
I don't like it the first fight ended in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.310 
I don't like it the first fight ended in
dominating<00:00:58.610> fashion<00:00:58.700> with<00:00:59.300> and<00:00:59.840> cracked<00:01:00.170> it

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
dominating fashion with and cracked it

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.200 
dominating fashion with and cracked it
on<00:01:00.410> top<00:01:01.780> 11<00:01:02.780> from<00:01:02.960> TKO<00:01:03.620> I<00:01:03.949> believe<00:01:04.190> both<00:01:04.940> round

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
on top 11 from TKO I believe both round

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.710 
on top 11 from TKO I believe both round
TKO<00:01:05.360> and<00:01:06.550> I'm<00:01:07.550> not<00:01:07.729> really<00:01:07.880> a<00:01:07.970> big<00:01:08.270> fan<00:01:08.330> of<00:01:08.510> that

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
TKO and I'm not really a big fan of that

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.170 
TKO and I'm not really a big fan of that
my<00:01:08.990> coming<00:01:09.320> up<00:01:09.440> I<00:01:09.619> mean<00:01:09.800> I<00:01:10.040> know<00:01:10.250> that<00:01:10.490> your

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
my coming up I mean I know that your

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.400 
my coming up I mean I know that your
father<00:01:11.330> wants<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:11.660> prove<00:01:11.780> a<00:01:11.840> point<00:01:11.930> that<00:01:12.170> the

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
father wants to prove a point that the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.170 
father wants to prove a point that the
wait<00:01:12.560> may<00:01:13.100> have<00:01:13.250> affected<00:01:13.520> him<00:01:13.820> but<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.090> don't

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
wait may have affected him but I don't

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.969 
wait may have affected him but I don't
think<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.479> much<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.380> think<00:01:15.590> what<00:01:15.680> you<00:01:15.770> see

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
think that much I think what you see

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.640 
think that much I think what you see
wasn't<00:01:16.910> exactly<00:01:17.420> what<00:01:18.229> you're<00:01:18.350> going<00:01:18.440> to<00:01:18.530> get

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
wasn't exactly what you're going to get

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.740 
wasn't exactly what you're going to get
in<00:01:18.830> this<00:01:18.950> next<00:01:19.190> fight<00:01:19.430> I<00:01:19.850> think<00:01:20.540> Manny

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
in this next fight I think Manny

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.840 
in this next fight I think Manny
Pacquiao<00:01:21.140> in<00:01:21.710> fact<00:01:21.979> should<00:01:22.160> pursue<00:01:22.550> a<00:01:22.580> flight

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
Pacquiao in fact should pursue a flight

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.550 
Pacquiao in fact should pursue a flight
will<00:01:23.060> cynical<00:01:23.960> gravity<00:01:24.350> because<00:01:25.280> not<00:01:25.970> only

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
will cynical gravity because not only

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.740 
will cynical gravity because not only
young<00:01:27.560> gun<00:01:27.770> he's<00:01:27.979> excellent<00:01:28.610> fighter<00:01:28.789> and<00:01:29.060> he

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
young gun he's excellent fighter and he

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.770 
young gun he's excellent fighter and he
may<00:01:30.350> have<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.190> physical<00:01:32.000> attributes<00:01:32.570> that

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
may have the physical attributes that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.960 
may have the physical attributes that
parallel<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:34.009> avoid<00:01:34.369> Mayweather<00:01:34.700> if<00:01:34.820> he's

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
parallel to avoid Mayweather if he's

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.520 
parallel to avoid Mayweather if he's
planning<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:35.360> pursue<00:01:35.570> that<00:01:35.810> by<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.050> reporter

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
planning to pursue that by the reporter

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.650 
planning to pursue that by the reporter
so<00:01:36.770> I<00:01:37.039> think<00:01:37.399> the<00:01:37.670> mood<00:01:37.850> Randy<00:01:38.060> makes<00:01:38.450> sense

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
so I think the mood Randy makes sense

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.430 
so I think the mood Randy makes sense
that<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:38.990> young<00:01:39.229> guy<00:01:40.960> I'm<00:01:41.960> not<00:01:42.140> going<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.320> get

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
that a young guy I'm not going to get

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.499 
that a young guy I'm not going to get
into<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.740> race<00:01:43.070> issue<00:01:43.369> but<00:01:43.759> that's<00:01:44.270> something

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
into the race issue but that's something

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.270 
into the race issue but that's something
that<00:01:44.720> could<00:01:45.229> be<00:01:45.350> addressed<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.920> if<00:01:46.130> people

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
that could be addressed to it if people

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.150 
that could be addressed to it if people
that's<00:01:47.210> what<00:01:47.300> they<00:01:47.360> want<00:01:47.600> to<00:01:47.660> see<00:01:47.810> but<00:01:48.440> that's

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
that's what they want to see but that's

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.240 
that's what they want to see but that's
that<00:01:49.520> my<00:01:49.670> it<00:01:49.729> makes<00:01:49.940> more<00:01:50.090> sense<00:01:50.149> but

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
that my it makes more sense but

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.730 
that my it makes more sense but
I<00:01:52.310> don't<00:01:52.490> know<00:01:52.550> if<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.730> makes<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.940> dollar<00:01:53.330> so

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
I don't know if it makes a dollar so

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.180 
I don't know if it makes a dollar so
doesn't<00:01:54.740> make<00:01:54.830> sense<00:01:54.980> right<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:57.170> would<00:01:57.980> have<00:01:58.040> to

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
doesn't make sense right I would have to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.590 
doesn't make sense right I would have to
agree<00:01:58.220> i<00:01:58.430> don't<00:01:58.910> think<00:01:59.060> i<00:01:59.120> want<00:01:59.300> to<00:01:59.390> see<00:01:59.480> the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
agree i don't think i want to see the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.570 
agree i don't think i want to see the
code<00:01:59.780> or<00:01:59.900> two<00:02:00.050> because<00:02:00.260> i<00:02:00.590> think<00:02:00.860> photo<00:02:01.250> did

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
code or two because i think photo did

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.980 
code or two because i think photo did
his<00:02:01.700> best<00:02:01.880> already<00:02:02.210> in<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.390> fight<00:02:02.660> and<00:02:02.840> was

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
his best already in that fight and was

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.490 
his best already in that fight and was
somewhat<00:02:03.260> he<00:02:03.320> could<00:02:03.500> do<00:02:04.180> 147<00:02:05.180> with<00:02:06.020> packed<00:02:06.380> a

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
somewhat he could do 147 with packed a

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.109 
somewhat he could do 147 with packed a
oh<00:02:06.530> it's<00:02:06.800> nothing<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.729> going<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.910> be<00:02:07.970> a<00:02:08.000> huge

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
oh it's nothing is going to be a huge

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.850 
oh it's nothing is going to be a huge
difference<00:02:08.420> or<00:02:08.690> turn<00:02:08.990> out<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.470> way<00:02:09.560> did<00:02:09.770> in
