00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:29.630 

Kevin<00:00:20.939> wherever<00:00:22.189> and<00:00:27.769> so<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.920> game<00:00:29.160> mode<00:00:29.429> in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
crunchyroll every single week I think

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.290

that<00:00:49.710> season<00:00:49.980> finale<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> just<00:00:50.399> came<00:00:50.520> out<00:00:50.730> but

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.939 
that season finale I just came out but
they<00:00:51.570> made<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> video<00:00:51.870> game<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
they made a video game for it so if you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
they made a video game for it so if you
haven't<00:00:53.129> seen<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> show<00:00:53.600> then<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.719> might<00:00:54.870> not

know<00:00:55.199> what's<00:00:55.350> going<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:55.920> basically<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
know what's going on but basically the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.490 
know what's going on but basically the
concept<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.239> there's<00:00:57.690> these<00:00:57.840> Titans<00:00:58.289> and

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
concept is that there's these Titans and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.619 
concept is that there's these Titans and
they're<00:00:59.309> running<00:00:59.489> around<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.760> city<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.270> your
