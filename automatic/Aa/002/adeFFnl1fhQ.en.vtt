00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
highly recommend it next we need to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160 
highly recommend it next we need to
choose<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.280> table<00:01:02.640> layout<00:01:02.840> for<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.899> video

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
going to choose the no overlap option

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.450 
going to choose the no overlap option
because<00:01:07.710> my<00:01:07.830> tables<00:01:08.130> will<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.340> be

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
because my tables will not be

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.609 
because my tables will not be
overlapping<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.320> finally<00:01:10.320> you'll<00:01:10.439> need<00:01:10.560> to

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
overlapping and finally you'll need to

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.289
