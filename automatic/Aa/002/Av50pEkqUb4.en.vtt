hi folks we've got a hose in place of

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.950 
hi folks we've got a hose in place of
running<00:00:05.220> some<00:00:05.400> clean<00:00:06.150> water<00:00:06.359> into<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.839> ends

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
running some clean water into the ends

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.669 
running some clean water into the ends
of<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.230> fleshie<00:00:07.730> in<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.849> last<00:00:09.059> video<00:00:09.679> obviously

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
of a fleshie in the last video obviously

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.900 
of a fleshie in the last video obviously
where<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.010> take<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.400> top<00:00:12.120> censors<00:00:12.570> out<00:00:13.910> drain

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
where we take the top censors out drain

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.170 
where we take the top censors out drain
the<00:00:15.059> block<00:00:16.279> now<00:00:17.279> look<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:18.119> is

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
the block now look at this this is

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.670 
the block now look at this this is
what's<00:00:18.510> just<00:00:18.750> come<00:00:18.810> out<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.260> sanding

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
what's just come out of the sanding

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.650 
what's just come out of the sanding
block<00:00:23.449> doesn't<00:00:24.449> want<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.750> good<00:00:25.080> then<00:00:26.660> we're

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
block doesn't want it to good then we're

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.630 
block doesn't want it to good then we're
just<00:00:27.689> gonna<00:00:27.960> take<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.349> fighters<00:00:28.980> apply<00:00:29.310> shot

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
just gonna take the fighters apply shot

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.099 
just gonna take the fighters apply shot
here<00:00:29.849> since<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.240> don't<00:00:30.390> want<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.599> get<00:00:30.689> water

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
here since we don't want to get water

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.940 
here since we don't want to get water
down<00:00:31.820> but<00:00:33.020> we<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.290> see<00:00:35.420> it's<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.510> little<00:00:36.950> silly

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
down but we can see it's a little silly

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.480 
down but we can see it's a little silly
there<00:00:39.860> see

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.490 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.890 

you<00:00:44.970> got<00:00:45.150> water<00:00:45.360> drag<00:00:45.720> the<00:00:45.870> bell<00:00:46.550> flush<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.730> out

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.010 

pretty<00:00:51.900> well<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:53.360> we're<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.390> gonna<00:00:54.630> let<00:00:54.840> this

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
pretty well so we're just gonna let this

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.100 
pretty well so we're just gonna let this
run<00:00:55.290> proving<00:00:55.830> get<00:00:56.820> all<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.060> nasty<00:00:57.600> old<00:00:57.750> junk

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
run proving get all this nasty old junk

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.200 
run proving get all this nasty old junk
out<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:59.930> for<00:01:00.930> about<00:01:00.989> 25<00:01:01.680> minutes<00:01:01.980> or<00:01:02.220> so<00:01:02.280> 2025

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
out here for about 25 minutes or so 2025

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.260 
out here for about 25 minutes or so 2025
minutes<00:01:03.540> whatever

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
minutes whatever

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:15.560 
minutes whatever
I<00:01:13.340> don't<00:01:14.340> think<00:01:14.369> certain<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> whole<00:01:15.390> lot

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
I don't think certain for the whole lot

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.749 
I don't think certain for the whole lot
pressure<00:01:15.900> through<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.410> in<00:01:17.040> fact<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.520> just

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
pressure through that in fact I just

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.969 
pressure through that in fact I just
wouldn't<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.630> cooling<00:01:19.560> systems

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
wouldn't because these cooling systems

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.900 
wouldn't because these cooling systems
are<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:21.890> not<00:01:22.890> designed<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.369> even<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.729> one

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
are not not designed I even have one

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.680 
are not not designed I even have one
about<00:01:24.090> 15<00:01:24.479> pounds<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:25.020> pressure<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.690> hey

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
about 15 pounds of to pressure so hey

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.050 
about 15 pounds of to pressure so hey
you<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.350> want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.680> careful<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.220> blow

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
you just want to be careful not blow

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.670 
you just want to be careful not blow
something<00:01:30.479> apart<00:01:30.780> accidentally<00:01:31.410> with<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
something apart accidentally with a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.710 
something apart accidentally with a
high-pressure<00:01:32.070> hose<00:01:32.430> which<00:01:32.790> pretty<00:01:33.420> unlikely

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
high-pressure hose which pretty unlikely

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.030 
high-pressure hose which pretty unlikely
on<00:01:34.110> that<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.619> one<00:01:35.490> thing<00:01:35.700> will<00:01:35.850> also<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.330> doing

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
on that but one thing will also be doing

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.880 
on that but one thing will also be doing
in<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.660> in<00:01:39.660> conjunction<00:01:40.110> with<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.740> will

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
in here in conjunction with this is will

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.279 
in here in conjunction with this is will
be<00:01:41.009> back<00:01:41.220> pushing<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> heater<00:01:41.880> core<00:01:42.229> saw<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
be back pushing the heater core saw the

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.100 
be back pushing the heater core saw the
V<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.160> also<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.910> it's<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:46.080> sure

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
V on that also know that it's for sure

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.050 
V on that also know that it's for sure
you<00:01:46.560> did<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.160> use<00:01:47.280> much<00:01:47.520> pressure<00:01:47.850> on

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you did not want to use much pressure on

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.420 
you did not want to use much pressure on
that<00:01:48.330> so<00:01:52.369> we'll<00:01:53.369> show<00:01:53.610> that

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.070
