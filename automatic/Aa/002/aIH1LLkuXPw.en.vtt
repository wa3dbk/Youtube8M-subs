00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.370
 You know, I have a secret, but that is the secret you want to share. It's like when you learn 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.660
 Something nobody knows 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.590
 Its secret is the stuffing of the skin. A variety of quick and easy treatments that 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.710
 It can take years off the appearance of your face. Very successful treatments have been 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.309
 Liquid whitening processes are called 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.500
 You know, I know I'm gonna keep getting older, so this is a way to reduce the type of 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.250
 Some shocks 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.229
 It's a way to roll back dramatically around the clock 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.970
 The fillers fill the wrinkles around the mouth and around your jaws; around your 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.290
 Eyes and anywhere you have on your face that you have wrinkles. It's a very nice way 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.979
 He worked in everything he had - nature taken away 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.300
 You are in the point of life where you need to get a face lift or do something different 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.119
 Makes me really feel, really good. I have often told the doctor that he has one par 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.060
 Without cutting my face, it made me feel pretty 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.140
 Face fillers are injected only under the skin. Booting, tightening, puffing 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.649
 And volumizing with almost no stop or pain. Epione in Dr. Simon Ourian, Harvard 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.360
 Cosmetic dermatologists trained uses the latest generation of skin fillers, which, unlike 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.149
 The collagen of the predecessor, usually does not trigger an inflammatory or immune response 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.069
 Most of them do not require sensitivity testing 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:16.069
 Injectable material, Juvederm, Restylane and Artefill are all unique qualities, and training consultant 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.630
 Epione's can help you determine which filler is right for you. Selection will be based 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.880
 On where you need the injection, the longevity you want and the budget you have 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.150
 .the chosen 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.130
 It's a little small - a little smaller than the needle stitches to your face number and 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.680
 Just do not really hurt 'cause it's just too superficial. It was exactly what 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.420
 .I was expecting it was easy and last for really long 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.939
 , Although no one can tell for some sure studies that have shown that injected injection with a substance can continue 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.930
 At least two to five years. Artefill, on the other hand, can be durable. You could expect 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.879
 Effects of Joviderm Restellin and others. Up to one year or more 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.590
 In Epione, the goal is to have every patient leave looking 5 to 10 years younger. 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.959
 It 's a very natural look. You look like I did a few years ago [laughing 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:13.870
 The same skin filler procedure is fast, a few minutes after the injection for a few minutes 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.599
 Immediately after treatment, there may be redness, swelling, tenderness or itching 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.799
 The area is treated, but temporary inconvenience usually goes away in a day 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:24.170
 Or two 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.279
 It was actually much easier than I thought it would be. I had immediate results 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:34.829
 As soon as I leave. I mean I was a bit swollen but the next day was very smooth 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.810
 . In fact I had absolutely zero lines and was filled with it 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:45.499
 There was a slight slight swelling with it, but that went away and I would say within two months 

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:51.140
 And only for three days, such as the wrinkles that were present completely fluffy from and 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.489
 I looked at the younger years 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.780
 To treat glare, you know you are getting the sparkle of Epione when you come to a person 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.019
 Who knows exactly what they are doing 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:08.599
 Thousands of these by the skin of Ourian have done Dr. injection filler. His years of experience 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.150
 In the looks and self esteem Epione pay for patients in 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.680
 Makes me feel very good. It's some minor changes but it's just - I always feel like it 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.740
 Do something nice for myself and treat myself 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.720
 It just makes you feel more confident. And out in the business world, if you are more 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.680
 Trust, then to achieve more 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.260
 What Dr. Oriyan's patients in Epione says is achieved is a very special fountain 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.550
 Of the youth 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.810
 I do not have to go for surgery, I do not have to put them under I do not have to 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.810
 It is pulled, I definitely found the secret. I woke up in the morning and my eyes went smoothly 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.870
 I have no puffs. I can go without compensation 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.150
 I feel more confident and less conscious and this is the only one less 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.430
 Something to worry about 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.379
