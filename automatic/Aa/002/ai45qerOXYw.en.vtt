stuff done if I feel like it but I

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.349 
stuff done if I feel like it but I
wasn't<00:04:04.640> aware<00:04:04.880> of<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:05.620> being<00:04:06.620> something

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
wasn't aware of that being something

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.210 
wasn't aware of that being something
here<00:04:08.359> I<00:04:08.390> was<00:04:08.690> like<00:04:08.840> man<00:04:09.170> I'm<00:04:09.590> going<00:04:09.829> super<00:04:10.190> fast

here I was like man I'm going super fast

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.599 
here I was like man I'm going super fast
now<00:04:10.940> it's<00:04:11.420> just<00:04:11.690> that<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:12.799> didn't<00:04:13.280> know<00:04:13.400> there's

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
now it's just that I didn't know there's

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:14.830 
now it's just that I didn't know there's
more<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:13.940> it

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
more to it

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.890 
more to it
hmm<00:04:15.769> all<00:04:16.150> right<00:04:17.150> well<00:04:17.840> I'm<00:04:19.269> not<00:04:20.269> able<00:04:20.479> to<00:04:20.630> tell

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
hmm all right well I'm not able to tell

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.020 
hmm all right well I'm not able to tell
at<00:04:21.079> this<00:04:21.200> point<00:04:21.289> of<00:04:21.709> peak<00:04:21.919> I'm<00:04:22.400> guessing<00:04:22.880> it's

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
at this point of peak I'm guessing it's

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.450 
at this point of peak I'm guessing it's
all<00:04:23.240> upfront<00:04:23.810> damage<00:04:24.620> I'm<00:04:24.800> not<00:04:24.919> comparing<00:04:25.250> to

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
all upfront damage I'm not comparing to

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.110 
all upfront damage I'm not comparing to
stats<00:04:25.700> with<00:04:25.940> like<00:04:26.090> Daniel<00:04:26.479> Bryan

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
stats with like Daniel Bryan

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.340 
stats with like Daniel Bryan
but<00:04:28.050> uh<00:04:28.310> who<00:04:29.310> has<00:04:29.760> really<00:04:30.270> high<00:04:30.419> damage<00:04:30.840> well

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
but uh who has really high damage well

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.219 
but uh who has really high damage well
he's<00:04:31.650> pretty<00:04:31.860> good<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.370> mean<00:04:33.180> he'll<00:04:33.900> get<00:04:34.050> better

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
he's pretty good I mean he'll get better

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.000 
he's pretty good I mean he'll get better
over<00:04:34.620> time<00:04:35.180> that's<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.530> that's<00:04:37.530> probably

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
over time that's it that's probably

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.410 
over time that's it that's probably
pretty<00:04:38.639> underwhelming<00:04:39.360> but<00:04:39.600> that's<00:04:39.990> alright
