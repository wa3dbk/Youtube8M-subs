00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.300
 This one is missing a little jeep from Mass and 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.059

 Brazil and will enter this segment of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.220
 surf is if there were compacts here in brazil 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.390
 Where is it 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.119
 it's a segment that's doing a lot 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.369
 success playing a lot and has sales right 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.230
 many competitors in this segment then 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.230

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.210
 uai 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.010
 I can not even pronounce his name when 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.309
 He comes to Brazil and they will change that. 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.350
 name and I'll put another name on it, right? 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.579
 A very odd name even there the car he 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.710
 It's already out there. 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.010
 since last year it's not just the issue 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.840
 nissan even want to bring forth that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.309
 is a segment that is pumping not 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:56.160
 bring a car and this one will turn 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.309
 that 2.0 engine with cvt exchange 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 many people like the exchange cvt esse 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.320
 compact suv segment 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.250
 here in Brazil you do not have any exchange 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.439
 cvt 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.450
 detail the interior of the car here is with 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.310
 but if you have Brazil and you 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.070
 have automatic gearbox 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:20.060
 then it would be a first in the segment with 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:24.240
 giant cvt solar glass exchange 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.939
 Nissan has officially said that it will 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.100
 bring this car here but tell 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.829
 That's going to bring him to really come here. 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.810
 it will take years 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.560
 We'll see and there's another one that's going to 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.490

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.710

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.689
 it will be released now in china is 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.460
 that it is and then it will be released on 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.250
 the rest of the world will also 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.149
 compact suv segment here in brazil 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.340
 I saw that 1.6 engine from hyundai 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.820
 still uses in hb 20 here in brazil and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.829
 some of her cars is the engine that is already 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.170
 here in the market for some time so it goes 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.770
 be nothing new this car comes to 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.060

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.489

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.170
 so there are two more models that can 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.349
 to arrive 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.569
 nissan is already sure to arrive and the 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:22.370
 which can also come from which can increase 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.010
 in the options of the segment that is booming 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.780
