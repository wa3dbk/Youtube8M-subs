 like this book 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.769
 to make a diary we need 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.760
 cardboard plain paper or paper 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.630

 actually paper tissue white paper 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.020
 or squared paper for starters I'm 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.729
 I cut two rectangles of 2 seconds 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.060
 half by three and a half centimeters 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.759
 and one rectangle of 3 seconds 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.119
 half a centimeter to half a centimeter 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:33.259
 take a piece of cloth on the wrong side 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.780
 up and lay out the cut parts on 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.100
 tissues 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.560
 large rectangles should be placed 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.280
 at a distance of about 1 and a half 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.680
 millimeter from a small rectangle 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.030
 when I laid out 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.950
 rectangles on the fabric I will fix them 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.250
 with a small amount of glue 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.250
 pva 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.530
 now i will cut the corners 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.319
 and glue the fabric to the cardboard 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.250
 it is very important to coat the corners well 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.840
 so that in the corners is good fabric 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.840
 taped and not bristled 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.450

 4 and 9 centimeters by three centimeters 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.609
 putting two centimeters two millimeters 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:06.090
 on each side I draw two lines 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:09.720
 Now I take sewed and put a ruler 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:18.940

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:23.980
 scratching with an awl line it will help 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.889
