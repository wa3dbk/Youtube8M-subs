and<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:43.270> is<00:02:43.330> also<00:02:43.780> true<00:02:44.020> when<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.410> blend<00:02:45.010> it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
and this is also true when you blend it

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.940 
and this is also true when you blend it
all<00:02:45.280> on<00:02:45.400> your<00:02:45.490> face<00:02:45.780> I'm<00:02:46.780> not<00:02:47.050> sure<00:02:47.320> if<00:02:47.650> there's

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
all on your face I'm not sure if there's

another color that will match with my
skin<00:02:50.920> better<00:02:51.190> but<00:02:51.880> this<00:02:52.000> one<00:02:52.300> seems<00:02:52.660> like<00:02:52.959> it's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
skin better but this one seems like it's

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.830 
skin better but this one seems like it's
too<00:02:53.770> light<00:02:53.980> for<00:02:54.010> Miss<00:02:54.340> King<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.209> looks<00:02:55.630> a

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
too light for Miss King and it looks a

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.370 
too light for Miss King and it looks a
little<00:02:55.959> bit<00:02:56.140> ashy<00:02:56.380> at<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.190> Thomas<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.510> pull<00:02:59.050> on

little bit ashy at the Thomas to pull on
my<00:02:59.620> skin<00:03:00.040> tone<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:02.050> that's<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.950> color<00:03:03.160> right

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.509 
my skin tone so that's a color right
there<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:04.440> when<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.590> blend<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.040> out

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519

I'm skin food is really creamy so it's a

really really glowy finish finish on
your<00:03:17.530> skin<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:19.420> just<00:03:19.690> matches<00:03:19.959> with<00:03:20.410> my

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440

skin very well and at the same time it

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.000 
skin very well and at the same time it
really<00:03:23.200> brightens<00:03:23.800> up<00:03:24.100> my<00:03:24.160> skin<00:03:24.640> tone<00:03:26.010> so

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
really brightens up my skin tone so

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.830 
really brightens up my skin tone so
that's<00:03:27.250> skin<00:03:27.820> food<00:03:28.090> when<00:03:28.510> it's<00:03:28.780> blend<00:03:29.170> out<00:03:29.380> and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
that's skin food when it's blend out and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.930 
that's skin food when it's blend out and
for<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.380> hand<00:03:32.650> skiing<00:03:33.040> since<00:03:33.280> it's<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.670> very

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
for the hand skiing since it's a very

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.229 
for the hand skiing since it's a very
watery<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:35.140> coverage<00:03:35.650> is<00:03:35.890> not<00:03:36.310> as<00:03:36.700> good<00:03:36.940> as

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
watery the coverage is not as good as

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.220 
watery the coverage is not as good as
skiing<00:03:37.540> food<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:40.239> can<00:03:40.390> expect<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.959> use<00:03:41.200> a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
skiing food and you can expect to use a

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.040 
skiing food and you can expect to use a
little<00:03:41.709> bit<00:03:41.800> more<00:03:42.160> product<00:03:42.519> since<00:03:43.090> it's<00:03:43.660> not

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
little bit more product since it's not

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.729 
little bit more product since it's not
as<00:03:44.730> blendable<00:03:45.730> on<00:03:46.000> if<00:03:46.870> we're<00:03:47.080> skiing<00:03:47.350> food<00:03:47.590> a

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
as blendable on if we're skiing food a

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.860 
as blendable on if we're skiing food a
little<00:03:48.160> bit<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.430> product<00:03:48.730> goes<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:49.060> long<00:03:49.360> way

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
little bit of product goes a long way

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.680 
little bit of product goes a long way
but<00:03:50.320> since<00:03:50.650> hand<00:03:51.190> skiing<00:03:51.580> it's<00:03:51.820> more<00:03:52.360> of<00:03:52.660> a

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
but since hand skiing it's more of a

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.229 
but since hand skiing it's more of a
watery<00:03:53.410> consistency<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.459> might<00:03:54.880> have<00:03:55.090> to

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
watery consistency so you might have to

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.870 
watery consistency so you might have to
use<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.480> little<00:03:56.019> bit<00:03:56.110> more<00:03:56.280> for<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.459> coverage

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
use a little bit more for the coverage

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.680 
use a little bit more for the coverage
so<00:03:58.560> that's<00:03:59.560> hence

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
so that's hence

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.840 
so that's hence
and<00:04:00.840> if<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:01.770> compare<00:04:02.190> these<00:04:02.340> two<00:04:02.670> you

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
and if you just compare these two you

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.390 
and if you just compare these two you
can<00:04:03.000> still<00:04:03.330> kind<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.750> see<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.470> ashy<00:04:04.680> undertone

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
can still kind of see the ashy undertone

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.830 
can still kind of see the ashy undertone
for<00:04:05.790> hand<00:04:06.270> scheme<00:04:06.800> so<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:08.520> skin-food<00:04:09.209> shades

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
skincare sight of these BB creams but

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.630 
skincare sight of these BB creams but
would<00:07:14.780> I<00:07:14.810> buy<00:07:15.080> this<00:07:15.140> again<00:07:15.590> yes<00:07:16.160> I<00:07:16.370> would

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:16.640 
would I buy this again yes I would

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.090 
would I buy this again yes I would
probably<00:07:17.150> at<00:07:17.480> the<00:07:17.630> same<00:07:17.840> price<00:07:18.110> at<00:07:18.620> $15<00:07:19.900> but<00:07:21.100> if

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100 
probably at the same price at $15 but if

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.220 
probably at the same price at $15 but if
it<00:07:22.400> goes<00:07:22.550> any<00:07:22.820> higher<00:07:22.880> than<00:07:23.300> that<00:07:23.480> I<00:07:23.720> will

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
it goes any higher than that I will

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.320 
it goes any higher than that I will
probably<00:07:24.560> still<00:07:25.040> go<00:07:25.160> back<00:07:25.340> to<00:07:25.550> skiing<00:07:25.850> food<00:07:26.060> I

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330 
probably still go back to skiing food I

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.740 
probably still go back to skiing food I
think<00:07:26.630> in<00:07:27.020> many<00:07:27.290> different<00:07:28.510> areas<00:07:29.510> I<00:07:29.720> think

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:29.750 
think in many different areas I think

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.200 
think in many different areas I think
skin<00:07:30.230> food<00:07:30.500> ones<00:07:31.040> are<00:07:31.370> just<00:07:31.610> a<00:07:31.730> little<00:07:31.940> bit

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.210 
skin food ones are just a little bit

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.350 
skin food ones are just a little bit
because<00:07:32.450> of<00:07:32.930> its<00:07:33.530> consistency<00:07:34.400> coverage<00:07:34.970> and
