now<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.160> work<00:01:57.520> with<00:01:57.700> our<00:01:57.850> animation<00:01:58.479> window

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
now to work with our animation window

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.340 
now to work with our animation window
let's<00:01:59.380> start<00:01:59.530> with<00:01:59.800> our<00:01:59.920> first<00:02:00.310> layer<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:02.200> can

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
let's start with our first layer you can

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.719 
let's start with our first layer you can
see<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.770> loop<00:02:02.979> is<00:02:03.130> currently<00:02:03.550> on

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
see that the loop is currently on

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.880 
see that the loop is currently on
forever<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.540> it's<00:02:04.960> at<00:02:05.080> zero<00:02:05.110> seconds<00:02:07.890> make

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
forever and it's at zero seconds make

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.070 
forever and it's at zero seconds make
sure<00:02:08.920> all<00:02:09.429> the<00:02:09.700> other<00:02:09.880> frames<00:02:10.360> are<00:02:10.690> invisible

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
sure all the other frames are invisible

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.229
