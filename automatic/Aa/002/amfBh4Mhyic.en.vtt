00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.769
 I use this facial gel 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.769

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.960
 and a device for cleansing the skin of philips he 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.400
 deeply and delicately enough 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.199
 skin without hurting her 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.480
 and also prepare this device and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.510
 why absorb cosmetic light from 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.550
 it has two timer modes included 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.410
 also there are two nozzles 1 for normal 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.090
 skin is different for sensitive and also 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.820
 know how to peel and for 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.410
 deep pore cleansing 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.270
 helium immediately our on the brush and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.579
 gently in circular motions i 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.590
 spread it all over your face 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.530
 as well as a huge plus what is Egor here 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.329
 can be used in the shower and as I have 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.910
 said earlier he has a timer that is 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.950
 every 20 seconds he pauses and so 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:01:01.770
 most prompts that you can go to 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:01:03.329
 another zone and face and always wiping 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.880
 individual towel to 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.110
 avoid getting into different microbes and so 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.909
 as I have it now is not the best 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.490
 condition so i will use 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.310
 andal evening cleansing mask 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.970
 it cleans pores well enough 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.409
 makes skin more rested and 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.990
 put this mask will be approximately 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.710
 for 10-15 minutes until it is completely 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.710
 feeds on 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.950
 also always cleaned with tonic 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.690
 The moment I have from their son with 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.280

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.860
 combination and oily skin 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.440

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.420
 pimples using cream for the area 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.820
