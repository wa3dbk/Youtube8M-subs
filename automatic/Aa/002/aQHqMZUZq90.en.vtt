00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 first night at about three in the morning 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.319
 Only not this he goes directly on me at 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.480
 I have nothing left I have nothing 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.250
 I can do this terrible scary 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.280
 the corridor stretches endlessly 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.770
 I don't know where I don't want to run this anymore. 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.550
 not in my power anyway from death 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.859
 you won't run away 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.680
 but how did it happen I can't 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.369
 I do not want to see the death approaching 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.650
 die 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.050
 need to pull yourself together and run until 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
 run out of power to escape from this monster 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.300
 that goes to me I don't know what's waiting 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.309
 me in front of what's behind me for sure 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.730
 not happy i have to run 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.070
 Well , I'm already on the legs jerk and everything is all 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.930
 the worst will be left behind in front 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.789
 It is only the unknown and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.160
 uncertainty suits me more 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.200
 what is certain death death in agony 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.600
 the suffering that I have to endure 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.300
 since this monster will kill me not immediately 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.030
 and will tear rail crush mine 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.579
 body until my soul leaves him 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.609
 this is what will become of my soul is still 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.860
 the question seems to be he started to add pace 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.110
 faster and faster his mechanical 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.930
 theon picked up speed and it seemed like 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.689
 the monster is no longer running but hovers above the ground and 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.509
 here he already exceeded my running speed 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.000
 but still not so bad i don't know what 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.100
 waiting for me ahead maybe in a couple 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.299
 meters will be the very door that 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.240
 it will be possible to close 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.250
 rid yourself of death from suffering and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.770
 fear but for some reason she doesn't 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.619
 appears and the monster is reduced 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.840
 he has a little distance and he 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.390
 achieve its goal because it only 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.090
 wants me to suffer 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.119
 suffering like burning in fire 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.939
 but no matter how wrong my hope is with me 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.790
 I still believe in salvation like what 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.250
 salvation don't believe me breath with every 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.049
 the step gets harder and harder 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.329
 speed is getting slower and 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.909
 slower and the monster approaches everything 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.189
 closer and closer it seems he was already behind my 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.560
 back settings separated me from 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.049
 death only a miracle could help me 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.049
 for some reason but suddenly 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.910
 opened a second breath something gave me 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.770
 some more strength 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.840
 useful to be saved new 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.290
 the one who gave me these strength played with me 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.750
 evil joke i fell as if 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.510
 stumbled over something or succumbed 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.540
 and it was all that moment which I so 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.120
 feared everywhere the lights went out 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.970
 there was a little impenetrable darkness I did 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.580
 the corridor is even worse and even without a monster 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.920
 he would look no less scary and here 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.340
 my hour has come something circling around 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:45.190
 it was as if I was looking for my nose 8 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.190
 weak spots and it looks like she found them 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.000
 yes that was a dream
