00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.910 

here's<00:00:00.630> that<00:00:00.780> generator<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.319> clean<00:00:01.620> the<00:00:01.709> car

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
here's that generator I clean the car

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.100 
here's that generator I clean the car
boat<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.490> other<00:00:02.610> day<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:03.090> put<00:00:03.540> the<00:00:03.629> carburetor

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
boat the other day I put the carburetor

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.490 
boat the other day I put the carburetor
back<00:00:04.410> on<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.359> there's<00:00:06.359> still<00:00:06.629> issues<00:00:07.290> with

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
back on and there's still issues with

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.820 
back on and there's still issues with
this<00:00:07.680> generator<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.690> don't<00:00:09.690> start<00:00:09.900> up<00:00:10.139> rev<00:00:10.530> up<00:00:10.559> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
this generator I don't start up rev up a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.970 
this generator I don't start up rev up a
bit<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.219> then<00:00:12.170> just<00:00:13.170> kind<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.440> run<00:00:13.620> really

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
bit and then just kind of run really

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.430 
bit and then just kind of run really
rough<00:00:14.160> it's<00:00:14.580> spitting<00:00:15.030> gas<00:00:15.360> out<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.170> carb

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
rough it's spitting gas out of the carb

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.230 
rough it's spitting gas out of the carb
here<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.920> I've<00:00:17.130> adjusted<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.699> carb<00:00:18.000> many

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
here and I've adjusted the carb many

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.740 
here and I've adjusted the carb many
times<00:00:18.570> try<00:00:19.350> different<00:00:19.590> things<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.510> I<00:00:21.510> spoke

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
times try different things and I spoke

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.210 
times try different things and I spoke
to<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> friend<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.260> mine<00:00:22.380> who's<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> mechanic<00:00:22.740> as

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
to a friend of mine who's a mechanic as

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.759 
to a friend of mine who's a mechanic as
well<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:24.210> both<00:00:24.359> think<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.619> an

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
well and we both think that it's an

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.920 
well and we both think that it's an
internal<00:00:26.099> problem<00:00:26.460> especially<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.449> intake

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
internal problem especially the intake

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.540 
internal problem especially the intake
valve<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.439> I'm<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.830> ripping<00:00:29.400> this

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
valve so I'm going to be ripping this

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.490 
valve so I'm going to be ripping this
apart<00:00:29.939> first<00:00:30.179> I'll<00:00:30.359> show<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.689> again<00:00:30.990> what<00:00:31.410> it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
apart first I'll show you again what it

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:47.360 
apart first I'll show you again what it
does<00:00:45.200> now<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.289> can<00:00:46.530> keep<00:00:46.710> doing<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.100> all<00:00:47.340> day

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
does now you can keep doing this all day

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.880 
does now you can keep doing this all day
with<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.090> will<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.450> keep<00:00:48.719> going<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.410> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
with it it will not keep going and it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.049 
with it it will not keep going and it
keeps<00:00:50.180> blowing<00:00:51.180> back<00:00:51.510> fuel<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.670> it's<00:00:53.670> burning

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
keeps blowing back fuel and it's burning

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.310 
keeps blowing back fuel and it's burning
a<00:00:54.210> lot<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.510> oil<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.809> I'm<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.050> rip<00:00:55.199> it

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
a lot of oil so I'm going to rip it

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.529 
a lot of oil so I'm going to rip it
apart<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.280> start<00:00:56.550> by<00:00:56.670> taking<00:00:57.059> off<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> gas

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
apart and it start by taking off the gas

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.229 
apart and it start by taking off the gas
tank<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.140> did<00:00:58.320> previously<00:00:58.969> now<00:00:59.969> I'm<00:01:00.059> going

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
tank like I did previously now I'm going

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.369 
tank like I did previously now I'm going
to<00:01:00.329> take<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.809> head<00:01:01.020> off<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:02.280> 14<00:01:02.820> millimeter

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
to take the head off the 14 millimeter

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:16.610 
to take the head off the 14 millimeter
sized<00:01:04.379> saketini

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.380 

there<00:01:17.620> it<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:17.830> it's<00:01:18.130> pretty<00:01:18.430> carbon<00:01:19.000> DUP<00:01:19.180> in

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
there it is it's pretty carbon DUP in

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.260 
there it is it's pretty carbon DUP in
there<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.710> you<00:01:20.770> can<00:01:21.130> see<00:01:21.310> how<00:01:21.430> carbon<00:01:21.850> up<00:01:22.000> that

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
there so you can see how carbon up that

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.130 
there so you can see how carbon up that
engine<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.850> must<00:01:25.090> be<00:01:25.180> burning<00:01:25.479> oil<00:01:25.750> because

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
engine is it must be burning oil because

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.330 
engine is it must be burning oil because
I<00:01:26.290> can<00:01:26.500> smell<00:01:27.010> all<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:27.700> is<00:01:27.729> running<00:01:28.210> very

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
I can smell all and it is running very

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.670 
I can smell all and it is running very
carbon<00:01:30.340> up<00:01:30.490> inside<00:01:30.910> here<00:01:31.150> I<00:01:31.330> have<00:01:32.229> checked<00:01:32.530> the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
carbon up inside here I have checked the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.240 
carbon up inside here I have checked the
valve<00:01:32.920> clearance<00:01:33.660> and<00:01:34.660> it<00:01:34.869> is<00:01:35.020> six<00:01:35.530> thou<00:01:35.830> on

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
valve clearance and it is six thou on

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.380 
valve clearance and it is six thou on
the<00:01:36.880> intake<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.479> eight<00:01:38.200> on<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.560> exhaust

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the intake and eight on the exhaust

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.590 
the intake and eight on the exhaust
which<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.570> think<00:01:40.869> should<00:01:41.050> be<00:01:41.229> all<00:01:41.380> right<00:01:42.600> when

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
which I think should be all right when

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.200 
which I think should be all right when
you<00:01:43.750> turn<00:01:43.960> it<00:01:44.140> over<00:01:44.290> they<00:01:44.619> sit<00:01:44.860> open<00:01:45.040> good<00:01:45.550> and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
you turn it over they sit open good and

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.870 
you turn it over they sit open good and
shut<00:01:46.570> right<00:01:48.090> they<00:01:49.090> are<00:01:49.240> pretty<00:01:49.600> tight<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
shut right they are pretty tight the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.460 
shut right they are pretty tight the
intake<00:01:52.240> valve<00:01:52.920> seems<00:01:53.920> time<00:01:55.020> shiny<00:01:56.020> finish

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
intake valve seems time shiny finish

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.760 
intake valve seems time shiny finish
underneath<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:58.360> tells<00:01:58.750> me<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:59.229> is<00:01:59.259> shutting

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
underneath which tells me it is shutting

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.320 
underneath which tells me it is shutting
properly<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.500> I'm<00:02:02.649> going<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:02.979> decarbonize<00:02:03.759> it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
properly so I'm going to decarbonize it

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.030 
properly so I'm going to decarbonize it
with<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.720> piston<00:02:05.229> off<00:02:05.350> like<00:02:05.500> this<00:02:05.680> both

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
with the piston off like this both

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.240 
with the piston off like this both
valves<00:02:06.369> shut<00:02:07.090> tight<00:02:07.509> so<00:02:07.869> no<00:02:08.110> carbon<00:02:08.770> gets<00:02:08.979> in

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
valves shut tight so no carbon gets in

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.270 
valves shut tight so no carbon gets in
there<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.670> I'm<00:02:10.630> going<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.840> use<00:02:11.110> my<00:02:11.470> drill<00:02:11.920> with

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
there and I'm going to use my drill with

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:32.770 
there and I'm going to use my drill with
a<00:02:12.489> wire<00:02:12.700> brush<00:02:12.970> at<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.270> end

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.450 

now<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.500> it's<00:02:33.620> coming<00:02:33.860> like<00:02:34.040> that<00:02:34.220> I'm<00:02:34.370> going

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
now that it's coming like that I'm going

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.730 
now that it's coming like that I'm going
to<00:02:34.580> turn<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.940> motor<00:02:35.150> over<00:02:35.390> just<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.260> open<00:02:36.410> one

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
to turn the motor over just to open one

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.700 
to turn the motor over just to open one
valve<00:02:37.040> at<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> time<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.750> I'm<00:02:39.110> going<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.380> run<00:02:39.530> my

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
valve at a time and I'm going to run my

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.580 
valve at a time and I'm going to run my
brush<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.310> between<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:41.390> valve<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.290> seat

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
brush in between the valve and the seat

00:02:42.590 --> 00:03:02.089 
brush in between the valve and the seat
there<00:02:42.890> to<00:02:43.250> clean<00:02:43.550> in<00:02:43.790> between

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.530 

so<00:03:03.099> now<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.310> it's<00:03:03.610> all<00:03:03.910> cleaned<00:03:04.209> up<00:03:04.330> I'm

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
so now that it's all cleaned up I'm

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.270 
so now that it's all cleaned up I'm
going<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.750> air<00:03:05.019> blow<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.349> with<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.709> compressor

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
going to air blow it with the compressor

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:19.830 
going to air blow it with the compressor
to<00:03:06.489> make<00:03:06.670> sure<00:03:06.849> no<00:03:07.030> carbon<00:03:07.690> is<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.260> engine

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.809 

now<00:03:20.620> I'm<00:03:20.739> going<00:03:20.890> to<00:03:20.920> slap<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.280> back<00:03:21.610> together

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
now I'm going to slap it back together

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.080 
now I'm going to slap it back together
quickly<00:03:22.420> try<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:22.930> out<00:03:23.050> if<00:03:23.380> there's<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:23.800> problem

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
quickly try it out if there's a problem

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:47.090 
quickly try it out if there's a problem
still<00:03:25.090> I'm<00:03:25.450> going<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.170> take<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.500> apart<00:03:26.590> again

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.170 

now<00:03:48.100> I'm<00:03:48.190> just<00:03:48.310> going<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.550> hand<00:03:48.700> tighten<00:03:48.910> them

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
now I'm just going to hand tighten them

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.100 
now I'm just going to hand tighten them
up<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:55.209> I'm<00:03:55.450> going<00:03:55.600> to<00:03:55.630> try<00:03:55.870> like<00:03:56.080> this

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
up and I'm going to try like this

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.720 
up and I'm going to try like this
without<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.680> fuel<00:03:56.920> tank<00:03:57.190> because<00:03:57.459> there's<00:03:57.640> a

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
without the fuel tank because there's a

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:14.700 
without the fuel tank because there's a
lot<00:03:57.910> of<00:03:57.940> fuel<00:03:58.209> left<00:03:58.330> in<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.870> car

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.259 

so<00:04:15.710> there's<00:04:16.070> still<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.340> problem<00:04:16.609> in<00:04:16.940> there<00:04:17.090> at

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
so there's still a problem in there at

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.030 
so there's still a problem in there at
this<00:04:17.480> point<00:04:17.750> here<00:04:18.079> it's<00:04:18.380> going<00:04:18.590> to<00:04:18.650> need<00:04:18.799> more

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
this point here it's going to need more

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.759 
this point here it's going to need more
work<00:04:19.310> I<00:04:19.690> want<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.780> check<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.109> points<00:04:21.470> as<00:04:21.590> well

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
work I want to check the points as well

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.700 
work I want to check the points as well
just<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.310> make<00:04:22.340> sure<00:04:23.020> and<00:04:24.020> if<00:04:24.200> that<00:04:24.350> doesn't

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
just to make sure and if that doesn't

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.020 
just to make sure and if that doesn't
work<00:04:24.830> I'm<00:04:25.070> going<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.250> rip<00:04:25.460> the<00:04:25.640> motor<00:04:25.850> apart

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
work I'm going to rip the motor apart

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.520 
work I'm going to rip the motor apart
again<00:04:26.360> because<00:04:26.810> there<00:04:26.990> could<00:04:27.080> be<00:04:27.140> something

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
again because there could be something

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.800 
again because there could be something
side<00:04:27.980> with<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.520> camshaft<00:04:28.790> I'm<00:04:29.420> not<00:04:29.570> sure<00:04:29.750> if

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
side with the camshaft I'm not sure if

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.930 
side with the camshaft I'm not sure if
it's<00:04:29.990> got<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.230> timing<00:04:30.890> chain<00:04:30.920> this<00:04:31.280> engine<00:04:31.670> some

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
it's got a timing chain this engine some

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.820 
it's got a timing chain this engine some
did<00:04:32.240> and<00:04:33.010> maybe<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.220> timings<00:04:34.640> off<00:04:35.500> so<00:04:36.500> that's

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
did and maybe the timings off so that's

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.730 
did and maybe the timings off so that's
where<00:04:37.070> I'm<00:04:37.190> at<00:04:37.370> with<00:04:37.550> this
