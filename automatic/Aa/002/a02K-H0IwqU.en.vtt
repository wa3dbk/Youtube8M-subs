rather<00:00:38.160> than<00:00:38.280> waiting<00:00:39.210> for<00:00:39.420> something<00:00:39.780> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
rather than waiting for something to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.280 
rather than waiting for something to
happen<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.040> opponent<00:00:41.489> feels<00:00:41.760> like

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
happen and the opponent feels like

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.529 
happen and the opponent feels like
you're<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.440> allowed<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.680> miss<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.539> rather

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
you're not allowed to miss now rather

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.850 
you're not allowed to miss now rather
than<00:00:45.719> going<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.559> think<00:00:46.739> that

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
than going for it and I think that

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.150 
than going for it and I think that
combination<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:48.170> just<00:00:49.170> sort<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.410> put<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
combination can just sort of put the

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.000 
combination can just sort of put the
chances<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.690> side<00:00:51.989> plus<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.410> plate<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.860> so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
chances on my side plus a plate of so

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.069 
chances on my side plus a plate of so
many<00:00:53.190> times<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.760> know<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> court<00:00:54.870> feels

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
many times I know how the court feels

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.920 
many times I know how the court feels
that<00:00:55.760> I<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.660> an<00:00:57.780> advantage

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
that I think that that is an advantage

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.349 
that I think that that is an advantage
but<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> course<00:00:58.800> pressure<00:00:59.609> could<00:00:59.850> also<00:00:59.969> get<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
but of course pressure could also get to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.450 
but of course pressure could also get to
you<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.719> think<00:01:00.750> was<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.559> experience<00:01:02.370> I

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you but I think was the experience I

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.000 
you but I think was the experience I
have<00:01:02.640> these<00:01:02.879> days<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.510> walk<00:01:04.290> out<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.559> I'm

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
probably one of those years where it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.819 
probably one of those years where it's
not<00:01:39.000> gonna<00:01:39.180> go<00:01:39.390> well<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.170> always<00:01:40.439> did

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
not gonna go well and then it always did
