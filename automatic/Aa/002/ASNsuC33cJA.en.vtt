00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
oven I just put them on a cooling rack

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.830 
oven I just put them on a cooling rack
that<00:03:11.890> way<00:03:12.010> they<00:03:12.220> can<00:03:12.400> cool<00:03:13.030> off<00:03:13.060> before<00:03:13.510> we

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
that way they can cool off before we

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.720 
that way they can cool off before we
frost<00:03:14.080> them<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:21.100> now<00:03:21.220> we<00:03:21.250> can<00:03:21.490> make<00:03:21.580> our

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730

some coffee and I'm also adding in
vanilla<00:03:33.090> now<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.150> can<00:03:34.330> take<00:03:34.570> our<00:03:34.780> blender<00:03:35.380> and

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
vanilla now we can take our blender and

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.190 
vanilla now we can take our blender and
mix<00:03:35.860> this<00:03:35.980> up<00:03:36.190> until<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:36.790> creamed<00:03:37.210> so<00:03:37.990> once

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
mix this up until it is creamed so once

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.470 
mix this up until it is creamed so once
it<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.380> creamed<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:39.100> looks<00:03:39.310> like<00:03:39.400> this<00:03:39.730> we<00:03:40.330> can

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
it is creamed and looks like this we can

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.800 
it is creamed and looks like this we can
slowly<00:03:40.750> add<00:03:41.020> in<00:03:41.380> our<00:03:41.770> cocoa<00:03:42.190> powder<00:03:42.220> and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
slowly add in our cocoa powder and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.880 
slowly add in our cocoa powder and
confectioners<00:03:43.810> sugar<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.110> then<00:03:44.500> just<00:03:44.710> keep

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
confectioners sugar and then just keep

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.190 
confectioners sugar and then just keep
blending<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.460> and<00:03:45.610> adding<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.240> until<00:03:46.960> we<00:03:47.110> get

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
blending it and adding it until we get

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.350 
blending it and adding it until we get
the<00:03:47.350> consistency<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:48.100> we<00:03:48.430> want<00:03:48.460> and<00:03:48.910> it

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
the consistency that we want and it

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.000 
the consistency that we want and it
might<00:03:49.570> look<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.840> little<00:03:49.900> bit<00:03:50.110> crumbly<00:03:50.620> when

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
might look a little bit crumbly when

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.440 
might look a little bit crumbly when
you're<00:03:51.160> doing<00:03:51.490> it<00:03:51.640> but<00:03:51.820> as<00:03:51.910> long<00:03:51.940> as<00:03:52.210> you<00:03:52.270> keep

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
you're doing it but as long as you keep

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.170 
you're doing it but as long as you keep
mixing<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.110> will<00:03:53.290> come<00:03:53.440> out<00:03:53.590> smooth<00:03:53.890> so<00:03:54.850> for

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
mixing it it will come out smooth so for

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.230 
mixing it it will come out smooth so for
this<00:03:55.270> I'm<00:03:55.540> just<00:03:55.900> using<00:03:56.080> a<00:03:56.380> 1m<00:03:56.860> tip<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.490> my

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
this I'm just using a 1m tip and my

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.160 
this I'm just using a 1m tip and my
piping<00:03:58.630> bag<00:04:00.270> when<00:04:01.270> it<00:04:01.300> comes<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.660> piping<00:04:01.990> bags

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
piping bag when it comes to piping bags

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.800 
piping bag when it comes to piping bags
I<00:04:02.380> usually<00:04:02.710> don't<00:04:02.980> use<00:04:03.070> a<00:04:03.220> coupler<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.000> I<00:04:04.390> just

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
I usually don't use a coupler so I just

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.840 
I usually don't use a coupler so I just
put<00:04:04.990> my<00:04:05.140> tip<00:04:05.440> in<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.040> then<00:04:06.190> cut<00:04:06.430> the<00:04:06.550> end<00:04:06.700> off

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
put my tip in and then cut the end off

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.060 
put my tip in and then cut the end off
and<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.780> make<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:08.020> easier<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.770> put<00:04:08.980> the

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
and to make it easier to put the

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.220 
and to make it easier to put the
frosting<00:04:09.580> in<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.730> bag<00:04:10.000> I<00:04:10.390> like<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.960> put<00:04:11.140> the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
frosting in the bag I like to put the

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.830 
frosting in the bag I like to put the
bag<00:04:11.440> over<00:04:11.710> a<00:04:11.980> mason<00:04:12.520> jar<00:04:12.550> and<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.090> way<00:04:13.780> you

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
bag over a mason jar and that way you

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.480 
bag over a mason jar and that way you
don't<00:04:14.110> have<00:04:14.200> to<00:04:14.590> kind<00:04:14.800> of<00:04:14.860> wrestle<00:04:15.250> with<00:04:15.370> the

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
don't have to kind of wrestle with the

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.690 
don't have to kind of wrestle with the
bag<00:04:15.670> and<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.150> makes<00:04:16.330> a<00:04:16.480> lot<00:04:16.690> more<00:04:16.989> sense<00:04:17.890> and

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
bag and it makes a lot more sense and

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.280 
bag and it makes a lot more sense and
just<00:04:18.910> makes<00:04:19.090> a<00:04:19.150> lot<00:04:19.270> easier<00:04:19.660> for<00:04:19.720> yourself

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.200 

so<00:04:23.290> now<00:04:23.380> we<00:04:23.440> can<00:04:23.650> frost<00:04:23.950> our<00:04:24.220> cupcakes<00:04:24.700> and<00:04:24.970> I'm

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
so now we can frost our cupcakes and I'm

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.000 
so now we can frost our cupcakes and I'm
not<00:04:25.330> doing<00:04:25.450> anything<00:04:25.810> special<00:04:26.410> for<00:04:26.530> this<00:04:26.710> just

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
not doing anything special for this just

00:04:27.010 --> 00:05:01.720 
not doing anything special for this just
a<00:04:27.220> classic<00:04:27.730> swirl

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.970 

we<00:05:02.730> can't<00:05:03.000> have<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.390> cookie<00:05:03.780> crumble<00:05:04.260> cupcake

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
we can't have a cookie crumble cupcake

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.770 
we can't have a cookie crumble cupcake
without<00:05:05.400> the<00:05:05.610> cookies<00:05:06.060> so<00:05:06.270> now<00:05:06.420> I'm<00:05:06.570> just

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
without the cookies so now I'm just

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.050 
without the cookies so now I'm just
taking<00:05:07.110> some<00:05:07.140> Oreos<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.160> I'm<00:05:08.610> just<00:05:08.760> putting

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
taking some Oreos and I'm just putting

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.300 
taking some Oreos and I'm just putting
it<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.270> a<00:05:09.360> bag<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:09.960> make<00:05:10.020> sure<00:05:10.800> that<00:05:10.980> it<00:05:11.160> is

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
it in a bag and make sure that it is

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.490
