00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.000
 if you have not introduced it from the flesh 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.920

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.600
 we add a little bit of ground food 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.690
 and the pattern and the paprika we observe 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.230
 for later 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.230
 two 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.770
 now we will stop taking you to the flesh 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.190
 meanwhile we can live 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.120
 cutting all our ingredients 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.090
 before it does not take them 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.310
 chickpeas only in this case used in 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.409
 goal but you can use chickpeas 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.840
 fresh leaving him to spend the night 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:28.540
 previous and has added four more 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.540
 small or medium with my country 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.330
 he had cut the carrot 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.890
 pumpkin into large pieces as you see the 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.160
 potatoes also just like this in front of 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.440
 cut them a little bit in half and 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.400
 make an opening yes to make it 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.400
 also inside 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.820
 the green measures we remove the point I 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.060
 I 've cut it in half if you want 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.620
 you can take away the little girl who has 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.930
 here 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.930
 and if not something you leave as is 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.260
 once we have our meat already 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.020
 lamb marked on both sides 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.140
 we will enter to introduce all the vegetables 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.850
 that we have cut the die and the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.520
 chickpeas will be for the end because 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.220
 as they are already cooked if you use the 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.930
 fresh chickpea that you have left in 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.400
 soak in the previous night the 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.850
 procedure be brief first 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.000
 we will add the chickpeas and we will leave it 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.640
 like two hours like that with water so that 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.470
 they go and then the vegetables 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.409
 in this case the chickpeas at the end 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.360
 because we are cooked 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:50.360
 we are adding all the vegetables 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.639
 the pineapple also all the sweet potato the 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:09.259
 cauliflower cut into 3 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.259
 and our pumpkin 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:18.090
 as you can see is a super pot of vegetables 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:20.610
 that's why I chose this big goya 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.970
 Now we will cover with water and leave 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.650
 cooking on medium heat for one hour 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.780
 an hour and a half or until the 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.780
 vegetables are at their point 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.159
 well now we cover with water 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:41.990
 I added 222 liters of practically 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:44.529
 I'm going to add a little more water 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.039
 half a liter more 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:47.039
 ah 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:01.080
 ok we raise the fire high until 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:03.120
 start to boil and once you start 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.920
 boil we add the spices that we 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.290
 that is the sweet paprika and the 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.290
 saffron we can cover even 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.860
 and wait 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.009
 well once it's boiling 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.040
 we added the spices that we had 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.040
 reserved sweet paprika 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:30.210
 and of chance the sachet 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.150
 in this case I leave them but also 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:36.530
 can be accepted in threads 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.530
 a little 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:47.450
 now we will lower the fire 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:50.470
 over medium heat over low heat if you want and 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.520
 cover and let cook one hour 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.370
 approximately until the vegetable 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:59.110
 is cooked half an hour before it finishes 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.110
 the cooking will add the chickpeas 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:07.530
 Well this has been 40 minutes and now 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.389
 Then an ingredient can be made like this 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.570
 that we add the chickpeas that are already 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:11.570
 cooked 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:18.290
 all right 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.410
 and we leave it for about 15 more minutes and 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:25.450
 enough then we'll cover and leave 

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.450
 rest before plating 

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.540
 well we have our knife 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.710
 finished we have let it rest 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:37.140
 and here we have placed it and 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.910
 can eat in two ways well with the 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.970
 broth part 

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:45.660
 and then the vegetable and the meat in another 

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:49.140
 dish without charge and you can go out with a 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:51.900
 little bit of leaving a little olive and for 

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:53.490
 the teques good my girl just to eat 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.689
 well because she has already made a 

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:58.059
 introduction to solids 

00:07:55.689 --> 00:08:00.549
 but if you have smaller children then 

00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:04.029
 you can crush all in the blender 

00:08:00.549 --> 00:08:06.099
 and there is a delicious puree you can also 

00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:07.749
 avoid some foods if you do not 

00:08:06.099 --> 00:08:09.699
 you have introduced as the flesh of 

00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:11.689
 lamb in this case or the 

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:13.909
 legumes that are 

00:08:11.689 --> 00:08:15.769
 what is a glass place I hope you like it 

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:18.039
