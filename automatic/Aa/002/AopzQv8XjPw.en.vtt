00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
right tank on loading capacity and this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.710 
right tank on loading capacity and this
is<00:01:30.810> how<00:01:30.930> fast<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.470> unloads<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.579> if<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.090> want<00:01:33.329> it
