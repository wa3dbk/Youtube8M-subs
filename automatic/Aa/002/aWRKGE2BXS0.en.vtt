00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.759 
nine thousand nine hundred and their
snake<00:02:42.209> I've<00:02:42.660> checked<00:02:43.049> these<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.410> think<00:02:43.620> our

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
snake I've checked these I think our

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.070 
snake I've checked these I think our
brightest<00:02:44.340> floor<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.940> engage<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.570> generator

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
brightest floor and engage the generator

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.710 
brightest floor and engage the generator
energy<00:02:47.040> output<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.549> low<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.420> should<00:02:48.690> be

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
energy output is low but it should be

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.530 
energy output is low but it should be
enough<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.110> power<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.799> elevator<00:02:50.480> try<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
enough to power the elevator try the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.009 
enough to power the elevator try the
elevator<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.470> see<00:02:52.709> if<00:02:52.799> it's<00:02:52.920> working<00:02:54.019> but

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
elevator and see if it's working but

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.229 
elevator and see if it's working but
yeah<00:02:55.200> why<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:55.650> use<00:02:55.920> whole<00:02:56.250> keyboard<00:02:56.580> I

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
yeah why not use whole keyboard I

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.000 
yeah why not use whole keyboard I
automated<00:02:57.840> makes<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.140> kind<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.380> easy<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.860> this

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
automated makes it kind of easy for this

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.460 
automated makes it kind of easy for this
sort<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.280> thing<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.840> doesn't<00:03:01.260> make<00:03:01.410> sense

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
sort of thing but it doesn't make sense

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.340 
sort of thing but it doesn't make sense
by<00:03:01.920> someone<00:03:02.220> like<00:03:02.250> otakon<00:03:03.239> who's<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> hasher

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
by someone like otakon who's a hasher

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.350 
by someone like otakon who's a hasher
and<00:03:04.620> obviously<00:03:05.010> knows<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.610> tricks<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:06.030> trade

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
and obviously knows the tricks the trade

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.330 
and obviously knows the tricks the trade
why<00:03:07.080> he<00:03:07.410> would<00:03:07.620> have<00:03:07.910> such<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> simple<00:03:09.360> password

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
why he would have such a simple password

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.240 
why he would have such a simple password
oh<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.750> by<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.930> way<00:03:12.050> I<00:03:12.349> know<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.860> password

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
oh and by the way I know the password

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.729 
oh and by the way I know the password
48273500<00:03:16.250> they<00:03:17.239> give<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.569> wrong<00:03:17.750> one<00:03:18.050> okay

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
48273500 they give the wrong one okay

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.820 
48273500 they give the wrong one okay
first<00:03:19.519> go<00:03:19.849> down<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.239> central<00:03:20.540> hallway<00:03:20.840> don't

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
first go down the central hallway don't

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.729 
first go down the central hallway don't
worry<00:03:22.099> it's<00:03:22.489> not<00:03:22.700> electrified<00:03:23.180> anymore<00:03:23.810> but

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
worry it's not electrified anymore but

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:25.809 
worry it's not electrified anymore but
we're<00:03:24.920> going<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.129> avoid<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:25.400> area

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
we're going to avoid this area

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.759 
we're going to avoid this area
altogether<00:03:26.120> for<00:03:26.989> something<00:03:27.440> for<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.620> little

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
altogether for something for a little

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.259 
altogether for something for a little
bit<00:03:27.950> because<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.879> want<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.150> trigger<00:03:29.330> something

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
bit because I want to trigger something

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.339 
bit because I want to trigger something
it<00:03:32.269> wasn't<00:03:32.540> there<00:03:32.629> yeah<00:03:32.959> there<00:03:33.140> it<00:03:33.200> is<00:03:33.290> a

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
it wasn't there yeah there it is a

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.059 
it wasn't there yeah there it is a
portable<00:03:33.650> rocket<00:03:33.860> launcher<00:03:35.590> always<00:03:36.590> nice<00:03:36.860> to

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
portable rocket launcher always nice to

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:48.880 
portable rocket launcher always nice to
have<00:03:37.220> near<00:03:37.760> your<00:03:38.060> electric<00:03:38.900> grid<00:03:47.890> everything

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
have near your electric grid everything

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.729 
have near your electric grid everything
looks<00:03:49.069> exactly<00:03:49.519> like<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:50.030> remember<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.739> except

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
looks exactly like I remember it except

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.470 
looks exactly like I remember it except
for<00:03:51.860> that<00:03:51.950> wall<00:03:52.220> weighing<00:03:52.610> back<00:03:52.819> anyway<00:03:53.269> I

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
for that wall weighing back anyway I

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.900 
for that wall weighing back anyway I
still<00:03:54.440> can't<00:03:54.470> believe<00:03:54.739> how<00:03:55.129> much<00:03:55.250> damage<00:03:55.579> you

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
still can't believe how much damage you

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.080 
still can't believe how much damage you
caused<00:03:56.180> in<00:03:56.420> such<00:03:56.569> a<00:03:56.599> small<00:03:56.840> space<00:03:57.579> haha<00:03:58.579> the

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
caused in such a small space haha the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.750 
caused in such a small space haha the
switchboard<00:04:00.040> nailed<00:04:01.040> it<00:04:01.250> with<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.400> remote

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
switchboard nailed it with a remote

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.250 
switchboard nailed it with a remote

guidance system and those things takes

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.640 
guidance system and those things takes
up<00:04:07.579> so<00:04:07.760> much<00:04:07.819> space<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.930> hardly<00:04:09.170> leaves<00:04:09.440> any

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
up so much space it hardly leaves any
