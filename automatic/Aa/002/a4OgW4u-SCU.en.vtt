00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.610
 m 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.030
 and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.720
 I still do not understand why he has 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.930
 he made so many wars to his name killing 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.060
 well to so many people I understand that to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.849
 sometimes one might think that jehovah is 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.039
 a dictator or something like that but not 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.869
 forget that jehovah is holy what 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.170
 implies that there can not be any 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.930
 evil also had not left in his 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.750
 registered word these events just 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.750
 as to put doubts between us not 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.809
 you seem to hear he had not seen it from that 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.670
 way is true if jehovah placed those 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.990
 stories will be for something that we 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.450
 we must learn correct look at something that 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.940
 jehovah teaches us in these stories is 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.550
 that he always delivers his people his 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.870
 loved people everyone loves but not 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.630
 special to his servants 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.210
 for example we look at a story 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.900
 related to remember who he was 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.330
 the not the truth I do not remember 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.110
 this story is found in the book of 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.270
 judges in chapter 3 verse 15 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.330
 if you want please read it many 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.940
 thank you and the children of israel started 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.190
 to cry out to jehovah for help so 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.330
 that Jehovah raised them a savior abud 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.400
 son of daughter wrath half a bream with 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.440
 the time the children of israel sent 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.260
 tribute by hand of him ailón the king of 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.580
 moab now feeling helped judge 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.830
 when israel had no king so is 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.720
 although in the bible it is not described 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.330
 as a judge if it is mentioned as 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.210
 savior what allows us to think that 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.790
 he was one of the judges of the time here 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.070
 the interesting thing was that as you read in the 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.470
 verse the people of israel are 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.470
 I was in serious trouble and they were 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.690
 begging the help of Jehovah then he 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.300
 was in charge of providing relief to 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.619
 village in the name of jehovah 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.190
 taking advantage of the confidence that he acquired 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.270
 by paying tribute to the king of moab 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.790
 dismissed the Moabites who 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.350
 accompanied back so wood 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.900
 went back to where the king 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.230
 he shrewdly addressed words in order 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.610
 to kill the long let's look at it in the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.620
 chapter 3 verses 20 and 21 and came to 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.870
 him while he was sitting in his 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.900
 cool camera the text he had for himself 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.950
 alone and still went on to say a word of 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.510
 I have god for you 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.250
 before that he rose from his throne 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.990
 then the USA put his left hand and 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.320
 took the sword from on his right thigh 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.800
 and he sank it in the clone belly 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.290
 tremendous final let's think the town 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.490
 I was really bad so I asked 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.400
 help 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.190
 Jehovah assigns him a savior out and this 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.930
 only man with the help of jehovah could 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.450
 kill the head of the people that 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.750
 he was oppressing israel so that 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.500
 he would not feel weak without his king and so 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.070
 It was 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.710
 jehovah moved matters verses 27-30 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.390
 and it happened that when he arrived there he 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.910
 put to play the horn in the region 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.950
 mountainous of ephraim and the children of 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.870
 Israel began to descend with that of 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.870
 the mountainous region 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.900
 with him at the head of them then he 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.569
 He said follow me because he has given it to his 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.330
 dressmakers enemies in YOUR hand 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.060
 and they started to follow him and they managed 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.159
 take the fords of jordán against the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.860
 Moabites and they did not allow anyone 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.780
 will happen and on that occasion they put 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.170
 to knock down marc like 10,000 men 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.170
 each one robust and each one man 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.269
 brave and not even one escaped and 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.670
 morad was subjugated that the day under 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:57.030
 hand of israel and the earth had no more 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.640
 disturbance for 80 years how can you 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.459
 observe out was used by jehová 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:05.129
 so that to rid his people of their 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.920
 oppressors what we learn here is the 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:10.829
 capacity that has a village jehová 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.140
 as wet well established as could 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.900
 lose against Israel a people not 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.139
 therefore when the warrior 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.120
 his people are in danger what will happen 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.910
 Jehovah will act in his favor and will free him 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.550
 jehovah will be our liberator but not 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.760
 only as a group but also it will be 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.760
 in our case in a spiritual sense 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.310
 the key is to lean on him and why not 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.760
 ask for help from jehovah if it is the case 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.480
 when we see each other in distress thank you for 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.500
 this story and I remembered that there was 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.450
 definitely jehová protects his 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.230
 people and has done also with the 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.720
 witnesses despite strong opposition like this 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.370
 It is and will forever until you 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.490
 wants God's enemy on earth 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:58.390
 for eternity jehovah will have reached 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.390
 be our liberator
