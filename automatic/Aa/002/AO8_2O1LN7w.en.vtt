00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.590
 hello dear viewers today 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 would like to share a chicken recipe 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.600
 stuffed with mushrooms for this to us 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.840
 will need 300 grams of champignon mushrooms 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.290
 2 onions one egg 300 grams of solid 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.680
 cheese 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:29.489
 67 pancakes and chicken first of all to us 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 it is necessary to separate the chicken from the skin for 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.090
 this needs to be separated 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.220
 ponytail and separate all the fat from the chicken 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.719
 can help over the knife gradually 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.519
 running into the skin 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:48.210
 from chicken hands 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:51.390
 most importantly the skin does not hurt because 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.699
 what do we need on and will 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.309
 the main course is now the same 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.050
 doing on the back 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.690
 to separate the skin from the chicken is not so difficult 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.650
 as it seems in fact all this 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.650
 just done 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.920
 keep moving the skin 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.570
 turn out 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:20.510
 legs along the joint and incise with a knife for 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.660
 the legs remain in the skin 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:28.010
 we need them very basic meaning 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.950
 this time of this dish is that 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.400
 skin will remain 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:38.420
 legs and wings from the carcass we cut the meat 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:43.700
 and grind through a meat grinder now with 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:46.790
 by the wings of john the same thing with us 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.820
 Now you can get such a skin 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.410
 say a little shirt with legs and wings 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.170
 from chicken who we later choose 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.570
 stuff pancakes from a piece out 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.880
 hens we separate the meat from the bone and 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.410
 we turn through a meat grinder at us 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.990
 get minced add salt and spices 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:09.380
 to taste and proceed to the next stage 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.350
 chop finely mushrooms and onions 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.440
 must be finely chopped in order to 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.090
 he then 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.220
 go well with 3 panic 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.090
 finely chopped onions we now need 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.250
 us to brown it nomos not butter can 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.340
 take a creamy olive or kiss 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.580
 while our onion is fried we are at this time 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:36.500
 grind mushrooms mushrooms 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.260
 we now fry for about 20 minutes then they 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.410
 give juice well and add spices to taste 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.570
 then we wait for the juice to evaporate 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.180
 let's not waste time at the time when 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.850
 stir fried in rows 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.040
 fine grater in order to rub the cheese 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.340
 it's easier to freeze it a little bit 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.220
 we now need to mix 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.280
 by fried mushrooms with minced meat and now 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.130
 mix well the minced meat 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.980
 need salt and pepper on 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.490
 working surface lay out a pancake on 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:16.570
 lay out the bulk of the pancake 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.570
 and wrap the straw 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.010
 clay we forced on for this now 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.640
 we will need chicken skin 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:32.170
 moisten ready stuffed pancakes 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:39.830
 salt-sprinkled eggs sprinkled with cheese and 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:43.610
 we put everything neatly in the carcass we 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:47.660
 make to pancakes then when 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:52.120
 cutting they crumbled in a crust and cheese 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.120
 us is a kind of gluten 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.000
 which will hold pancakes between 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:03.140
 by itself so that the juice does not flow 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.180
 our chicken we need to fasten it 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:10.430
 toothpicks can be ordinary thread and 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.110
 the neck of our hens is also possible 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.110
 to fasten 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.110
 toothpick 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:23.010
 now you need to put the chicken in 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.350
 I donâ€™t usually put a form on a sheet 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.230
 because the shape of the chicken does not hold it 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.310
 us boneless now our chicken us 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.310
 it is necessary to salt 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.240
 grind 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:46.190
 and for the color to make it beautiful 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:50.570
 chicken can be greased or tomato 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.730
 paste either jack or sachet now 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.760
 bake our chicken in the oven 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:05:00.950
 heated to 180 degrees for about an hour to 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.870
 the appearance of crisp has passed an hour 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.010
 we decorated our chicken with greens 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.010
 bon appetit
