first<00:02:38.790> first<00:02:39.150> ten<00:02:39.330> minutes<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.870> was<00:02:39.990> kind

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
first first ten minutes of it was kind

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.930 
first first ten minutes of it was kind
of<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.320> shock<00:02:40.560> but<00:02:40.590> now<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.250> like<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.580> it's
