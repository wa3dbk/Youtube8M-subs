00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
 Hello everyone, this is rprentki 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.300
 This is another tutorial video for EyeWire. 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.400
 It is about to 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.000
 Starburst amacrine cell 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.500
 They are more difficult 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
 Their characteristic properties are 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.000
 Long thin branches 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 They usually run through the cube 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 And an occasional drop 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
 They are difficult artifacts because of their branches 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Is so weak, so sometimes 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Very ugly and clear in 2D images. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.500
 Let's start 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
 Moreover, they almost always run through the cube. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 You will find that our starting works stopped halfway through the way. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.500
 And, it has a flat edge right here 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 So if it has a flat edge or jagged 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.600
 This usually indicates that something is missing. 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.000
 If it has a rounded edge it will indicate that it is complete 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Ok, let's get started. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Please take a minute and pay attention, you can see here 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 Outside the line 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 The blue color is a little bit. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 If I press shift, you can still watch 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 This is just an artificial intelligence error, 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 AI error, 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Sometime this error happened 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 This is good but not perfect 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 The most important thing is to make sure 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 You don't make your computer's mistake worse. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 I mean 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 This one is here, the biggest one, 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 Actually correct 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 This smaller one is incorrect 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 So, I don't want to add anything to the incorrect part. 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 So I ignore it 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 And pretend it doesn't exist 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Fortunately, it has disappeared now. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Ok, let's continue 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 Ok, then this is what I mean, when I say, 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 It can be very rare to see. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 Sometimes the outline is very blurry, 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Or almost nonexistent 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 So you must try 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Find out her original shape 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Ok, I saw that there is 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 A slightly curved shape is on the top. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 Let's try it with it. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500
 And when you get big things up 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.000
 And can confirm with 3D image that this is a big chunk 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 You always want to make sure it is correct 52 00:01:57.0 --&gt; 00:02:00.0 in 3D, so I zoom in a little bit 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And look, ok. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 Ok, for me, 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.600
 It flows in a nice way to 56 00:02:06.6 --&gt; 00:02:10.0 Thus, there is a smooth continuation 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 This is what I already mentioned 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 So 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.500
 There are still long branches, so a drop. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.000
 Sometimes they have a few bumps 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Come out of them, and almost always have 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.500
 Long branches, it exudes 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.500
 Arrive on the other side of the cube 64 00:02:25.5 --&gt; 00:02:27.0 Ok, let's continue 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 Ok, I am paying attention to this drop now. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 Because after I look at the 3D image, 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 There are rough little pieces here. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 You can also see 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Small missing piece 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Before I move on, I have to check those. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Ok, it looks like it disappears. 72 00:02:55.0 --&gt; 00:02:57.0 Now let's go back and follow 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 This long branch is all the way 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Ok, it looks like it's here. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Well, it seems that it has reached the edge and disappeared. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 We are over.
