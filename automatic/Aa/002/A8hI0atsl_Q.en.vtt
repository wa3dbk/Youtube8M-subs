going to uh I guess we're doing a video
game<00:02:30.980> so<00:02:31.160> against<00:02:31.370> two<00:02:31.490> nice<00:02:31.670> articulation

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
game so against two nice articulation

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.990 
game so against two nice articulation
yes<00:02:33.319> Stan<00:02:33.530> articulation<00:02:34.220> for<00:02:34.400> a<00:02:34.430> TCU<00:02:34.850> nurse

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000

forward anything like that you can stand

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.949 
forward anything like that you can stand
them<00:03:08.989> up<00:03:09.080> straight<00:03:09.290> perfectly<00:03:09.800> fine<00:03:10.060> mmm<00:03:11.120> when

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
them up straight perfectly fine mmm when

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.750 
them up straight perfectly fine mmm when
it<00:03:12.050> comes<00:03:12.200> to<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.350> shoulder<00:03:12.650> pads<00:03:12.890> sort<00:03:13.670> of

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
it comes to the shoulder pads sort of

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.460 
it comes to the shoulder pads sort of
pageant<00:03:14.120> made<00:03:14.209> out<00:03:14.360> of<00:03:14.480> soft<00:03:14.930> rubber<00:03:15.170> so<00:03:15.320> they

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
pageant made out of soft rubber so they

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.440 
pageant made out of soft rubber so they
don't<00:03:15.830> they<00:03:16.100> don't<00:03:16.130> really<00:03:16.489> hinder<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
don't they don't really hinder the

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.300 
don't they don't really hinder the
movement<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.080> arms<00:03:18.320> that<00:03:18.470> much<00:03:18.739> obviously

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
movement of the arms that much obviously

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.470 
movement of the arms that much obviously
you<00:03:19.370> can<00:03:19.489> go<00:03:19.580> all<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.820> way<00:03:19.850> up<00:03:20.090> but<00:03:20.239> then

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
you can go all the way up but then

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.000 
you can go all the way up but then
they're<00:03:20.840> pretty<00:03:21.050> soft<00:03:21.290> they<00:03:21.560> could<00:03:21.709> take<00:03:21.860> the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
they're pretty soft they could take the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.290 
they're pretty soft they could take the
punishment<00:03:22.489> if<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:22.670> move<00:03:22.880> them<00:03:23.030> around<00:03:23.090> like

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
punishment if you move them around like

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.979 
punishment if you move them around like
that<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:24.590> still<00:03:24.799> pretty<00:03:24.980> cool<00:03:25.780> other<00:03:26.780> than

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
that so still pretty cool other than

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.539

that<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.320> basic<00:03:28.540> basic<00:03:29.540> articulation<00:03:30.549> some

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
that the basic basic articulation some

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.270 
that the basic basic articulation some
new<00:03:31.700> design<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:33.320> strap<00:03:33.620> over<00:03:33.829> here<00:03:33.950> is<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.160> lot

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
new design the strap over here is a lot

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.039 
new design the strap over here is a lot
different<00:03:34.459> also<00:03:34.850> that<00:03:35.239> extends<00:03:35.810> all<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:35.959> way

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
different also that extends all the way

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.620

to back to all around his waist

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.220 
to back to all around his waist
doesn't<00:03:39.530> really<00:03:39.680> doesn't<00:03:40.630> really<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.810> kind<00:03:42.079> of

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
doesn't really doesn't really a kind of

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.199 
doesn't really doesn't really a kind of
hinders<00:03:42.500> articulation<00:03:43.310> left<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.790> right<00:03:43.970> a

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
hinders articulation left to right a

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.870 
hinders articulation left to right a
little<00:03:44.690> bit<00:03:44.780> up<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:44.989> down<00:03:45.110> too<00:03:45.579> but<00:03:46.579> what's

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
little bit up and down too but what's

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.740 
little bit up and down too but what's
also<00:03:47.090> cool<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.570> on<00:03:47.720> the<00:03:47.959> new<00:03:48.140> design<00:03:48.500> is<00:03:48.739> the

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
also cool it on the new design is the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.810
