00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
the database and you know how to imagine

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.760 
the database and you know how to imagine
it<00:01:25.820> you've<00:01:26.450> come<00:01:26.630> along<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:27.200> some<00:01:27.410> sort<00:01:27.710> of

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770

fingerprint fingerprint finger down on

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.450 
fingerprint fingerprint finger down on
the<00:01:35.330> scanner<00:01:35.690> again<00:01:35.930> take<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.170> fingerprint<00:01:36.680> and

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
the scanner again take a fingerprint and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.980 
the scanner again take a fingerprint and
we'll<00:01:37.610> see<00:01:37.850> whether<00:01:38.090> we<00:01:38.210> can<00:01:38.300> identify<00:01:38.510> you

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
we'll see whether we can identify you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.230 
we'll see whether we can identify you
without<00:01:39.260> knowing<00:01:39.530> who<00:01:39.619> you<00:01:39.740> are<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:41.210> is

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
without knowing who you are so this is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.790 
without knowing who you are so this is
the<00:01:41.420> matching<00:01:41.630> stage<00:01:43.240> okay<00:01:44.500> same<00:01:45.500> finger

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
the matching stage okay same finger

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.790 
the matching stage okay same finger
there<00:01:46.250> we<00:01:46.340> go<00:01:47.050> thank<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.200> now<00:01:48.500> it's<00:01:48.650> going

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
find the closest match there we go and

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.130 
find the closest match there we go and
it's<00:01:55.010> around<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.340> yep<00:01:55.760> bout<00:01:56.150> with<00:01:56.720> a<00:01:56.750> score<00:01:57.110> of

such as pdas and mobile phones so what's

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.870 
such as pdas and mobile phones so what's
the<00:03:10.599> advantage<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:11.280> biometric<00:03:12.280> testing<00:03:12.760> as

the advantage of biometric testing as

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.059 
the advantage of biometric testing as
opposed<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.450> now<00:03:13.930> there's<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.349> conventional

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
opposed to now there's a conventional

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.490 
opposed to now there's a conventional
swipe<00:03:15.400> card<00:03:15.730> system<00:03:16.120> right<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.989> conventional

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
swipe card system right the conventional

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.250 
swipe card system right the conventional
swipe<00:03:17.709> card<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.160> something<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.670> have<00:03:19.080> you<00:03:20.080> can

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
swipe card is something you have you can

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.020 
swipe card is something you have you can
be<00:03:20.410> lost<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.830> can<00:03:20.980> be<00:03:21.130> stolen<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.670> can<00:03:21.849> be

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
be lost it can be stolen it can be

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.020 
be lost it can be stolen it can be
borrowed<00:03:22.269> so<00:03:22.959> certainly<00:03:23.790> jeopardizes<00:03:24.790> what

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
borrowed so certainly jeopardizes what

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.089 
borrowed so certainly jeopardizes what
the<00:03:25.209> security<00:03:25.599> will<00:03:26.019> be<00:03:26.050> jeopardized<00:03:26.680> if<00:03:26.920> you

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
the security will be jeopardized if you

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.789 
the security will be jeopardized if you
lost<00:03:27.640> if<00:03:28.060> if<00:03:28.480> you<00:03:28.660> lost<00:03:28.900> your<00:03:29.080> card<00:03:29.290> or<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.530> car

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799

cash stolen for the pin number or

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.470 
cash stolen for the pin number or
password<00:03:32.260> is<00:03:32.680> something<00:03:33.010> you<00:03:33.130> know<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.670> for

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
password is something you know and for

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.259 
password is something you know and for
example<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.760> application<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.850> financial

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
example the the application to financial

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.390 
example the the application to financial
transactions<00:03:37.950> people<00:03:38.950> tends<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.280> have

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
transactions people tends to have

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.970 
transactions people tends to have
multiple<00:03:39.760> cards<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.510> but<00:03:41.380> it<00:03:41.500> tends<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.769> use

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
multiple cards and but it tends to use

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.770 
multiple cards and but it tends to use
the<00:03:42.130> same<00:03:42.370> password<00:03:42.610> so<00:03:43.150> if<00:03:43.239> you<00:03:43.360> lost<00:03:43.540> one

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
the same password so if you lost one

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.750 
the same password so if you lost one
card<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.799> whole<00:03:45.099> security<00:03:45.400> it

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
card that the whole security it

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.610 
card that the whole security it
jeopardized<00:03:46.269> whereas<00:03:46.959> biometry<00:03:47.500> is

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
jeopardized whereas biometry is

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.860 
jeopardized whereas biometry is
something<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.190> are<00:03:48.370> he<00:03:48.910> can't<00:03:49.209> it<00:03:49.450> can't<00:03:49.660> be

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
something you are he can't it can't be

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.589 
something you are he can't it can't be
lost<00:03:50.049> and<00:03:50.319> can't<00:03:50.500> be<00:03:50.650> stolen<00:03:50.890> generally<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:52.450> is

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
lost and can't be stolen generally so is

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:55.770 
lost and can't be stolen generally so is
it<00:03:52.840> provides<00:03:53.019> more<00:03:53.680> security<00:03:54.690> compared<00:03:55.690> to

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
it provides more security compared to

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.559 
it provides more security compared to
the<00:03:55.870> conventional<00:03:56.489> technology<00:03:57.489> you<00:03:58.360> call

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
the conventional technology you call

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.590 
the conventional technology you call
this<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.019> warp<00:03:59.349> system<00:04:00.100> why<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.600> well

one<00:04:02.380> of<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.650> big<00:04:02.829> challenge<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.489> biometric

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
one of the big challenge of biometric

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.990 
one of the big challenge of biometric
recognition<00:04:04.269> system<00:04:05.079> is<00:04:05.380> the<00:04:05.680> geometric

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
recognition system is the geometric

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.210 
recognition system is the geometric
variation<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.720> happens<00:04:08.290> in<00:04:08.530> fingerprint

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
variation it happens in fingerprint

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.699 
variation it happens in fingerprint
happens<00:04:09.670> in<00:04:09.820> face<00:04:10.030> recognition<00:04:10.709> the

happens in face recognition the

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.340 
happens in face recognition the
geometric<00:04:12.280> data<00:04:12.430> can<00:04:12.910> be<00:04:12.940> distorted<00:04:13.569> for

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
geometric data can be distorted for

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.199 
geometric data can be distorted for
example<00:04:14.739> fingerprint<00:04:15.310> it<00:04:15.519> depends<00:04:15.880> on<00:04:16.000> how

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
example fingerprint it depends on how

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.270 
example fingerprint it depends on how
much<00:04:16.390> pressure<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:17.019> apply<00:04:17.079> them<00:04:17.470> finger<00:04:17.799> on

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
much pressure you apply them finger on

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.940 
much pressure you apply them finger on
the<00:04:18.549> on<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:19.060> scanner<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.870> depends<00:04:20.709> on<00:04:20.829> the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
the on the scanner and depends on the

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.100 
the on the scanner and depends on the
angle<00:04:21.100> of<00:04:21.489> your<00:04:21.669> fingerprint<00:04:22.300> opposed<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:23.020> the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
angle of your fingerprint opposed to the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.450 
angle of your fingerprint opposed to the
scanner<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:24.340> can<00:04:24.789> create<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.210> very<00:04:25.660> complicated

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
scanner it can create a very complicated

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.950 
scanner it can create a very complicated
distortion<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:27.610> those<00:04:28.510> distortions

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
distortion and those distortions

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.200 
distortion and those distortions
sometimes<00:04:29.680> can<00:04:30.100> make<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.460> recognition

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
sometimes can make the recognition

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.050 
sometimes can make the recognition
system<00:04:31.800> difficult<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.889> recognize<00:04:33.370> or<00:04:33.669> even

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
system difficult to recognize or even

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.180 
system difficult to recognize or even
and<00:04:34.300> make<00:04:34.780> false<00:04:35.080> rejection<00:04:35.500> or<00:04:35.979> false

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
and make false rejection or false

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.700 
and make false rejection or false
acceptance<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:37.539> what<00:04:37.750> we're<00:04:37.930> trying<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.289> do<00:04:38.530> is

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
acceptance so what we're trying to do is

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.379 
acceptance so what we're trying to do is
come<00:04:38.950> up<00:04:38.979> with<00:04:39.100> a<00:04:39.250> mathematical<00:04:39.940> model<00:04:40.240> to

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
come up with a mathematical model to

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:42.779 
come up with a mathematical model to
correct<00:04:41.139> those<00:04:41.380> distortion<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.580> make<00:04:42.760> a

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
correct those distortion and to make a

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.600 
correct those distortion and to make a
geometric<00:04:43.360> invariant<00:04:44.200> ie<00:04:44.740> every<00:04:45.280> time<00:04:45.430> you

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
geometric invariant ie every time you

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.370 
geometric invariant ie every time you
present<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:46.060> same<00:04:46.270> fingerprint<00:04:46.960> or<00:04:47.110> indeed

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
present the same fingerprint or indeed

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.159 
present the same fingerprint or indeed
you're<00:04:47.620> saying<00:04:48.010> biometric<00:04:48.820> data<00:04:49.060> you<00:04:49.600> always

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
you're saying biometric data you always

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.999 
you're saying biometric data you always
generate<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.919> same

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
generate a same

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.779 
generate a same
image<00:04:52.819> regardless<00:04:53.749> of<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.650> viewing<00:04:55.009> angle<00:04:55.520> or

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
image regardless of the viewing angle or

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.519 
image regardless of the viewing angle or
the<00:04:55.819> pressure<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:56.419> apply<00:04:56.509> on<00:04:56.930> on<00:04:57.139> the

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 
the pressure you apply on on the

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.670 
the pressure you apply on on the
blueprint<00:04:58.279> but<00:04:59.210> perhaps<00:04:59.360> even<00:04:59.779> more<00:05:00.110> so<00:05:00.499> than

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
blueprint but perhaps even more so than

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.409 
blueprint but perhaps even more so than
with<00:05:00.830> fingerprint<00:05:01.369> technology<00:05:01.699> there<00:05:02.240> is<00:05:02.389> a

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
with fingerprint technology there is a

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:04.389 
with fingerprint technology there is a
margin<00:05:03.020> for<00:05:03.169> error<00:05:03.229> well<00:05:04.159> we<00:05:04.249> guess

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:04.399 
margin for error well we guess

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:06.010 
margin for error well we guess
especially<00:05:04.639> with<00:05:05.059> that<00:05:05.089> face<00:05:05.809> recognition

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
especially with that face recognition

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.719 
especially with that face recognition
there's<00:05:06.469> also<00:05:06.559> a<00:05:06.680> lot<00:05:06.770> of<00:05:06.830> variation<00:05:07.639> between

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
there's also a lot of variation between

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.179 
there's also a lot of variation between
images<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.779> same<00:05:08.960> person<00:05:09.439> these<00:05:09.740> can<00:05:09.919> be<00:05:10.039> due

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:10.189 
images the same person these can be due

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:12.489 
images the same person these can be due
to<00:05:10.339> much<00:05:10.669> as<00:05:10.819> facial<00:05:11.629> expression<00:05:12.020> changes<00:05:12.349> or

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:12.499 
to much as facial expression changes or

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:14.920 
to much as facial expression changes or
hairstyle<00:05:13.159> glasses<00:05:14.119> but<00:05:14.389> also<00:05:14.539> there's

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
hairstyle glasses but also there's

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.510 
hairstyle glasses but also there's
differences<00:05:15.649> in<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:15.949> lighting<00:05:16.159> and<00:05:16.460> the

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
differences in the lighting and the

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.709 
differences in the lighting and the
natural<00:05:16.669> direction<00:05:16.939> the<00:05:17.240> image<00:05:17.419> was<00:05:17.569> taken

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:17.719 
natural direction the image was taken

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:20.829 
natural direction the image was taken
from<00:05:18.020> so<00:05:18.860> what's<00:05:19.099> your<00:05:19.399> challenge<00:05:19.839> what

00:05:20.829 --> 00:05:20.839 
from so what's your challenge what

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.589 
from so what's your challenge what
current<00:05:21.289> systems<00:05:21.710> expect<00:05:22.369> a<00:05:22.580> frontal<00:05:23.300> image

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
current systems expect a frontal image

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.089 
current systems expect a frontal image
neutral<00:05:24.199> lighting<00:05:24.529> a<00:05:24.559> neutral<00:05:24.860> expression

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
neutral lighting a neutral expression

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.879 
neutral lighting a neutral expression

CCTV in those kind of situations so just
give<00:05:35.539> us<00:05:35.629> a<00:05:35.719> very<00:05:35.870> brief<00:05:36.110> demonstration<00:05:36.319> of

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
give us a very brief demonstration of

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.799 
give us a very brief demonstration of
how<00:05:36.919> it<00:05:37.039> works<00:05:37.219> well<00:05:37.849> I<00:05:37.879> can't<00:05:38.270> show<00:05:38.389> you<00:05:38.479> the

00:05:38.799 --> 00:05:38.809 
how it works well I can't show you the

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:41.499 
how it works well I can't show you the

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:44.209 
demonstration of detection which is one

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:46.179 
demonstration of detection which is one
of<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.360> initial<00:05:44.899> stages<00:05:45.110> we<00:05:45.319> require<00:05:45.680> yeah

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:46.189 
of the initial stages we require yeah

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.619 
of the initial stages we require yeah
and<00:05:48.370> right<00:05:49.370> well<00:05:50.360> they're<00:05:50.479> definitely

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:50.629 
and right well they're definitely

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.879 
and right well they're definitely
criminals<00:05:51.259> yes<00:05:52.360> well<00:05:53.360> this<00:05:53.629> project<00:05:54.379> has<00:05:54.439> just
