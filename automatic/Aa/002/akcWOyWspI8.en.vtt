00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.219
 now chop let's see the techniques for 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 chop the vegetables first chop 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:22.160
 it is only the vegetables we cut 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.650
 for example the sliced ​​carrot we do 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:32.110
 julienne carrot slices 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:34.370
 in this way then we take the turn 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.629
 let's make this brown cut now 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:45.739
 it was small cubes so we will do 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:51.470
 also with julien cut celery to 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:54.080
 julienne tagliolo alla bruno hans and so 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.689
 it will then be made also with the onion 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.970
 let's say the mince actually in 

00:00:56.689 --> 00:01:06.080
 cooking uses celery and carrot onion 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:10.369
 fine julien as well as the onion 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:14.620
 in this way we also create the onion 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:18.590
 we mix everything together at brown 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:22.090
 to start chopping for that chop 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.290
 it means to bring a lot 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.760
 finely our vegetables 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.760
 this is the job that maybe in case 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.350
 you use to do with the crescent 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.800
 but the cutting knife that it is 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.530
 indispensable for this operation yes 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.580
 You can use a crescent mo keeping only 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.110
 stop the hand resting on the blade on the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:52.370
 tip of the knife and spinning yes 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:56.220
 door the mince has the desired consistency 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:00.870
 based on the type of 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:04.590
 recipe that we're going to do well and this 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.340
 it is a great mince to sauté 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.340
 in the kitchen 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.889
