00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.240
 very good to all I am the cris and we are 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.300
 with a new informative video video 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.420
 about nba 2k 16 weeks in concrete 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.700
 about the test mode m this new mode 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.940
 of game that a few days ago announced via 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.699
 trailer and that little was known about this 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.189
 new mode so there was an interview 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.739
 yesterday you take the vice president development 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.910
 of visual concepts sports and good 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.399
 Well, he has asked a series of questions 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.989
 so interesting which we go now 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.420
 to comment here on the video on the one hand 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:49.079
 the question is good ones that we 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.839
 comments jeff tomÃ¡s in which difference 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.030
 there is no I will focus the one that could be seen 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.179
 between the field in which he faces 5 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.280
 against 5 our 10 players and good 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.989
 like the current one in which it looked 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.199
 by four courts those that play a 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.930
 total of 40 players not as you choose 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.800
 what difference is air more then this 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.890
 He has told me the following 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.500
 the sand m test is going to have the 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.120
 four courts will be the king center 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.790
 but it happens that they have to be excellent at 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.230
 call prow m sand agree let's go 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.720
 have there the four courts that we have 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.990
 currently and there we can play with 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.090
 unknown people and people who also 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.040
 be friends and others is without having a 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.990
 own team so to speak as we 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.660
 we unite as it was currently the recent 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.640
 some time and I can play without 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.380
 problems and then part we're going to have in 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.600
 the different then the new this year 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.690
 which is the theme of being able to play with your 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.060
 own team we ride tss 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.620
 this gang so to speak not in that 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.540
 equipment in which you can customize 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.300
 Well, all the shirts, what's already 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.330
 saw in the trailer shirt the court 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.700
 all of self-owned equipment and there already 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.460
 play as an exclusive 5 to 5 in 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.160
 that field that we have created in 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.820
 the sun the difference of agreement by 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.810
 another the other question was 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.220
 yes in the pro-am then everyone that 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.560
 participate in the team 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.100
 in that team that has been created can 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.980
 modify at any time 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.310
 colors of the kit equipment is 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.770
 of the courts because it is not simply the 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.750
 that has created that team wrong in the owner 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.470
 is the one who will be able to make these 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.800
 changes 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.320
 others are not going to be able to do it 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.380
 another part another question is can we be 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.600
 part of several teams or good or 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.830
 gangs do not and the answer is yes 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.750
 what can we do, or can we 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.570
 participate for example in our case 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.760
 in the team of the renault that has 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.780
 we are preparing good consumer 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.390
 confer with jorge gallardo rafa chris 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.470
 Bailey and I are worth to that gang that 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.330
 we are realizing that team that 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.040
 we are doing and apart we can 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.650
 make our own body templates 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.160
 with subscribers or things so that's 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.700
 very well the truth this option 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.190
 it's great news another question in the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.090
 If you only have three 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.480
 teammates to make a team 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.180
 we can play with the cpu worth so that 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.890
 complete those two remaining holes or 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.000
 you have to be by force when with 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.500
 five or four friends and you do not and 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.480
 comments that yes you can can 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.940
 play with three players and the rest 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.090
 be cpu of the machine so there would not be 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.000
 no kind of problem another question is 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.800
 yes our my player our players 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.500
 have individual or 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.380
 exclusive what difference in mode 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.710
 proa m that we are talking about or the park 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.810
 and there's not going to be differences, it 's all 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.330
 unified which other good news fear 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.210
 the question is how do the 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.620
 ranking rankings will be 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.780
 determined by a percentage of 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.910
 victories matches played region 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.970
 what details could you give us about 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.350
 on this topic and this further comments what 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.060
 next the classifications are 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.580
 determine through a system of 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.060
 classification l 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.600
 Valerian been since you will say 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.590
 with connector 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.750
 on the other hand 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.680
 If we decide to change 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.199
 team 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.990
 these statistics that we have got 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.300
 individually will be lost will affect the 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.040
 Ranking ranking and this more 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.300
 he says that he will not do it or that he is going to 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.010
 keep staying something good 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.220
 it affected in January 215 you were in a 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.370
 park for example on the flyers like 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.139
 were we not minor town and then 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.290
 we changed the sunset at sunset beach 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:50.080
 and there we lost everything or they forced you 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.500
 to start from scratch any other change 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.900
 positive in this vean nba 2k 16 other 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.870
 question is can there be several 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.940
 test equipment m that have the same 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.740
 nickname for example by chicago wings or 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.110
 seven the wings for example and to this 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.669
 he tells me that not resounding is not going to 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.520
 must have been names names 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:16.210
 completely different and individual 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.669
 the two teams with the same name another 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.130
 interesting question is if we can by 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.900
 example play will be a kind of 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.389
 restriction in terms of position is 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.070
 say yes in the case that I know that 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.740
 our friends we are all bases 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.389
 let's all escorts or good is 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.520
 positive if we do not have any 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.020
 pivot if there will be some kind of problem or 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.039
 no and in principle there is no kind of 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.810
 restriction is to say that we can play 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:43.360
 everything will be all you cut all pivot 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.770
 ok there's going to be no kind of 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.389
 problems so we're not going to have to 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.220
 this question from our friends what 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.979
 position over the next year because there 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.960
 have any kind of more in that regard 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.370
 and finally the last question is if it goes 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.950
 to have somewhere a website 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.919
 or application on the mobile to be able to see 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.889
 these statistics of the prow and others 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:06.430
 Game results and the answer 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:09.220
 resounding yes or whether the kids 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.750
 way to try it looks great without 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.310
 doubt these questions this answer that 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.470
 we have seen that they contribute 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.110
 information that we did not know about this 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.680
 new game mode and the truth is that 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.310
 yes 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.720
 trainer- nba 236 getting better and better 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.419

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.270
 about this new game the denied k 16 the 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:30.430

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.270
 liked the video, yes, but I like it 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.430
 he tested these comments on these 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.680
 Cross novelties seem and we 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.000
 we see in the next video kids 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.000
 until next time
