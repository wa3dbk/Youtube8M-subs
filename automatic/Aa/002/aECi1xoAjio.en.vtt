00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.450 

I<00:00:04.790> want<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.879> connect<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.359> Arduino<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:07.410> my<00:00:07.830> PC

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
I want to connect the Arduino to my PC

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.549 
I want to connect the Arduino to my PC
for<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.820> first<00:00:09.120> time<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.690> what<00:00:10.410> I've<00:00:10.530> got

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
for the first time and what I've got

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.780 
for the first time and what I've got
here<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.130> my<00:00:11.429> Arduino<00:00:11.940> Uno<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:13.309> then<00:00:14.309> I've<00:00:14.549> got

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
here is my Arduino Uno and then I've got

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.570 
here is my Arduino Uno and then I've got
a<00:00:14.820> standard<00:00:15.750> USB<00:00:16.440> connector<00:00:16.619> cable<00:00:17.430> that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
a standard USB connector cable that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.769 
a standard USB connector cable that
comes<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.119> kit<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:19.980> my<00:00:20.670> laptop<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.750> a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
comes in the kit so my laptop here is a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.349 
comes in the kit so my laptop here is a
Windows<00:00:22.410> 8<00:00:22.619> laptop<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:23.910> my

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
Windows 8 laptop and on it I have my

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.990 
Windows 8 laptop and on it I have my
Arduino<00:00:25.019> sketch<00:00:25.460> software<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.670> let's<00:00:26.849> run

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
Arduino sketch software so let's run

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.609 
Arduino sketch software so let's run
this<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.160> comes<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:30.260> can<00:00:31.260> see

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
this and when it comes up I can see

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.670 
this and when it comes up I can see
right<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.189> under<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:32.730> tools<00:00:33.680> serial

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
right here that under my tools serial

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.040 
right here that under my tools serial
port<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.550> grayed<00:00:35.910> out<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.750> tells<00:00:36.930> me

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
port it's grayed out and it tells me

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.619 
port it's grayed out and it tells me
that<00:00:37.140> there's<00:00:37.469> not<00:00:37.829> anything<00:00:38.280> connected<00:00:39.000> as

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
that there's not anything connected as

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.360 
that there's not anything connected as
no<00:00:39.930> Arduino<00:00:40.410> connected<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.070> computer

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
no Arduino connected to this computer

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.459 
no Arduino connected to this computer
right<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.450> makes<00:00:42.600> sense<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.110> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
right now and that makes sense because I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.459 
right now and that makes sense because I
haven't<00:00:43.739> plugged<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:45.110> I'm<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.410> do

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
haven't plugged it in so I'm going to do

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.630 
haven't plugged it in so I'm going to do
the<00:00:46.590> obviously<00:00:46.950> you're<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> take<00:00:47.460> my

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the obviously you're going to take my

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.580 
the obviously you're going to take my
USB<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.870> I'm<00:00:48.930> gonna<00:00:49.020> plug<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.350> into<00:00:49.469> my

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
USB and I'm gonna plug it into my

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.889 
USB and I'm gonna plug it into my
computer<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.250> then<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.390> take<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
computer and then I'm going to take and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.240 
computer and then I'm going to take and
I'm<00:00:51.989> going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.170> plug<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.770> my<00:00:53.510> Arduino<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
I'm going to plug it into my Arduino I

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.200 
I'm going to plug it into my Arduino I
should<00:00:56.250> hear<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.489> thing<00:00:56.670> click<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
should hear this thing click for a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.400 
should hear this thing click for a
minute<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.140> through

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
minute and then it's going to go through

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.869 
minute and then it's going to go through
its<00:00:58.590> standard<00:00:58.949> stuff<00:00:59.219> it'll<00:00:59.489> come<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
its standard stuff it'll come up and

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.529 
its standard stuff it'll come up and
it'll<00:00:59.969> say<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.719> has<00:01:01.320> found<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> board

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
it'll say that it has found the board

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
it'll say that it has found the board
now<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.570> may<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.199> error<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.500> may<00:01:04.739> get<00:01:04.890> things

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
now I may get an error I may get things

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.469 
now I may get an error I may get things

that tell me that it doesn't didn't load
if<00:01:08.700> that's<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.540> case<00:01:09.720> there's<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> be

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
if that's the case there's going to be

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.600 
if that's the case there's going to be
another<00:01:10.619> tutorial<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.310> show<00:01:11.549> you

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
another tutorial that will show you

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.580 
another tutorial that will show you
where<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.909> find<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.330> drivers<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:13.049> they're

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
where to find the drivers there they're

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.929 
where to find the drivers there they're
locating<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.070> directory<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.640> stuff<00:01:14.909> that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
locating that directory and stuff that

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.880 
locating that directory and stuff that
we<00:01:15.180> downloaded<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.869> for<00:01:16.409> now<00:01:16.530> when<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.740> go<00:01:16.860> back

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
we downloaded but for now when I go back

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.359 
we downloaded but for now when I go back

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
may not have comm 11 I do ok so I'm

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.910 
may not have comm 11 I do ok so I'm
going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.759> select<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.180> says<00:01:27.900> use<00:01:28.170> column<00:01:28.530> 11

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
going to select that says use column 11

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.679 
going to select that says use column 11
I'm<00:01:29.729> then<00:01:29.939> going<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> come<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.479> I'm<00:01:30.570> going

I'm then going to come in and I'm going

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
I'm then going to come in and I'm going
to<00:01:30.750> select<00:01:30.900> my<00:01:31.140> board<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:31.799> there<00:01:32.400> all<00:01:32.610> kinds

using<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.350> true<00:01:46.680> Arduino<00:01:47.549> Uno<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:49.049> I'm<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.350> to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
using a true Arduino Uno so I'm going to

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.670 
using a true Arduino Uno so I'm going to
select<00:01:49.670> Arduino<00:01:50.670> Uno<00:01:51.320> I'm<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> come

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
select Arduino Uno I'm going to come

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.749 
select Arduino Uno I'm going to come
back<00:01:52.710> over<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.939> going<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.360> my<00:01:54.509> file

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
back over and I'm going to my file

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.490 
back over and I'm going to my file
examples<00:01:57.350> basic

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
examples basic

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.560 
examples basic
and<00:01:59.980> I'm<00:02:00.070> going<00:02:00.190> to<00:02:00.220> get<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.490> bare<00:02:00.880> minimum

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
and I'm going to get the bare minimum

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.370 
and I'm going to get the bare minimum
code<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:03.610> opens<00:02:03.940> up<00:02:04.090> into<00:02:04.390> a<00:02:04.420> new<00:02:04.870> window<00:02:05.080> so

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
code it opens up into a new window so

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.630 
code it opens up into a new window so
I'm<00:02:05.440> just<00:02:05.530> going<00:02:05.650> to<00:02:05.710> close<00:02:05.890> out<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.280> old<00:02:06.430> one

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
I'm just going to close out the old one

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.810 
I'm just going to close out the old one
here<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:06.970> over<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.240> new<00:02:07.390> one<00:02:08.490> this<00:02:09.490> is<00:02:09.700> the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
here and over the new one this is the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.000 
here and over the new one this is the
absolute<00:02:10.479> minimum<00:02:10.869> code<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.620> we<00:02:11.740> can<00:02:11.890> ever

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
absolute minimum code that we can ever

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.980 
absolute minimum code that we can ever
put<00:02:12.250> onto<00:02:12.550> an<00:02:12.640> Arduino<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.660> we're<00:02:13.780> going<00:02:13.900> to

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
put onto an Arduino and we're going to

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.440 
put onto an Arduino and we're going to
do<00:02:14.050> it<00:02:14.170> just<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.440> test<00:02:14.770> so<00:02:15.220> we're<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:15.940> hit

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
do it just to test so we're going to hit

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.010 
do it just to test so we're going to hit
the<00:02:16.660> upload<00:02:17.170> button<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:19.540> look<00:02:19.690> down<00:02:19.720> here

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
the upload button and we look down here

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.680 
the upload button and we look down here
it<00:02:20.140> says<00:02:20.320> it's<00:02:20.470> compiling<00:02:20.980> it's<00:02:21.910> uploading

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
it says it's compiling it's uploading

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.280 
it says it's compiling it's uploading
and<00:02:22.900> it's<00:02:23.110> done<00:02:23.760> that's<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:25.000> because<00:02:25.930> it's

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
and it's done that's it because it's

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.230 
and it's done that's it because it's
done<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.860> tells<00:02:27.130> us<00:02:27.370> now<00:02:27.580> that<00:02:27.640> we've<00:02:28.030> had

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
done that it tells us now that we've had

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.660 
done that it tells us now that we've had
connection<00:02:28.780> with<00:02:28.930> Arduino<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.860> our

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
connection with Arduino that our

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.510 
connection with Arduino that our
computer<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.630> talking<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.560> now<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.160> can

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
computer is talking to it and now we can

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.920 
computer is talking to it and now we can
step<00:02:33.730> off<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.150> we<00:02:34.270> can<00:02:34.420> start<00:02:34.630> trying<00:02:34.780> to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
step off and we can start trying to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.200 
step off and we can start trying to
write<00:02:35.080> some<00:02:35.290> code<00:02:35.440> so<00:02:35.830> very<00:02:36.460> simply<00:02:36.940> file

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
write some code so very simply file

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.980 
write some code so very simply file
examples<00:02:40.290> minimum<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:43.360> one<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.660> we<00:02:43.780> want

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
examples minimum is the one that we want

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.290 
examples minimum is the one that we want
to<00:02:44.080> use<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.530> test<00:02:44.770> just<00:02:45.550> to<00:02:45.670> make<00:02:45.820> sure<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.150> we

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
to use to test just to make sure that we

00:02:46.300 --> 00:03:02.970 
to use to test just to make sure that we
