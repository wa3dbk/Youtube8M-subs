00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.650
 how is my top model joy today 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.330
 with nine meters reason because I am 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.440
 But that alone is not the case 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.760
 problematic because I had like me 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.490
 always made a lot of notes and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.320
 hope you discuss with me 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.849
 where I have to say that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.870
 Somehow, today's episode does not seem to me that way 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.060
 liked it 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.130
 I do not know why it was even though much 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.539
 bi feeder bahn does not like it that way 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.990
 Pleased at the beginning with the post from to 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.910
 I think it's always nice when home 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.380
 the parents came to visit because of this 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.420
 times, unfortunately, so yes it is not natural 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.980
 beautiful the then to rejoice 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.149
 I was very interesting, there are none 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.860
 get post even if that is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.100
 enlightened so what if I'm special 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.239
 sad yes but I was happy 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.370
 When you partner family members 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.360
 flown no idea why 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.390
 this time is not meant to have not 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.250
 you have to save because wolfgang joop is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.670
 yes, I think twice and failed 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.930
 then the guests had to pick up and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.260
 probably because of the budget 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.489
 bit exhausted the battles I found 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.320
 honestly, not great either 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.910
 I find his catwalk challenge on 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.930
 beginning to match the end now safe 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.070
 but I always think so that is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.750
 actually have to have it on 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.010
 on the other side where should 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.760
 this cologne is no one him 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.950
 taught 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.180
 So I can not really believe it 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.710
 remember that the manes 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.189
 running training has that used to be one 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.270
 a bit more intense but not if 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.920
 these substances or not at all on non 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.970
 So that's what I'm wondering 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.170
 bit what you walked in the catwalk 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.909
 noticed is the word choice of daria 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.409
 So the snout 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.640
 i am completely honest i tend sometimes 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.780
 there too we pull people on the bag 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.729
 is going to iron a bit 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.500
 but with me is now in limits and 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.790
 I think I would not do that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.229
 the camera is on but maybe has 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.549
 That's why you know it 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.290
 Not 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.840
 What I also noticed is that it 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.009
 this mba world of topmodel so 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 no longer is that I am a pity 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.049
 because I find it very exciting 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.590
 Three girls are likely to go to New York and 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.060
 I found it to be honest 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.290
 totally out of place because I knew 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 that's not taken because they are not 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.770
 the dimensions so I think it's really pretty 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.590
 but I mean 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.000
 what the new york fashion week and how 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.609
 you never see a job before 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.530
 so far , it was totally stupid and yes no 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.179
 I 'm totally weird that the 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.929
 jury always says yes you get a job 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.670
 I do not get a job 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.230
 but it has no consequences i say 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.549
 he has that on the combination 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.950
 somehow preprogrammed distance 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:23.360
 I did not find coaching that way either 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.670
 exciting yes soon at the end and photo were 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.739
 now no werbetrÃ¤ger how would dance 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.140
 That's why not sooo cool now 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.650
 but the photo shoot perceive so 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.200
 better because that's just very elegant 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.819
 out with the towels and one the whole 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.709
 good or really great 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.660
 come out again 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.860
 I would wish that you 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.390
 maybe always the same as before 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.890
 make bodypainting like that 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.739
 not having to make crass properly 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.790
 bodypainting 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.110
 yes but I think they do not do that 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.209
 A very expensive course is also very 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.579
 the first season lasts long 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.110
 I think so Gehrke as a leopard 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.579
 or so asked her that was not 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.959
 really cool but otherwise never again 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.160
 made except at that time with barbara meier 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.889
 but no idea who on the fashion 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.079
 He has to say that Lisa and job 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.180
 to get 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.100
 manu can understand it, but as you saw 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.139
 I also look good on this car 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.420
 I am not that visa fan but me 

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:20.109
 I hated that because I fit 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.549
 have taken a surprise but have 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.109
 what we have a bit annoyed the study 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.579
 is it a common topic every what ever 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.680
 year appears is always a girl 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.239
 I have problems with men to shoot 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.359
 sunday have a text designer 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.430
 Noir sensual poses and I know that 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:35.810
 you should then find the old I want 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.400
 then you could want to 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.230
 you already can or should be 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.329
 Do not do it like that because I understand mine 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.700
 your friend lives on but success 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:47.540
 against that I see the problems well 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.849
 the girls are obviously different 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.250
 Studio was not quite green gave the rain 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.900
 it has ever been in season six award 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.189
 not sooo cool now 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.349
 I then in Saxon for later 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:01.560
 found me with little bikinis 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:03.000
 not so good this should be one 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.349
 but victoria's secret are ajar 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.790
 I do not have anything from victoria's secret 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.599
 seen except that the children had 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.599
 but I think it's not enough 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.629
 yes then he is kiki i found now 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.420
 not so surprising 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:19.169
 daria who ever said that city 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.370
 yourself as topmodel you where I can 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.780
 I get a bit of a spectator 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.400
 a good figure and a good size and 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.020
 I sometimes do not know result 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.000
 its sometimes worth specifying 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.050
 stuff about them and me 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.449
 my size is finally what 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.270
 counts and therefore 173 are really much 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.030
 smaller and I 'll open kiki already 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.410
 any case better chances yes that was 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.760
 that was a summary 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.370
 next week thinks next week 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.870
 thursday is a result and on sunday 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.979
 on sunday I will not quite 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.930
 say happy because i am in mallorca 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.039
 back and forth that in the next beach 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.389
 or at the pool no idea 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.250
 and I wanted and quite another 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.289
 address the topic and thus in the 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.430
 read the press 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.710
 germany's next topmodel promotes 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.300
 Anorexia in young girls I would 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.120
 like to know what you think I have 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.220
 to a opinion I think that is 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.500
 complete nonsense because I think there 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.310
 Do not make girls hungry with that 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.900
 usually girls 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.760
 have above average figures 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.190
 because knife for me no 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.780
 extreme emaciated people there are 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.520
 many girls who do it with or 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.900
 most of you probably just 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.510
 a slim figure who by nature 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.729
 Japan with 16 17 18 usually no problems 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.620
 if you have a good taste so 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.110
 I want that nonsense annoys me that 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.000
 bashing against skinny people extremely because 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.169
 I am also very slim and was too 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.669
 that's why it often criticizes me 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.280
 Personally , that's because I think so 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.000
 I prefer to be overweight and me 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.139
 find this topic because of it and because 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.690
 with thin one can say that at 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.740
 monster and says you're too fat then 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.020
 it always means oh how can you say it 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.210
 and plane is 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.919
 huge and I believe that it is more 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.990
 Overweight people are there 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.160
 anorexic and I believe that the 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.370
 overweight actually rather a 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.319
 socio trouble than everything 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.500
 Supplement is ultimately no matter because 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:59.270
 everyone live the way he feels good 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.620
 He does not care for himself long 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.940
 it harms and I mean that 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.610
 both directions so write me 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.099
 the comments on the subject thinks and he 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.190
 check that the video comes to that 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:09.190
 now
