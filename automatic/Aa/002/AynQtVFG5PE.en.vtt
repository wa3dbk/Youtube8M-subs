00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.369
 first finger second rope first fret 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.369
 with the sun position 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.060
 now network 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.310
 and these four are played with the last one in 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.930
 the first string third fret and 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.260
 we remove the first degree with the position 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.260
 network 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.940

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.940

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.930
 my minor 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.720
 and the least 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.130
 very well the intro is played with 204 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.410
 the sun 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.320
 that is repeated four times 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.549
 Y 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.840
 all right 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.790
 now of his 4 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.740
 While 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.280
 Y 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.380
 you 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.870
 very well now the first verse we play 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.870
 only four times with the rhythm 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.060
 twice 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.500
 the first choir when four months 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.570
 twice 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.840
 very good 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.530
 twice 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.700
 twice 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.440
 and now I'm taking 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.730
 sometimes 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.019
 Sun 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.350
 with only four times 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.540
 4 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.410
 two 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.849
 and now the choir changes is not the same as 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:02.090
 the first one is going to happen when four 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.090
 times 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.170
 Y 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.889
 two or four months 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.180
 then they are twice 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.940
 nations 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:50.249
 immediately we reach the sun or when 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.010
 those times 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.040
 twice 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.610
 twice 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.830
 and the least two kisses 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.410
 back to the third 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.840
 four times 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.699
 and then 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:40.700
 twice 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.700
 let's say two because of the risk of 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.240
 and queen 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.240
 do not 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.370
 or the network 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.530
 i 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.400
 now the end I like to attack him like this 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.150
 let's use the position of the sun and 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.150
 let's do this 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.720
 to 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.550
 and this is the good song we saved it
