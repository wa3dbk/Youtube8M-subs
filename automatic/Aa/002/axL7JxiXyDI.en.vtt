00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.070 
go and pretty much mainly update it and
I<00:00:23.340> figured<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.730> out<00:00:23.820> myself<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.420> some<00:00:24.930> other

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.210 
I figured this out myself but some other
people<00:00:25.350> all<00:00:25.439> trying<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.650> play<00:00:25.800> with<00:00:25.980> they

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.519 
couldn't seem to really figure out
themselves<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.930> have<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> try<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.349> walk

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
them through it and apparently they're

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.490

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
straightforward then again they might

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.720
