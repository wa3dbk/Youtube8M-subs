00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
side of the key and then there's a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.560 
side of the key and then there's a
little<00:00:48.870> tool<00:00:49.050> inside<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.550> notice<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.030> the

little tool inside and I notice on the
Jaguar<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:53.039> part<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> little

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
Jaguar that this this part is a little

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.720 
Jaguar that this this part is a little
cheaper<00:00:55.579> plastic<00:00:56.579> which<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.329> very<00:00:57.750> strange

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730

pressure
all<00:02:08.590> right<00:02:08.710> goes<00:02:08.890> okay<00:02:09.759> that<00:02:10.149> was<00:02:10.240> actually<00:02:10.600> a

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
all right goes okay that was actually a

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.190 
all right goes okay that was actually a
lot<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.960> pressure<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.470> thought<00:02:12.840> well<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.990> keep

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
lot of pressure I thought well to keep

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.720 
lot of pressure I thought well to keep
the<00:02:14.920> tool<00:02:15.160> put<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.880> back<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.740> then<00:02:17.740> this

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
the tool put it back in and then this

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.610 
the tool put it back in and then this
can<00:02:18.970> take<00:02:19.210> a<00:02:19.240> little<00:02:19.480> getting<00:02:19.870> used<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.320> but

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
can take a little getting used to but

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.580 
can take a little getting used to but
