00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
sandstone I'm in a venture mode and in

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.810 
sandstone I'm in a venture mode and in
venture<00:00:10.920> mode<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.219> can<00:00:11.370> use<00:00:11.400> flint<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.790> steel

venture mode you can use flint and steel
on<00:00:12.210> TNT<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.719> it'll<00:00:13.080> blow<00:00:13.259> up<00:00:13.440> but<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:14.670> you

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
on TNT and it'll blow up but what you

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.870 
on TNT and it'll blow up but what you
get<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.240> well<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> big<00:00:16.350> hole<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> ground<00:00:16.880> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
get is well a big hole in the ground and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.790 
get is well a big hole in the ground and
that's<00:00:18.390> not<00:00:18.539> necessarily<00:00:18.690> desirable<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.770> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
that's not necessarily desirable to a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.330 
that's not necessarily desirable to a

mode let's go to creative mode just to
place<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.399> now<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> little

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
place that and now we have a little

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.240 
place that and now we have a little
contraption<00:00:34.500> running<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> little

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
contraption running this is a little

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.370 
contraption running this is a little
piece<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.489> redstone<00:00:35.610> what<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> does<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.020> allows

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
piece of redstone what it does is allows

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.280 
piece of redstone what it does is allows
me<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.890> place<00:00:38.790> T&amp;T<00:00:39.239> I'm<00:00:39.600> an<00:00:39.719> adventure<00:00:40.110> mode

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
place TNT and it automatically gets lid

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.209 
place TNT and it automatically gets lid
off<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.870> it's<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.350> it's<00:00:46.440> I'm<00:00:46.950> kind

over<00:02:02.759> how<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.939> works<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.450> these<00:02:03.570> nine

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
over how it works it's just these nine

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.419 
command blocks these two command blocks
here<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:07.110> run<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> clock<00:02:07.500> this<00:02:07.860> constantly

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
here just run the clock this constantly

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.210 
here just run the clock this constantly
fills<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:09.330> area<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.989> redstone<00:02:10.560> blocks<00:02:10.950> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
fills this area with redstone blocks and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.160 
fills this area with redstone blocks and
stone

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
stone

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.370 
stone
this<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> 20<00:02:12.950> ticks<00:02:13.640> per<00:02:13.819> second<00:02:14.270> clock<00:02:14.660> this

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
this is a 20 ticks per second clock this

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.960 
this is a 20 ticks per second clock this
clock<00:02:15.680> runs<00:02:15.950> 20<00:02:16.250> times<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.490> second<00:02:16.819> and

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
clock runs 20 times a second and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.090 
clock runs 20 times a second and
triggers<00:02:17.480> all<00:02:17.600> these<00:02:17.690> command<00:02:17.959> blocks<00:02:18.100> okay

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
triggers all these command blocks okay

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.210 
triggers all these command blocks okay
so<00:02:19.160> on<00:02:19.490> this<00:02:19.670> side<00:02:19.940> what<00:02:20.209> we<00:02:20.330> have<00:02:21.220> actually

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
so on this side what we have actually

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.240 
so on this side what we have actually
let's<00:02:22.580> go<00:02:22.760> with<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.060> one<00:02:23.240> first<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.750> first<00:02:24.250> we

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
let's go with this one first so first we

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.280 
let's go with this one first so first we
look<00:02:25.280> for<00:02:25.790> any<00:02:26.030> prime<00:02:26.450> T<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:26.930> T<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.800> has<00:02:28.160> a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
look for any prime T and T that has a

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.140 
look for any prime T and T that has a
fuse<00:02:30.290> of<00:02:30.590> 1<00:02:30.980> which<00:02:31.220> means<00:02:31.400> one<00:02:31.670> tick<00:02:31.880> till<00:02:32.030> it's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
fuse of 1 which means one tick till it's

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.300 
fuse of 1 which means one tick till it's
going<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.360> explode<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.830> sets<00:02:34.070> its

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
going to explode and it sets its

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.460 
going to explode and it sets its
exploding<00:02:34.850> score<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.540> 1<00:02:35.720> this<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.110> trick<00:02:36.350> I

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
exploding score to 1 this is a trick I

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.250 
exploding score to 1 this is a trick I
used<00:02:36.740> in<00:02:36.980> my<00:02:37.520> recent<00:02:38.030> snapshot<00:02:38.390> video<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.140> it

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
used in my recent snapshot video so it

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.040 
used in my recent snapshot video so it
sets<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.620> exploding<00:02:40.130> score<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.580> 1<00:02:40.840> for<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.900> T

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
sets the exploding score to 1 for the T

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.310 
sets the exploding score to 1 for the T
and<00:02:42.170> T<00:02:42.319> then<00:02:42.920> for<00:02:43.610> any<00:02:43.730> TNT<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.959> has<00:02:45.140> an

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
and T then for any TNT that has an

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.140 
and T then for any TNT that has an
exploding<00:02:45.770> score<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.100> 1<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.940> going<00:02:47.090> to

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
exploding score of 1 it's going to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.030 
exploding score of 1 it's going to
summon<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> creeper<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.739> creeper<00:02:49.010> is

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
summon a creeper and the creeper is

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.009 
summon a creeper and the creeper is
going<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.250> have<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.400> fuse<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.880> 0<00:02:50.180> which<00:02:50.750> means

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
going to have a fuse of 0 which means

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.570 
going to have a fuse of 0 which means
it's<00:02:51.320> going<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.530> go<00:02:51.680> ahead<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.160> explode

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
it's going to go ahead and explode

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.610 
it's going to go ahead and explode
immediately<00:02:52.940> it's<00:02:53.060> also<00:02:53.180> invisible<00:02:53.630> has<00:02:54.350> an

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
immediately it's also invisible has an

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.199 
immediately it's also invisible has an
invisibility<00:02:54.950> effect<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.860> TNT<00:02:58.370> has<00:02:59.180> a

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
invisibility effect so so the TNT has a

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.460 
invisibility effect so so the TNT has a
fuse<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.630> 1<00:02:59.780> it's<00:02:59.959> about<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:00.230> explode

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
fuse of 1 it's about to explode

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.170 
fuse of 1 it's about to explode
someone's<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> creeper<00:03:01.250> that's<00:03:01.459> that's<00:03:01.910> also

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
someone's a creeper that's that's also

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.820 
someone's a creeper that's that's also
about<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.540> explode<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.080> then<00:03:03.560> we<00:03:05.050> oh<00:03:06.050> this<00:03:06.709> is

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
about to explode and then we oh this is

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.320 
about to explode and then we oh this is
not<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.250> one<00:03:07.459> then<00:03:08.000> we<00:03:08.360> where<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.170> it<00:03:09.670> oh<00:03:10.670> it's

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
not the one then we where is it oh it's

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.640 
not the one then we where is it oh it's
over<00:03:11.420> here

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
over here

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.350 
over here
then<00:03:13.370> we<00:03:13.519> kill<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.150> TNT<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.680> basically<00:03:16.640> it

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
then we kill the TNT so basically it

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.930 
then we kill the TNT so basically it
replaces<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.930> TNT<00:03:18.290> with<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.470> creeper<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:18.980> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
replaces the TNT with a creeper and the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.319 
replaces the TNT with a creeper and the
game<00:03:20.180> rule<00:03:20.530> mob<00:03:21.530> griefing<00:03:21.829> is<00:03:22.250> turned<00:03:22.910> off<00:03:23.060> so

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
game rule mob griefing is turned off so

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.150 
game rule mob griefing is turned off so
creepers<00:03:24.049> can't<00:03:24.380> cause<00:03:24.590> damage<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.010> the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
creepers can't cause damage to the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.069 
creepers can't cause damage to the
terrain<00:03:25.519> with<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.269> game<00:03:26.480> roll<00:03:26.690> off<00:03:26.840> so

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
terrain with this game roll off so

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.229 
terrain with this game roll off so
basically<00:03:27.470> that's<00:03:27.769> how<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.579> prevent<00:03:28.910> damage

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
basically that's how you prevent damage

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.390 
basically that's how you prevent damage
to<00:03:29.269> the<00:03:29.930> ambient<00:03:30.350> terrain<00:03:30.650> now<00:03:31.130> you<00:03:31.190> might<00:03:31.370> ask

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
to the ambient terrain now you might ask

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.220 
to the ambient terrain now you might ask
how<00:03:31.880> did<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.120> get<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.420> holes<00:03:32.600> to<00:03:32.840> appear<00:03:33.079> in<00:03:33.170> the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
how did I get the holes to appear in the

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.130 
how did I get the holes to appear in the
walls<00:03:33.410> if<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:34.209> TNT<00:03:35.209> wasn't<00:03:35.540> causing<00:03:35.870> damage

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
walls if the TNT wasn't causing damage

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.410 
walls if the TNT wasn't causing damage
to<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.260> train<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.769> answer<00:03:37.040> is<00:03:37.220> I've<00:03:37.610> kind

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
to the train and the answer is I've kind

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.030 
to the train and the answer is I've kind
of<00:03:38.480> used<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.660> little<00:03:38.780> bit<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.959> trickery<00:03:39.140> here<00:03:39.290> so

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
of used a little bit of trickery here so

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.160 
of used a little bit of trickery here so
we've<00:03:40.250> got<00:03:40.489> these<00:03:41.090> are<00:03:41.239> normal<00:03:41.690> stone<00:03:41.870> brick

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
we've got these are normal stone brick

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.729 
we've got these are normal stone brick
blocks

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
blocks

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.550 
blocks
I<00:03:42.769> like<00:03:43.340> this<00:03:43.610> normal<00:03:44.120> stone<00:03:44.299> brick<00:03:44.530> but<00:03:45.530> I

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
I like this normal stone brick but I

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.949 
I like this normal stone brick but I
used<00:03:46.340> stone<00:03:46.940> brick<00:03:47.239> Moss<00:03:47.480> rig<00:03:47.780> that's

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
used stone brick Moss rig that's

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.680 
used stone brick Moss rig that's
basically<00:03:48.890> stone<00:03:49.760> brick<00:03:50.000> with<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.180> silver<00:03:50.420> fish

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
basically stone brick with a silver fish

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.330 
basically stone brick with a silver fish
and<00:03:50.900> then<00:03:50.989> similarly<00:03:51.350> cracked<00:03:51.829> stone<00:03:52.100> brick

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
and then similarly cracked stone brick

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.170 
and then similarly cracked stone brick
monster<00:03:52.730> egg<00:03:52.880> and<00:03:53.110> and<00:03:54.579> when<00:03:55.579> the<00:03:55.700> team's<00:03:55.940> he

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
monster egg and and when the team's he

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.500 
monster egg and and when the team's he
goes<00:03:56.360> off<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:57.110> basically<00:03:57.850> runs<00:03:58.850> a<00:03:58.970> big<00:03:59.150> replace

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
goes off it basically runs a big replace

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.170 
goes off it basically runs a big replace
command<00:03:59.959> in<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.260> area<00:04:00.560> around<00:04:00.860> it<00:04:01.180> looking

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
command in the area around it looking

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.110 
command in the area around it looking
for<00:04:02.590> monster<00:04:03.590> egg<00:04:03.739> blocks<00:04:04.070> and<00:04:04.430> replaces<00:04:04.940> them

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
for monster egg blocks and replaces them

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.840 
for monster egg blocks and replaces them
with<00:04:05.150> air<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:06.079> we<00:04:06.590> have<00:04:06.680> to<00:04:06.799> execute<00:04:07.100> prime<00:04:07.640> T

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
with air so we have to execute prime T

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.640 
with air so we have to execute prime T
and<00:04:08.000> T<00:04:08.120> with<00:04:08.329> a<00:04:08.359> score<00:04:08.690> of<00:04:08.720> exploding<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.560> at

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
and T with a score of exploding of at

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.069 
and T with a score of exploding of at
least<00:04:09.739> one<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.910> fills<00:04:11.359> the<00:04:11.510> area<00:04:11.660> around

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
least one and it fills the area around

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.220 
least one and it fills the area around
that<00:04:12.380> with<00:04:12.769> air<00:04:13.130> ok<00:04:13.970> so<00:04:14.030> then<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.690> final<00:04:15.019> thing

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
that with air ok so then the final thing

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.860 
that with air ok so then the final thing
that<00:04:15.260> I<00:04:15.530> need<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.039> go<00:04:16.579> over<00:04:16.729> is<00:04:16.970> how<00:04:17.539> did<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:17.750> get

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
that I need to go over is how did I get

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.500 
that I need to go over is how did I get
the<00:04:17.959> TNT<00:04:18.350> to<00:04:18.500> explode<00:04:18.890> automatically<00:04:19.519> or<00:04:19.789> get

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
the TNT to explode automatically or get

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.849 
the TNT to explode automatically or get
ignited<00:04:20.840> automatically<00:04:21.289> without<00:04:21.470> me<00:04:21.739> having

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
ignited automatically without me having

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.670 
ignited automatically without me having
to<00:04:22.070> use<00:04:23.060> flint<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.660> steel

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
to use flint and steel

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.980 
to use flint and steel
and<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.190> that's<00:04:25.400> these<00:04:26.300> command<00:04:26.600> blocks<00:04:26.660> over

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
and so that's these command blocks over

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.580 
and so that's these command blocks over
here<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:28.330> basically<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.630> looks<00:04:30.199> for<00:04:30.610> a<00:04:32.590> player

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
here it basically it looks for a player

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.370 
here it basically it looks for a player
who<00:04:33.620> just<00:04:34.280> set<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.580> down<00:04:34.610> to<00:04:34.910> TMT<00:04:35.330> so<00:04:35.660> if<00:04:36.169> I<00:04:36.259> go

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
who just set it down to TMT so if I go

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.230 
who just set it down to TMT so if I go

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
use item dot minecraft TNT so if you

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.140 
use item dot minecraft TNT so if you
look<00:04:47.840> in<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> side<00:04:48.229> very<00:04:48.889> briefly<00:04:49.340> my<00:04:49.669> TNT

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
look in the side very briefly my TNT

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.020 
look in the side very briefly my TNT
score<00:04:50.419> turns<00:04:50.690> to<00:04:50.900> 1<00:04:51.110> every<00:04:51.889> time<00:04:52.100> I<00:04:52.490> place<00:04:52.820> down

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
score turns to 1 every time I place down

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.210 
score turns to 1 every time I place down
a<00:04:53.060> TNT<00:04:53.539> that's<00:04:54.080> how<00:04:54.259> it<00:04:54.410> knows<00:04:54.590> to<00:04:55.009> um<00:04:57.220> well

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
a TNT that's how it knows to um well

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.980 
a TNT that's how it knows to um well
would<00:04:59.150> that<00:04:59.330> guy<00:04:59.570> come<00:04:59.750> from

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
would that guy come from

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.719 
would that guy come from
I<00:05:00.139> know<00:05:00.710> where<00:05:00.889> that<00:05:00.919> guy<00:05:01.130> came<00:05:01.160> from<00:05:01.340> anyway

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
I know where that guy came from anyway

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.379 
I know where that guy came from anyway
that's<00:05:02.479> how<00:05:02.599> it<00:05:02.780> knows<00:05:02.930> how<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:04.550> look<00:05:05.090> for

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
that's how it knows how to to look for

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.379 
that's how it knows how to to look for
TNT<00:05:05.930> to<00:05:06.349> ignite<00:05:06.620> but<00:05:06.860> basically<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.820> fills<00:05:08.180> the

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
TNT to ignite but basically it fills the

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.570 
TNT to ignite but basically it fills the
area<00:05:08.570> around<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.259> player<00:05:09.530> who<00:05:09.919> just<00:05:09.949> placed<00:05:10.490> a

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
area around the player who just placed a

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.640 
area around the player who just placed a
TNT<00:05:10.849> block<00:05:11.150> with<00:05:11.810> a<00:05:11.840> bunch<00:05:12.199> of<00:05:12.320> upside-down

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
TNT block with a bunch of upside-down

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.339 
TNT block with a bunch of upside-down
levers<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:14.060> you<00:05:14.210> can't<00:05:14.479> see<00:05:14.750> him<00:05:14.840> because<00:05:15.169> it

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
levers and you can't see him because it

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:16.980 
levers and you can't see him because it
immediately<00:05:15.620> deletes<00:05:16.190> them<00:05:16.370> after<00:05:16.669> that

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
immediately deletes them after that

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.990 
immediately deletes them after that
right<00:05:17.990> here<00:05:18.259> this<00:05:18.470> replaces<00:05:18.949> the<00:05:19.130> levers<00:05:19.729> with

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
right here this replaces the levers with

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.790 
right here this replaces the levers with
air<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:21.940> and<00:05:22.940> then<00:05:23.630> it<00:05:23.750> resets<00:05:24.110> your<00:05:24.349> TM<00:05:24.650> T

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
air and and then it resets your TM T

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.710 
air and and then it resets your TM T
squared<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.160> zero<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:25.639> that<00:05:25.669> it<00:05:25.849> doesn't<00:05:26.630> keep

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
squared to zero so that it doesn't keep

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.450 
squared to zero so that it doesn't keep
trying<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:26.990> do<00:05:27.080> this<00:05:27.229> 20<00:05:27.800> times<00:05:27.830> a<00:05:28.099> second

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
trying to do this 20 times a second

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.830 
trying to do this 20 times a second
that's<00:05:29.030> there<00:05:29.240> you<00:05:29.300> go<00:05:29.389> that's<00:05:29.510> how<00:05:29.630> it<00:05:29.720> all

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
that's there you go that's how it all

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.620 
that's there you go that's how it all
works<00:05:30.050> it's<00:05:30.949> not<00:05:31.159> too<00:05:32.060> many<00:05:32.150> command<00:05:32.449> blocks

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
works it's not too many command blocks

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.390 
works it's not too many command blocks
it's<00:05:32.900> pretty<00:05:33.380> simple<00:05:33.710> but<00:05:33.949> it's<00:05:34.280> got

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
it's pretty simple but it's got

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.740 
it's pretty simple but it's got
basically<00:05:34.849> all<00:05:34.970> the<00:05:35.090> functionality<00:05:35.630> you<00:05:35.659> want

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
basically all the functionality you want

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.740 
basically all the functionality you want
for<00:05:36.199> an<00:05:36.289> adventure<00:05:36.590> map<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:37.639> only<00:05:37.849> thing<00:05:38.090> you

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
for an adventure map the only thing you

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.240 
for an adventure map the only thing you
really<00:05:38.810> have<00:05:39.020> to<00:05:39.080> worry<00:05:39.229> about<00:05:39.349> is<00:05:39.680> it<00:05:39.979> is

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
really have to worry about is it is

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.060 
really have to worry about is it is
going<00:05:40.430> to<00:05:40.520> trigger<00:05:40.760> TNT<00:05:41.539> so<00:05:41.840> let's<00:05:42.169> see<00:05:42.320> if<00:05:42.740> I

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
going to trigger TNT so let's see if I

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.100 
going to trigger TNT so let's see if I
go<00:05:43.940> ahead<00:05:44.030> and<00:05:44.210> pick<00:05:44.360> up<00:05:44.510> a<00:05:44.690> command<00:05:44.990> block

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
go ahead and pick up a command block

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.529 
go ahead and pick up a command block
let's<00:05:45.830> say<00:05:46.010> I<00:05:46.039> had<00:05:46.610> a<00:05:46.639> command<00:05:46.970> block<00:05:47.030> here<00:05:47.389> and

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
let's say I had a command block here and

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.870 
let's say I had a command block here and
it<00:05:47.630> had<00:05:47.750> some<00:05:48.020> command<00:05:48.349> in<00:05:48.470> it<00:05:48.560> let's<00:05:48.889> just<00:05:49.760> use

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
it had some command in it let's just use

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.490 
it had some command in it let's just use
that<00:05:50.000> for<00:05:50.060> example<00:05:50.360> that's<00:05:51.199> going<00:05:51.349> to<00:05:51.409> get

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
that for example that's going to get

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.620 
that for example that's going to get
triggered<00:05:51.830> if<00:05:52.010> I<00:05:52.220> place<00:05:52.909> the<00:05:53.060> TNT<00:05:53.389> nearby

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
triggered if I place the TNT nearby

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.270 
triggered if I place the TNT nearby
because<00:05:53.990> it's<00:05:54.139> filling<00:05:54.470> up<00:05:54.560> this<00:05:54.620> entire<00:05:54.800> area

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
because it's filling up this entire area

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.899 
because it's filling up this entire area
with<00:05:55.970> powered<00:05:56.570> levers<00:05:57.080> and<00:05:57.320> so<00:05:58.220> any<00:05:58.400> redstone

00:05:58.899 --> 00:05:58.909 
with powered levers and so any redstone

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:00.999 
with powered levers and so any redstone
your<00:05:59.630> bike<00:05:59.780> is<00:06:00.050> going<00:06:00.229> to<00:06:00.289> get<00:06:00.409> triggered<00:06:00.710> so

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:01.009 
your bike is going to get triggered so

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.010 
your bike is going to get triggered so
basically<00:06:01.820> if<00:06:02.300> you're<00:06:02.570> going<00:06:02.690> to<00:06:02.750> use<00:06:02.840> this

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
basically if you're going to use this

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.890 
basically if you're going to use this
technique<00:06:03.380> you<00:06:04.099> need<00:06:04.340> to<00:06:04.610> not<00:06:05.030> have<00:06:05.060> redstone

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
technique you need to not have redstone

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.680 
technique you need to not have redstone
nearby<00:06:06.550> unless<00:06:07.550> you<00:06:07.729> actually<00:06:08.120> do<00:06:08.449> want<00:06:08.630> to

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
nearby unless you actually do want to

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.920 
nearby unless you actually do want to
treat<00:06:08.870> that's<00:06:09.620> how<00:06:09.740> it<00:06:09.800> works<00:06:10.599> yeah<00:06:11.599> that's

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
treat that's how it works yeah that's

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:23.580 
treat that's how it works yeah that's
about<00:06:12.020> it<00:06:12.199> thanks<00:06:12.440> for<00:06:12.470> watching

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.710 

you

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720
