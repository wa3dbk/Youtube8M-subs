00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
I've ever used it just you know makes

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.910 
I've ever used it just you know makes
the<00:04:05.060> job<00:04:05.240> so<00:04:05.600> much<00:04:05.750> easier<00:04:06.200> but<00:04:06.440> it's<00:04:06.650> still<00:04:06.890> a

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
the job so much easier but it's still a

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.830 
the job so much easier but it's still a
hard<00:04:07.190> job<00:04:07.490> there<00:04:07.790> was<00:04:07.910> still<00:04:08.150> times<00:04:08.480> where

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
hard job there was still times where

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.350 
hard job there was still times where
there<00:04:09.590> was<00:04:09.680> just<00:04:09.890> really<00:04:10.220> tricky<00:04:10.460> lighting

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
there was just really tricky lighting

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.710 
there was just really tricky lighting
situations<00:04:11.900> like<00:04:12.020> a<00:04:12.080> mix<00:04:12.350> of<00:04:12.530> candlelight<00:04:13.280> and

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
situations like a mix of candlelight and

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.340 
situations like a mix of candlelight and
tungsten<00:04:14.720> light<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.140> fluorescent<00:04:15.740> light<00:04:15.950> and

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
tungsten light and fluorescent light and

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.520 
tungsten light and fluorescent light and
early<00:04:18.350> on<00:04:18.530> also<00:04:19.130> window<00:04:19.549> light<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.230> it's<00:04:21.230> just

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
early on also window light and it's just

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.170 
early on also window light and it's just
tricky<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:22.130> sometimes<00:04:22.610> getting<00:04:22.910> focused

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
tricky and sometimes getting focused

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.240 
tricky and sometimes getting focused
even<00:04:23.750> with<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.170> best<00:04:24.380> glass<00:04:24.650> on<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.070> best

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
even with the best glass on the best

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.140 
even with the best glass on the best
body<00:04:25.690> in<00:04:26.690> my<00:04:26.960> opinion<00:04:27.440> it's<00:04:28.400> still<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.790> hard

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
body in my opinion it's still a hard

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.090 
body in my opinion it's still a hard
thing<00:04:29.450> and<00:04:29.720> you<00:04:29.990> have<00:04:30.200> to<00:04:30.230> be<00:04:30.440> able<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.770> get<00:04:30.950> it

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
thing and you have to be able to get it

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.950
