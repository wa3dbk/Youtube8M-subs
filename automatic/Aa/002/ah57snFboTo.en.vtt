00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.240
 hello I am christian solmecke 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.950
 lawyer and partner of the cologne 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.570
 law firm wilde beuger &amp; 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.580
 Solmecke and it's Sunday again 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.250
 and ask time for your users and for 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:21.340
 much has our last video too 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.660
 the attorney fees and there ask 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.430
 wayne johnson i do not quite understand 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.800
 why the costs rise so much 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.869
 absolute and not percentage if that 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.099
 The lawyer has a higher dispute value 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.880
 risk or how can that be done 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.340
 justify 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.140
 yes so it is so we already risk 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.550
 because of course we are lawyers in 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.230
 the liability when it comes to a lot of money 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.310
 then we are in a higher one too 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.280
 liability in it 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.130
 On the other hand, I say it is 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.230
 expenses for expensive legal disputes 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.730
 not necessarily higher and higher you can 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.500
 Imagine that when I have one 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.270
 bump on the car then can the 300 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.300
 euro cost or 3000 euro 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.920
 to repair these trees but the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.390
 Expense attorney is exactly the same 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.350
 because it's about clarifying who has the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.030
 citizen 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.280
 so that 's sometimes the case 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.190
 By the way, it's not fair to us 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.950
 even if we then for 300 euros 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.040
 only 80 90 euro if we get this 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.890
 legal dispute but almost clear it 4 56 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.280
 Fache if we just this 3000 euro 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.840
 but loot have the risk in the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.580
 liability that justifies then 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.550
 maybe that we have more money 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.840
 get when the Streitwert rises 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.520
 then there is a question of max he says 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.550
 I have been working for a long time 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.810
 forum is also becoming more successful 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.460
 I have a user number and 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.010
 clicks I wonder what's up 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.230
 now if suddenly my users 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.990
 post pornographic content in the 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.440
 forum or copyright violate how 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.240
 I can exclude the liability for this 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.550
 it is on my homepage my 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.470
 server very important you have to 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.510
 Make sure the content is not 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.370
 look like your content but you 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.100
 must be clearly marked 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:02.530
 as contents of third then it is 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.630
 namely user-generated content 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.060
 and for user generated content of the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.069
 It first after knowledge of the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.050
 illegality that is, someone has to 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.150
 you say hey there are illegal content 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.069
 on a server as possible 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.360
 right-holder, of course, and only then 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.910
 you have to delete and for this note 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.790
 he has not even one can not even 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.300
 bill attorney fees 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.690
 Last question for today's round comes 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.030
 I ask games from captain 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.130
 counterstrike and there you can do music in 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.120
 background this music will be heard 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.000
 but not voted but 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.980
 downloaded and before I even 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.080
 all files will go to the server 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.750
 downloaded and on the computer 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.550
 installed and that would be official 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.800
 Music is also public 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.209
 I do not know exactly what he can buy 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.370
 now in official music, I mean 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.680
 type that is chart music 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.150
 act and this music can then 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.160
 to download the mobile phone 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.300
 You still have to do that 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.250
 describe in more detail 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.920
 I find that very exciting when 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.200
 one at such counter strike servers 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.910
 actually official chart music 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.470
 then get into the game 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.610
 and this music on the computer 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.400
 is downloaded 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.090
 that would be pretty safe 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.590
 copyright infringement for that 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.630
 counter-strike as any rights 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.190
 I just bought that 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.720
 not introduce 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.130
 and probably they are then 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.239
 just maybe on the server too 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.340
 uploaded by users 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.810
 So you have to be careful and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.430
 especially you have to be careful that you 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.010
 this music does not continue somehow 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.650
 because then you all together man 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.239
 could have connected a network 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.250
 it's like being wrong, there too 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.549
 exchanged music with each other 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.440
 becomes 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.910
 I thank you very much for 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.489
 these many exciting user questions 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.750
 created 3 i know you want the 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.450
 videos should be longer therefore 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.380
 we have already taken three 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.940
 we always take the most exciting 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.100
