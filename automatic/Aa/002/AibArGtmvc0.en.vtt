third-generation super soldiers again
were<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.140> next<00:00:07.910> development<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.900> next

advancement of and where he was even
more<00:00:13.950> enhancements<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.910> was<00:00:15.660> even<00:00:16.080> getting<00:00:16.650> a

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
more enhancements it was even getting a

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.240 
more enhancements it was even getting a
lot<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:20.960> surgical<00:00:21.960> procedures<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.070> were

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
lot of surgical procedures that were

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.240 
lot of surgical procedures that were
causing<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.970> we're<00:00:24.090> doing<00:00:24.180> modifications

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
causing that we're doing modifications

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.490 
causing that we're doing modifications
like<00:00:26.250> my<00:00:26.550> first<00:00:26.820> one<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.390> when<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.750> was<00:00:28.050> five

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
like my first one was when I was five

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.669 
like my first one was when I was five
years<00:00:28.529> old<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.310> then<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> had<00:00:30.390> him

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
years old and then I had him

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.880 
years old and then I had him
periodically<00:00:31.699> throughout<00:00:33.170> further<00:00:34.170> implants

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.430 
periodically throughout further implants
not<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.339> implants<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.150> track<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.780> but

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
not just implants that track you but

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.920 
not just implants that track you but
implants<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.699> turn<00:00:38.970> instead<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.690> having

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
implants that in turn instead of having

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.810 
implants that in turn instead of having

one<00:01:13.020> thing<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.350> didn't<00:01:13.860> mention<00:01:14.010> before

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
one thing that I didn't mention before

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.960 
one thing that I didn't mention before
is<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:15.560> first<00:01:16.560> generation<00:01:16.800> super<00:01:17.550> soldiers

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970

had usually around five alters so they

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.330 
had usually around five alters so they
would<00:01:20.280> split<00:01:20.580> their<00:01:20.730> alternates<00:01:21.530> for<00:01:22.530> four

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
