it's<00:02:51.269> not<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.420> little<00:02:51.660> character<00:02:52.110> which<00:02:52.260> goes

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
it's not a little character which goes

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.070 
it's not a little character which goes
that<00:02:52.739> way<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.920> believe<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.900> rest<00:02:54.900> are
