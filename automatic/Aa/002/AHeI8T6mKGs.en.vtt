inches<00:00:19.160> if<00:00:20.160> one<00:00:20.430> side<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.699> nicer<00:00:21.029> than<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
inches if one side is nicer than the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.240 
inches if one side is nicer than the
other<00:00:21.449> lay<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.320> two<00:00:22.470> knife<00:00:22.680> sides<00:00:22.949> down

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
other lay the two knife sides down

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.400

facing<00:00:23.820> each<00:00:23.939> other<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.390> then<00:00:24.900> pin<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> two

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
facing each other and then pin the two

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.780 
facing each other and then pin the two
circles<00:00:25.740> together<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> two<00:00:32.340> circle

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
circles together so the two circle

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.549 
circles together so the two circle
pieces<00:00:33.120> together<00:00:33.329> leaving<00:00:34.020> about<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.260> three

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
pieces together leaving about a three

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
pieces together leaving about a three
inch<00:00:34.710> gap<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.730> will<00:00:35.910> let<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> turn<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
inch gap this will let you turn it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.229 
inch gap this will let you turn it
right-side<00:00:36.719> out

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.000 

once<00:00:44.840> you<00:00:44.960> have<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:45.230> turned<00:00:45.440> right<00:00:45.649> side<00:00:45.680> out

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
once you have it turned right side out

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.250 
once you have it turned right side out
take<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.670> two<00:00:46.850> rough<00:00:47.120> edges<00:00:47.360> on<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.870> sides<00:00:48.079> of

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
take the two rough edges on the sides of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.010 
take the two rough edges on the sides of
the<00:00:48.379> cap<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:48.800> turn<00:00:49.100> them<00:00:49.250> in<00:00:49.399> word<00:00:49.870> pin<00:00:50.870> them

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
the cap and turn them in word pin them

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.920 
the cap and turn them in word pin them
together<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:51.649> then<00:00:51.829> you<00:00:51.949> can<00:00:51.980> sew<00:00:52.309> it<00:00:52.460> shut

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
together and then you can sew it shut

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.630 
together and then you can sew it shut
these<00:00:53.930> stitches<00:00:54.440> will<00:00:54.649> show<00:00:54.920> on<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.220> outside

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
these stitches will show on the outside

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.580 
these stitches will show on the outside
so<00:00:56.210> find<00:00:56.480> a<00:00:56.570> thread<00:00:56.750> that'll<00:00:57.079> go<00:00:57.199> nicely<00:00:57.410> with

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
so find a thread that'll go nicely with

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.560 
so find a thread that'll go nicely with
your<00:00:57.829> fabric<00:00:58.219> with<00:01:00.550> our<00:01:01.550> capstone<00:01:01.879> shut<00:01:02.300> we're

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
your fabric with our capstone shut we're

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.299 
your fabric with our capstone shut we're
now<00:01:02.720> ready<00:01:02.900> to<00:01:03.050> stitch<00:01:03.379> a<00:01:03.500> pocket<00:01:03.890> into<00:01:04.070> our

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
now ready to stitch a pocket into our

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.149 
now ready to stitch a pocket into our
fabric<00:01:05.140> this<00:01:06.140> can<00:01:06.380> be<00:01:06.500> accomplished<00:01:07.040> by

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
fabric this can be accomplished by

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.609 
fabric this can be accomplished by
stitching<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:07.909> circle<00:01:08.300> about<00:01:08.720> one<00:01:08.930> inch<00:01:09.200> inside

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
stitching a circle about one inch inside

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.130 
stitching a circle about one inch inside
the<00:01:09.740> perimeter<00:01:10.390> once<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.630> is<00:01:11.750> complete

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
the perimeter once that is complete

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.889 
the perimeter once that is complete
stitch<00:01:12.830> another<00:01:13.130> one<00:01:13.430> about<00:01:13.850> 3/4<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.659> an<00:01:14.810> inch

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
stitch another one about 3/4 of an inch

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.100 
stitch another one about 3/4 of an inch
inside<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:15.590> first<00:01:16.539> this<00:01:17.539> will<00:01:17.780> create<00:01:17.990> the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
inside the first this will create the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.609 
inside the first this will create the
desired<00:01:18.619> pocket<00:01:19.810> with<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:20.840> in<00:01:21.110> place<00:01:21.259> our

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
desired pocket with that in place our

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.410 
desired pocket with that in place our
next<00:01:21.890> step<00:01:22.070> is<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.340> set<00:01:22.640> two<00:01:22.880> eyelets<00:01:23.240> on

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
next step is to set two eyelets on

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.160 
next step is to set two eyelets on
opposite<00:01:23.960> ends<00:01:24.170> of<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.289> circle<00:01:25.780> using<00:01:26.780> seam

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
opposite ends of the circle using seam

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.350 
opposite ends of the circle using seam
rippers<00:01:27.530> or<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:27.920> pair<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.250> scissors<00:01:28.460> cut

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
rippers or a pair of scissors cut

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.200 
rippers or a pair of scissors cut
through<00:01:29.570> just<00:01:29.780> one<00:01:30.050> layer<00:01:30.320> of<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.649> fabric<00:01:31.210> the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
through just one layer of the fabric the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.120 
through just one layer of the fabric the
hole<00:01:32.420> needs<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.780> be<00:01:32.899> big<00:01:33.080> enough<00:01:33.110> to<00:01:33.560> slip<00:01:33.920> in

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
hole needs to be big enough to slip in

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.310 
hole needs to be big enough to slip in
the<00:01:34.250> long<00:01:34.460> part<00:01:34.789> of<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.000> eyelid<00:01:35.330> but<00:01:35.899> not<00:01:36.080> so

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
the long part of the eyelid but not so

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.590 
the long part of the eyelid but not so
big<00:01:36.560> that<00:01:36.770> it<00:01:36.890> falls<00:01:37.100> out<00:01:37.310> easily<00:01:37.600> achieving

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
big that it falls out easily achieving

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.020 
big that it falls out easily achieving
this<00:01:38.720> can<00:01:38.960> be<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.110> little<00:01:39.380> tricky<00:01:39.590> but<00:01:40.030> the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
this can be a little tricky but the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.210 
this can be a little tricky but the
shorter<00:01:41.390> portion<00:01:41.750> of<00:01:41.929> the<00:01:42.050> eyelet<00:01:42.409> over<00:01:43.100> the

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
shorter portion of the eyelet over the

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.570 
shorter portion of the eyelet over the
long<00:01:43.399> one<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.270> we're<00:01:44.420> ready<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.810> set<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.580> we

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
long one and we're ready to set it we

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.249 
long one and we're ready to set it we
talked<00:01:46.789> about<00:01:46.909> setting<00:01:47.270> eyelets<00:01:47.750> a<00:01:47.869> little<00:01:48.110> in

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
talked about setting eyelets a little in

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.870 
talked about setting eyelets a little in
lesson<00:01:48.590> three<00:01:48.860> but<00:01:49.189> we'll<00:01:49.369> go<00:01:49.520> over<00:01:49.759> it<00:01:49.820> again

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
lesson three but we'll go over it again

after you cut your ribbon I would

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.800 
after you cut your ribbon I would
suggest<00:02:52.069> tying<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:52.760> two<00:02:52.939> ends<00:02:53.150> together<00:02:53.390> so

suggest tying the two ends together so

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.119 
suggest tying the two ends together so
