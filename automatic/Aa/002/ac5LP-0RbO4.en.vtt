Merlot's<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.930> suggestion<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> start<00:01:07.950> by

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
Merlot's my suggestion is to start by

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.590 
Merlot's my suggestion is to start by
pouring<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.460> couple<00:01:08.729> ounces<00:01:08.880> into<00:01:09.299> your<00:01:09.390> glass

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
pouring a couple ounces into your glass

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.899 
pouring a couple ounces into your glass
then<00:01:10.380> taking<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:10.830> glass<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> flat<00:01:11.670> surface

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and gently spinning it this will allow

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.580 
and gently spinning it this will allow
the<00:01:15.030> liquid<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.540> spin<00:01:15.869> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> bottom<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.500> the
