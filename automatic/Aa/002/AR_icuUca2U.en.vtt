he's already capacitors you and went
into<00:01:00.860> this<00:01:01.100> board<00:01:04.780> yeah<00:01:05.780> those<00:01:06.620> three<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:08.570> a

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
into this board yeah those three and a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.380 
into this board yeah those three and a
little<00:01:09.560> to<00:01:09.740> the<00:01:10.490> two<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:10.880> I<00:01:10.940> told<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.270> about

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
little to the two that I told you about

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.450 
little to the two that I told you about
earlier<00:01:11.690> can<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.380> see<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:15.220> three<00:01:16.220> on<00:01:16.370> the

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
earlier can you see that three on the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.210 
earlier can you see that three on the
right<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.970> two<00:01:18.910> three<00:01:19.910> they're<00:01:20.180> two<00:01:20.660> they're

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
right and two three they're two they're

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.040 
right and two three they're two they're
replaced<00:01:22.220> it<00:01:22.520> by<00:01:22.730> the<00:01:22.940> TV<00:01:23.360> still<00:01:23.540> not<00:01:23.720> coming

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
replaced it by the TV still not coming

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.469 
replaced it by the TV still not coming
on<00:01:24.230> okay<00:01:25.160> now<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.820> see<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:26.150> right<00:01:26.690> here<00:01:28.479> this

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
on okay now you see this right here this

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.750 
on okay now you see this right here this
right<00:01:29.720> here<00:01:29.780> is<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.350> five<00:01:30.590> volts<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.460> turns

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
right here is the five volts that turns

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.170 
right here is the five volts that turns
this<00:01:32.000> board<00:01:32.360> on<00:01:32.630> okay<00:01:33.380> once<00:01:34.220> it<00:01:34.369> does<00:01:34.550> that<00:01:34.580> it

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
this board on okay once it does that it

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.700 
this board on okay once it does that it
goes<00:01:35.420> through<00:01:35.690> this<00:01:35.810> whole<00:01:36.020> processing<00:01:36.590> this

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
goes through this whole processing this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.150 
goes through this whole processing this
main<00:01:36.979> chip<00:01:37.310> here<00:01:37.550> is<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.760> processor<00:01:38.450> okay

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
main chip here is the processor okay

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.130 
main chip here is the processor okay
this<00:01:40.160> is<00:01:40.400> all<00:01:40.790> this<00:01:41.210> circuits<00:01:41.720> tree<00:01:41.930> right

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
this is all this circuits tree right

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.290 
this is all this circuits tree right
here<00:01:42.440> this<00:01:42.680> is<00:01:42.740> what<00:01:43.040> turns<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:43.670> big<00:01:43.940> board

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
here this is what turns this big board

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.410 
here this is what turns this big board
here<00:01:44.630> on<00:01:44.780> this<00:01:45.320> is<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.619> y-sustain<00:01:45.830> board<00:01:46.420> you

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
here on this is the y-sustain board you

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.200 
here on this is the y-sustain board you
see<00:01:47.600> how<00:01:47.750> they<00:01:47.990> connect<00:01:48.740> right<00:01:49.550> there<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.119> you

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
see how they connect right there so you

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.570 
see how they connect right there so you
got<00:01:50.330> an<00:01:50.510> input<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:51.140> then<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:51.800> got<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.070> output

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
got an input and then you got the output

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.930 
got an input and then you got the output
right<00:01:52.820> here<00:01:53.950> okay<00:01:54.950> that's<00:01:55.340> gonna<00:01:55.490> turn<00:01:55.760> on

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
right here okay that's gonna turn on

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.719 
right here okay that's gonna turn on
this<00:01:56.180> board<00:01:56.479> right<00:01:56.630> here<00:01:56.960> this<00:01:57.950> wire<00:01:58.369> right

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
this board right here this wire right

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.919 
this board right here this wire right
here<00:01:58.789> has<00:01:59.330> I<00:01:59.690> want<00:02:00.649> to<00:02:00.710> say<00:02:00.800> ten<00:02:01.039> circuits<00:02:01.929> that

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
here has I want to say ten circuits that

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.190 
here has I want to say ten circuits that
feeds<00:02:03.470> this<00:02:03.920> board<00:02:04.369> right<00:02:04.670> here<00:02:04.990> one<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.110> the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
feeds this board right here one of the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.820 
feeds this board right here one of the
circuits<00:02:06.679> is<00:02:06.920> called<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:08.440> you<00:02:09.440> can<00:02:09.590> look<00:02:09.710> at

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
circuits is called the you can look at

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.250 
circuits is called the you can look at
this<00:02:10.009> section<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.580> board<00:02:10.910> right<00:02:11.150> here<00:02:11.600> it

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
this section of the board right here it

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:30.460 
this section of the board right here it
says<00:02:12.500> set<00:02:12.920> up<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.700> see<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:29.930> set<00:02:30.319> up

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
says set up you see it so that set up

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.080 
says set up you see it so that set up
this<00:02:31.370> set<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.790> circuits<00:02:32.300> right<00:02:32.930> here<00:02:34.090> okay

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
this set of circuits right here okay

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.440 
this set of circuits right here okay
it's<00:02:35.300> being<00:02:35.510> powered<00:02:35.990> from<00:02:36.560> right<00:02:36.860> here

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
it's being powered from right here

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.210 
it's being powered from right here
there's<00:02:38.450> uh<00:02:38.569> I<00:02:39.020> think<00:02:39.230> it's<00:02:39.350> number<00:02:39.530> 11

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
there's uh I think it's number 11

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.100 
there's uh I think it's number 11
somewhere<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:40.850> this<00:02:41.000> pin<00:02:41.330> right<00:02:41.360> here<00:02:41.600> one<00:02:42.020> of

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
somewhere on this pin right here one of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.750 
somewhere on this pin right here one of
these<00:02:42.200> pins<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.830> think<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.160> what<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.550> one

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
these pins I think is what this one

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.290 
these pins I think is what this one
right<00:02:43.910> here<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.270> pin<00:02:44.510> number<00:02:44.540> 11<00:02:45.670> that's<00:02:46.670> once

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
right here is pin number 11 that's once

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.890 
right here is pin number 11 that's once
once<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.080> what<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.220> chip<00:02:49.520> here<00:02:49.970> sends<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
once that what this chip here sends the

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.580 
once that what this chip here sends the
three<00:02:51.170> volts<00:02:51.620> through<00:02:51.980> here<00:02:52.780> right<00:02:53.780> that's

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
three volts through here right that's

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.650 
three volts through here right that's
when<00:02:54.980> that's<00:02:55.370> when<00:02:55.550> this<00:02:55.850> puppy<00:02:56.209> here<00:02:56.420> gets

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
when that's when this puppy here gets

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.160 
when that's when this puppy here gets
activated<00:02:58.209> yeah<00:02:59.240> if<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.569> three<00:02:59.810> volts

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
activated yeah if the three volts

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.550 
activated yeah if the three volts
doesn't<00:03:00.500> come<00:03:00.740> from<00:03:01.400> here<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:03.590> won't<00:03:03.890> turn<00:03:04.070> on

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
doesn't come from here it won't turn on

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.250 
doesn't come from here it won't turn on
you<00:03:08.290> know<00:03:09.580> this<00:03:10.580> ship<00:03:10.910> this<00:03:11.390> ship<00:03:11.450> here<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:12.020> bad

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
you know this ship this ship here is bad

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.680 
you know this ship this ship here is bad
on<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.950> on<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.910> logic<00:03:14.120> board<00:03:17.140> logic<00:03:19.090> yeah<00:03:20.090> so

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
on the on the logic board logic yeah so

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.930 
on the on the logic board logic yeah so
what<00:03:21.290> I'm<00:03:21.410> gonna<00:03:21.530> do<00:03:21.800> now<00:03:22.010> is<00:03:22.370> I'm<00:03:22.820> gonna

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.450 
what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna
replace<00:03:23.270> this<00:03:23.540> chip<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:24.560> if<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.010> comes<00:03:25.130> on

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
replace this chip and if it comes on

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.900 
replace this chip and if it comes on
then<00:03:25.790> we<00:03:25.910> know<00:03:26.060> this<00:03:26.270> board<00:03:26.600> is<00:03:26.750> bad<00:03:26.960> okay<00:03:27.950> once

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
then we know this board is bad okay once

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.730 
then we know this board is bad okay once
it<00:03:29.030> comes<00:03:29.240> on<00:03:29.450> we<00:03:29.630> got<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.840> let<00:03:29.960> it<00:03:30.020> play<00:03:30.230> for<00:03:30.320> a

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
it comes on we got to let it play for a

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.490 
it comes on we got to let it play for a
while<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.790> know<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.210> see<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.840> see<00:03:33.170> what<00:03:33.380> are

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
while you know and see you see what are

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.460 
while you know and see you see what are
the<00:03:33.590> problems<00:03:33.980> my<00:03:34.190> my<00:03:34.580> decor<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.300> then<00:03:36.110> first

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
the problems my my decor and then first

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.170 
the problems my my decor and then first
test<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.370> setup<00:03:37.760> circuit<00:03:38.600> here<00:03:38.840> for<00:03:39.170> any

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
test this setup circuit here for any

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.080 
test this setup circuit here for any
shortage<00:03:41.180> shortages<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:43.370> know<00:03:43.490> like<00:03:43.700> like<00:03:44.060> a

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
shortage shortages you know like like a

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.180 
shortage shortages you know like like a
short<00:03:44.450> or<00:03:44.690> something<00:03:44.990> like<00:03:45.110> that<00:03:45.170> if<00:03:46.040> the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
short or something like that if the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.920 
short or something like that if the
problem<00:03:46.490> starts<00:03:46.790> here<00:03:47.000> it'll<00:03:47.209> blow<00:03:47.480> this<00:03:47.660> chip

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
problem starts here it'll blow this chip

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.440 
problem starts here it'll blow this chip
back<00:03:48.140> out<00:03:48.350> again

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
back out again

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.960 
back out again
so<00:03:50.450> we<00:03:50.830> diagnosed<00:03:51.830> these<00:03:52.040> circuits<00:03:52.520> here<00:03:52.670> make

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
so we diagnosed these circuits here make

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.680 
so we diagnosed these circuits here make
sure<00:03:53.090> this<00:03:53.300> is<00:03:53.480> two<00:03:53.780> but<00:03:55.090> yeah<00:03:56.090> just<00:03:56.360> from<00:03:56.450> what

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
sure this is two but yeah just from what

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.110 
sure this is two but yeah just from what
I<00:03:56.720> can<00:03:56.840> see<00:03:56.990> here<00:03:57.440> at<00:03:57.530> these<00:03:57.980> two<00:03:58.250> FETs<00:03:58.610> here<00:03:58.880> to

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
I can see here at these two FETs here to

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.990 
I can see here at these two FETs here to
a<00:03:59.150> part<00:03:59.570> of<00:03:59.630> this<00:03:59.810> circuit<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:01.640> know<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:01.940> I

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
a part of this circuit you know and I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.520 
a part of this circuit you know and I
just<00:04:02.240> tested<00:04:02.540> them<00:04:02.690> they're<00:04:02.900> they're<00:04:03.140> they're

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
just tested them they're they're they're

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.770 
just tested them they're they're they're
great<00:04:03.709> you<00:04:04.520> know<00:04:04.610> so<00:04:04.880> hopefully<00:04:05.090> hopefully

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
great you know so hopefully hopefully

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.300 
great you know so hopefully hopefully
this<00:04:06.140> chips<00:04:06.500> not<00:04:06.800> bad<00:04:07.300> you<00:04:08.300> know<00:04:08.330> but<00:04:08.750> I

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
this chips not bad you know but I

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.040 
this chips not bad you know but I
wouldn't<00:04:10.310> know<00:04:10.459> until<00:04:10.700> I<00:04:11.050> start<00:04:12.050> from<00:04:12.230> here

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
wouldn't know until I start from here

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.890 
wouldn't know until I start from here
from<00:04:15.050> this<00:04:15.230> trip<00:04:15.530> here<00:04:15.800> getting<00:04:16.640> that<00:04:16.820> in<00:04:17.030> then

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
from this trip here getting that in then

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.159 
from this trip here getting that in then
we<00:04:18.500> can<00:04:18.650> go<00:04:18.739> from<00:04:18.890> there<00:04:20.200> alright<00:04:23.169> it'll

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
we can go from there alright it'll

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.190 
we can go from there alright it'll
probably<00:04:24.440> be<00:04:24.650> tomorrow<00:04:25.220> again<00:04:26.030> I'll<00:04:26.360> give<00:04:27.080> you

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
probably be tomorrow again I'll give you

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.659 
probably be tomorrow again I'll give you
a<00:04:27.229> call<00:04:27.500> probably<00:04:28.010> like<00:04:28.130> around<00:04:29.560> twelve<00:04:30.669> if

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
a call probably like around twelve if

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.810 
a call probably like around twelve if
you've<00:04:31.880> got<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.150> time<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:33.520> we<00:04:34.520> can<00:04:34.700> do

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
you've got the time and we can do

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.490 
you've got the time and we can do
another<00:04:35.060> video<00:04:35.330> conference<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.080> got<00:04:36.229> to<00:04:36.350> go

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
another video conference I got to go

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.040 
another video conference I got to go
locate<00:04:36.950> that<00:04:37.160> chip<00:04:37.460> drop<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.360> in<00:04:38.479> it's<00:04:38.750> not<00:04:38.900> the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
locate that chip drop it in it's not the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:59.260 
locate that chip drop it in it's not the
whole<00:04:39.169> board<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:41.860> it<00:04:42.860> from<00:04:43.010> there

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.780 

no<00:04:59.419> problem
