00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.220 

oh<00:03:46.880> I<00:03:47.880> think<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.270> should<00:03:48.450> give<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> rating

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
oh I think you should give that a rating

oh I think you should give that a rating
and<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.890> think<00:03:50.130> it's<00:03:50.280> gonna<00:03:50.400> write<00:03:50.640> highly<00:03:51.800> okay

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800

and I think it's gonna write highly okay
I<00:03:53.040> guess<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.580> could<00:03:53.730> do<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:54.030> uh<00:03:55.370> chanting<00:03:56.370> this

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
I guess I could do that uh chanting this

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.140 
I guess I could do that uh chanting this
is<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.670> best<00:03:56.850> thing<00:03:57.030> in<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.180> world<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.820> can't
