00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.130 

so<00:00:04.339> sometimes<00:00:04.790> when<00:00:05.060> thinking<00:00:05.509> about<00:00:05.779> space

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
so sometimes when thinking about space

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.230 
so sometimes when thinking about space
we<00:00:06.380> just<00:00:06.410> use<00:00:06.859> the<00:00:07.040> word<00:00:07.189> star<00:00:07.609> in<00:00:07.819> general<00:00:08.120> and

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
we just use the word star in general and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.600 
we just use the word star in general and
we<00:00:08.299> just<00:00:08.510> think<00:00:08.629> of<00:00:08.840> stars<00:00:09.680> but<00:00:10.340> there<00:00:10.519> are

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
we just think of stars but there are

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.339 
we just think of stars but there are
many<00:00:10.790> different<00:00:11.180> types<00:00:11.510> of<00:00:11.780> stars<00:00:12.049> so<00:00:12.259> we're

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
many different types of stars so we're

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.169 
many different types of stars so we're
going<00:00:12.440> to<00:00:12.530> take<00:00:12.650> a<00:00:12.679> look<00:00:12.860> at<00:00:12.980> some<00:00:13.160> of<00:00:13.250> those<00:00:13.370> so

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
going to take a look at some of those so

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:21.370 
going to take a look at some of those so
one<00:00:14.389> is<00:00:14.540> the<00:00:14.719> main<00:00:15.110> sequence<00:00:16.099> star<00:00:19.869> so<00:00:20.869> most

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
one is the main sequence star so most

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.089 
one is the main sequence star so most
stars<00:00:21.800> are<00:00:22.099> a<00:00:22.130> main<00:00:22.550> sequence<00:00:23.090> star<00:00:23.919> so<00:00:24.919> the

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
stars are a main sequence star so the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.830 
stars are a main sequence star so the
majority<00:00:25.309> of<00:00:25.520> stars<00:00:25.759> our<00:00:25.970> main<00:00:26.210> sequence<00:00:26.630> star

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
majority of stars our main sequence star

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.260 
majority of stars our main sequence star
so<00:00:26.989> this<00:00:27.110> is<00:00:27.200> just<00:00:27.349> your<00:00:27.500> normal<00:00:28.220> star<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:28.700> you

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
so this is just your normal star and you

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.269 
so this is just your normal star and you
may<00:00:29.390> not<00:00:29.570> know<00:00:29.630> that<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.259> Sun<00:00:30.500> is<00:00:30.680> actually<00:00:30.860> a

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
may not know that the Sun is actually a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.200 
may not know that the Sun is actually a
star

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
star

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.000 
star
it's<00:00:32.719> just<00:00:32.989> happens<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.380> be<00:00:33.440> very<00:00:33.559> close<00:00:33.860> to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
it's just happens to be very close to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.470 
it's just happens to be very close to
Earth<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:34.430> provide<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:34.940> provides<00:00:35.270> us<00:00:35.420> with

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
Earth so provide it provides us with

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.900 
Earth so provide it provides us with
heat<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.530> Sun<00:00:36.739> is<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:36.949> main<00:00:37.250> sequence<00:00:37.609> star

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
heat so the Sun is a main sequence star

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.919 
heat so the Sun is a main sequence star
and<00:00:38.449> then<00:00:39.109> we<00:00:39.230> have<00:00:40.329> red<00:00:42.969> supergiant's<00:00:43.969> that's

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
and then we have red supergiant's that's

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.650 
and then we have red supergiant's that's
another<00:00:45.140> type<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:46.519> a<00:00:47.089> star<00:00:47.359> that<00:00:47.510> you're

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
another type and a star that you're

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.979 
another type and a star that you're
familiar<00:00:47.809> with<00:00:48.109> it's<00:00:48.289> a<00:00:48.379> red<00:00:48.589> supergiant<00:00:49.429> is

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
familiar with it's a red supergiant is

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.860 
familiar with it's a red supergiant is
Betelgeuse<00:00:51.969> which<00:00:52.969> isn't<00:00:53.210> really<00:00:53.359> spelled

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
Betelgeuse which isn't really spelled

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.569 
Betelgeuse which isn't really spelled
like<00:00:54.289> you<00:00:54.589> think<00:00:54.739> Betelgeuse<00:00:55.280> would<00:00:55.460> be

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
like you think Betelgeuse would be

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.250 
like you think Betelgeuse would be
spelled<00:00:55.879> but<00:00:56.749> it<00:00:56.839> has<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.079> same

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
spelled but it has the same

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.009 
spelled but it has the same
pronunciation<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.480> give<00:00:59.629> you<00:00:59.659> an<00:00:59.839> idea

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
pronunciation and so to give you an idea

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.160 
pronunciation and so to give you an idea
of<00:01:00.409> how<00:01:01.129> big<00:01:01.339> these<00:01:01.460> types<00:01:01.729> of<00:01:01.909> stars<00:01:02.210> are<00:01:02.479> I'm

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
of how big these types of stars are I'm

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.439 
of how big these types of stars are I'm
going<00:01:03.379> to<00:01:03.440> kind<00:01:03.710> of<00:01:03.739> provide<00:01:03.979> an<00:01:04.159> analogy<00:01:04.760> some

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
going to kind of provide an analogy some

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.820 
going to kind of provide an analogy some
other<00:01:05.570> types<00:01:05.810> of<00:01:05.930> starts<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.290> gets<00:01:06.590> you<00:01:06.710> were

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
other types of starts and gets you were

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.860 
other types of starts and gets you were
the<00:01:06.979> white<00:01:07.159> dwarf<00:01:07.370> and<00:01:07.730> the<00:01:07.790> red<00:01:07.970> dwarf<00:01:08.300> then

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
the white dwarf and the red dwarf then

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.540 
the white dwarf and the red dwarf then
right<00:01:08.990> here<00:01:09.140> I<00:01:09.200> have<00:01:09.530> Sun<00:01:10.070> which<00:01:10.310> is<00:01:10.460> an

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:10.550 
right here I have Sun which is an

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.430 
right here I have Sun which is an
example<00:01:10.850> it's<00:01:11.150> kind<00:01:11.330> of<00:01:11.360> representing<00:01:12.230> main

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
example it's kind of representing main

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.040 
example it's kind of representing main
sequence<00:01:12.950> stars<00:01:13.190> in<00:01:13.430> general<00:01:13.760> so<00:01:14.450> if<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.780> Sun

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
sequence stars in general so if the Sun

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.750 
sequence stars in general so if the Sun
were<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.800> size<00:01:16.040> of<00:01:16.160> a<00:01:16.250> dime

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
were the size of a dime

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.600 
were the size of a dime
then<00:01:17.570> Betelgeuse<00:01:18.140> would<00:01:18.410> be<00:01:18.560> about<00:01:18.920> 3<00:01:19.220> meters

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
then Betelgeuse would be about 3 meters

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.460 
then Betelgeuse would be about 3 meters
short<00:01:19.910> of<00:01:20.060> being<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.480> size<00:01:20.690> of<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.290> football

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
short of being the size of a football

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.550 
short of being the size of a football
field<00:01:21.650> including<00:01:22.780> both<00:01:23.780> end<00:01:24.080> zones

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
field including both end zones

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.560 
field including both end zones
well<00:01:25.460> it<00:01:25.520> seems<00:01:25.670> it's<00:01:25.820> only<00:01:25.940> three<00:01:26.180> meters<00:01:26.270> off

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
well it seems it's only three meters off

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.170 
well it seems it's only three meters off
we'll<00:01:26.780> say<00:01:26.900> it's<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.170> size<00:01:27.380> of<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.940> football

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
we'll say it's the size of a football

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.230 
we'll say it's the size of a football
field<00:01:29.360> now<00:01:30.350> white<00:01:30.950> dwarf<00:01:31.280> would<00:01:31.520> be<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.970> size

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
field now white dwarf would be the size

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.580 
field now white dwarf would be the size
of<00:01:32.920> small<00:01:33.920> bacterium<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:38.140> red<00:01:39.140> dwarf<00:01:39.410> would

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
of small bacterium and red dwarf would

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.350 
of small bacterium and red dwarf would
be<00:01:39.680> about<00:01:39.830> the<00:01:39.980> size<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:41.170> sesame<00:01:42.170> seed<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:44.300> I

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
be about the size of a sesame seed so I

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.930 
be about the size of a sesame seed so I
can<00:01:44.510> kind<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:44.750> just<00:01:44.840> number<00:01:45.590> these<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:46.070> order

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
can kind of just number these in order

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.940 
can kind of just number these in order
right<00:01:47.090> here<00:01:47.150> so<00:01:47.720> football<00:01:48.200> fields<00:01:48.530> obviously

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
right here so football fields obviously

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.740 
right here so football fields obviously
the<00:01:49.070> largest<00:01:49.660> then<00:01:50.660> we<00:01:50.780> go<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.800> dime<00:01:52.750> then

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
the largest then we go to the dime then

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.390 
the largest then we go to the dime then
the<00:01:53.960> sesame<00:01:54.470> seed<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:54.740> then<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.160> small

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
the sesame seed and then the small

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.910 
the sesame seed and then the small
bacterium<00:01:56.030> so<00:01:56.630> even<00:01:56.780> idea<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.230> relative<00:01:57.650> size

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
bacterium so even idea the relative size

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.680 
bacterium so even idea the relative size
here<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:59.570> a<00:02:00.610> Sun<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.880> white<00:02:02.030> dwarf<00:02:02.240> or

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
here and so a Sun and a white dwarf or

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.270 
here and so a Sun and a white dwarf or
excuse<00:02:02.960> me<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.140> Sun<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.620> red<00:02:03.770> dwarf<00:02:03.950> or

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
excuse me the Sun and the red dwarf or

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.740 
excuse me the Sun and the red dwarf or
somewhat<00:02:04.700> similar<00:02:05.000> in<00:02:05.030> size<00:02:05.240> but<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.510> small

million kilometers in diameter then
Betelgeuse<00:02:20.750> is<00:02:20.989> about<00:02:21.730> 825<00:02:22.730> million

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
Betelgeuse is about 825 million

it's<00:02:25.310> located<00:02:25.700> about<00:02:26.080> 640<00:02:27.080> light<00:02:27.620> years<00:02:27.830> from

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
it's located about 640 light years from

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.870 
it's located about 640 light years from
the<00:02:28.040> Sun<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:28.520> fact<00:02:29.360> if<00:02:29.630> Betelgeuse<00:02:30.349> were

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
the Sun in fact if Betelgeuse were

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.490 
the Sun in fact if Betelgeuse were
located<00:02:31.880> in<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.000> same<00:02:32.150> place<00:02:32.209> as<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.750> Sun<00:02:32.989> it

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
located in the same place as the Sun it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.290 
located in the same place as the Sun it
would<00:02:33.620> extend<00:02:33.980> past<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.760> orbit<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.239> Jupiter

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
would extend past the orbit of Jupiter

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.180 
would extend past the orbit of Jupiter
so<00:02:36.200> if<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.380> think<00:02:36.470> about<00:02:36.590> where<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.920> Sun<00:02:37.160> is

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
so if you think about where the Sun is

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.350 
so if you think about where the Sun is
and<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.640> new<00:02:37.760> thing<00:02:37.910> about<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.239> other

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
and the new thing about the other

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.790 
and the new thing about the other
planets<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:38.989> he<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.680> know<00:02:39.769> where<00:02:39.920> Jupiter<00:02:40.400> is

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
planets and he you know where Jupiter is

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.589 
planets and he you know where Jupiter is
Betelgeuse<00:02:42.800> would<00:02:43.069> take<00:02:43.250> up<00:02:43.430> all<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:44.450> this

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
Betelgeuse would take up all of this

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.800 
Betelgeuse would take up all of this
area<00:02:44.959> that's<00:02:45.860> how<00:02:46.040> large<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.849> it's<00:02:47.450> huge

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810

still 25 to 50 times the diameter of the
Sun<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.480> think<00:03:20.630> about<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.900> Sun<00:03:21.140> being

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
Sun so you think about the Sun being

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.500 
Sun so you think about the Sun being
really<00:03:21.950> huge<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.489> provide<00:03:22.790> all<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:22.970> heat<00:03:23.329> to

really huge to provide all that heat to

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.810 
really huge to provide all that heat to
the<00:03:23.630> earth<00:03:23.840> but<00:03:24.739> really<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.310> Sun<00:03:25.579> is

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
the earth but really the Sun is

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.970 
the earth but really the Sun is

extremely small when compared to most

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.259 
extremely small when compared to most
stars<00:03:28.840> or<00:03:29.840> maybe<00:03:30.560> not<00:03:30.769> most<00:03:31.040> stars<00:03:31.459> because

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
stars or maybe not most stars because

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.420 
stars or maybe not most stars because
main-sequence<00:03:32.810> stars<00:03:33.230> are<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.069> large<00:03:34.220> kind

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
main-sequence stars are the large kind

main-sequence stars are the large kind
of<00:03:34.519> star<00:03:34.670> but<00:03:34.880> the<00:03:34.970> Sun<00:03:35.209> is<00:03:35.329> extremely<00:03:36.109> small
