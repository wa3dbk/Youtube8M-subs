00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.430 
rupees we can get 3 rupees in two ways
let's<00:01:36.960> draw<00:01:37.259> it<00:01:37.380> here<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.100> use<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:39.210> rupee

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
let's draw it here you can use one rupee

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.380 
let's draw it here you can use one rupee
plus<00:01:40.610> another<00:01:41.610> 1<00:01:41.970> rupee<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.710> another<00:01:43.710> 1<00:01:43.950> rupee

which would equal

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.220 
which would equal
three<00:01:47.860> rupees<00:01:48.070> or<00:01:48.610> we<00:01:49.570> can<00:01:49.690> also<00:01:49.840> do<00:01:50.140> it

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
three rupees or we can also do it

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.340 
three rupees or we can also do it
another<00:01:50.470> way<00:01:50.590> we<00:01:51.430> could<00:01:51.580> draw<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.660> to<00:01:52.930> repeat

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
another way we could draw the to repeat

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.670 
another way we could draw the to repeat
coin<00:01:53.560> plus<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.880> one<00:01:55.420> rupee<00:01:55.630> coin<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.410> the

coin plus a one rupee coin and the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.760 
coin plus a one rupee coin and the
answer<00:01:57.040> for<00:01:57.280> that<00:01:57.490> would<00:01:58.480> also<00:01:58.690> be<00:01:58.900> three

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
answer for that would also be three

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.300 
answer for that would also be three
rupees<00:02:01.980> now<00:02:02.980> let<00:02:03.220> us<00:02:03.250> try<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.610> get<00:02:03.910> four<00:02:04.420> rupees

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
rupees now let us try to get four rupees

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.969 
rupees now let us try to get four rupees
again<00:02:06.310> we<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:07.060> use<00:02:07.330> for<00:02:08.020> one<00:02:08.350> rupee<00:02:08.560> coins

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
again we can use for one rupee coins

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.710 
again we can use for one rupee coins
let's<00:02:09.850> draw<00:02:10.119> that<00:02:10.440> one<00:02:11.440> repeat<00:02:12.390> another<00:02:13.390> one

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
let's draw that one repeat another one

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.050 
let's draw that one repeat another one
repeat<00:02:14.340> one<00:02:15.340> more<00:02:15.400> repeat<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.360> another<00:02:17.260> one

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
repeat one more repeat and another one

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.920 
repeat one more repeat and another one
equals<00:02:19.680> four<00:02:20.680> rupees<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:22.540> we<00:02:22.600> can<00:02:22.900> use

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
equals four rupees now we can use

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.830 
equals four rupees now we can use
another<00:02:23.350> combination<00:02:23.740> we<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:24.310> use<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:25.420> repeat

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
another combination we can use to repeat

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.180 
another combination we can use to repeat
coins<00:02:26.430> that's<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.850> coin<00:02:28.150> two<00:02:28.600> rupees<00:02:29.190> plus

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190

another<00:02:30.490> 2<00:02:30.760> rupee<00:02:31.090> coin<00:02:31.350> equals<00:02:33.270> equals<00:02:34.270> four

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
another 2 rupee coin equals equals four

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.010 
another 2 rupee coin equals equals four
rupees<00:02:35.550> okay<00:02:36.550> that's<00:02:36.790> two<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.390> repeat<00:02:37.780> coins
