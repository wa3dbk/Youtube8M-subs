its<00:00:18.060> own<00:00:18.210> any<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.720> its<00:00:18.930> power<00:00:19.170> keys<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:20.880> there's

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
its own any of its power keys so there's

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.609 
its own any of its power keys so there's
several<00:00:21.300> ways<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:21.869> fuel<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.230> thing<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
several ways you can fuel this thing I

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.160 
several ways you can fuel this thing I
guess<00:00:22.800> get<00:00:23.039> some<00:00:23.189> arrows<00:00:23.900> right<00:00:24.900> click

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
guess get some arrows right click

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.689 
guess get some arrows right click
they'll<00:00:25.350> just<00:00:25.529> shoot<00:00:25.619> one<00:00:25.949> hour<00:00:26.160> out<00:00:26.430> last

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
they'll just shoot one hour out last

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.310 
they'll just shoot one hour out last
time<00:00:26.869> so<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.050> thought<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.680> chingam<00:00:29.189> them

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
time so you thought you can chingam them

time so you thought you can chingam them
all<00:00:31.320> right<00:00:31.439> if<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.610> left<00:00:33.030> click<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.450> shoots<00:00:33.719> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
all right if you left click it shoots a

all right if you left click it shoots a
shopping<00:00:34.440> style<00:00:35.340> pellet<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:37.320> now<00:00:39.110> each<00:00:40.110> time

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
shopping style pellet and now each time

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.490 
shopping style pellet and now each time
you<00:00:40.680> shoot<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.219> she's<00:00:41.760> highly<00:00:42.120> effective<00:00:42.719> and

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you shoot it she's highly effective and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.069 
you shoot it she's highly effective and

may<00:02:02.790> be<00:02:02.850> wrong<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:04.670> you're<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.759> fair

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
may be wrong on that but you're not fair

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
may be wrong on that but you're not fair
if<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.420> don't<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> promising<00:02:07.170> here<00:02:07.439> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
if you don't have a promising here you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.949 
if you don't have a promising here you
get<00:02:08.190> klein<00:02:08.580> star<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.149> you're<00:02:09.270> doing<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.720> little

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
get klein star and you're doing a little

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.589 
get klein star and you're doing a little
bit<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.229> charge<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.550> will<00:02:11.700> use<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.030> emc

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
bit of charge of it it will use the emc

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.490 
bit of charge of it it will use the emc
stored<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.080> decline

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.340 
stored in decline
star<00:02:13.770> obviously<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.880> will<00:02:15.120> provide<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.810> lot

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
star obviously this will provide a lot

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.420 
star obviously this will provide a lot
more<00:02:16.970> again<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:22.050> pretty<00:02:22.650> much<00:02:22.710> she<00:02:23.010> doesn't

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
more again so pretty much she doesn't

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.670 
more again so pretty much she doesn't
and<00:02:24.150> again<00:02:24.900> all<00:02:25.170> these<00:02:25.380> are<00:02:25.820> numbers<00:02:27.380> here<00:02:28.380> are

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
and again all these are numbers here are

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.740 
and again all these are numbers here are
all<00:02:29.370> homing<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.090> pick<00:02:30.270> them<00:02:30.450> up<00:02:30.540> as

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
all homing you have to pick them up as

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
all homing you have to pick them up as
well<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:32.070> will<00:02:32.190> use<00:02:32.370> up<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.670> same<00:02:32.910> EMC<00:02:33.770> it

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
well so it will use up the same EMC it

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.140 
well so it will use up the same EMC it
would<00:02:34.980> be<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.280> make<00:02:35.430> these<00:02:35.610> areas<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
would be to make these areas in the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.810 
would be to make these areas in the
first<00:02:36.390> place<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.400> sort<00:02:38.400> of<00:02:38.459> like<00:02:38.610> our

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
first place so sort of like our

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.580 
first place so sort of like our
generation<00:02:39.510> obviously<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.870> use<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.380> for<00:02:40.530> that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
generation obviously you use it for that

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.960 
generation obviously you use it for that
