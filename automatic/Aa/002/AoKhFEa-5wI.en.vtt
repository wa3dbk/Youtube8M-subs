00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 what could be better than a beautiful one 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.020
 energetic breakfast to start 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.330
 on the right foot the certain day 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.190
 in short, yes, but with a bit of energy 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.450
 moderation because we who are attentive 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.269
 the lines we must always respect 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.369
 as written in the golden rules 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.740
 dictated by nutrition education 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.470
 well then today I propose a menu 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.660
 ideal for breakfast biscuits 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.109
 naturists prepared with whole wheat flour 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.369
 oat bran two ingredients 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.529
 very important not just because they go to 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.170
 increase the feeling of satiety 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.420
 so it immediately fills our stomach but 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.399
 they are also important because they balance 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.719
 a little what is regularity 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.760
 intestinal 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.370
 another important ingredient that we go 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.920
 to use in biscuits and honey 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.110
 that we will use the place of sugar 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.329
 of the classic sucrose because like 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.949
 know honey purchases conducted co 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.050
 has a binding power then the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.520
 slightly higher sweetener 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.109
 compared to sugar then what 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.910
 means that it will be sufficient 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.039
 use a smaller amount of 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.260
 honey compared to sugar for 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.060
 get the same sweetening effect 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.840
 and then in short honey also rich in 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.119
 vitamins and minerals what instead 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.640
 in short, sugar does not have 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.040
 another important ingredient to use 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.500
 corn oil oil in 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.049
 replacement of the butter because the oil has 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 clearly a nutritional profile 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.299
 best 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.570
 let's go immediately to find out what is there 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.680
 needed to prepare cookies 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.460
 Integrals with raisins are required 250 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:41.159
 g of wholemeal flour 60 g of bran 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:46.280
 oats 12 grams of brewer's yeast 30 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:51.479
 grams of honey 125 milliliters of water 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.729
 a pinch of salt 2 tablespoons of oil of 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.600
 seeds 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:00.990
 then an egg yolk 70 g raisins 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.710
 sultana and to sprinkle 30 grams 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.750
 of cane sugar 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.910
 the first thing to do to prepare the 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.819
 whole grain biscuits and soak 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.940
 the raisins in boiling water and the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.280
 we leave here for good all the time 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.510
 needed for the preparation of biscuits 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:26.430
 well I heated the water 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:32.970
 now we'll have to melt the honey here 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:35.430
 Here, however, we return to everything 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:41.209
 the honey of the chat all in and we mix 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.209
 with steel spoon 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.360
 then we will go on to dissolve 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.069
 even yeast , brewer's yeast 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.349
 even if the yeast is present 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.049
 these cookies should not be left 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.060
 leavening we will also go to do the 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.530
 deformed and then we're going to play 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.079
 therefore it is not necessary immediately 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.959
 wait just as I told you the times 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:08.030
 of leavening 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:12.180
 now the honey has completely melted 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.420
 add the pd and vi little by little 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.400
 you find yourself grizzled only this time 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.470
 we are not going to use the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.730
 steel spoon but the stick 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.350
 that as you well know the yeasts do not 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.870
 experiment well on contact with 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.450
 steel if we are going to mix 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.859
 with the normal spoon maybe from the 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.450
 limitation in the oven can come a 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.360
 little compromised therefore advice 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.370
 always using 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:44.620
 wooden ladle materials we shake 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:48.380
 for good ok now that it has melted 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.540
 we can combine all the ingredients 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:55.340
 then inside a boule then we put 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:04:02.000
 the bran flour wholemeal flour 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:05.360
 oat oil 2 tablespoons of oil of oil 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:10.220
 of corn seeds a bit of salt than not 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.340
 it may be missing then we add the yolk 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.340
 egg 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.140
 I take a ladle and 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.630
 however, we mix well in everything 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:26.510
 later we will add the 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.560
 our decline 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.560
 let's give another mixed up 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:50.510
 at this point we can drain the raisins 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.680
 we put boiling water so I am 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.950
 even a few minutes of 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.550
 soak we squeeze it with our hands in 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:04.070
 so as to remove all the water we pour 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:07.260
 inside and or we don't mix well 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:12.090
 if necessary we will add 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.430
 we have even more flour 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.290
 transferred the mixture to the pastry board 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.230
 as you can see it has become beautiful 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.630
 rather soft ball I added 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.190
 about 20 grams of doing nothing serious 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.140
 because I impart you too much 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.090
 fluid to work it by hand and now 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:34.310
 let's sport the work plan with a little 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:37.050
 of flour so we model a little 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:42.210
 the dough as we are going to spread it with 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:45.660
 the rolling pin also joined away of a 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:50.090
 round pastry cutter I chose a 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:52.290
 pastry cutter with a diameter of 5 centimeters 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.920
 but then you can use all the 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.840
 ants you want 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.910
 now we are going to spend the beautiful one 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.300
 browse also quite simple from 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:06.350
 roll out what this pasta 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.350
 about one centimeter thick 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:13.229
 as you can see we spread the dough 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:15.659
 rather same I meanwhile too 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.779
 prepared two lined baking plates 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:20.460
 with the wax paper where we will go to 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:22.740
 clearly to put biscuit now 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:27.930
 with the coppapasta we give to form gods 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:30.270
 so cookies and then every single one 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.430
 cookie we're going to put it back on 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:38.430
 oven plate until all are finished 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:41.189
 a dough with time in short cuts 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:46.349
 they can be reshuffled and formed new 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:48.839
 biscuits from the dough we got 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:52.969
 about 40 biscuits as you can see 

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:55.020
 I have already gone ahead with the hope 

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:57.330
 brush the surface of all the 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.159
 biscuits with some water now there 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.949
 I show some of what I have 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:03.449
 left to do because brush the 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.099
 surface with water because water 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.169
 acts as a glue 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:08.580
 so whatever we're going to put in 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:12.389
 above as in this case and sugar 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:14.009
 both cane and will stick perfectly yes 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:17.930
 they will glue why I say that 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:21.149
 the water in this case acts as a glue 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.819
 here we have also finished everything 

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:27.449
 kant sugar and now let's go to 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:33.899
 Bake one warm 180 degrees for about 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:35.729
 15 minutes menu ideal for a first 

00:07:33.899 --> 00:07:38.930
 breakfast from champions 

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:41.369
 well 45 cookies from tourists like these 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:44.129
 associated with a good cup of hot tea 

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:46.319
 or even a spies coffee and one 

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:49.169
 apple is the best gift we can 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:51.209
 do to our intestines and ours 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:53.509
 body to start the day with 

00:07:51.209 --> 00:07:53.509
 a smile
