 hello everyone with you doctor magician and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.500
 today's video tutorial I will tell you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.679
 How to increase FPS in games or increase 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.980
 computer speed 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:16.369
 so let's start go start panel 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.100
 system management and security 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.630
 system add on and system parameters 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.080
 and so how else can you log in 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.010
 push start 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.650
 computer property bares come such 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.210
 the same plate can also if you 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.989
 bring to the desktop click to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.160
 dishes properties here we have written 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.030
 performance 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.850
 click the button parameters here we have 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.950
 speed performance pops up altogether 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.350
 everyone should restore the value by 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.780
 default if someone did not set up 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.180
 imagine these effects 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.309
 so I wanted to tell you about these 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.920
 different effects 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.129
 even if you want a desktop 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.549
 have a beautiful but also want to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.979
 your game worked post I recommend 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.909
 you put me like he is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.040
 worth the value 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.990
 set default values 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.320
 click special effects remove all 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.210
 tick from and tick where i have 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.380
 that is, the inclusion of a composition 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.630
 desktop 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.439
 using display styles for windows 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.079
 and claps display thumbnails of places icons 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.610
 and smooth out bumps in font screens 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.130
 so apply it further the second way 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.490
 which also enhances your 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.280
 speed click additionally 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.140
 here probably all known file 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.460
 swap which we will be with you 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.470
 change click change here stands 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.100
 automatically select file size 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.030
 swap 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.320
 also 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.820
 gives your computer work 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.100
 optimally if you do not play for example in 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.920
 games just work on the computer 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.650
 can set automatic selection 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.950
 under choose the paging file size you 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.400
 everything will be fine both what value 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.819
 generally can not be set if you mean 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.050
 worth for example c 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:25.380
 put the initial size on c 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:28.790
 4096 maximum size 8192 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.200
 if you should be worth 100 bet on d 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.180
 I recommend that you put it only on 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.610
 one disk on the other just put 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.400
 missing recommend also you not 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.239
 put this paging file on 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.230
 drive on which there is no lead so the third 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.519
 the way probably the most famous way 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:56.819
 increase the speed of the computer is 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:58.769
 Waters combinations m with fan fiction I execute 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.530
 near you specifically down and you can 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.940
 if we can't stand on or around 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.989
 you do not have this command write out 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:14.790
 after the races she find me writing 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:17.800
 ps antique click about you pops up 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.170
 such a system configuration table 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.790
 click downloads additional 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.740
 parameters the number of processes you may be 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.840
 ticked off if you only 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.350
 reinstall remove windows recommend 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.480
 you immediately put the maximum 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.040
 the value of the processors it will increase your 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:43.270
 a piece of computer action is very strong 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.520
 where is the light computer itself if you 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.260
 reinstall windows for example come in 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.360
 here you have to max out 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.900
 values â€‹â€‹have taken your price 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.930
 maximum it means set 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.750
 the maximum value is so generally general 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.460
 according to the standard puts only three tu 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.390
 all subscribe to the channel put like 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:07.590
 and subscribe to an emphasis near docker and 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.590
 happy live park
