00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.080
 I'm the personal speaker of the month in this video I 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.390
 I'll say goodbye to you. 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.150
 This then talks how to make a house. 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.340
 the game before the material area is 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.020
 very extensive so if you have a 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.940
 difficulty is somewhat lost 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.380
 pause the video there and watch with larger 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.080
 details the items I'm using 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.970
 basically five steps in the 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.820
 first let's need date 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.649
 foundation of the house is not her floor and then 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.890
 We're going to need the four walls. 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:42.790
 obviously we need the frame of the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.230
 door to door and finally the ceiling then 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.780
 come on 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.790
 the first thing we need 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.130
 more collect wood and it is not because 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.540
 I did not warn you to get enough wood 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.579
 so if you have a friend for you 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.950
 help it gets easier it will group 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.470
 several blogs and also xix can pick up 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.640
 everything we both need the blog so much 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.640
 like wood 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.860
 after collecting the wood has to 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.600
 transform the lots you got here 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.060
 in the case and 17 you'll need 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.340
 turn tables into nec on show them 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.880
 they call sports can not be captured 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:30.360
 all two with board 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:33.220
 we're going to make 6/1 of players it's 23.56 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:39.090
 with 61 customers 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.090
 We're going to make three fronts. 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.979
 now 31 of fronts 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.250
 we got to do the foundation of the house 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.250
 only 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.610
 now with the foundation of the selected house 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.380
 it's time to decide where we go 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.510
 start making our home this will 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.310
 depending on your strategy the one 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.780
 conservative you are playing here at 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.760
 single player I will build near the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.650
 same farm but for example if the 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.110
 Sir see persecuted after doing his house 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.930
 more hidden you will not want any 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.210
 another player trying to invade it and has 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.100
 a secret to laying the foundation that 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.780
 you put buried in the ground you do not 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.350
 will be able to put the pillars of the house 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.860
 huh 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.410
 so always try to put it so that 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.450
 already by the demonstration that it seems 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:33.670
 You can put the pillars right here. 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.430
 and I can put the pillars of the house without 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.840
 problems to make the pillars go 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.020
 need two items 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.630
 one is the other support is the boards 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:46.450
 So, first let's turn it around. 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:51.100
 support or need some stixx here 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.330
 I already have some two sticks is 11 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.770
 Support 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.770
 so I'll make two 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.950
 you can see that he made two now 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.950
 I'll get a tram 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.720
 and put the dem bracket on top 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.950
 You can see a man appear in 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.950
 cornerstone 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:40.160
 I'm going to make four pillars, let's put it 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:41.330
 the pillars of the house with our pillars 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.730
 placed 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.019
 We are going to put the walls in the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.239
 so to make the wall we go 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:51.410
 need the four walls we go 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:58.970
 need 6 dem frames and 4 dem 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:04:03.920
 pi read here on the kraft in which he did 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.049
 already the wall here how to do 4 plus one 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.790
 to give four walls 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.230
 note that the fourth wall we will not 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.860
 to use otherwise we will not be able to 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.579
 enter the house when it comes to 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.470
 walls right 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.700
 It may be that I took this process 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.210
 will assume in place of kaka that was 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.650
 ready and this one I do not go for nothing 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.970
 now we are going to do 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.669
 the doorway to do when the door 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.919
 already need a wall and the world in 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.919
 support place here 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.800
 now we have a good place to put 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.660
 door 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.790
 now the door is missing on then the door to 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.880
 people will need a frame and 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.800
 boots the frames you've seen how 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.140
 make the pockets you can find in 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.530
 cities or you can capture them 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.630
 collecting stones is now that we 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.630
 we have the door 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.720
 the house already has the four walls have the 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.470
 door I have the foundation but because the 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.320
 ceiling is not a home without their roof to 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.410
 make the ceiling we'll need three 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.680
 the players and 3 the dem crossroad cross 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:33.470
 And learn how to craft here 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:36.800
 you will put dem support're here 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:48.680
 and so would make three 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:50.420
 dem cross with three cross but the dem 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.830
 31 lawsuits 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:57.170
 we'll have the platform here 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.730
 now can put the ceiling the ceiling was 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:05.540
 with the hard seed put it like that 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:07.040
 then the semira pull and put in the 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.090
 Hotel 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:15.680
 here we have our first house of 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.990
 antonia says there then people you can 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.730
 to see that I started by day now already 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.140
 night so you can be sure that it will 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.730
 take a little while to make the house 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.950
 but it's worth it because you will 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.280
 protect from enemies of the game even 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.960
 other players is if you have 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.300
 questions regarding materials 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.610
 used to make the house only come back 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.620
 a little on the video pause and see how I 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.780
 I handled the necessary items as well 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.550
