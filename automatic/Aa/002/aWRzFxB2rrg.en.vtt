was and i guess he assumed that I was

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.260 
was and i guess he assumed that I was
scarf<00:01:55.050> or<00:01:55.259> something<00:01:55.289> like<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:56.240> so<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
scarf or something like that so I

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.749 
scarf or something like that so I
predict<00:01:57.720> him<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.289> go<00:01:58.679> for<00:01:58.979> water<00:01:59.190> electric

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
predict him to go for water electric

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.630 
predict him to go for water electric
really<00:02:00.330> doesn't<00:02:00.660> matter<00:02:01.310> Celebi<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.459> take

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
really doesn't matter Celebi can take

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.430 
really doesn't matter Celebi can take
either<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.090> them<00:02:03.300> because<00:02:03.780> he's<00:02:03.929> bulky<00:02:04.319> I'm

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
either of them because he's bulky I'm

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.900 
either of them because he's bulky I'm
gonna<00:02:04.590> assume<00:02:04.860> he<00:02:05.039> doesn't<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.369> ice<00:02:05.610> beam<00:02:05.880> I

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
gonna assume he doesn't have ice beam I

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.150 
gonna assume he doesn't have ice beam I
could<00:02:06.270> be<00:02:06.420> wrong<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> Assumption

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
could be wrong but that's the Assumption

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.469 
could be wrong but that's the Assumption
I'm<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.550> with<00:02:08.640> right<00:02:08.849> now<00:02:09.000> come<00:02:09.330> for

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
I'm going with right now come for

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.120 
I'm going with right now come for
sidekick<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.110> because<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.380> did<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.590> figured

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
sidekick just because I did I figured

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.400 
sidekick just because I did I figured
he'd<00:02:11.250> go<00:02:11.340> into<00:02:11.520> closed<00:02:11.760> score<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:13.020> he<00:02:13.230> goes

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
he'd go into closed score but he goes

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.980 
he'd go into closed score but he goes
into<00:02:13.530> his<00:02:13.590> jirachi<00:02:14.180> now<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.209> know<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.660> u-turn

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
into his jirachi now I know the u-turn

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.660 
into his jirachi now I know the u-turn
is<00:02:16.170> coming<00:02:16.470> because<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.770> don't<00:02:16.950> see<00:02:17.069> leftovers

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
is coming because I don't see leftovers

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.820 
is coming because I don't see leftovers
and<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.000> know<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.540> it'll<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:19.020> about<00:02:19.200> half<00:02:19.560> if

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and I know that it'll do about half if

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.010 
and I know that it'll do about half if
he<00:02:19.980> scarfed<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.209> I'm<00:02:21.300> just<00:02:21.480> gonna<00:02:21.599> hit<00:02:21.810> up<00:02:21.930> or

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
he scarfed so I'm just gonna hit up or

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.960 
he scarfed so I'm just gonna hit up or
recover<00:02:22.410> while<00:02:22.620> he<00:02:22.680> goes<00:02:22.920> into<00:02:23.130> Gliscor<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.880> I

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
recover while he goes into Gliscor and I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.730 
recover while he goes into Gliscor and I
assume<00:02:24.300> here<00:02:24.690> he<00:02:24.810> did<00:02:24.959> predict<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.470> thunder

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
assume here he did predict the thunder

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.240 
assume here he did predict the thunder
wave<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.750> works<00:02:27.930> out<00:02:28.080> perfectly<00:02:28.380> for<00:02:29.040> me

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
wave so that works out perfectly for me

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.800 
wave so that works out perfectly for me
because<00:02:29.730> all<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.329> happened<00:02:30.659> was<00:02:30.720> he

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
because all that happened was he

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.530 
because all that happened was he
switched<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.379> glow<00:02:31.530> score<00:02:32.299> he's<00:02:33.299> going<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
switched in a glow score he's going to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.820 
switched in a glow score he's going to
talk<00:02:33.689> me<00:02:33.959> um

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
talk me um

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.730 
talk me um
don't<00:02:35.370> really<00:02:35.550> have<00:02:35.640> much<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.030> do<00:02:36.180> to<00:02:36.330> him<00:02:36.740> but

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
don't really have much to do to him but

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.850 
don't really have much to do to him but
I<00:02:37.770> guess<00:02:37.860> he<00:02:38.010> wanted<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.700> do<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.660> so<00:02:40.170> now<00:02:40.830> I

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
I guess he wanted to do that so now I

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.890 
I guess he wanted to do that so now I
can't<00:02:41.160> recover<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.000> guess<00:02:42.180> that's<00:02:42.330> nice<00:02:42.600> for

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
can't recover so I guess that's nice for

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.700 
can't recover so I guess that's nice for
him<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.520> leftovers<00:02:45.360> sandstorm<00:02:46.320> I'm<00:02:46.410> switching

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
him so leftovers sandstorm I'm switching

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.510 
him so leftovers sandstorm I'm switching
to<00:02:46.890> angel<00:02:47.550> um<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.680> guess<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.800> predicted<00:02:50.220> him<00:02:50.430> to

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
to angel um I guess I predicted him to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.390 
to angel um I guess I predicted him to
go<00:02:50.610> into<00:02:50.790> heat<00:02:51.000> train<00:02:51.210> right<00:02:51.420> there<00:02:51.630> and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
go into heat train right there and

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.190 
go into heat train right there and
earthquakes<00:02:53.400> not<00:02:53.760> gonna<00:02:53.940> be<00:02:54.030> too<00:02:54.240> AKO<00:02:54.600> now

move<00:03:58.530> from<00:03:59.100> star<00:03:59.489> me<00:03:59.640> and<00:03:59.850> it's<00:04:00.780> looking<00:04:01.050> like

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
move from star me and it's looking like

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.720 
move from star me and it's looking like
he<00:04:01.290> doesn't<00:04:01.620> have<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.769> ice<00:04:02.010> move<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:02.580> that's

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
he doesn't have the ice move so that's

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.620 
he doesn't have the ice move so that's
great<00:04:03.390> for<00:04:03.690> me<00:04:04.370> right<00:04:05.370> here<00:04:05.760> i<00:04:05.820> believe<00:04:06.360> i<00:04:06.600> just

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
great for me right here i believe i just

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.720 
great for me right here i believe i just
finally<00:04:07.110> say<00:04:07.860> go<00:04:08.070> for<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.310> least<00:04:08.519> arm

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
finally say go for the least arm

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.110 
finally say go for the least arm
and<00:04:08.940> i<00:04:09.060> miss<00:04:09.570> now<00:04:10.470> this<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.310> a<00:04:11.340> really<00:04:11.730> bulky

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
and i miss now this is a really bulky

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.479 
and i miss now this is a really bulky
tyranitar<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:13.530> it<00:04:13.739> would<00:04:13.980> have<00:04:14.100> done<00:04:14.220> that

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
tyranitar so it would have done that

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.330 
tyranitar so it would have done that
much<00:04:14.790> but<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.239> do<00:04:15.330> get<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:15.660> thunder<00:04:15.930> wave<00:04:16.049> off

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
much but I do get the thunder wave off

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.530 
much but I do get the thunder wave off
at<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.459> point<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:17.790> didn't<00:04:18.060> know<00:04:18.180> what<00:04:18.330> kind<00:04:18.419> of

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
at this point I didn't know what kind of

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.750 
at this point I didn't know what kind of
Atari<00:04:18.840> anatar<00:04:19.140> was<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:20.160> after<00:04:20.459> seeing<00:04:20.609> the

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
Atari anatar was but after seeing the

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.340 
Atari anatar was but after seeing the
payback<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.690> fact<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:21.989> he's<00:04:22.169> going<00:04:22.290> to

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
payback and the fact that he's going to

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.980 
payback and the fact that he's going to
leave<00:04:22.590> him<00:04:22.710> in<00:04:22.890> i<00:04:23.130> assume<00:04:24.090> he's<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.510> really

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
leave him in i assume he's the really

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.590 
leave him in i assume he's the really
specialty<00:04:25.680> bulky<00:04:26.070> with<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.280> sandstorm<00:04:26.850> up<00:04:27.000> so

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
specialty bulky with the sandstorm up so

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.750 
specialty bulky with the sandstorm up so
leaf<00:04:27.840> storm<00:04:28.169> i<00:04:28.440> do<00:04:28.650> predict<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.160> switching<00:04:29.520> to

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
leaf storm i do predict a switching to

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.630 
leaf storm i do predict a switching to
jirachi<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.750> take<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.050> leaf<00:04:31.229> storm<00:04:31.530> but<00:04:32.310> he

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
jirachi to take the leaf storm but he

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.750 
jirachi to take the leaf storm but he
keeps<00:04:32.880> in<00:04:33.240> tarrant<00:04:33.630> are<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.400> over<00:04:35.400> prediction

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
keeps in tarrant are so over prediction

four minutes Stone Edge I predict him to

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.529 
four minutes Stone Edge I predict him to
try<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.310> get<00:04:47.430> some<00:04:47.610> kind<00:04:47.760> of<00:04:47.850> advantage<00:04:48.210> on<00:04:48.510> me
