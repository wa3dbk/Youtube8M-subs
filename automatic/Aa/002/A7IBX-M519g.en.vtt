better<00:00:23.580> luck<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.720> really<00:00:25.110> defeat<00:00:25.350> anything

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
better luck can really defeat anything

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.940 
better luck can really defeat anything
so<00:00:26.130> we<00:00:26.789> are<00:00:26.940> hopeful<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.530> very

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:28.950 
so we are hopeful and we are very

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.999 
so we are hopeful and we are very
positive<00:00:29.280> and<00:00:30.180> I<00:00:30.660> think<00:00:30.930> we<00:00:31.110> got<00:00:31.680> a<00:00:31.710> boring

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
positive and I think we got a boring

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.580 
positive and I think we got a boring
lineup<00:00:32.790> which<00:00:32.970> can<00:00:33.180> really<00:00:33.390> go<00:00:34.140> through<00:00:34.350> any

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
lineup which can really go through any

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.630 
lineup which can really go through any
team<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.670> feel<00:00:36.510> bad<00:00:36.750> as<00:00:36.930> just<00:00:37.340> getting<00:00:38.340> back

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
team and I feel bad as just getting back

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.920 
team and I feel bad as just getting back
into<00:00:38.700> form<00:00:39.470> this<00:00:40.470> is<00:00:40.680> only<00:00:40.860> matter<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.930> just

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
into form this is only matter of just

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.250 
into form this is only matter of just
putting<00:00:43.560> a<00:00:43.710> good<00:00:43.890> show<00:00:44.130> on<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> day<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.809> think

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
putting a good show on a day so I think

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.470 
putting a good show on a day so I think
we're<00:00:46.559> looking<00:00:46.860> forward<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.760> think

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
we're looking forward for that I think

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.799 
we're looking forward for that I think

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
best cricket if we want to beat Pakistan

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.300 
best cricket if we want to beat Pakistan
it's<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.540> simple<00:02:27.660> as<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.440> think<00:02:28.680> yeah

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
it's as simple as that and I think yeah

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.950 
it's as simple as that and I think yeah
I<00:02:29.340> don't<00:02:29.760> think<00:02:30.030> you're<00:02:30.120> ever<00:02:30.300> owned<00:02:30.600> anything

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
I don't think you're ever owned anything

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.060 
I don't think you're ever owned anything
in<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:31.920> game<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.310> cricket<00:02:33.710> so<00:02:34.710> we<00:02:34.830> have<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
in this game of cricket so we have to

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.870 
in this game of cricket so we have to
make<00:02:35.190> sure<00:02:35.340> we're<00:02:35.430> ready<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.670> go<00:02:35.760> tomorrow

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
make sure we're ready to go tomorrow

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.330 
make sure we're ready to go tomorrow
which<00:02:36.390> we<00:02:36.720> will<00:02:36.870> be<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.140> think<00:02:37.530> Pakistan<00:02:38.220> have

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
which we will be I think Pakistan have

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.220 
which we will be I think Pakistan have
been<00:02:38.370> underrated<00:02:38.760> for<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.240> for<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> long<00:02:39.959> time

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
been underrated for a for a long time

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.870 
been underrated for a for a long time
especially<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.100> shorter<00:02:41.459> form<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.820> the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
especially in the shorter form of the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.720 
especially in the shorter form of the
game<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.870> think<00:02:43.620> they've<00:02:43.890> got<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.070> lot<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.310> talent

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
game I think they've got a lot of talent

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.250 
game I think they've got a lot of talent
I<00:02:44.820> think<00:02:44.850> their<00:02:45.120> attacks<00:02:45.480> very<00:02:45.690> good<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.170> have

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
I think their attacks very good and have

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.199 
I think their attacks very good and have
showed<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.650> throughout<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.100> series<00:02:47.370> I

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
showed that throughout this series I

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.030 
showed that throughout this series I
think<00:02:48.810> they've<00:02:49.020> got<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.170> good<00:02:49.230> mix<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:49.860> youth

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
think they've got a good mix of youth

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.290 
think they've got a good mix of youth
and<00:02:50.190> experience<00:02:50.250> with<00:02:50.730> their<00:02:50.850> batting<00:02:51.180> as

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
and experience with their batting as

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.580 
and experience with their batting as
well<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.600> they're<00:02:51.720> led<00:02:51.930> really<00:02:52.290> well<00:02:52.470> from

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
well and they're led really well from

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.830 
well and they're led really well from
miss<00:02:52.830> balls<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.730> think<00:02:54.239> tomorrow's<00:02:54.720> gonna

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
miss balls so I think tomorrow's gonna

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.390 
miss balls so I think tomorrow's gonna
be<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.020> really<00:02:55.290> tough<00:02:55.440> challenge<00:02:55.709> for<00:02:56.100> us<00:02:56.130> and

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
be a really tough challenge for us and

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.340 
be a really tough challenge for us and
