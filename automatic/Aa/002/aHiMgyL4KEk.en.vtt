00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
little bit too late for that but in any

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you can full pull the trigger now this

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.740 
you can full pull the trigger now this
is<00:01:40.229> both<00:01:40.470> good<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:40.890> bad<00:01:41.100> it's<00:01:41.729> bad<00:01:41.909> because<00:01:42.540> of

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
is both good and bad it's bad because of

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
is both good and bad it's bad because of
course<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.770> was<00:01:43.920> allowed<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.340> shoot<00:01:44.520> it

course if I was allowed to shoot it
faster<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.360> would<00:01:45.960> get<00:01:46.140> kills<00:01:46.439> quicker<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:46.979> as

unfortunately one of the downsides of
having<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.840> feature<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.590> anyone<00:01:59.040> with

having that feature is that anyone with

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.039 
having that feature is that anyone with
a<00:01:59.189> modded<00:01:59.729> controller<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.960> able

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
a modded controller is going to be able

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.620 
a modded controller is going to be able
to<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> colossal<00:02:02.189> advantage<00:02:02.909> over<00:02:03.119> those

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
to have a colossal advantage over those

to have a colossal advantage over those
who<00:02:03.869> are<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.110> trying<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.649> it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
who are just trying to do it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.459 
who are just trying to do it
legitimately<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.329> aspect<00:02:06.469> raining

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
legitimately so in that aspect raining

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.199 
legitimately so in that aspect raining
down<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.039> rate<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.220> fire<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.759> actually

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
down the rate of fire and actually

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.699 
down the rate of fire and actually
making<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.869> having<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.440> modded

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
making it so that having a modded

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.199 
making it so that having a modded
controller<00:02:11.009> or<00:02:11.220> having<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.670> know<00:02:11.790> just<00:02:12.030> your

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
controller or having you know just your

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.090 
controller or having you know just your
finger<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.690> gonna<00:02:12.780> make

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
finger is gonna make

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.640 
finger is gonna make
basically<00:02:13.550> no<00:02:13.730> difference<00:02:14.270> is<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:15.020> pretty<00:02:15.380> good

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
basically no difference is a pretty good

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.720 
basically no difference is a pretty good
idea<00:02:15.830> now<00:02:16.820> to<00:02:16.880> make<00:02:17.240> up<00:02:17.420> for<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.990> they<00:02:18.230> have

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
idea now to make up for this they have

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.550 
idea now to make up for this they have
substantially<00:02:19.730> increase<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.540> damage<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
substantially increase the damage the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.860 
substantially increase the damage the
description<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.580> this<00:02:22.760> weapon<00:02:23.000> reads<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.660> it

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
description of this weapon reads that it

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
description of this weapon reads that it
is<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.050> two<00:02:24.500> shot<00:02:25.100> kill<00:02:25.580> on<00:02:25.820> infantry<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.530> can

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
is a two shot kill on infantry and I can

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.120 
is a two shot kill on infantry and I can
confirm<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.490> in<00:02:28.790> only<00:02:29.060> two<00:02:29.600> shots<00:02:30.110> you<00:02:30.740> will

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
confirm that in only two shots you will

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.780 
confirm that in only two shots you will
kill<00:02:31.730> enemy<00:02:32.410> most<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.860> time<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.520> say

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
kill enemy most of the time and I say

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.090 
kill enemy most of the time and I say
most<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.300> time<00:02:35.480> because<00:02:35.680> frankly<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.710> get

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
most of the time because frankly I get

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.340 
most of the time because frankly I get
to<00:02:37.400> hit<00:02:37.670> markers<00:02:38.120> more<00:02:38.870> than<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.170> would<00:02:39.320> like

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
to hit markers more than I would like

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.100 
to hit markers more than I would like
now<00:02:40.280> again<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:40.820> gun<00:02:41.030> is<00:02:41.060> very<00:02:41.450> capable<00:02:41.900> of

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
now again this gun is very capable of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.860 
now again this gun is very capable of
getting<00:02:42.620> kills<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.250> two<00:02:43.820> hits<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:44.300> have<00:02:44.540> gotten

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
getting kills in two hits I have gotten

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.520 
getting kills in two hits I have gotten
many<00:02:45.620> two<00:02:46.340> shot<00:02:46.730> kills<00:02:47.090> I've<00:02:47.720> also<00:02:48.080> gotten

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
many two shot kills I've also gotten

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.010 
many two shot kills I've also gotten
many<00:02:48.950> three<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.760> four<00:02:50.210> shot<00:02:50.510> kills<00:02:50.810> and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
many three and four shot kills and

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.020 
many three and four shot kills and
that's<00:02:51.260> where<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.590> gun<00:02:51.860> really<00:02:52.190> falls<00:02:52.580> back

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
that's where this gun really falls back

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.380 
that's where this gun really falls back
I'm<00:02:53.750> positive<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.770> shivas<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.640> hit<00:02:56.000> kill

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
I'm positive the shivas to hit kill

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.410 
I'm positive the shivas to hit kill
range<00:02:56.780> is<00:02:57.140> not<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:58.010> entire<00:02:58.400> map<00:02:58.670> because<00:02:59.030> the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
range is not the entire map because the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.110 
range is not the entire map because the
further<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.110> enemy<00:03:00.440> is<00:03:00.590> away<00:03:01.100> from<00:03:01.370> me<00:03:01.490> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
further the enemy is away from me the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.120 
further the enemy is away from me the
more<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.420> feel<00:03:02.810> like<00:03:02.990> I'm<00:03:03.170> getting<00:03:03.380> those<00:03:03.680> two

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
more I feel like I'm getting those two

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.180 
more I feel like I'm getting those two
plus<00:03:04.550> hit<00:03:04.850> markers<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.530> another<00:03:06.530> factor<00:03:07.010> is

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
plus hit markers and another factor is

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.830 
plus hit markers and another factor is
that<00:03:07.250> if<00:03:07.670> you<00:03:07.790> shoot<00:03:08.030> through<00:03:08.300> any<00:03:08.540> type<00:03:08.810> of

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
that if you shoot through any type of

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.510 
that if you shoot through any type of
cover<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.590> I'm<00:03:09.710> pretty<00:03:09.920> sure<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.190> bullets

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
cover like I'm pretty sure that bullets

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.660 
cover like I'm pretty sure that bullets
only<00:03:10.670> do<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.450> know<00:03:11.570> 50<00:03:12.170> exact<00:03:12.800> damage<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.520> it's

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
only do you know 50 exact damage so it's

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.130 
only do you know 50 exact damage so it's
a<00:03:13.760> two<00:03:13.940> shot<00:03:14.180> kill<00:03:14.450> on<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.600> hundred<00:03:14.870> health

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
a two shot kill on a hundred health

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.800 
a two shot kill on a hundred health
enemy<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.040> if<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.490> goes<00:03:16.730> through<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:17.510> you

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
enemy so if it goes through this you

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.050 
enemy so if it goes through this you
know<00:03:17.960> a<00:03:17.990> piece<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.290> paper<00:03:18.620> or<00:03:19.400> something<00:03:19.790> on

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
know a piece of paper or something on

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.210 
know a piece of paper or something on
call<00:03:20.300> of<00:03:20.390> duty<00:03:20.600> on<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.780> map<00:03:21.050> and<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.740> damage<00:03:21.980> is

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
call of duty on a map and the damage is

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.800 
call of duty on a map and the damage is
lowered<00:03:22.640> slightly<00:03:23.060> you're<00:03:23.300> gonna<00:03:23.420> have<00:03:23.660> to

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
lowered slightly you're gonna have to

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.140 
lowered slightly you're gonna have to
shoot<00:03:24.050> again<00:03:24.260> now<00:03:25.040> shooting<00:03:25.520> three<00:03:25.880> shots

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
shoot again now shooting three shots

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.390 
shoot again now shooting three shots
certainly<00:03:26.750> isn't<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.290> end<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.740> world<00:03:28.100> is

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
certainly isn't the end of the world is

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.290 
certainly isn't the end of the world is
still<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.000> very<00:03:29.300> very<00:03:29.660> powerful<00:03:30.080> powerful<00:03:30.680> gun

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
still a very very powerful powerful gun

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.760 
still a very very powerful powerful gun
however<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.750> problem<00:03:33.170> is<00:03:33.380> with<00:03:33.710> that

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
however the problem is with that

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.550 
however the problem is with that
extremely<00:03:34.520> low<00:03:34.730> rate<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.150> fire<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.320> fact

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
extremely low rate of fire and the fact

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.370 
extremely low rate of fire and the fact
that<00:03:36.680> there<00:03:36.920> is<00:03:36.950> no<00:03:37.430> flinch<00:03:37.970> reducing<00:03:38.690> perk<00:03:39.050> in

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
that there is no flinch reducing perk in

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.410 
that there is no flinch reducing perk in
black<00:03:39.800> ops<00:03:40.040> 3<00:03:40.190> which<00:03:40.520> overall<00:03:41.000> I<00:03:41.060> think<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.390> a

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
black ops 3 which overall I think is a

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.780 
black ops 3 which overall I think is a
good<00:03:41.690> thing<00:03:41.900> but<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.560> results<00:03:43.070> in<00:03:43.190> this<00:03:43.490> gun

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
good thing but it results in this gun

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.700 
good thing but it results in this gun
being<00:03:44.060> a<00:03:44.180> little<00:03:44.390> bit<00:03:44.570> less<00:03:44.780> effective

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:45.710 
being a little bit less effective

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.680 
being a little bit less effective
because<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:46.700> know<00:03:46.820> if<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.150> are<00:03:47.450> shooting

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
because you know if you are shooting

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.810 
because you know if you are shooting
with<00:03:47.960> a<00:03:47.990> fully<00:03:48.410> automatic<00:03:48.890> assault<00:03:49.430> rifle

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
with a fully automatic assault rifle

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.880 
with a fully automatic assault rifle
like<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.090> man<00:03:50.300> o'war<00:03:50.660> like<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.230> hv<00:03:51.530> k<00:03:51.740> and

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
like the man o'war like the hv k and

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.470 
like the man o'war like the hv k and
you're<00:03:52.010> shooting<00:03:52.370> an<00:03:52.460> enemy<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:52.940> then<00:03:53.300> you

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
you're shooting an enemy and then you

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.060 
you're shooting an enemy and then you
get<00:03:53.600> hit<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> couple<00:03:54.050> times<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:54.650> flinch

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
get hit a couple times and you flinch

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.580 
get hit a couple times and you flinch
upwards<00:03:55.850> maybe<00:03:56.180> above<00:03:56.450> his<00:03:56.630> head<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.410> can

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
upwards maybe above his head you can

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.440 
upwards maybe above his head you can
just<00:03:57.770> drag<00:03:58.220> your<00:03:58.250> skull<00:03:58.700> back<00:03:58.910> on<00:03:59.150> target

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
just drag your skull back on target

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.390 
just drag your skull back on target
without<00:03:59.720> ever<00:04:00.140> releasing<00:04:00.770> the<00:04:00.860> trigger<00:04:01.130> and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
without ever releasing the trigger and

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.460 
without ever releasing the trigger and
just<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.120> know<00:04:02.150> drag<00:04:02.600> your<00:04:02.750> shots<00:04:02.960> back<00:04:03.260> on

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
just you know drag your shots back on

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.620 
just you know drag your shots back on
target<00:04:03.710> and<00:04:03.920> finish<00:04:04.310> off<00:04:04.460> that<00:04:04.520> enemy<00:04:05.060> with

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
target and finish off that enemy with

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.420 
target and finish off that enemy with
the<00:04:05.750> Shiva<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.440> really<00:04:06.740> isn't<00:04:06.980> an<00:04:07.280> option

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
the Shiva that really isn't an option

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.060 
the Shiva that really isn't an option
because<00:04:07.730> your<00:04:08.030> rate<00:04:08.210> of<00:04:08.240> fire<00:04:08.510> is<00:04:08.540> so<00:04:09.050> slow<00:04:09.680> if

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
because your rate of fire is so slow if

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.000 
because your rate of fire is so slow if
you<00:04:10.730> miss<00:04:11.120> a<00:04:11.150> shot<00:04:11.570> you<00:04:11.870> are<00:04:12.380> screwed<00:04:12.830> if

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
you miss a shot you are screwed if

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.890 
you miss a shot you are screwed if
you're<00:04:13.190> in<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.370> head-to-head<00:04:13.820> fight<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:14.510> a<00:04:14.540> lot

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
you're in a head-to-head fight so a lot

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.020 
you're in a head-to-head fight so a lot
of<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.080> time<00:04:15.290> I<00:04:15.320> felt<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:15.740> it<00:04:16.220> was<00:04:16.609> difficult

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
of the time I felt that it was difficult

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.270 
of the time I felt that it was difficult
to<00:04:17.480> get<00:04:18.049> in<00:04:18.170> a<00:04:18.260> fight<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.680> head-to-head<00:04:19.250> fight

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
to get in a fight a head-to-head fight

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.250 
to get in a fight a head-to-head fight
with<00:04:19.760> enemy<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:20.210> I<00:04:20.270> shot<00:04:20.540> him<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:20.870> he<00:04:20.930> shot<00:04:21.140> me

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
with enemy and I shot him and he shot me

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.320 
with enemy and I shot him and he shot me
at<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.380> same<00:04:21.530> time<00:04:21.770> if<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:22.430> flinched<00:04:22.820> out<00:04:23.120> of

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
at the same time if I flinched out of

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.879 
at the same time if I flinched out of
his<00:04:23.479> like<00:04:23.750> way<00:04:23.990> and<00:04:24.290> I<00:04:24.380> shot<00:04:24.680> behind<00:04:24.890> them<00:04:25.280> or

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
his like way and I shot behind them or

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.619 
his like way and I shot behind them or
side<00:04:26.009> him<00:04:26.189> or<00:04:26.310> something<00:04:26.639> I<00:04:26.789> was<00:04:27.150> screwed<00:04:27.479> I

00:04:27.619 --> 00:04:27.629 
side him or something I was screwed I

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:29.390 
side him or something I was screwed I
was<00:04:27.840> completely<00:04:28.050> screwed<00:04:28.620> whereas<00:04:29.159> if<00:04:29.249> you

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
was completely screwed whereas if you

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.700 
was completely screwed whereas if you
using<00:04:29.759> a<00:04:29.849> more<00:04:30.090> traditional<00:04:30.300> fully<00:04:31.020> automatic

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
using a more traditional fully automatic

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.129 
using a more traditional fully automatic
gun<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:32.310> can<00:04:32.490> get<00:04:32.639> back<00:04:32.819> on<00:04:32.879> target<00:04:33.300> extremely

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
gun you can get back on target extremely

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.890 
gun you can get back on target extremely
quickly<00:04:34.590> now<00:04:35.580> with<00:04:35.819> that<00:04:36.029> downside<00:04:36.599> there<00:04:36.749> is

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
quickly now with that downside there is

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.719 
quickly now with that downside there is
also<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.439> upside<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:37.800> this<00:04:37.889> just<00:04:38.279> being<00:04:38.580> an

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
also the upside of this just being an

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.989 
also the upside of this just being an
unbelievably<00:04:39.599> accurate<00:04:39.870> weapon<00:04:40.830> like<00:04:41.340> with<00:04:41.909> a

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:41.999 
unbelievably accurate weapon like with a

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:43.610 
unbelievably accurate weapon like with a
rate<00:04:42.180> of<00:04:42.360> fire<00:04:42.539> the<00:04:42.749> slow<00:04:43.169> rate<00:04:43.469> of<00:04:43.499> fire

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
rate of fire the slow rate of fire

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.950 
rate of fire the slow rate of fire
coupled<00:04:44.340> with<00:04:44.430> just<00:04:44.789> generally<00:04:45.389> low<00:04:45.629> recoil

coupled with just generally low recoil

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.649 
coupled with just generally low recoil
means<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:47.009> you<00:04:47.219> can<00:04:47.430> absolutely<00:04:47.659> snipe

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
means that you can absolutely snipe

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.420 
means that you can absolutely snipe
enemies<00:04:49.080> from<00:04:49.169> across<00:04:49.499> the<00:04:49.560> map<00:04:49.889> you<00:04:50.279> will

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
enemies from across the map you will

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.300 
enemies from across the map you will
have<00:04:50.610> no<00:04:50.969> problem<00:04:51.199> firing<00:04:52.199> it<00:04:52.319> as<00:04:52.499> fast<00:04:52.949> as<00:04:53.189> it

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930

the<00:05:05.189> rapid<00:05:05.370> fire<00:05:05.580> I<00:05:05.610> think<00:05:05.669> it's<00:05:05.909> one<00:05:06.060> of<00:05:06.090> the

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
the rapid fire I think it's one of the

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.959 
the rapid fire I think it's one of the
last<00:05:06.419> perks<00:05:06.779> unlocked<00:05:07.259> but<00:05:07.919> I<00:05:07.949> imagine<00:05:08.520> since

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
last perks unlocked but I imagine since

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:10.490 
last perks unlocked but I imagine since
the<00:05:09.240> rapid<00:05:09.509> fire<00:05:09.659> doesn't<00:05:09.960> even<00:05:10.080> say<00:05:10.289> it

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
the rapid fire doesn't even say it

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.429 
the rapid fire doesn't even say it
lowers<00:05:11.039> damage<00:05:11.550> it<00:05:11.789> just<00:05:12.539> increases<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:13.169> rate

00:05:13.429 --> 00:05:13.439 
lowers damage it just increases a rate

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.309 
lowers damage it just increases a rate
of<00:05:13.469> fire<00:05:13.800> and<00:05:14.240> increases<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.389> recoil<00:05:15.990> to<00:05:16.139> do

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
of fire and increases the recoil to do

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.519 
of fire and increases the recoil to do
with<00:05:16.500> this<00:05:16.620> gun<00:05:16.949> but<00:05:17.610> because<00:05:18.060> it's

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:18.529 
with this gun but because it's

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:20.450 
with this gun but because it's
semi-automatic<00:05:19.529> and<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:19.740> can<00:05:19.919> control<00:05:20.279> the

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
semi-automatic and you can control the

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.390 
semi-automatic and you can control the
recoil<00:05:20.639> very<00:05:21.150> easily<00:05:21.509> I<00:05:21.930> imagine<00:05:22.680> rapid<00:05:23.159> fire

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
recoil very easily I imagine rapid fire

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.640 
recoil very easily I imagine rapid fire
with<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.729> Shiva<00:05:24.150> is<00:05:24.300> actually<00:05:25.110> gonna<00:05:25.469> be

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
with the Shiva is actually gonna be

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.379 
with the Shiva is actually gonna be
pretty<00:05:25.889> insane<00:05:26.339> so<00:05:26.610> I'll<00:05:26.909> keep<00:05:27.180> you<00:05:27.270> guys

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
pretty insane so I'll keep you guys

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:28.909 
pretty insane so I'll keep you guys

posted if i unlock it i'm gonna do a

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.469 
posted if i unlock it i'm gonna do a
video<00:05:29.159> on<00:05:29.339> that<00:05:29.370> but<00:05:30.000> it's<00:05:30.150> definitely

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
video on that but it's definitely

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.469 
video on that but it's definitely
something<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.379> keep<00:05:31.560> your<00:05:31.860> eye<00:05:31.889> on<00:05:32.300> so<00:05:33.300> in

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
something to keep your eye on so in

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.450 
something to keep your eye on so in
summary<00:05:33.509> i<00:05:33.930> would<00:05:34.139> describe<00:05:34.289> the<00:05:34.740> Shiva<00:05:35.009> as<00:05:35.250> an

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
summary i would describe the Shiva as an

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.390 
summary i would describe the Shiva as an
overall<00:05:36.060> good<00:05:36.509> gun<00:05:36.930> I<00:05:37.169> think<00:05:37.500> that<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:38.189> ease

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
overall good gun I think that the ease

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.839 
overall good gun I think that the ease
of<00:05:38.430> use<00:05:38.939> is<00:05:39.180> not<00:05:39.680> amazingly<00:05:40.680> friendly<00:05:41.099> towards

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
of use is not amazingly friendly towards

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.029 
of use is not amazingly friendly towards
newer<00:05:42.180> players<00:05:42.629> if<00:05:42.930> you<00:05:43.139> don't<00:05:43.589> really<00:05:43.830> play<00:05:44.009> a

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
newer players if you don't really play a

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.679 
newer players if you don't really play a
lot<00:05:44.219> of<00:05:44.339> call<00:05:44.520> of<00:05:44.550> duty<00:05:44.849> and<00:05:45.000> you're<00:05:45.330> not<00:05:45.479> very

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:45.689 
lot of call of duty and you're not very

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:47.600 
lot of call of duty and you're not very
good<00:05:45.779> at<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.110> game<00:05:46.139> maybe<00:05:46.620> you<00:05:46.889> kind<00:05:47.129> of<00:05:47.279> going

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:47.610 
good at the game maybe you kind of going

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.429 
good at the game maybe you kind of going
positive<00:05:47.879> as<00:05:48.300> an<00:05:48.449> amazing<00:05:49.020> thing<00:05:49.229> for<00:05:49.259> you

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.800 
positive as an amazing thing for you
definitely<00:05:50.310> don't<00:05:50.580> unlock<00:05:51.089> this<00:05:51.300> gun<00:05:51.569> because

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
definitely don't unlock this gun because

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.600 
definitely don't unlock this gun because
it<00:05:51.960> takes<00:05:52.110> a<00:05:52.259> lot<00:05:52.439> of<00:05:52.469> skill<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:53.009> use<00:05:53.039> and

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
it takes a lot of skill to use and

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.429 
it takes a lot of skill to use and
you're<00:05:53.759> gonna<00:05:53.849> have<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.060> hard<00:05:54.300> time<00:05:54.599> versing

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:55.439 
you're gonna have a hard time versing

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.889 
you're gonna have a hard time versing
enemies<00:05:55.770> at<00:05:55.949> one-on-one<00:05:56.610> gunfights<00:05:57.210> however

back of the map and really kind of

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.990 
back of the map and really kind of
picking<00:06:01.349> your<00:06:01.439> engagements<00:06:02.099> this<00:06:02.460> gun<00:06:02.729> is

picking your engagements this gun is

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.820 
picking your engagements this gun is
insanely<00:06:03.449> powerful<00:06:03.779> the<00:06:04.139> power<00:06:04.349> level<00:06:04.680> is

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
insanely powerful the power level is

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.040 
insanely powerful the power level is
there<00:06:05.129> but<00:06:05.610> the<00:06:05.639> ease<00:06:05.939> of<00:06:06.060> you<00:06:06.330> simply<00:06:06.689> isn't

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 
there but the ease of you simply isn't

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.809 
there but the ease of you simply isn't
