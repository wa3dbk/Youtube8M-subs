00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.160 

certainly<00:01:23.610> an<00:01:23.700> awful<00:01:24.210> lot<00:01:24.329> of<00:01:24.360> training<00:01:24.960> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
certainly an awful lot of training and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.319 
certainly an awful lot of training and
effort<00:01:25.710> goes<00:01:25.740> into<00:01:25.920> producing<00:01:26.579> these<00:01:26.969> horses

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
effort goes into producing these horses

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.510 
effort goes into producing these horses
to<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.930> elite<00:01:28.259> level<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.250> about

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
to this elite level it's all about

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.510 
to this elite level it's all about
putting<00:01:29.909> all<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.180> information<00:01:30.360> into

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
putting all that information into

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.980 
putting all that information into
moments<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.700> seconds<00:01:33.329> when<00:01:33.539> you're<00:01:33.719> on<00:01:33.840> the

world now I think you know the course is

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.810 
world now I think you know the course is
it's<00:01:59.900> a<00:02:00.530> real<00:02:00.770> bull<00:02:01.010> start<00:02:01.310> track<00:02:01.580> it's

everything's<00:02:02.210> big<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:03.230> know<00:02:03.380> there's

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
everything's big and you know there's

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.710 
everything's big and you know there's
there's<00:02:04.160> so<00:02:04.370> many<00:02:04.460> questions<00:02:04.640> out<00:02:05.120> there<00:02:05.420> and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
there's so many questions out there and

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.240 
there's so many questions out there and

you can't take anything cheaply and

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.620 
you can't take anything cheaply and
certainly<00:02:07.970> has<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.090> stamp

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
certainly has that stamp

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.840 
certainly has that stamp

last name I think building a four star

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.210 
last name I think building a four star
course<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.390> always<00:02:14.740> it's<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.860> challenge

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
course is always it's a challenge

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.880
