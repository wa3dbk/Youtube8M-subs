00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.680
 when we want to go from a point to a 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.420
 point b 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.820
 the simplest is to draw a line 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.210
 and to follow her the problem is that 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.540
 the scale of a city a region the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.570
 country 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.609
 it gets complicated i sncf that's it our 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 craft make simple and fluid the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.070
 transport of persons and 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.320
 merchandise 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.430
 for us the shortest way to a 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.740
 point to another 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.970
 it's first to bring them together because 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.500
 that our first job is to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.269
 allow every day to millions of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.440
 travelers like Beatrice to park 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.320
 to take the same train as mark 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.530
 to meet caroline caroline who takes 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.420
 his bus and joined marion connect the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.480
 different modes of transportation that's it 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.519
 intermodality a complicated word for 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.989
 make it simple ah and then 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.750
 something else when you go in 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.059
 mountain unia the bermudas flip-flops at 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.649
 sncf it's the same safest way 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.280
 to go from one point to another in any 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.019
 security 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.390
 it is to be well equipped to have 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.370
 trust in his material to be able 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.949
 to supervise 24 hours a day near 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.780
 15000 train control in real time the 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.580
 hardware reliability while ensuring 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.159
 the exploitation of 36 thousand kilometers of 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.929
 channels with more of the superpower 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.610
 design and develop the transport of 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.289
 tomorrow we will have to find ourselves 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.270
