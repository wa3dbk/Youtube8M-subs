change though I'm going to make this a
two-story<00:00:44.040> house<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.610> I'm<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.850> orbit

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
two-story house so I'm going to orbit

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.630 
two-story house so I'm going to orbit
back<00:00:45.360> around<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.590> zoom<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.610> I

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
back around so and zoom out so that I

can see my whole roof remember what i
did<00:00:51.570> when<00:00:51.719> i<00:00:51.780> made<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.110> roof<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.430> I'm<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
did when i made the roof so I'm going to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.760 
did when i made the roof so I'm going to
RAB<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.969> move<00:00:54.149> tool<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.600> drop<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.500> back

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
RAB that move tool and drop this back

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.270 
RAB that move tool and drop this back
down<00:00:56.690> till<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.870> flat<00:00:58.140> how<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.980> know<00:00:59.070> when

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
down till it's flat how do I know when

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:11.710 
down till it's flat how do I know when
it's<00:00:59.309> flat<00:00:59.609> I<00:01:01.670> depend<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.210> axis<00:01:07.460> move<00:01:08.460> tool

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.830 

on<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> red<00:01:13.170> axis

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.910 

it<00:01:19.740> should<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.070> good<00:01:20.189> erase<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.729> line

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
it should be good erase that line

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.660 
it should be good erase that line
actually<00:01:22.920> I'm<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.159> erase<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> whole

roof or ceiling orbit back around make a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.569 
roof or ceiling orbit back around make a
rectangle<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.039> ceiling<00:01:31.159> tangle<00:01:32.159> remember

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
rectangle for a ceiling tangle remember

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.709 
rectangle for a ceiling tangle remember
we<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.789> a<00:01:32.819> floor<00:01:33.179> now<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> ceiling

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
we have a floor now we have a ceiling

we have a floor now we have a ceiling
orbit<00:01:36.719> background<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.380> pull<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.219> up<00:01:39.950> to

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
orbit background and pull that up to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:50.139 
orbit background and pull that up to
about<00:01:41.159> 18<00:01:41.609> feet<00:01:46.549> scratch<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.579> move<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.689> up<00:01:48.869> oh

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
about 18 feet scratch that move it up oh

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.319 
about 18 feet scratch that move it up oh
my<00:01:51.149> goodness<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.959> must<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:53.159> made<00:01:53.459> gotten

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
my goodness I must not have made gotten

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.350 
my goodness I must not have made gotten
that<00:01:54.659> exactly<00:01:55.349> flat<00:01:55.969> probably<00:01:56.969> everyone's

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
that exactly flat probably everyone's

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.910 
that exactly flat probably everyone's
going<00:01:57.569> to<00:01:57.599> do<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.959> so<00:01:58.380> let<00:01:58.590> me<00:01:58.619> show<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.829> how

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
going to do that so let me show you how

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.119 
going to do that so let me show you how
to<00:01:59.009> fix<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.569> let's<00:02:00.569> check<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> tape<00:02:01.110> measure

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:04.129 

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:07.399 

my<00:02:05.129> two<00:02:05.250> feets<00:02:05.899> probably<00:02:06.899> move<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.229> down

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
my two feets probably move that down

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.589 
my two feets probably move that down
just<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:07.920> bit<00:02:09.140> horrible<00:02:10.140> um<00:02:11.269> yeah<00:02:12.269> okay

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
just a little bit horrible um yeah okay

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.350 
just a little bit horrible um yeah okay
11<00:02:15.599> feet<00:02:16.010> i'm<00:02:17.010> using<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.459> keys<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.329> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
11 feet i'm using the keys on the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.520 
11 feet i'm using the keys on the
keyboard<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:18.959> my<00:02:19.049> tools<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.620> much<00:02:20.040> quicker

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
keyboard for my tools it's much quicker

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.599 
keyboard for my tools it's much quicker
except<00:02:22.530> for<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> tape<00:02:22.889> measure<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.340> think

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
except for the tape measure I think

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.199 
except for the tape measure I think
that's<00:02:23.790> T<00:02:24.230> wouldn't<00:02:25.230> that<00:02:25.290> make<00:02:25.440> sense<00:02:26.209> 21

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
that's T wouldn't that make sense 21

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.400 
that's T wouldn't that make sense 21
feet<00:02:27.389> close<00:02:27.660> enough<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.049> don't<00:02:28.170> want<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.350> hold

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
feet close enough I don't want to hold

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.879 
feet close enough I don't want to hold
you<00:02:28.560> up<00:02:28.680> but<00:02:29.600> 18<00:02:30.600> 19<00:02:30.870> feet<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.380> about<00:02:31.650> right

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:31.889 
you up but 18 19 feet is about right

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:37.759 
you up but 18 19 feet is about right
actually<00:02:32.660> 20<00:02:33.660> feet<00:02:34.760> plus<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.030> roof<00:02:36.769> erase

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769

this<00:04:31.200> is<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.410> way<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.560> do<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:31.800> on<00:04:31.980> a<00:04:32.010> house<00:04:32.300> the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
this is the way you do it on a house the

this is the way you do it on a house the
roofs<00:04:33.540> have<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.930> actually<00:04:34.290> have<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.680> go

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
roofs have to actually have to go

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.850 
roofs have to actually have to go

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
perpendicular to one another that goes

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.219 
perpendicular to one another that goes
like<00:04:38.040> that<00:04:38.270> move<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.660> dude<00:04:40.350> up<00:04:40.560> like<00:04:41.040> so

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
like that move that dude up like so

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.110 
like that move that dude up like so
orbit<00:04:43.229> around<00:04:43.320> to<00:04:43.620> see<00:04:43.770> what<00:04:43.890> we've<00:04:44.010> got<00:04:44.120> that

its own object so I need to make that
triangle<00:06:00.990> that's<00:06:01.990> above<00:06:02.290> this<00:06:02.470> line<00:06:02.710> now<00:06:03.490> it's

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
triangle that's above this line now it's

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.060 
triangle that's above this line now it's
it's<00:06:04.090> a<00:06:04.300> separate<00:06:04.750> object<00:06:04.930> from<00:06:05.410> the<00:06:05.620> base<00:06:05.889> I

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
it's a separate object from the base I

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.930 
it's a separate object from the base I
mean<00:06:09.070> it<00:06:09.160> happens<00:06:09.490> that<00:06:09.729> quick<00:06:11.699> sketchup<00:06:12.699> just

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
mean it happens that quick sketchup just

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.440

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
made it a completely separate object now

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.360 
made it a completely separate object now
if<00:06:16.660> i<00:06:16.750> take<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:17.050> move<00:06:17.229> tool<00:06:17.500> i<00:06:17.740> can<00:06:17.919> drag<00:06:18.100> this

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
if i take the move tool i can drag this
