00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
got some truck or acetic acid at home

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.280 
got some truck or acetic acid at home
why<00:02:31.430> don't<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.760> make<00:02:32.000> my<00:02:32.180> own<00:02:32.210> solution<00:02:33.080> and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
why don't I make my own solution and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.860 
why don't I make my own solution and
make<00:02:33.800> my<00:02:33.950> own<00:02:33.980> peel<00:02:34.520> pads<00:02:34.730> that's<00:02:35.570> going<00:02:35.780> to

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
make my own peel pads that's going to

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.030 
make my own peel pads that's going to
save<00:02:36.050> me<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.320> lot<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.620> money<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.440> did<00:02:39.800> and

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
save me a lot of money so I did and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.980 
save me a lot of money so I did and
that's<00:02:40.700> exactly<00:02:40.880> what<00:02:41.480> I'm<00:02:41.600> here<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:41.870> talk

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990

about today now this is the bottle of
the<00:02:45.560> trunk<00:02:45.830> floor<00:02:46.040> acetic<00:02:46.459> acid<00:02:46.970> that<00:02:47.360> I

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
the trunk floor acetic acid that I

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.790 
the trunk floor acetic acid that I
bought<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:49.780> that's<00:02:50.780> how<00:02:50.959> they<00:02:51.140> come<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.739> they

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
bought and that's how they come and they

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.820 
bought and that's how they come and they
want<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.610> get<00:02:53.090> them<00:02:53.300> in<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.600> colored<00:02:54.380> bottle

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
want to get them in a colored bottle

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.640 
want to get them in a colored bottle
like<00:02:55.070> this<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:58.190> helps<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.790> keep<00:02:59.780> any<00:03:00.080> light

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
like this and it helps to keep any light

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.729 
like this and it helps to keep any light
from<00:03:01.130> tent<00:03:01.430> penetrating<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.630> acid<00:03:03.140> which

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
from tent penetrating the acid which

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.800 
from tent penetrating the acid which
would<00:03:03.950> make<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.370> less<00:03:05.170> potent<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:07.780> so<00:03:08.780> I

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
would make it less potent and so I

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.470 
would make it less potent and so I
bought<00:03:09.140> some<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:10.220> truck<00:03:10.459> or<00:03:10.730> acetic<00:03:11.030> acid

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
bought some of the truck or acetic acid

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.670 
bought some of the truck or acetic acid
on<00:03:11.690> Amazon<00:03:12.350> or<00:03:12.560> belief<00:03:12.860> and<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:14.840> was<00:03:15.050> a<00:03:15.080> fifty

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
on Amazon or belief and this was a fifty

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.979 
on Amazon or belief and this was a fifty
percent<00:03:16.010> solution<00:03:16.540> now<00:03:17.540> if<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.810> were<00:03:17.870> going

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
percent solution now if you were going

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.570 
percent solution now if you were going
to<00:03:18.080> do<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> chemical<00:03:18.770> peel<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.310> would<00:03:19.430> never

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
to do a chemical peel you would never

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.400 
to do a chemical peel you would never
use<00:03:19.880> a<00:03:19.910> fifty<00:03:20.300> percent<00:03:20.600> solution<00:03:20.840> on<00:03:21.260> your

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
use a fifty percent solution on your

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.620 
use a fifty percent solution on your
face<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:21.890> have<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.130> dilute<00:03:22.550> it<00:03:22.760> but<00:03:23.480> the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
face you have to dilute it but the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.780 
face you have to dilute it but the
instructions<00:03:24.230> are<00:03:24.500> included<00:03:24.830> in<00:03:25.549> the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
did was I use a couple of droppers of

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.199 
did was I use a couple of droppers of
the<00:03:34.580> truck<00:03:35.330> or<00:03:35.540> acetic<00:03:35.870> acid<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.610> I<00:03:37.610> happen<00:03:38.180> to

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
the truck or acetic acid and I happen to

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.530 
the truck or acetic acid and I happen to
have<00:03:38.360> some<00:03:39.140> of<00:03:39.320> these<00:03:39.730> little<00:03:40.730> bottles<00:03:40.940> and

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
have some of these little bottles and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.710 
have some of these little bottles and
you<00:03:41.959> don't<00:03:42.590> want<00:03:42.830> to<00:03:42.950> use<00:03:43.340> anything<00:03:43.820> that<00:03:44.390> like

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
you don't want to use anything that like

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.789 
you don't want to use anything that like
metal<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.730> acid<00:03:47.120> could<00:03:47.269> react<00:03:47.630> with<00:03:47.959> but

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
metal that the acid could react with but

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.850 
metal that the acid could react with but
a<00:03:49.070> thicker<00:03:49.910> plastic<00:03:50.510> bottle<00:03:51.170> like<00:03:51.380> this<00:03:51.410> one

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
a thicker plastic bottle like this one

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.630 
a thicker plastic bottle like this one
or<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:53.230> glass<00:03:54.230> bottle<00:03:54.860> would<00:03:55.190> be<00:03:55.370> absolutely

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
or a glass bottle would be absolutely

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.390 
or a glass bottle would be absolutely
fine<00:03:56.150> to<00:03:56.209> use<00:03:56.470> but<00:03:57.470> I<00:03:57.709> took<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.950> couple<00:03:58.220> of

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
fine to use but I took a couple of

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.850 
fine to use but I took a couple of
droppers<00:03:58.880> of<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.299> truck<00:03:59.510> or<00:03:59.750> acetic<00:04:00.110> acid<00:04:00.590> and

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
droppers of the truck or acetic acid and

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.039 
droppers of the truck or acetic acid and
I<00:04:01.430> put<00:04:01.640> them<00:04:01.670> in<00:04:01.880> the<00:04:02.030> bottle<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.570> then<00:04:02.690> i<00:04:02.750> used

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
I put them in the bottle and then i used

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.830 
I put them in the bottle and then i used
some<00:04:03.140> distilled<00:04:03.709> water<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.459> i<00:04:05.360> filled<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:05.690> up

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
some distilled water and i filled it up

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.880 
some distilled water and i filled it up
and<00:04:06.790> that's<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.209> so<00:04:08.720> now<00:04:08.959> I've<00:04:09.290> got<00:04:09.500> my<00:04:09.680> own

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
and that's it and so now I've got my own

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.930 
and that's it and so now I've got my own
truck<00:04:10.820> floor<00:04:11.000> sittig<00:04:11.420> acid<00:04:11.780> solution<00:04:12.440> and<00:04:12.940> I

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
truck floor sittig acid solution and I

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.210 
truck floor sittig acid solution and I
went<00:04:14.239> ahead<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:14.510> did<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:15.140> facial<00:04:15.530> peel<00:04:15.920> that

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
went ahead and did a facial peel that

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.690 
went ahead and did a facial peel that
night<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:17.290> using<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.500> using<00:04:19.040> just<00:04:19.400> cotton

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
night and using the using just cotton

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.350 
night and using the using just cotton
balls<00:04:20.470> with<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.769> solution<00:04:22.490> that<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:22.940> had<00:04:23.150> mixed

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
balls with the solution that I had mixed

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.320 
balls with the solution that I had mixed
up<00:04:23.660> and<00:04:23.930> this<00:04:24.080> has<00:04:24.260> got<00:04:24.470> a<00:04:24.500> small<00:04:25.400> hole<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:26.270> I

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
up and this has got a small hole and I

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.690 
up and this has got a small hole and I
just<00:04:26.510> squeezed<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.650> solution<00:04:28.220> onto<00:04:28.430> the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
just squeezed the solution onto the

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.150 
just squeezed the solution onto the
cotton<00:04:29.060> bowl<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.510> applied<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.650> my<00:04:30.890> face

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
cotton bowl and applied it to my face

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.220 
cotton bowl and applied it to my face

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
made it I made this about a twenty

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.930 
made it I made this about a twenty
percent<00:05:20.410> solution<00:05:20.710> so<00:05:21.280> it's<00:05:21.520> still<00:05:21.730> pretty

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
percent solution so it's still pretty

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.600 
percent solution so it's still pretty
strong<00:05:22.770> but<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:23.890> can<00:05:24.040> make<00:05:24.190> them<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:24.400> lot

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610
