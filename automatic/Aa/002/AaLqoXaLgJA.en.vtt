00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.610 

now<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.810> question<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.560> guy<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:03.620> traveling

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
now the question is a guy is traveling

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.490 
now the question is a guy is traveling
with<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> constant<00:00:05.790> speed<00:00:06.020> first<00:00:07.020> it<00:00:07.230> saw<00:00:07.470> a

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
with a constant speed first it saw a

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000 
with a constant speed first it saw a
two-digit<00:00:08.160> milestone<00:00:08.700> let's<00:00:09.090> say<00:00:09.210> X<00:00:09.389> well

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
two-digit milestone let's say X well

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.860 
two-digit milestone let's say X well
then<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.130> saw<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.370> same<00:00:11.849> two<00:00:12.210> digits<00:00:12.540> but<00:00:12.719> in

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
then it saw the same two digits but in

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.160 
then it saw the same two digits but in
the<00:00:12.960> inverse<00:00:13.410> order<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.519> by<00:00:14.790> X<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.330> after

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
the inverse order that is by X and after

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.250 
the inverse order that is by X and after
wanna<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:17.130> saw<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> same<00:00:18.029> original<00:00:18.630> digits

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
wanna it saw the same original digits

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.390 
wanna it saw the same original digits
but<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:20.100> zero<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.880> between<00:00:21.920> now<00:00:22.920> simply

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
but with a zero in between now simply

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.910 
but with a zero in between now simply
when<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.119> say<00:00:24.300> number<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:24.990> two<00:00:25.320> three

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
when we say number one two three

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.500 
when we say number one two three
one<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:27.060> hundred<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.800> 2<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.369> nothing<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:29.820> 20

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
one is hundred this 2 is nothing but 20

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.319 
one is hundred this 2 is nothing but 20
and<00:00:30.779> theis<00:00:31.380> value<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.890> nothing<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.309> three<00:00:32.700> so

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and theis value is nothing but three so

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.260 
and theis value is nothing but three so
that's<00:00:33.540> how<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.290> 120<00:00:34.880> so<00:00:35.880> when<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.120> say

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
that's how we get to 120 so when we say

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.790 
that's how we get to 120 so when we say
X<00:00:36.570> Y<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.770> nothing<00:00:38.309> but<00:00:38.489> 10<00:00:38.879> X<00:00:39.149> plus<00:00:39.540> one

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
X Y this is nothing but 10 X plus one

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.069 
X Y this is nothing but 10 X plus one
tens<00:00:40.800> place<00:00:41.160> jernej<00:00:41.700> place<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.750> nothing

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
tens place jernej place this is nothing

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.709 
tens place jernej place this is nothing
but<00:00:43.110> 10<00:00:43.469> y<00:00:43.710> plus<00:00:44.070> X<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.270> nothing<00:00:45.600> but

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
but 10 y plus X and this is nothing but

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.010 
but 10 y plus X and this is nothing but
100<00:00:45.960> X<00:00:46.410> plus<00:00:47.280> 1<00:00:47.600> in<00:00:48.600> 1<00:00:49.020> our<00:00:49.489> carving<00:00:50.489> from<00:00:51.000> X<00:00:51.329> Y

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
100 X plus 1 in 1 our carving from X Y

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.900 
100 X plus 1 in 1 our carving from X Y
to<00:00:52.410> Y<00:00:53.010> X<00:00:53.420> means<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.719> from<00:00:55.020> 10<00:00:55.350> X<00:00:55.590> plus<00:00:55.920> 5<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to Y X means that is from 10 X plus 5 to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.830 
to Y X means that is from 10 X plus 5 to
10<00:00:57.210> by<00:00:57.449> plus<00:00:57.899> X<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.980> how<00:00:59.190> much<00:00:59.399> did<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.210> car<00:01:00.480> go

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
10 by plus X so how much did the car go

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.990 
10 by plus X so how much did the car go
in<00:01:01.320> varna<00:01:03.409> this<00:01:04.409> minus<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.790> all<00:01:05.970> we

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
in varna this minus this so what all we

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.719 
in varna this minus this so what all we
get<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.450> 9<00:01:06.960> 5<00:01:07.380> -<00:01:08.340> -<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.290> one<00:01:10.680> are<00:01:10.860> from<00:01:11.220> 10<00:01:11.490> X

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
get is 9 5 - - and in one are from 10 X

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.830 
get is 9 5 - - and in one are from 10 X
10<00:01:12.090> y<00:01:12.390> plus<00:01:12.720> X<00:01:12.990> 200<00:01:13.920> X<00:01:14.130> plus<00:01:14.400> 1<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.450> all<00:01:15.659> did

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
10 y plus X 200 X plus 1 so what all did

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.999 
10 y plus X 200 X plus 1 so what all did
it<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.530> 100<00:01:17.520> X<00:01:17.729> plus<00:01:18.090> y<00:01:18.530> minus<00:01:19.530> 10y<00:01:20.130> plus<00:01:20.820> X

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
it go is 100 X plus y minus 10y plus X

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.190 
it go is 100 X plus y minus 10y plus X
in<00:01:23.009> one<00:01:23.640> art<00:01:23.909> from<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.810> this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
in one art from this to this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.370 
in one art from this to this
what<00:01:25.470> will<00:01:25.650> we<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:26.060> from<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.960> what

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
what will we get from this to this what

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.149 
what will we get from this to this what
will<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.590> get

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
will we get

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.630 
will we get
so<00:01:29.790> what<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:31.520> 99<00:01:32.520> X<00:01:33.020> minus<00:01:34.020> 9

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
so what do we get here is 99 X minus 9

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.450 
so what do we get here is 99 X minus 9
so<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.729> one<00:01:36.000> hour<00:01:36.270> carving<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.979> our<00:01:38.220> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so in one hour carving this one our it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.780 
so in one hour carving this one our it
went<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.810> has<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.350> equal<00:01:41.220> as<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
went this but it has to be equal as the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.389 
went this but it has to be equal as the
car<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> constant<00:01:43.470> speed<00:01:43.560> so

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
car is going with a constant speed so

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.030 
car is going with a constant speed so
first<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:45.060> distance<00:01:45.689> has<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.649> equal<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
first as distance has to be equal to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.330 
first as distance has to be equal to
second<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.700> distance<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.720> get<00:01:48.899> 18<00:01:49.409> y<00:01:49.649> equal<00:01:50.189> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
second as distance we get 18 y equal to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.090 
second as distance we get 18 y equal to
1<00:01:50.520> 0<00:01:50.549> 8<00:01:51.149> X<00:01:51.509> y<00:01:52.470> equal<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.430> 6x<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.829> quickly<00:01:55.829> repeat

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
1 0 8 X y equal to 6x I quickly repeat

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.240 
1 0 8 X y equal to 6x I quickly repeat
first<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.000> saw<00:01:57.210> X<00:01:57.509> Y<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.229> 10<00:01:58.439> X<00:01:58.619> plus<00:01:58.829> 5

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
first it saw X Y that is 10 X plus 5

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.149 
first it saw X Y that is 10 X plus 5
then<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.729> saw<00:01:59.939> y<00:02:00.180> X<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.049> 10<00:02:01.290> by<00:02:01.469> plus<00:02:01.740> X<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
then it saw y X that is 10 by plus X and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.100 
then it saw y X that is 10 by plus X and
then<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> saw<00:02:03.119> x<00:02:03.780> over<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.100> 100x<00:02:05.640> plus<00:02:05.759> 1<00:02:06.180> 1

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
then it saw x over that is 100x plus 1 1

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.840 
then it saw x over that is 100x plus 1 1
r<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:08.190> -<00:02:08.640> this<00:02:08.819> one<00:02:09.509> r<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:10.170> -

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
r this - this one r this -

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.360 
r this - this one r this -
distances<00:02:11.850> are<00:02:12.090> equal<00:02:12.570> because<00:02:13.500> speed<00:02:14.100> is

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
distances are equal because speed is

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.020 
distances are equal because speed is
constant<00:02:14.820> so<00:02:15.660> we<00:02:15.780> get<00:02:15.960> y<00:02:16.290> equal<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.340> 6x

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
constant so we get y equal to 6x

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.630 
constant so we get y equal to 6x
now<00:02:18.630> when<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.470> say<00:02:19.680> Y<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.310> equal<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.760> 6x<00:02:21.530> x<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.160> y

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
now when I say Y is equal to 6x x and y

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.790 
now when I say Y is equal to 6x x and y
are<00:02:23.940> digits<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.230> when<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.470> say<00:02:25.830> digits<00:02:26.370> 0<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.390> 9

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
are digits so when I say digits 0 to 9

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.980 
are digits so when I say digits 0 to 9
digit<00:02:28.800> can<00:02:28.980> never<00:02:29.190> be<00:02:29.430> more<00:02:29.610> than<00:02:29.670> 9<00:02:30.060> if<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.840> say

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
digit can never be more than 9 if I say

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.330 
digit can never be more than 9 if I say
X<00:02:31.230> 0<00:02:31.590> y<00:02:32.250> 0<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.720> vehicle<00:02:34.500> will<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.800> stationary

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
X 0 y 0 the vehicle will be stationary

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.030 
X 0 y 0 the vehicle will be stationary
if<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:36.120> say<00:02:36.270> X<00:02:36.480> 1<00:02:36.900> Y<00:02:37.380> will<00:02:37.590> become<00:02:37.890> 6<00:02:38.300> to<00:02:39.300> 12<00:02:39.860> but<00:02:40.860> a

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
if I say X 1 Y will become 6 to 12 but a

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.540 
if I say X 1 Y will become 6 to 12 but a
digit<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.640> never<00:02:41.910> be<00:02:42.240> more<00:02:42.510> than<00:02:42.860> 9<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.190> the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
digit can never be more than 9 so the

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.320 
digit can never be more than 9 so the
only<00:02:44.850> possible<00:02:45.570> answer<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:46.070> 1/6<00:02:47.330> only

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
only possible answer is 1/6 only

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.570 
only possible answer is 1/6 only
possible<00:02:48.870> answer<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.640> 1/6<00:02:50.640> X<00:02:50.790> 1<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.840> y<00:02:52.500> 6<00:02:52.920> so

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
possible answer is 1/6 X 1 and y 6 so

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.660 
possible answer is 1/6 X 1 and y 6 so
now<00:02:53.730> simply<00:02:54.210> what<00:02:54.660> it<00:02:54.780> works<00:02:55.050> out<00:02:55.320> is

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
now simply what it works out is

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.200 
now simply what it works out is
originally<00:02:56.670> he<00:02:56.910> saw<00:02:57.150> 16<00:02:57.770> then<00:02:58.770> he<00:02:58.920> saw<00:02:59.220> 61<00:02:59.970> and

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
originally he saw 16 then he saw 61 and

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.270 
originally he saw 16 then he saw 61 and
then<00:03:00.750> he<00:03:00.930> saw<00:03:01.140> 1<00:03:01.440> 0<00:03:01.860> 6<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:04.080> 1<00:03:04.530> hour<00:03:04.770> he<00:03:05.130> went

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
then he saw 1 0 6 so in 1 hour he went

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.190 
then he saw 1 0 6 so in 1 hour he went
61<00:03:05.970> minus<00:03:06.390> 16<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.350> is<00:03:07.500> 45<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:09.240> speed<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.870> the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
61 minus 16 that is 45 so speed of the

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.960 
61 minus 16 that is 45 so speed of the
vehicle<00:03:10.740> is<00:03:11.010> 45<00:03:11.940> km/h<00:03:13.220> earlier<00:03:14.220> he<00:03:14.400> saw<00:03:14.580> 16

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
vehicle is 45 km/h earlier he saw 16

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.040 
vehicle is 45 km/h earlier he saw 16
then<00:03:15.360> he<00:03:15.480> saw<00:03:15.690> 61<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:17.010> speed<00:03:17.310> is<00:03:17.780> 45<00:03:19.010> km/h<00:03:21.050> speed

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
then he saw 61 so speed is 45 km/h speed

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.520 
then he saw 61 so speed is 45 km/h speed
is<00:03:22.200> 45<00:03:22.680> kilometers
