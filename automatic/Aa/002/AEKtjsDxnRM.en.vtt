 Well, you let in so low 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:31.390
 so much feel already 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.390
 voltage is different 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.880
 i.e., low down strongly in front of 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.650
 rest and here it is the enemy from the asset and yes how 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.320
 mice 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.560
 muscles should like not quite 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:54.790
 relax to pump them 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:59.470
 this way you go down there this one 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.840
 and also they have no longer allow 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.010
 reach from here stretched and then 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.679
 already have a rest display if for example gru 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.020
 doing about 20 of course 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.190
 pull off wrong you can continue 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:24.310
 pull the guise then the other you didn't lie to 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:32.920
 horse is not in this exercise that 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:37.510
 me back tops more about what if i 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.060
 I sit on about 20 what 's the first 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:46.730
 symbol 4 on so you should always follow 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:50.830
 so that it now began 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.440
 and if you come to live chest turns 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.970
 very much right here means 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.610
 it turns out that you only do again 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.160
 if u have a lens so tight 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:11.510
 head just as easy as you feel 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:16.340
 how convenient are you yes yes always free 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:22.489
 were it so you yourself felt like it 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:27.530
 everything works for you on every skin of the body 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:29.500
 the other one you train there we only know 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.000
 you have to train hard with a mixer 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.150
 easier 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:43.209
 games makes 12 reps none of this 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:46.920
 810 find such as such a scheme 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.050
 training workout itself 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:55.270

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.300

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.300
 you feel better 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:30.680

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.020

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.930
