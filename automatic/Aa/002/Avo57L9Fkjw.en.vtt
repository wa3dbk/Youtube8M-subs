00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
section this is very important as well

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.209 
section this is very important as well
we<00:00:54.629> need<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.870> set<00:00:55.079> both<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.320> these<00:00:55.500> values<00:00:56.010> to

2.2 also what this is doing is it's

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.760 
2.2 also what this is doing is it's

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
gamma is disabled 3ds max will ask you

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.760 
gamma is disabled 3ds max will ask you
if<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.280> want<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.790> disable<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.500> always

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
if you want to disable it but you always

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.950 
if you want to disable it but you always
want<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.280> keep<00:01:44.460> gamma<00:01:44.790> enabled<00:01:45.329> from<00:01:45.570> now<00:01:45.720> on

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
want to keep gamma enabled from now on

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.010 
want to keep gamma enabled from now on
so<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.220> should<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.490> good<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.759> go<00:01:47.909> now<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.750> long

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
