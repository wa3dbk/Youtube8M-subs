00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
pushes you really hard so I kind of

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.660 
pushes you really hard so I kind of
changed<00:00:34.410> my<00:00:34.440> whole<00:00:34.649> mindset<00:00:35.070> towards<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
changed my whole mindset towards that

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.139 
changed my whole mindset towards that
and<00:00:35.850> going<00:00:36.059> hard<00:00:36.329> each<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> every<00:00:37.320> day<00:00:38.000> it<00:00:39.000> was

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
and going hard each and every day it was

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.400 
and going hard each and every day it was
real<00:00:39.360> different<00:00:39.780> but<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.989> think<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.379> really

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
real different but I think it really

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.440 
real different but I think it really
helped<00:00:40.890> us<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> long<00:00:41.520> run<00:00:41.790> cuz<00:00:42.120> we're<00:00:42.329> all

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
helped us in the long run cuz we're all

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.750 
helped us in the long run cuz we're all
unselfish<00:00:43.110> players<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:44.250> know<00:00:44.399> how<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> play

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
unselfish players we know how to play

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.639 
unselfish players we know how to play
with<00:00:44.940> other<00:00:45.090> great<00:00:45.360> players<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.930> that's<00:00:46.440> what

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
with other great players and that's what

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.170 
with other great players and that's what
that's<00:00:46.860> how<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> NBA's<00:00:47.489> like<00:00:47.760> you'll<00:00:47.969> be

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that's how the NBA's like you'll be

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.150 
that's how the NBA's like you'll be
playing<00:00:48.420> with<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.600> lot<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.930> different<00:00:49.289> people

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
playing with a lot of different people

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.979 
playing with a lot of different people
that's<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.700> your<00:00:50.879> skills<00:00:51.180> that<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.449> better<00:00:51.629> so

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
that's on your skills that are better so

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.540 
that's on your skills that are better so
I<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.770> really<00:00:52.890> prepared<00:00:53.340> us<00:00:55.489> as<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
I think it really prepared us as a

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.459 
I think it really prepared us as a
shooter<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> think<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.420> working<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> lot<00:00:58.199> you

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
shooter I think I'm working on a lot you

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.349 
shooter I think I'm working on a lot you
know<00:00:58.590> Don<00:00:59.160> has<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.609> taking<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.940> lot<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> more

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
know Don has me taking a lot of more

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.660 
know Don has me taking a lot of more
jump<00:01:00.629> shots<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.070> improving

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
jump shots I think I'm really improving

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.210 
jump shots I think I'm really improving
and<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.969> think<00:01:03.239> that's<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.629> thing<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:05.100> lot

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and I think that's one thing that a lot

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.560 
and I think that's one thing that a lot
of<00:01:05.369> people<00:01:05.610> are<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:05.939> shot<00:01:06.180> back<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
of people are going to be shot back and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.789 
of people are going to be shot back and
shoot<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> ball<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:12.409> I'm<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> big

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
shoot the ball a little bit I'm a big

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.289 
shoot the ball a little bit I'm a big
