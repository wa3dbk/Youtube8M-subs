backside he'll be able to see the belt
drive<00:01:09.670> the<00:01:10.670> lever<00:01:11.420> which<00:01:11.840> actuate<00:01:15.160> so<00:01:16.160> you

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
drive the lever which actuate so you

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.220 
drive the lever which actuate so you
would<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.880> would<00:01:17.030> start<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:17.570> bike<00:01:17.840> on<00:01:18.080> the

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
would you would start this bike on the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.530 
would you would start this bike on the
stand<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:19.190> kick<00:01:19.520> it<00:01:19.640> off<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.910> stand<00:01:20.120> you<00:01:20.450> would

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
stand it kick it off the stand you would

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.620 
stand it kick it off the stand you would
actuate<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.229> belt<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:22.040> take<00:01:22.250> off<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:23.450> have

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
actuate the belt to take off you have

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.160 
actuate the belt to take off you have
your<00:01:24.910> accelerator<00:01:25.910> here<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.420> throttle<00:01:26.960> and

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
your accelerator here a throttle and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.680 
your accelerator here a throttle and
this<00:01:28.040> side<00:01:28.280> actually<00:01:28.820> works<00:01:29.420> these

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
this side actually works these

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.969 
this side actually works these
mechanisms<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:30.950> this<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:33.650> spark

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
mechanisms and this is the the spark

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.420 
mechanisms and this is the the spark
control<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.610> advance<00:01:34.970> for<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:35.990> timing

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
control the advance for the timing

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.180 
control the advance for the timing
amazing<00:01:37.430> so<00:01:37.790> I<00:01:38.060> think<00:01:38.290> are<00:01:39.290> you<00:01:39.650> telling<00:01:40.040> me

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
amazing so I think are you telling me

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.840 
amazing so I think are you telling me
that<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:42.560> would<00:01:42.770> be<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:43.009> sprocket<00:01:43.640> that

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that this would be the sprocket that

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.030 
that this would be the sprocket that
would<00:01:44.630> be<00:01:44.720> the<00:01:44.840> rear<00:01:45.050> sprocket<00:01:45.619> railroad

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
would be the rear sprocket railroad

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.690 
would be the rear sprocket railroad
that's<00:01:46.310> correct

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
that's correct

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.700 
that's correct
and<00:01:46.790> what<00:01:47.270> does<00:01:47.390> this<00:01:47.479> made<00:01:47.720> out<00:01:47.869> of<00:01:47.900> that's

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
and what does this made out of that's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.640 
and what does this made out of that's
out<00:01:48.979> of<00:01:49.009> wood<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:49.750> back<00:01:50.750> then<00:01:51.020> your<00:01:51.200> sprocket

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
out of wood and back then your sprocket

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.530 
out of wood and back then your sprocket
was<00:01:51.770> made<00:01:51.979> out<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.250> wood<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.640> then<00:01:53.360> were<00:01:53.420> they

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
was made out of wood and then were they

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.390 
was made out of wood and then were they
last

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
last

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.770 
last
well<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.610> belt<00:01:55.850> would<00:01:56.000> usually<00:01:56.180> go<00:01:56.540> before

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
well the belt would usually go before

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.400 
well the belt would usually go before
the<00:01:57.080> sprocket<00:01:58.000> fascinating<00:01:59.000> now<00:01:59.600> another

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
the sprocket fascinating now another

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.560 
the sprocket fascinating now another
question<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.860> have<00:02:01.040> is<00:02:01.220> was<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:01.910> know<00:02:02.180> that<00:02:02.420> there

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
are different types of oiling system on

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.980 
are different types of oiling system on
these<00:02:04.370> early<00:02:04.610> bikes<00:02:04.790> I<00:02:05.030> don't<00:02:05.390> know<00:02:05.659> what<00:02:05.870> they

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
these early bikes I don't know what they

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.160 
these early bikes I don't know what they
are

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170

bike this one is actually a pressurized
we'll<00:02:10.729> see<00:02:10.910> these

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.350 

actually<00:02:16.230> locked<00:02:16.740> down<00:02:16.980> at<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.280> moment<00:02:17.610> but

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
actually locked down at the moment but

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.610 
actually locked down at the moment but
she<00:02:18.510> would<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.810> plunger

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
she would have a plunger

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.500 
she would have a plunger
open<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:20.370> he<00:02:20.580> turned<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:20.940> left<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.330> bring

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
open this he turned to the left to bring

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.530 
open this he turned to the left to bring
it<00:02:21.600> up<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.290> pressurize<00:02:22.770> your<00:02:23.160> oil<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.790> it

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
it up and you pressurize your oil and it

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.360 
it up and you pressurize your oil and it
would<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.050> drip<00:02:25.380> system<00:02:25.830> that<00:02:26.010> goes<00:02:26.160> down

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
would have a drip system that goes down

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.310 
would have a drip system that goes down
into<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> motor<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.270> lubricates<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.990> and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
into the motor and lubricates it and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.560 
into the motor and lubricates it and
that's<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.340> only<00:02:29.370> lubrication<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.450> they

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
that's the only lubrication that they

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.230 
that's the only lubrication that they
had<00:02:30.750> Wow<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:32.310> they'd<00:02:32.640> run<00:02:32.790> forever<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.210> you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
had Wow and they'd run forever if you

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.390 
had Wow and they'd run forever if you
did<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.680> were<00:02:36.050> very<00:02:37.050> diligent<00:02:37.470> at

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
did that if you were very diligent at

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880 
did that if you were very diligent at
pumping<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.210> pressurizing<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.200> you'd

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
pumping that pressurizing it you'd

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.230 
pumping that pressurizing it you'd
actually<00:02:41.040> drain<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.640> oil<00:02:41.670> out<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
actually drain the oil out of the

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.020 
actually drain the oil out of the
crankcase<00:02:42.570> after<00:02:43.140> 2<00:02:43.770> or<00:02:43.800> 3<00:02:43.950> days<00:02:44.100> put<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.850> back

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
crankcase after 2 or 3 days put it back

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.670 
crankcase after 2 or 3 days put it back
up<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.420> top<00:02:45.660> depending<00:02:46.050> upon<00:02:46.110> how<00:02:46.320> many<00:02:46.380> miles

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
up and top depending upon how many miles

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.070 
up and top depending upon how many miles
you<00:02:46.860> would<00:02:47.070> use<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.790> you'd<00:02:47.970> recycle<00:02:48.660> your<00:02:48.870> oil

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
you would use and you'd recycle your oil

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.810 
you would use and you'd recycle your oil
from<00:02:49.320> your<00:02:49.380> crankcase<00:02:49.950> back<00:02:50.250> up<00:02:50.490> into<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
from your crankcase back up into the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.090 
from your crankcase back up into the
tank<00:02:51.060> Wow<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.650> know<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.830> answer<00:02:52.950> your

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
tank Wow and it you know to answer your

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.090 
tank Wow and it you know to answer your
question<00:02:54.080> it's<00:02:55.080> not<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.470> efficient<00:02:55.980> as<00:02:56.070> you

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
question it's not as efficient as you

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.250 
question it's not as efficient as you
know<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.970> know<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.180> moved<00:02:57.330> away<00:02:57.510> from<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.900> but

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
know you know we moved away from it but

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.360 
know you know we moved away from it but
it<00:02:58.770> worked<00:02:59.250> for<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.580> time<00:02:59.990> I<00:03:00.990> mean<00:03:01.230> how<00:03:02.190> long

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
it worked for the time I mean how long

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.920 
it worked for the time I mean how long
how<00:03:02.760> long<00:03:02.820> could<00:03:03.150> they<00:03:03.240> ride<00:03:03.450> these<00:03:03.600> bikes<00:03:03.660> I

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
how long could they ride these bikes I

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.520 
how long could they ride these bikes I
mean<00:03:04.080> could<00:03:04.470> they<00:03:04.560> put<00:03:04.740> 50,000<00:03:05.460> miles<00:03:05.610> on<00:03:05.790> it

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
mean could they put 50,000 miles on it

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.260 
mean could they put 50,000 miles on it
25,000<00:03:07.530> Wow<00:03:07.620> how<00:03:08.370> long<00:03:08.700> would<00:03:08.850> these<00:03:08.970> bikes

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
25,000 Wow how long would these bikes

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.690 
25,000 Wow how long would these bikes
last<00:03:10.170> before<00:03:10.530> they<00:03:10.620> had<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.830> do<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> rebuild<00:03:11.430> you

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
last before they had to do a rebuild you

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.550 
last before they had to do a rebuild you
know<00:03:11.790> this<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.120> purely<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.870> guess<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.350> my<00:03:13.410> part

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
know this is purely a guess on my part

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.380 
know this is purely a guess on my part
it's<00:03:14.070> probably<00:03:14.460> a<00:03:14.490> question<00:03:14.730> for<00:03:15.120> someone

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
it's probably a question for someone

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.450 
it's probably a question for someone
else<00:03:15.570> but<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.050> would<00:03:16.080> say<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.530> bike<00:03:16.860> like<00:03:17.070> this<00:03:17.100> if

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
else but I would say a bike like this if

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.580 
else but I would say a bike like this if
it<00:03:17.580> was<00:03:17.730> maintained<00:03:18.240> because<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.380> road

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
it was maintained because the road

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.320 
it was maintained because the road
conditions<00:03:20.100> were<00:03:20.220> extremely<00:03:20.700> rough<00:03:21.090> they

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
conditions were extremely rough they

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.480 
conditions were extremely rough they
weren't<00:03:21.480> improved<00:03:21.900> back<00:03:22.110> then<00:03:22.380> potholes<00:03:23.250> were

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
weren't improved back then potholes were

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.699 
weren't improved back then potholes were
the<00:03:23.610> size<00:03:23.820> of<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.060> car<00:03:24.300> at<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.570> time<00:03:24.780> but<00:03:25.530> this

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
the size of a car at that time but this

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.550 
the size of a car at that time but this
thing<00:03:25.890> would<00:03:26.040> easily<00:03:26.280> do<00:03:26.580> 20,000<00:03:27.300> miles

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
thing would easily do 20,000 miles

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.890 
thing would easily do 20,000 miles
easily<00:03:28.560> Wow
