it<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.920> found<00:02:16.520> when<00:02:16.760> plugging<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.360> my<00:02:17.510> xbox<00:02:17.930> 360

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
it I found when plugging in my xbox 360

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.500 
it I found when plugging in my xbox 360
to<00:02:18.650> record<00:02:19.040> some<00:02:19.220> footage<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:19.670> this<00:02:19.849> device<00:02:20.150> it

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
to record some footage on this device it

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.110 
to record some footage on this device it
really<00:02:21.080> worked<00:02:21.409> well

really worked well

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.430 
really worked well
probably<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.270> only<00:02:23.540> downfall<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.290> this

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
probably the only downfall of this

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.650 
probably the only downfall of this
device<00:02:24.800> is<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.430> does<00:02:25.760> not<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.300> pass

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
device is that it does not have a pass

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.050 
device is that it does not have a pass
through<00:02:27.340> whereas<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.790> aver<00:02:29.000> aver<00:02:29.750> TV<00:02:30.620> HD<00:02:31.220> or

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
through whereas the aver aver TV HD or

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.830 
through whereas the aver aver TV HD or
USB<00:02:32.540> HD<00:02:33.080> DVR<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.680> can<00:02:34.069> HDMI<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.150> my<00:02:35.239> TV<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
USB HD DVR I can HDMI that to my TV and

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.420 
USB HD DVR I can HDMI that to my TV and
use<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.170> as<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.319> pass<00:02:36.620> through<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.160> there<00:02:37.250> might

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
use it as a pass through and there might

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.370 
use it as a pass through and there might
be<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.610> delay<00:02:37.819> on<00:02:37.970> my<00:02:38.209> laptop<00:02:38.450> recording<00:02:39.200> but<00:02:39.350> I

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
be a delay on my laptop recording but I

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.280
