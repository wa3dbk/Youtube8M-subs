doing a pulp ectomy pulpotomy so just

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.890 
doing a pulp ectomy pulpotomy so just
not<00:02:11.459> even<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.910> orifice<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.420> just

not even going the orifice is just

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.770 
not even going the orifice is just
opening<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.920> getting<00:02:14.549> obtaining<00:02:15.090> an<00:02:15.420> ionic

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
opening the getting obtaining an ionic

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.289 
opening the getting obtaining an ionic
access<00:02:16.849> scooping<00:02:17.849> out<00:02:17.939> the<00:02:18.000> pulpit<00:02:18.900> issue<00:02:19.110> and

sealing<00:02:21.299> with<00:02:21.540> whatever<00:02:22.610> restoration<00:02:23.610> and

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
sealing with whatever restoration and

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.229 
sealing with whatever restoration and
they<00:02:24.540> actually<00:02:24.720> followed<00:02:25.170> them<00:02:25.319> for<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:26.640> number

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
they actually followed them for a number

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.740 
they actually followed them for a number
up<00:02:27.420> up<00:02:27.689> to<00:02:27.750> 30<00:02:28.349> days<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.950> they<00:02:29.069> had<00:02:29.310> a

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
up up to 30 days and they had a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.170 
up up to 30 days and they had a
significant<00:02:30.750> amount<00:02:31.349> of<00:02:31.470> pain<00:02:31.680> relief<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
significant amount of pain relief so the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.819 
significant amount of pain relief so the
idea<00:02:33.329> behind<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:36.349> you<00:02:37.349> can<00:02:37.530> see<00:02:37.680> my

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
idea behind this is that you can see my

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.970 
idea behind this is that you can see my
crew<00:02:38.129> drawing<00:02:38.459> for<00:02:38.640> my<00:02:38.730> notes<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:40.590> if

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
crew drawing for my notes is that if

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.640 
crew drawing for my notes is that if
this<00:02:41.189> is<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.609> route<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.659> this<00:02:43.200> is<00:02:43.349> a<00:02:43.379> nerve

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
this is the route and this is a nerve

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.250 
this is the route and this is a nerve
canal<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.549> canal<00:02:44.819> space<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.540> axons<00:02:46.079> are

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
canal so the canal space the axons are

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.690 
canal so the canal space the axons are
coming<00:02:46.530> from<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:46.799> apical<00:02:47.010> tissues<00:02:47.609> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
coming from the apical tissues and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.970 
coming from the apical tissues and
they're<00:02:50.700> heading<00:02:51.150> Corona<00:02:51.780> Lee<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.170> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
they're heading Corona Lee and the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.379 
they're heading Corona Lee and the
receptors<00:02:53.459> are<00:02:53.639> actually<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> pulp

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
receptors are actually in the pulp

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.149 
receptors are actually in the pulp
tissue<00:02:54.540> so<00:02:54.870> if<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.019> remove<00:02:55.500> those<00:02:55.650> receptors

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
tissue so if you remove those receptors

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.849 
tissue so if you remove those receptors
and<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.209> term<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.599> users<00:02:57.930> arbor<00:02:58.260> eyes<00:02:58.409> or

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
and the term you users arbor eyes or

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.129 
and the term you users arbor eyes or
sort<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.370> like<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.489> tree<00:02:59.849> you<00:03:00.599> remove<00:03:00.900> all<00:03:00.989> those

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
sort of like a tree you remove all those

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.289 
sort of like a tree you remove all those
receptors<00:03:01.879> there<00:03:02.879> are<00:03:03.090> no<00:03:03.239> pain<00:03:05.299> receptors

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
receptors there are no pain receptors

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.619 
receptors there are no pain receptors
along<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.989> axon<00:03:07.379> so<00:03:08.310> essentially<00:03:08.790> once<00:03:09.540> you

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
along the axon so essentially once you

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.960 
along the axon so essentially once you
remove<00:03:09.840> all<00:03:09.959> those<00:03:10.049> receptors<00:03:10.970> you're

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
remove all those receptors you're

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.949 
remove all those receptors you're
removing<00:03:12.209> all<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.420> pain<00:03:12.689> sensation<00:03:17.269> so<00:03:18.269> what

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
removing all the pain sensation so what

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.680 
removing all the pain sensation so what
happened<00:03:19.349> was<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.500> was<00:03:19.739> completed<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.690> 1989

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
happened was that was completed in 1989

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.789 
happened was that was completed in 1989
and<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.109> was<00:03:22.230> sort<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:26.180> retried<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.799> was

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
and it was sort of retried and was

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.039 
and it was sort of retried and was
published<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:30.000> journal<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.480> american

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
published in a journal of american

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.949 
published in a journal of american
dental<00:03:31.470> association<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.639> this<00:03:33.510> one<00:03:33.690> was<00:03:33.810> in

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
dental association and this one was in

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.939 
dental association and this one was in
2004<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:35.930> they<00:03:36.930> did<00:03:37.109> essentially<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.769> same

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
2004 and they did essentially the same

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.319 
2004 and they did essentially the same
thing<00:03:38.010> they<00:03:38.400> had<00:03:38.549> a<00:03:38.579> number<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.879> patients<00:03:39.299> that

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
thing they had a number of patients that

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.729 
thing they had a number of patients that
presented<00:03:39.599> symptomatic<00:03:40.290> irreversible

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
presented symptomatic irreversible

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.589 
presented symptomatic irreversible
pulpitis<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.519> they<00:03:41.940> essentially<00:03:42.930> completed

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
pulpitis and they essentially completed

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.140 
pulpitis and they essentially completed
pulpotomy<00:03:45.599> 'he's<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.650> results<00:03:47.220> they

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
pulpotomy 'he's and the results they

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.059 
pulpotomy 'he's and the results they
actually<00:03:48.329> followed<00:03:48.690> him<00:03:48.780> for<00:03:49.139> a<00:03:49.500> lengthy

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
actually followed him for a lengthy

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.280 
actually followed him for a lengthy
period<00:03:50.099> of<00:03:50.430> time<00:03:50.549> up<00:03:50.699> to<00:03:50.819> a<00:03:50.849> year<00:03:50.909> and<00:03:51.540> they

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
period of time up to a year and they

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.250 
period of time up to a year and they
reported<00:03:52.680> similar<00:03:53.549> results<00:03:54.150> just<00:03:54.959> like<00:03:55.109> the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
reported similar results just like the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.610 
reported similar results just like the
1989<00:03:56.069> study<00:03:56.629> where<00:03:57.629> they<00:03:57.659> had<00:03:57.810> significant

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
1989 study where they had significant

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.610 
1989 study where they had significant
pain<00:03:59.190> reduction<00:03:59.909> by<00:04:00.900> just<00:04:01.169> doing<00:04:01.379> a<00:04:01.590> simple

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
pain reduction by just doing a simple

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.339 
pain reduction by just doing a simple
pulpotomy<00:04:02.599> so<00:04:03.599> what<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.989> take<00:04:04.169> home

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
pulpotomy so what is the take home

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.800 
pulpotomy so what is the take home
message<00:04:04.379> here<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:05.099> can<00:04:05.340> do<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.030> pulpotomy<00:04:06.449> and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
message here you can do a pulpotomy and

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.159 
message here you can do a pulpotomy and
actually<00:04:07.079> have<00:04:08.209> sort<00:04:09.209> of<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.359> safety<00:04:09.599> zone<00:04:09.750> for

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
actually have sort of a safety zone for

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.740 
actually have sort of a safety zone for
up<00:04:10.229> to<00:04:10.349> 30<00:04:10.650> days<00:04:10.970> where<00:04:11.970> you<00:04:12.000> can<00:04:12.180> reappoint

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
up to 30 days where you can reappoint

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.869 
up to 30 days where you can reappoint
that<00:04:12.930> patient<00:04:13.290> get<00:04:13.379> them<00:04:13.500> out<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.709> pain<00:04:13.949> get

manage that patient appropriately at
another<00:04:27.300> time<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:29.130> here's<00:04:29.550> just<00:04:29.730> a

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
another time and here's just a

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.330 
another time and here's just a
radiograph<00:04:30.230> from<00:04:31.230> that<00:04:31.350> jetta<00:04:31.650> article

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
radiograph from that jetta article

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.610 
radiograph from that jetta article

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
the placed irm in some of the patients

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:51.610 
the placed irm in some of the patients
irm<00:04:40.740> base<00:04:41.010> class<00:04:41.730> on<00:04:41.940> record<00:04:46.130> so<00:04:49.220> what<00:04:50.220> a<00:04:50.250> great

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
irm base class on record so what a great

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.920 
irm base class on record so what a great
what<00:04:52.620> a<00:04:52.650> great<00:04:52.800> technique<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:53.690> so<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:54.720> just

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
what a great technique and so I just

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.560 
what a great technique and so I just
wanted<00:04:55.170> to<00:04:55.230> pass<00:04:55.350> that<00:04:55.590> along<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:56.010> think<00:04:56.220> it's<00:04:56.340> a

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
wanted to pass that along I think it's a

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.590 
wanted to pass that along I think it's a
an<00:04:57.570> effective<00:04:58.170> technique<00:04:58.640> if<00:04:59.640> that<00:05:00.030> if<00:05:00.360> the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
an effective technique if that if the

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.080 
an effective technique if that if the
patient<00:05:00.990> presents<00:05:01.080> and<00:05:01.740> actually<00:05:02.340> I<00:05:02.640> also

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
patient presents and actually I also

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.570 
patient presents and actually I also
asked<00:05:03.390> a<00:05:03.510> question<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.230> I<00:05:05.100> think<00:05:05.130> about<00:05:05.490> it

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
asked a question and I think about it

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.250 
asked a question and I think about it
what<00:05:05.790> if<00:05:05.910> you<00:05:06.090> had<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.240> public<00:05:06.570> exposure<00:05:07.250> or<00:05:08.250> say

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
what if you had a public exposure or say

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.690 
what if you had a public exposure or say
traumatic<00:05:10.260> pulpo's<00:05:10.650> iatrogenic<00:05:11.160> pulp

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
traumatic pulpo's iatrogenic pulp

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.580 
traumatic pulpo's iatrogenic pulp
exposure<00:05:12.120> or<00:05:12.510> maybe<00:05:12.690> even<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.960> carious<00:05:13.380> pulp

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
exposure or maybe even a carious pulp

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.260 
exposure or maybe even a carious pulp
exposure<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:14.370> it's<00:05:14.520> at<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:14.760> end<00:05:14.880> of<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.060> day

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
exposure and it's at the end of the day

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.340 
exposure and it's at the end of the day
and<00:05:15.540> you<00:05:16.260> need<00:05:16.560> you<00:05:16.980> know<00:05:17.070> it's<00:05:18.110> going<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.170> pull

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
and you need you know it's going to pull

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.870 
and you need you know it's going to pull
out<00:05:19.380> the<00:05:19.500> whole<00:05:19.710> endo<00:05:19.980> kit<00:05:20.250> now<00:05:20.460> you've<00:05:20.670> got

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
out the whole endo kit now you've got

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.610 
out the whole endo kit now you've got
the<00:05:21.000> operative<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.720> crown<00:05:22.050> bridge<00:05:22.290> kit<00:05:22.470> out

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
the operative and crown bridge kit out

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.220 
the operative and crown bridge kit out
whatever<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.520> make<00:05:23.610> situation<00:05:24.090> maybe<00:05:24.230> and

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
whatever that make situation maybe and

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.330 
whatever that make situation maybe and
the<00:05:25.530> idea<00:05:25.650> is<00:05:25.920> said<00:05:27.560> if<00:05:28.560> it's<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.860> reverse<00:05:29.160> it

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
the idea is said if it's a reverse it

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.400 
the idea is said if it's a reverse it
was<00:05:29.670> reversible<00:05:30.090> pulpitis<00:05:30.480> you're<00:05:31.110> good<00:05:31.290> to

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
was reversible pulpitis you're good to

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.710 
was reversible pulpitis you're good to
go<00:05:31.440> if<00:05:31.680> it<00:05:31.800> was<00:05:31.920> irreversible<00:05:32.580> to<00:05:33.270> start<00:05:33.570> with

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
go if it was irreversible to start with

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.920 
go if it was irreversible to start with
well<00:05:33.990> you<00:05:34.620> probably<00:05:35.120> may<00:05:36.120> have<00:05:36.270> wanted<00:05:36.720> to<00:05:36.840> be

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
well you probably may have wanted to be

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.960 
well you probably may have wanted to be
doing<00:05:37.290> down<00:05:37.440> the<00:05:37.590> endodontic<00:05:37.950> pathway<00:05:38.730> and

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
doing down the endodontic pathway and

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.080 
doing down the endodontic pathway and
the<00:05:39.030> first<00:05:39.360> step<00:05:40.040> it<00:05:41.040> has<00:05:41.280> to<00:05:41.460> have<00:05:41.640> some<00:05:41.910> sort

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
the first step it has to have some sort

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.790 
the first step it has to have some sort
of<00:05:42.210> vital<00:05:42.960> pulpit<00:05:43.320> issue<00:05:43.530> in<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:44.780> in<00:05:45.780> in<00:05:46.620> the

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
of vital pulpit issue in the in in the

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.550 
of vital pulpit issue in the in in the
tooth<00:05:46.980> itself<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.760> is<00:05:47.910> the<00:05:48.060> key<00:05:48.330> if<00:05:49.320> it's

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
tooth itself that is the key if it's

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.990 
tooth itself that is the key if it's
just<00:05:49.770> dust<00:05:50.430> it's<00:05:51.390> not<00:05:51.570> going<00:05:51.720> to<00:05:51.810> work<00:05:52.490> so<00:05:53.490> I

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
just dust it's not going to work so I

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.540 
just dust it's not going to work so I
hope<00:05:54.450> that<00:05:54.570> helped<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.650> pass<00:05:55.800> on<00:05:56.010> a<00:05:56.070> few<00:05:56.250> points

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
hope that helped it pass on a few points

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.780 
hope that helped it pass on a few points
and<00:05:58.100> let<00:05:59.100> me<00:05:59.160> know<00:05:59.280> if<00:05:59.340> you<00:05:59.430> learn<00:05:59.520> something

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
and let me know if you learn something

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.360 
and let me know if you learn something
