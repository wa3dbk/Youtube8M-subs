00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:04.300
 the basketball players of gasterra flames today have the first match in the 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.160
 semifinal played against the forest it's about good sitting it's one 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.949
 contest with a blistering denouement the lead choose den bosch 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:16.630
 fifty-eight against 49 max all lead at one point eleven 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.519
 points for guests 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:22.119
 the groningers must come though they have a lot of problems with the zone 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.399
 defending the forest the state this man on robby bostain 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.170
 paultje detail is all still worrying 8 points is the difference 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.410
 an advantage of the forest 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.040
 wessels akerboom also a dreaded three-point king jan wessels beautiful 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.060
 unlocked 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.150
 we provided much more ten points for the forest to traces of wessels 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.550
 anchor tree fog 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.660
 not a good match on his part 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.590
 then the countervailing of the groningers 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.090
 the stock exchange boer does not yet support the scotland for the entire competition 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.480
 except in the fourth quarter 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.940
 with the three points 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.200
 it is 2 is first for the forest 55 for flames 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.899
 a fourth place 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.710
 completely free 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.580
 he makes the score 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.990
 made fifteen points in the fourth quarter of January on the free throw line 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.140
 authors cold-blooded 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.440
 puts his team on a wider lead 8 points 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.040
 second player who is on the street on the side of flames in the fourth quarter is one 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.260
 third more profit more than two points 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.260
 fear from the square what the hell are you doing there? 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.230
 and what was that place 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.760
 identical situation is in the same place 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.690
 a beer word that is at the bottom 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.380
 61 alienated 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.580
 65 for the forest 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.600
 what seemed to be a tension in the fourth quarter game for the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.540
 groningers are getting closer 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.020
 wall street 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.630
 He sits in the sun if you try to agree the three points 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.359
 because the important role does not build from then is such and the score 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.710
 the difference was only two points 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.990
 or call in favor of den bos, but with three minutes to ask 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.170
 thanks to translators wessels with the three points he also lives on in the ring 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.919
 top scorer on the side of the forest with 20 points 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.189
 Then life must come Heemstede completely free with the three points 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.039
 tas tic done by robby bostain 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.379
 what a comb 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.659
 you can't do everything yourself 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.479
 and he does it here 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.479
 He wants the mistakes so a bonus that does not get that 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:33.259
 71 66 for the forest 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:38.009
 another important to bet a fall by gaining on wall street 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:40.129
 important opportunity for looting 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.129
 you also get skiing the bonis free throw 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:48.449
 for the trial of pirates something possible in the fourth quarter indian 72 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.519
 70 for the forest 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.849
 Steenvoorden cannot compete with him West can prevent the outbreak of flames 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.030
 Tourists also in Wessels' unsporting error sign that the stock market would be the weather 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.930
 those to the freewheel power line also it was more ball possession for the groningers 

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.729
 a free drop of water 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.979
 from bussel 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:13.269
 one point behind within 45 seconds 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.269
 but possession of the ball is for the groningers 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:20.679
 like elsewhere 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.049
 time is starting to run into debt 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.089
 by a scarf for the three points 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:26.069
 wait 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.579
 takes the mouth from roessel 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.909
 it is 74 72 new 7 jansen equalized again from the free throw line 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.020
 the mistakes are made an angry one 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.449
 he may then do well 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.849
 the first is going to hit 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.209
 juve on number two who misses 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.119
 and the balkan for the right one picks up the ball and whoever is in error 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.319
 on wall street 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.869
 again power to the free throw line for another four seconds on the card 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:54.629
 the first free throw is now in second that misses rebound for the forest for jan 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.290
 create the chance of victory there 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.880
 do you want to have a chance of making mistakes 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.290
 he stands with his foot on the back line which means possession of the ball for the groningers 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.549
 now really can not go wrong especially if a mistake is made on wall 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:08.040
 street 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.620
 the first instance 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.780
 7 74 just a little time out to put the last dots on the i 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.640
 first free throw is going to win 77 74 then number two that mission 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.759
 just a little more possible for the forest 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.340
 Jackson the most 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.110
 first stroke has been beaten by granted 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.900
 embarrassingly a 0 for the neighborhood 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.370
 our team is a special 10 even if we play poorly remember it 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.620
 not whether or not the big match was booked 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.289
 the main players who have to get up in the long term 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.599
 inflammation at that point in every point were the two very important ones 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:46.110
 three point she can do that very well and with the rest finally also in the 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.620
 match the first part match that is invisible 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.009
 that makes mistakes that he made this and I had the momentum 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.890
 and that is actually this is just the sun is everyone too 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.220
 but then with position and you have to put your people in good people now so something 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.980
 and what we really need from those according to your old south players 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.980
 that his replacement threats they caught an almost only babysitting 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:06.649
 so that has to go
