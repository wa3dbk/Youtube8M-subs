00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.360
 hello this week we have been super 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:08.509
 busy is working all week yesterday 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.509
 that was on Saturday I took pictures of 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:15.639
 marriage and today we just arrived 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.639
 I was taking pictures of a christening 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.370
 and for those who go with that I hope 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.510
 I 'm not a contrast 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.510
 in danger you 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.050
 a good hug 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 that 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.960
 then as I keep telling you we 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.660
 been very busy and for worse is that 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.480
 we are in 91 degrees of temperature 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.290
 I'm not fahrenheit that for the rest 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.760
 of the world that does not live in the USA is with 34 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.519
 Celsius degrees 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.510
 you think that the perfect idea for today 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.509
 was 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.580
 three simple ideas as everyone knows 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.580
 my videos are simple ideas about 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.290
 healthy and cold snacks all go to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.400
 be frozen for the little ones 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.760
 during the summer we will start to 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.800
 the first snack we need bananas 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.050
 chocolate and peanut butter 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.180
 and basically we are going to make small 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.280
 saints banana boys with butter 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.690
 of peanuts in the center covered 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.610
 chocolate 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.050
 recently bought these these guys from 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.020
 peanut butter because the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.659
 commission starbucks and they taste delicious 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.399
 they have honey 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.130
 and this best peanut butter that 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.409
 I know but if they have a normal jar 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.719
 simply with a knife they put a 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.909
 little in the middle of the slices of 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.299
 banana then the width with the store 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.380
 in the microwave for two minutes 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.090
 remember that when they take things out 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.340
 of the microwave are sometimes very 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.129
 hot especially if they are working 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.280
 with a child near as I did 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:15.450
 wait for it to cool a little before 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.430
 use it and just with a spoon 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.099
 we covered the banana sausages with 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.690
 the chocolate and they put them in the freezer and 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.280
 I do not know how in two hours they were already 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.280
 ready my commercial hours 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.450
 Y 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.690
 for the second subtract they just need 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.459
 fruit and yogurt can not choose the fruit 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.860
 they want if it's a big fruit 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.440
 They split the diced and I use 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.349
 I picked raspberries because amelie flame 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.110
 lately and for the chosen yogurt a 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.330
 Greek yogurt without flavor with 2 percent 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.660
 of fat that is my favorite 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.989
 just put the fruit in the yogurt 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.590
 that is well covered and put in a 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:08.670
 dish and once the sale in the 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.660
 freezer I put this way one hour and 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.660
 A lot was ready 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.710
 for the third snack the only thing that 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.140
 they need is yogurt a plastic bag 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.290
 for what we are going to do is droplets of 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.060
 frozen yogurt I love them in 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.600
 Reality does not like yogurt 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.760
 but this is the best way to get it 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.040
 eat I think you like it a lot 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.830
 cold and I really like that they are bits 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.740
 chemistries to practice motor skills 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.260
 clutching thin light and basically what 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.500
 let's do is throw yogurt in a 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.140
 bag with moment I'm doing full 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.780
 the bag and I pass it all as one 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.270
 corner and with scissors I'm going to cut 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.780
 the plastic tape asks very 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.660
 small and we are going to make yogurt droplets 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.760
 in a dish 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.310
 again of memories if they are 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.530
 working with a child near after 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.760
 use the scissors put them well away 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.760
 that they can not grab 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.510
 and from this we finish now we put it to 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.139
 freezer for one or two hours already 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.139
 enjoy 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.540

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.180
