hope is one of those things where I

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.920 
hope is one of those things where I
actually<00:01:39.159> preferred<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.850> canned<00:01:40.450> product

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
actually preferred the canned product

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.260 
actually preferred the canned product
over<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.320> fresh<00:01:41.620> so<00:01:42.280> many<00:01:42.430> pumpkins<00:01:42.790> are<00:01:43.060> bred

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
over the fresh so many pumpkins are bred

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.880 
over the fresh so many pumpkins are bred
for<00:01:43.300> jack-o'-lanterns<00:01:44.290> then<00:01:44.470> it's<00:01:44.590> really

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
for jack-o'-lanterns then it's really

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.830 
for jack-o'-lanterns then it's really
hard<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.250> get<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.400> high<00:01:45.610> quality<00:01:45.670> sugar<00:01:46.360> pumpkin

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
hard to get a high quality sugar pumpkin

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.859
