00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
going to do is we're going to take our

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.140 
going to do is we're going to take our
clipper<00:00:10.590> column<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.160> we're<00:00:11.760> going<00:00:11.879> to<00:00:11.940> take

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
clipper column and we're going to take

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.209 
clipper column and we're going to take
our<00:00:12.330> large<00:00:12.480> scissor<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.769> we're<00:00:14.010> going<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
our large scissor and we're going to

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.050 
our large scissor and we're going to
blend<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.670> bangs<00:00:14.880> into<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.599> back<00:00:15.920> so<00:00:16.920> as<00:00:17.730> we

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
blend the bangs into the back so as we

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.640 
blend the bangs into the back so as we
learned<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.450> the<00:00:18.509> basic<00:00:18.930> techniques<00:00:19.290> video

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
learned in the basic techniques video

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.850 
learned in the basic techniques video
for<00:00:20.070> scissor<00:00:20.279> over<00:00:20.369> comb<00:00:20.989> we're<00:00:21.989> gonna<00:00:22.110> use

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
for scissor over comb we're gonna use

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.109 
for scissor over comb we're gonna use
the<00:00:23.009> front<00:00:23.279> portion<00:00:23.550> of<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.849> scissor<00:00:26.119> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the front portion of that scissor and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.460 
the front portion of that scissor and
we're<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.419> to<00:00:27.480> blend<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.840> hair<00:00:28.110> from<00:00:28.290> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
we're going to blend that hair from the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.100 
we're going to blend that hair from the
front<00:00:28.649> to<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.399> back<00:00:29.489> and<00:00:29.939> we're<00:00:30.509> gonna<00:00:30.630> hit<00:00:31.050> it

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
front to the back and we're gonna hit it

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.930 
front to the back and we're gonna hit it
in<00:00:31.290> two<00:00:31.410> different<00:00:31.559> directions<00:00:31.820> we're<00:00:32.820> gonna

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
in two different directions we're gonna

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.660 
in two different directions we're gonna
come<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.450> direction<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:35.040> then<00:00:35.550> we're

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
come in this direction and then we're

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.800 
come in this direction and then we're
going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.850> come<00:00:36.059> from<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.420> front<00:00:36.540> forward<00:00:38.810> now

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
going to come from the front forward now

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.150 
going to come from the front forward now
we're<00:00:39.990> going<00:00:40.080> to<00:00:40.140> switch<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> our<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:40.890> blade

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
we're going to switch to our one blade

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.750 
we're going to switch to our one blade
which<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.970> next<00:00:42.180> size<00:00:42.420> down<00:00:42.450> from<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> 1a

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
which is the next size down from the 1a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
which is the next size down from the 1a
and<00:00:44.760> we're<00:00:44.880> going<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.060> do<00:00:45.150> the<00:00:45.240> same<00:00:45.480> thing

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
and we're going to do the same thing

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.080 
and we're going to do the same thing
what<00:00:46.740> you<00:00:46.890> want<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.220> remember<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.670> between

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
what you want to remember is between

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.670 
what you want to remember is between
each<00:00:48.300> blade<00:00:48.720> you<00:00:49.020> want<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.260> little<00:00:49.470> bit<00:00:49.620> of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
each blade you want a little bit of

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.620 
each blade you want a little bit of
separation<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.550> quarter<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.000> an<00:00:51.090> inch<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
separation a quarter of an inch to a

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.020 
separation a quarter of an inch to a
half<00:00:51.870> an<00:00:52.050> inch<00:00:52.430> if<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.610> work<00:00:53.790> down<00:00:53.970> through

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
half an inch if you work down through

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.270 
half an inch if you work down through
all<00:00:54.390> your<00:00:54.600> blades<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.200> you<00:00:55.320> keep<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.950> up

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
all your blades but you keep going up up

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.380 
all your blades but you keep going up up
just<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:56.910> high

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
just as high

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.790 
just as high
you're<00:00:57.690> still<00:00:57.870> gonna<00:00:57.989> wind<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.380> with<00:00:58.560> a<00:00:58.590> line

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you're still gonna wind up with a line

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.310 
you're still gonna wind up with a line
so<00:00:59.790> now<00:00:59.940> we're<00:01:00.150> gonna<00:01:00.270> drop<00:01:00.600> down<00:01:00.810> our<00:01:01.050> next

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
so now we're gonna drop down our next

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.770 
so now we're gonna drop down our next
blade<00:01:01.560> size<00:01:01.860> we're<00:01:02.640> doing<00:01:02.970> that<00:01:03.090> same<00:01:03.270> fading

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
blade size we're doing that same fading

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.250 
blade size we're doing that same fading
motion

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.750 

you<00:01:08.770> want<00:01:08.980> to<00:01:09.070> make<00:01:09.220> sure<00:01:09.250> that<00:01:09.580> you're

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
you want to make sure that you're

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.460 
you want to make sure that you're
leaving<00:01:09.940> that<00:01:10.150> quarter<00:01:10.690> of<00:01:10.780> an<00:01:10.870> inch<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.140> half

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
leaving that quarter of an inch to half

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.080 
leaving that quarter of an inch to half
an<00:01:11.590> inch<00:01:11.680> between<00:01:11.950> blades<00:01:12.460> so<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:12.730> have<00:01:12.940> that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
an inch between blades so you have that

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.810 
an inch between blades so you have that
separation<00:01:13.630> and<00:01:14.050> that<00:01:14.590> separation<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.610> what

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
separation and that separation is what

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.850 
separation and that separation is what
causes<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.840> tapering<00:01:17.590> or<00:01:17.830> fading<00:01:18.280> effect<00:01:19.860> so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
causes the tapering or fading effect so

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.230 
causes the tapering or fading effect so
at<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.100> very<00:01:21.310> end<00:01:21.580> when<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:21.880> get<00:01:22.000> about<00:01:22.180> a

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
at the very end when you get about a

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.340 
at the very end when you get about a
quarter<00:01:22.510> of<00:01:22.660> an<00:01:22.720> inch<00:01:22.780> or<00:01:22.990> a<00:01:23.020> half<00:01:23.050> an<00:01:23.260> inch

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
quarter of an inch or a half an inch

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.140 
quarter of an inch or a half an inch
away<00:01:23.530> very<00:01:23.890> slowly<00:01:24.430> pull<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.700> teeth<00:01:24.880> of<00:01:25.030> that

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
away very slowly pull the teeth of that

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.430 
away very slowly pull the teeth of that
blade<00:01:25.420> away<00:01:25.690> and<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:28.450> is<00:01:28.600> how<00:01:28.750> slow<00:01:29.020> I<00:01:29.050> do<00:01:29.200> it

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
blade away and this is how slow I do it

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.170 
blade away and this is how slow I do it
in<00:01:29.530> real<00:01:29.650> life<00:01:29.890> as<00:01:30.100> we<00:01:30.460> talked<00:01:30.730> about<00:01:30.850> before

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
in real life as we talked about before

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.640 
in real life as we talked about before
and<00:01:31.600> we'll<00:01:31.750> talk<00:01:31.930> about<00:01:32.080> throughout<00:01:32.440> the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
and we'll talk about throughout the

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.040 
and we'll talk about throughout the
series<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.220> hair<00:01:33.400> cut<00:01:33.550> lessons<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.750> slower

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
series of hair cut lessons the slower

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.920 
series of hair cut lessons the slower
you<00:01:35.260> work<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.710> easier<00:01:36.640> your<00:01:36.820> work<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.450> faster

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
you work and easier your work the faster

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.600 
you work and easier your work the faster
and<00:01:38.170> more<00:01:38.200> accurate<00:01:38.710> you're<00:01:38.860> working<00:01:39.220> final

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
and more accurate you're working final

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.030 
and more accurate you're working final
step<00:01:39.880> we're<00:01:40.660> going<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.870> use<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.350> beard<00:01:41.890> trimmer

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
step we're going to use a beard trimmer

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.830 
step we're going to use a beard trimmer
this<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.910> how<00:01:43.060> they<00:01:43.210> call<00:01:43.390> this<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.600> super

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
this is how they call this a super

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.630 
this is how they call this a super
shaver<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.470> what<00:01:44.560> this<00:01:44.680> does<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.190> this<00:01:45.340> gets

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
shaver and what this does is this gets

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.330 
shaver and what this does is this gets
it<00:01:45.850> just<00:01:46.060> as<00:01:46.810> close<00:01:47.020> as<00:01:47.290> a<00:01:47.350> straight<00:01:47.740> razor<00:01:47.979> so

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
it just as close as a straight razor so

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.650
