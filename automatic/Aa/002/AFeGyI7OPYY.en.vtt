00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.909 
running android 4.4 point2 both have
TouchWiz<00:00:23.779> but<00:00:24.050> there's<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.290> lot<00:00:24.559> of<00:00:24.590> little

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
TouchWiz but there's a lot of little

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.889 
TouchWiz but there's a lot of little
differences<00:00:25.160> that<00:00:25.640> really<00:00:25.880> can<00:00:26.480> help<00:00:26.509> you

we're<00:00:31.160> gonna<00:00:31.250> look<00:00:31.369> at<00:00:31.430> those<00:00:31.610> let's<00:00:32.149> start

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
we're gonna look at those let's start

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.180 
we're gonna look at those let's start
with<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:32.780> displays<00:00:33.230> we<00:00:34.010> have<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:36.100> 5.7<00:00:37.100> inch

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
with the displays we have a 5.7 inch

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.710 
with the displays we have a 5.7 inch
display<00:00:37.640> on<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.630> Galaxy<00:00:39.530> Note<00:00:39.680> 3<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.850> 5.1

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
display on the Galaxy Note 3 and a 5.1

display on the Galaxy Note 3 and a 5.1
inch<00:00:42.080> display<00:00:42.650> on<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.720> Galaxy<00:00:44.720> s5<00:00:45.530> now<00:00:46.310> this

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
inch display on the Galaxy s5 now this

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.630 
inch display on the Galaxy s5 now this
doesn't<00:00:47.600> actually<00:00:47.870> result<00:00:48.380> in<00:00:48.590> a<00:00:48.740> very

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
doesn't actually result in a very

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.050 
doesn't actually result in a very
different<00:00:50.180> footprint<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.560> phones<00:00:51.860> are<00:00:52.340> very

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
different footprint the phones are very

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.860 
different footprint the phones are very
similar<00:00:53.480> in<00:00:53.660> size<00:00:53.989> even<00:00:54.980> though<00:00:55.340> the<00:00:55.870> galaxy

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
similar in size even though the galaxy

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.170 
similar in size even though the galaxy
note<00:00:57.550> 3<00:00:58.550> has<00:00:58.820> a<00:00:59.739> point<00:01:00.739> 6<00:01:01.100> inch<00:01:01.310> larger<00:01:01.640> display

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
note 3 has a point 6 inch larger display

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.850 
note 3 has a point 6 inch larger display
you're<00:01:02.360> getting<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:02.780> know<00:01:02.809> an<00:01:03.110> extra<00:01:03.380> half<00:01:03.649> an

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
you're getting you know an extra half an

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.330 
you're getting you know an extra half an
inch<00:01:04.040> of<00:01:04.280> room<00:01:05.059> there<00:01:05.089> but<00:01:06.159> phones<00:01:07.159> are<00:01:07.310> pretty

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
inch of room there but phones are pretty

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.029 
inch of room there but phones are pretty
similar<00:01:07.640> in<00:01:08.000> size<00:01:08.420> now<00:01:09.259> one<00:01:09.619> of<00:01:09.649> the<00:01:09.770> big

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
similar in size now one of the big

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.249 
similar in size now one of the big
difference<00:01:10.429> is<00:01:10.639> is<00:01:10.819> the<00:01:11.270> galaxy<00:01:11.630> note<00:01:11.659> 3<00:01:11.960> comes

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
difference is is the galaxy note 3 comes

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.099 
difference is is the galaxy note 3 comes
with<00:01:12.469> an<00:01:12.649> S<00:01:12.859> Pen<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:14.539> while<00:01:14.749> this<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.079> not

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
with an S Pen and so while this is not

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.499 
with an S Pen and so while this is not
genuine<00:01:16.100> generally<00:01:16.700> considered<00:01:17.060> part<00:01:17.329> of<00:01:17.389> the

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
genuine generally considered part of the

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.359 
genuine generally considered part of the
display<00:01:17.719> by<00:01:18.079> a<00:01:18.109> lot<00:01:18.289> of<00:01:18.380> users<00:01:18.499> there's

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
display by a lot of users there's

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.249 
display by a lot of users there's
actually<00:01:19.700> display<00:01:20.090> tech<00:01:20.389> that<00:01:20.600> allows<00:01:20.840> this

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
actually display tech that allows this

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.719 
actually display tech that allows this
to<00:01:21.979> communicate<00:01:22.579> to<00:01:23.569> your<00:01:24.469> Galaxy<00:01:25.219> Note<00:01:25.369> 3<00:01:25.399> and

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
to communicate to your Galaxy Note 3 and

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.760 
to communicate to your Galaxy Note 3 and
you<00:01:26.539> can<00:01:26.659> use<00:01:26.749> this<00:01:26.840> little<00:01:27.109> button<00:01:27.319> to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
you can use this little button to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.029 
you can use this little button to
activate<00:01:28.249> a<00:01:28.819> air<00:01:29.630> command<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:30.409> actually

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
activate a air command and actually

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.980 
activate a air command and actually
hover<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.579> it<00:01:31.700> can<00:01:31.819> detect<00:01:31.939> that<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.479> pen<00:01:32.840> is

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
hover and it can detect that the pen is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.260 
hover and it can detect that the pen is
there<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.979> pen<00:01:34.189> is<00:01:34.399> actually<00:01:34.759> a<00:01:34.789> big<00:01:34.999> part

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
there so the pen is actually a big part

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.730 
there so the pen is actually a big part
of<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:36.289> galaxy<00:01:36.709> note<00:01:37.189> 3<00:01:37.670> display<00:01:38.529> there<00:01:39.529> is<00:01:39.619> no

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
of the galaxy note 3 display there is no

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.469 
of the galaxy note 3 display there is no
pen<00:01:40.039> with<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.959> galaxy<00:01:41.959> s5<00:01:42.799> but<00:01:43.609> you<00:01:44.060> get<00:01:44.240> a

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
pen with the galaxy s5 but you get a

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.059 
pen with the galaxy s5 but you get a
display<00:01:44.899> that<00:01:45.170> features<00:01:45.590> some<00:01:45.770> really<00:01:45.950> cool

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
display that features some really cool

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.249 
display that features some really cool
things<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.520> can<00:01:46.609> go<00:01:46.789> really<00:01:47.090> dim<00:01:47.329> you<00:01:47.959> can<00:01:48.109> go

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
things you can go really dim you can go

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.459 
things you can go really dim you can go
really<00:01:48.649> bright<00:01:49.539> it<00:01:50.539> has<00:01:50.869> one<00:01:51.109> of<00:01:51.170> the<00:01:51.229> best

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
really bright it has one of the best

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.830 
really bright it has one of the best
performing<00:01:52.399> mobile<00:01:52.670> displays<00:01:53.060> according<00:01:53.659> to

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
performing mobile displays according to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.039 
performing mobile displays according to
a<00:01:54.170> display<00:01:55.099> benchmarking<00:01:55.670> company<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:56.299> in

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
a display benchmarking company and in

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.269 
a display benchmarking company and in
person<00:01:57.439> as<00:01:57.529> I'm<00:01:57.649> looking<00:01:57.770> at<00:01:57.979> these<00:01:58.069> two

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:58.279 
person as I'm looking at these two

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:01.389 
person as I'm looking at these two
displays<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:59.810> galaxy<00:02:00.259> s5<00:02:00.499> has<00:02:00.529> a<00:02:00.740> clear<00:02:01.130> win

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
displays the galaxy s5 has a clear win

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.239 
displays the galaxy s5 has a clear win
in<00:02:01.729> terms<00:02:02.090> of<00:02:02.299> just<00:02:02.539> wow<00:02:03.289> looks<00:02:03.859> really<00:02:04.130> good

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
in terms of just wow looks really good

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:08.100 
in terms of just wow looks really good
now<00:02:05.240> both<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.659> these<00:02:05.749> devices<00:02:06.469> can<00:02:07.060> multitask

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
now both of these devices can multitask

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.449 
now both of these devices can multitask
or<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.140> should<00:02:09.319> say<00:02:09.410> can<00:02:10.250> do<00:02:10.640> multi<00:02:11.420> window<00:02:11.720> mode

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
or I should say can do multi window mode

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.100 
or I should say can do multi window mode
so<00:02:13.459> you<00:02:13.549> can<00:02:13.670> run<00:02:13.790> two<00:02:14.030> apps<00:02:14.060> on<00:02:14.540> screen<00:02:14.959> at<00:02:15.049> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
so you can run two apps on screen at the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.740 
so you can run two apps on screen at the
same<00:02:15.319> time<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.829> that's<00:02:16.549> something<00:02:16.849> that<00:02:17.000> work

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
same time and that's something that work

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.890 
same time and that's something that work
on<00:02:17.900> either<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.800> these<00:02:18.890> devices<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:20.630> you

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
on either of these devices so that you

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.720 
on either of these devices so that you
can<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.770> know<00:02:21.860> do<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.160> Duke<00:02:22.430> be<00:02:22.550> a<00:02:22.580> little

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
can you know do that Duke be a little

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.730 
can you know do that Duke be a little
more<00:02:22.880> productive<00:02:23.360> while<00:02:24.080> you're<00:02:24.260> using<00:02:24.380> them

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
more productive while you're using them

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.830 
more productive while you're using them
you<00:02:24.980> get<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.250> little<00:02:25.460> more<00:02:25.580> real<00:02:26.300> estate<00:02:26.330> over

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
you get a little more real estate over

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.310 
you get a little more real estate over
here<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.260> the<00:02:27.800> Galaxy<00:02:28.370> Note<00:02:28.840> then<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:29.930> do<00:02:30.080> on

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
here on the Galaxy Note then you do on

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.950 
here on the Galaxy Note then you do on
the<00:02:30.440> Galaxy<00:02:30.800> s5<00:02:31.360> another<00:02:32.360> difference<00:02:32.480> is<00:02:32.780> I

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
the Galaxy s5 another difference is I

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.170 
the Galaxy s5 another difference is I
can<00:02:33.110> say<00:02:33.260> okay<00:02:33.590> google<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:36.310> galaxy<00:02:37.310> s5

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
can say okay google and the galaxy s5

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.360 
can say okay google and the galaxy s5
will<00:02:38.209> start<00:02:38.720> listening<00:02:39.170> whereas<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> galaxy

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
will start listening whereas the galaxy

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.460 
will start listening whereas the galaxy
note<00:02:40.400> 4<00:02:40.730> does<00:02:41.090> not<00:02:41.240> have<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.450> ability<00:02:41.780> so

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
note 4 does not have that ability so

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.910 
note 4 does not have that ability so
it's<00:02:42.680> not<00:02:42.860> going<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.340> be<00:02:43.610> able<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:44.060> just

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
it's not going to be able to just

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.260 
it's not going to be able to just
respond<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.310> that<00:02:46.430> key<00:02:46.940> phrase<00:02:48.910> now<00:02:49.910> we<00:02:49.970> have<00:02:50.239> a

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
respond to that key phrase now we have a

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.120 
respond to that key phrase now we have a
different<00:02:50.780> version<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.170> TouchWiz<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:51.830> you<00:02:51.920> see

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
different version of TouchWiz so you see

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.970 
different version of TouchWiz so you see
a<00:02:52.340> variety<00:02:53.270> of<00:02:53.300> different<00:02:53.660> options<00:02:54.500> here<00:02:54.800> and
