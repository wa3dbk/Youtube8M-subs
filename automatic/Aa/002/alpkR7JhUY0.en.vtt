robberies or grudges I really don't

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520 
robberies or grudges I really don't
think<00:01:26.340> they<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:26.689> that<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> fire

what<00:01:42.630> happens<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.360> example<00:01:45.689> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
what happens here in the for example in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.929 
what happens here in the for example in
the<00:01:45.960> Bacchus<00:01:46.590> OSL<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> last<00:01:47.399> time<00:01:47.640> they<00:01:47.729> faced

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the Bacchus OSL the last time they faced

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.600 
the Bacchus OSL the last time they faced
off<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.390> fantasy<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.110> actually<00:01:49.500> alright<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.579> um

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
off a fantasy one actually alright so um

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.020 
off a fantasy one actually alright so um
yeah<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.869> guess<00:01:52.549> obviously<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.700> include

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
yeah so I guess obviously in the include

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.929 
yeah so I guess obviously in the include
OSL<00:01:54.390> finals<00:01:54.420> store<00:01:55.110> took<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.530> series<00:01:55.939> you

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
OSL finals store took the series you

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.139 
OSL finals store took the series you
know<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.270> five-game<00:01:57.869> series<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> games

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
know a five-game series but in the games

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.330 
know a five-game series but in the games
were<00:02:00.299> played<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.509> July<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.799> game<00:02:02.100> these

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
were played in July the one game these

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.370 
were played in July the one game these
two<00:02:02.520> faced<00:02:02.790> off<00:02:02.969> against<00:02:03.420> was<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> win<00:02:04.350> for

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
two faced off against was a win for

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.700 
two faced off against was a win for
fantasy

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
fantasy

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.889 
fantasy
of<00:02:07.710> course<00:02:07.950> anything<00:02:08.640> could<00:02:08.759> happen<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.750> is

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
of course anything could happen this is

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.559 
of course anything could happen this is
destination<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:11.000> it's<00:02:12.000> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.209> be<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> good

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
destination and it's going to be a good

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.820 
destination and it's going to be a good
map<00:02:12.750> here<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:12.990> think<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.319> could<00:02:13.470> be<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> longer

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
map here I think it could be a longer

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.370 
map here I think it could be a longer
game<00:02:14.120> depending<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.209> how<00:02:15.390> these<00:02:15.870> players<00:02:16.110> feel

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
game depending on how these players feel

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.260 
game depending on how these players feel
each<00:02:16.500> other<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.459> think<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
each other out I do think that the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.930 
each other out I do think that the
higher<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.690> skill<00:02:18.959> level<00:02:19.400> both<00:02:20.400> players<00:02:20.610> are

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
higher the skill level both players are

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.120 
higher the skill level both players are
the<00:02:21.870> less<00:02:22.140> chance<00:02:22.170> actually<00:02:22.860> we're<00:02:22.950> going<00:02:23.070> to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
the less chance actually we're going to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.930 
the less chance actually we're going to
see<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> super<00:02:23.730> early<00:02:24.120> cheese<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:26.700> because

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
see a super early cheese just because

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.580 
see a super early cheese just because
you<00:02:27.420> know<00:02:27.510> they<00:02:27.690> respect<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> other<00:02:28.290> players

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
you know they respect the other players

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.140 
you know they respect the other players
abilities<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.160> hold<00:02:29.340> off<00:02:29.459> that<00:02:29.670> kind<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:29.880> stuff

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
abilities to hold off that kind of stuff

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.180 
abilities to hold off that kind of stuff
basically<00:02:31.080> cheese<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.560> more<00:02:31.770> mechanistic

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
basically cheese is more mechanistic

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.270 
basically cheese is more mechanistic
than<00:02:32.610> any<00:02:32.790> other<00:02:33.000> longer<00:02:33.840> game<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:34.860> you

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
than any other longer game as in you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.590 
than any other longer game as in you
know<00:02:35.340> if<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.520> have<00:02:35.640> good<00:02:35.790> mechanics<00:02:36.390> then

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
know if you have good mechanics then

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.900 
know if you have good mechanics then
you're<00:02:36.720> able<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.989> handle<00:02:37.350> cheese<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.860> any<00:02:38.790> of

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
you're able to handle cheese and any of

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.640 
you're able to handle cheese and any of
these<00:02:38.970> top<00:02:39.209> players<00:02:39.450> can<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.410> really

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
these top players can and you really

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.530 
these top players can and you really
don't<00:02:40.860> get<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.040> huge<00:02:41.459> advantage<00:02:41.580> from

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
don't get a huge advantage from

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.570 
don't get a huge advantage from
delivering<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.140> then<00:02:43.320> this<00:02:44.160> by<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.400> way<00:02:44.489> is

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
delivering it then this by the way is

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.340 
delivering it then this by the way is
not<00:02:44.880> necessarily<00:02:45.330> cheese<00:02:45.600> this<00:02:45.810> is<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> Ford

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
not necessarily cheese this is a Ford

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.990 
not necessarily cheese this is a Ford
racks<00:02:46.620> here<00:02:46.800> from<00:02:47.010> fantasy<00:02:47.459> but<00:02:47.610> it's<00:02:47.730> done<00:02:47.880> at

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
racks here from fantasy but it's done at

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.390 
racks here from fantasy but it's done at
the<00:02:48.090> correct<00:02:48.450> time<00:02:48.900> as<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:49.709> it's<00:02:49.860> done<00:02:50.070> on

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the correct time as then it's done on

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.640 
the correct time as then it's done on
the<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.980> 10th<00:02:52.980> SCV<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.120> 78<00:02:54.630> on<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.440> other

the on the 10th SCV in 78 on the other
hand<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:56.100> could<00:02:56.459> turn<00:02:56.700> out<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:56.880> be<00:02:57.060> effective

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
hand this could turn out to be effective

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.080 
hand this could turn out to be effective
nonetheless<00:02:58.110> because<00:02:59.070> stork<00:02:59.550> has<00:02:59.610> gone<00:02:59.850> for<00:03:00.060> a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
nonetheless because stork has gone for a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.780 
nonetheless because stork has gone for a
fast<00:03:00.330> expand<00:03:00.750> this<00:03:01.500> looks<00:03:01.709> like<00:03:01.830> a<00:03:01.890> 12<00:03:02.400> Nexus

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
fast expand this looks like a 12 Nexus

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.100 
fast expand this looks like a 12 Nexus
here<00:03:03.530> from<00:03:04.530> stork<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:05.570> this<00:03:06.570> could<00:03:06.810> work<00:03:06.959> out

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
here from stork so this could work out

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.900 
here from stork so this could work out
well<00:03:07.350> for<00:03:07.380> fantasy<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.040> fact<00:03:08.280> if<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.550> get<00:03:08.700> some

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
well for fantasy in fact if you get some

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.300 
well for fantasy in fact if you get some
submarines<00:03:09.480> up<00:03:09.660> he<00:03:09.810> could<00:03:09.930> perhaps<00:03:10.200> go<00:03:11.040> for<00:03:11.280> a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
submarines up he could perhaps go for a

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.430 
submarines up he could perhaps go for a
bunker<00:03:11.730> rush<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.570> actually<00:03:12.959> pull<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.350> off

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
bunker rush and actually pull it off

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.229 
bunker rush and actually pull it off
we're<00:03:13.739> going<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:14.010> see<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:14.970> going<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.180> be

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
we're going to see this is going to be

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.539 
we're going to see this is going to be
interesting<00:03:15.590> just<00:03:16.590> because<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:17.010> that<00:03:17.040> early

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
interesting just because of that early

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.390 
interesting just because of that early
racks<00:03:17.820> in<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.360> forward<00:03:18.660> position<00:03:19.190> or<00:03:20.190> i<00:03:20.250> guess

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
racks in the forward position or i guess

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.720 
racks in the forward position or i guess
it<00:03:20.610> was<00:03:20.640> an<00:03:20.790> early<00:03:21.060> racks<00:03:21.239> but<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.630> Ford<00:03:21.930> racks

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
it was an early racks but the Ford racks

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.100 
it was an early racks but the Ford racks
if<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.880> was<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.180> correct<00:03:24.450> position<00:03:24.570> I

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
if it was in the correct position I

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.810 
if it was in the correct position I
would<00:03:25.500> say<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.070> bunker<00:03:26.459> rush<00:03:26.579> should<00:03:26.730> be

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
would say that a bunker rush should be

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.960 
would say that a bunker rush should be
less<00:03:27.000> likely<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.360> succeed<00:03:28.549> small<00:03:29.549> things<00:03:29.579> in

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
less likely to succeed small things in

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.400 
less likely to succeed small things in
timing<00:03:30.329> matters<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:30.720> much<00:03:30.780> anyway<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.350> looks

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
Kate not like straight up to gate but

generally<00:04:03.239> 12<00:04:03.660> Nexus<00:04:04.109> requires<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.040> go

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
generally 12 Nexus requires you to go

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.740 
generally 12 Nexus requires you to go
for<00:04:05.400> dragoon<00:04:05.730> range<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.420> number<00:04:06.660> of

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
for dragoon range and a number of

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.099 
for dragoon range and a number of
jergens<00:04:07.109> afterward<00:04:08.570> all<00:04:09.570> right<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:09.989> looks

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
jergens afterward all right so it looks

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.390 
jergens afterward all right so it looks
like<00:04:10.170> we<00:04:10.320> got<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.590> 1st<00:04:10.799> Marine<00:04:11.100> here<00:04:11.280> and

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
like we got the 1st Marine here and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.880 
like we got the 1st Marine here and
there<00:04:11.549> is<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.700> bunker<00:04:12.120> finally<00:04:12.630> I<00:04:12.890> think

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
there is the bunker finally I think

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
there is the bunker finally I think
maybe<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.160> bunker<00:04:14.430> were<00:04:14.519> been<00:04:14.670> better<00:04:14.849> off

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
maybe the bunker were been better off

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.420 
maybe the bunker were been better off
built<00:04:15.300> a<00:04:15.390> little<00:04:15.599> earlier<00:04:15.989> maybe<00:04:16.590> fantasy

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
built a little earlier maybe fantasy

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.800 
built a little earlier maybe fantasy

of his legs chopped off pretty much he's

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.240 
of his legs chopped off pretty much he's
pretty<00:05:06.060> much<00:05:06.530> going<00:05:07.530> to<00:05:07.590> be<00:05:07.650> out<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.860> this<00:05:07.980> game

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
pretty much going to be out of this game

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.490 
pretty much going to be out of this game
at<00:05:08.430> this<00:05:08.580> point<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:09.600> could<00:05:09.660> be<00:05:09.960> it<00:05:10.110> could<00:05:10.169> last

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
at this point it could be it could last

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.720 
at this point it could be it could last
for<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.800> while<00:05:10.950> but<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.280> don't<00:05:11.460> think<00:05:11.520> there's

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
for a while but I don't think there's

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.060 
for a while but I don't think there's
much<00:05:11.970> of<00:05:12.030> a<00:05:12.180> chance<00:05:12.540> for<00:05:13.260> him<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.380> win<00:05:13.590> against

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
much of a chance for him to win against

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.880 
much of a chance for him to win against
a<00:05:14.250> top-notch<00:05:14.880> player<00:05:15.240> I<00:05:15.270> mean<00:05:15.800> it's<00:05:16.800> just

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
a top-notch player I mean it's just

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.790 
a top-notch player I mean it's just
you're<00:05:17.220> too<00:05:17.400> far<00:05:17.610> behind<00:05:17.760> at<00:05:18.090> this<00:05:18.210> point

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
you're too far behind at this point

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.020 
you're too far behind at this point
we're<00:05:19.800> out<00:05:19.950> to<00:05:20.070> see<00:05:20.250> if<00:05:20.280> store<00:05:20.669> could<00:05:20.850> pull<00:05:21.000> off

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
we're out to see if store could pull off

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.170 
we're out to see if store could pull off
a<00:05:21.120> miracle<00:05:21.360> I<00:05:21.660> mean<00:05:21.960> that<00:05:22.110> would<00:05:22.230> be<00:05:22.260> certainly

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
a miracle I mean that would be certainly

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.790 
a miracle I mean that would be certainly
miraculous<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:25.169> nothing<00:05:25.530> short<00:05:25.740> of

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
miraculous and nothing short of

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.219 
miraculous and nothing short of
miraculous<00:05:26.190> there's<00:05:26.520> really<00:05:26.640> no<00:05:26.850> way<00:05:27.030> of<00:05:27.229> him

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
miraculous there's really no way of him

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.750 
miraculous there's really no way of him
winning<00:05:28.410> otherwise<00:05:28.830> though<00:05:29.130> he<00:05:29.340> has<00:05:29.460> mined

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
winning otherwise though he has mined

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.360 
winning otherwise though he has mined
out<00:05:29.940> the<00:05:30.090> back<00:05:30.390> of<00:05:30.660> his<00:05:30.750> own<00:05:30.900> base<00:05:31.229> probably<00:05:32.130> to

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
out the back of his own base probably to

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.010 
out the back of his own base probably to
try<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.610> get<00:05:32.910> something<00:05:33.150> going<00:05:33.270> here<00:05:33.570> in<00:05:33.720> terms

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
try to get something going here in terms

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.190 
try to get something going here in terms
of<00:05:34.110> a<00:05:34.229> sneak<00:05:34.590> attack<00:05:35.030> just<00:05:36.030> maybe<00:05:36.240> I<00:05:36.540> don't

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
of a sneak attack just maybe I don't

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.140 
of a sneak attack just maybe I don't
know<00:05:37.290> I<00:05:37.320> mean<00:05:37.590> these<00:05:37.890> players<00:05:38.190> are<00:05:38.430> you<00:05:39.060> know

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
know I mean these players are you know

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.850 
know I mean these players are you know
paid<00:05:39.450> to<00:05:39.630> play<00:05:39.780> though<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.320> certainly<00:05:40.590> they

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
paid to play though and certainly they

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.800 
paid to play though and certainly they
love<00:05:41.070> the<00:05:41.190> game<00:05:41.340> so<00:05:41.370> they<00:05:42.060> will<00:05:42.300> play<00:05:42.540> to<00:05:42.600> the

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
love the game so they will play to the

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.840 
love the game so they will play to the
end<00:05:42.960> in<00:05:43.229> general<00:05:43.650> even<00:05:43.890> when<00:05:44.520> they<00:05:44.610> feel<00:05:44.790> like

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
end in general even when they feel like

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.420 
end in general even when they feel like
they<00:05:45.150> have<00:05:45.180> no<00:05:45.390> chance<00:05:45.600> of<00:05:45.720> winning

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
they have no chance of winning

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.880 
they have no chance of winning
realistically<00:05:47.430> speaking<00:05:47.610> I<00:05:48.590> mean<00:05:49.590> you<00:05:49.770> know

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
realistically speaking I mean you know

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.860 
realistically speaking I mean you know
obviously<00:05:50.070> there's<00:05:50.430> a<00:05:50.490> huge<00:05:50.790> amount<00:05:50.820> if<00:05:51.270> if<00:05:51.570> if

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
obviously there's a huge amount if if if

obviously there's a huge amount if if if
if<00:05:52.080> if<00:05:52.229> if<00:05:52.440> so<00:05:53.400> you<00:05:53.850> know<00:05:53.970> obviously<00:05:54.120> the<00:05:54.600> it's

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
if if if so you know obviously the it's

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.030 
if if if so you know obviously the it's
not<00:05:54.960> like<00:05:55.050> they<00:05:55.140> have<00:05:55.229> no<00:05:55.410> chance<00:05:55.440> but<00:05:55.860> you

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
not like they have no chance but you

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.310 
not like they have no chance but you
know<00:05:56.160> I<00:05:56.310> it's<00:05:57.030> highly<00:05:57.300> unlikely<00:05:57.450> I<00:05:58.020> want<00:05:58.290> a

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
know I it's highly unlikely I want a

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.870 
know I it's highly unlikely I want a
stellar<00:05:58.500> player<00:05:58.710> makes<00:05:58.950> a<00:05:59.040> huge<00:05:59.340> blunder

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.580 

anyway<00:06:02.880> it<00:06:02.940> looks<00:06:03.000> like<00:06:03.390> minds<00:06:03.990> even<00:06:04.140> for

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
anyway it looks like minds even for

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.440 
anyway it looks like minds even for
fantasy<00:06:05.220> so<00:06:05.370> that's<00:06:05.490> going<00:06:05.610> to<00:06:05.669> further<00:06:06.000> delay

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
fantasy so that's going to further delay

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.510 
fantasy so that's going to further delay
any<00:06:06.750> kind<00:06:07.080> of<00:06:07.169> expansion<00:06:07.650> tent<00:06:07.890> and<00:06:08.040> these<00:06:08.190> two

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
any kind of expansion tent and these two

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.800 
any kind of expansion tent and these two
dragoons<00:06:08.850> are<00:06:09.060> gonna<00:06:09.180> have<00:06:09.270> to<00:06:09.330> do<00:06:09.419> a<00:06:09.450> ton<00:06:09.780> of

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
dragoons are gonna have to do a ton of

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.490 
dragoons are gonna have to do a ton of
damage<00:06:10.970> for<00:06:11.970> forced<00:06:12.419> or<00:06:12.510> to<00:06:12.630> do<00:06:12.780> anything<00:06:13.290> at

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
damage for forced or to do anything at

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.170 
damage for forced or to do anything at
this<00:06:13.590> point<00:06:13.680> alright<00:06:14.490> so<00:06:14.640> they<00:06:14.760> have<00:06:14.910> gotten

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
this point alright so they have gotten

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.600 
this point alright so they have gotten
into<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.510> natural<00:06:15.690> fancy<00:06:16.470> spots<00:06:16.800> them<00:06:17.070> he

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
into the natural fancy spots them he

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.850 
into the natural fancy spots them he
probably<00:06:17.940> can<00:06:18.240> just<00:06:18.450> online<00:06:18.630> use<00:06:19.500> vulture

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
probably can just online use vulture

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.800 
probably can just online use vulture
minds<00:06:20.070> to<00:06:20.160> get<00:06:20.280> out<00:06:20.370> of<00:06:20.400> it<00:06:20.610> but<00:06:20.880> uh<00:06:20.940> he<00:06:21.660> might

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
minds to get out of it but uh he might

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.240 
minds to get out of it but uh he might
be<00:06:21.930> forced<00:06:22.110> to<00:06:22.229> cancel<00:06:22.380> his<00:06:22.620> command<00:06:22.979> center

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
be forced to cancel his command center

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.640 
be forced to cancel his command center
that<00:06:23.880> would<00:06:24.000> be<00:06:24.120> a<00:06:24.150> big<00:06:24.390> win<00:06:24.960> for<00:06:25.229> stork

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
that would be a big win for stork

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.300 
that would be a big win for stork
certainly<00:06:26.870> forcing<00:06:27.870> a<00:06:27.930> cancel<00:06:28.380> but<00:06:28.590> we're

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
certainly forcing a cancel but we're

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.240 
certainly forcing a cancel but we're
going<00:06:29.430> to<00:06:29.490> see<00:06:29.640> oh<00:06:29.789> man<00:06:30.180> stork<00:06:30.599> oh<00:06:30.720> no<00:06:31.530> brutal

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
going to see oh man stork oh no brutal

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.540 
going to see oh man stork oh no brutal

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
there

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.360 
there
like<00:06:33.180> I<00:06:33.270> said<00:06:33.330> stork<00:06:34.050> oh<00:06:34.260> just<00:06:34.620> unable<00:06:34.830> to<00:06:35.190> pick

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
like I said stork oh just unable to pick

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.860 
like I said stork oh just unable to pick
up<00:06:35.400> his<00:06:35.700> own<00:06:35.910> natural<00:06:36.390> because<00:06:36.540> of<00:06:36.780> those

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
up his own natural because of those

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.900 
up his own natural because of those
minds<00:06:37.410> now<00:06:37.560> he<00:06:37.620> loses<00:06:38.040> a<00:06:38.070> number<00:06:38.280> of<00:06:38.370> units<00:06:38.670> and

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
minds now he loses a number of units and

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:41.330 
minds now he loses a number of units and
gets<00:06:39.210> a<00:06:39.360> lot<00:06:39.480> of<00:06:39.540> damage<00:06:40.170> he<00:06:40.470> has<00:06:40.770> managed<00:06:41.310> to

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
gets a lot of damage he has managed to

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.550 
gets a lot of damage he has managed to
force<00:06:41.730> the<00:06:42.450> cancellation<00:06:43.080> though<00:06:43.200> of<00:06:43.410> the

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
force the cancellation though of the

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.460 
force the cancellation though of the
command<00:06:44.220> center<00:06:44.540> I<00:06:45.540> still<00:06:45.990> wouldn't<00:06:46.170> say<00:06:46.320> it

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
command center I still wouldn't say it

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.440 
command center I still wouldn't say it
resets<00:06:46.890> the<00:06:47.040> game<00:06:47.220> at<00:06:47.340> all<00:06:47.490> because<00:06:48.090> obviously

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:48.450 
resets the game at all because obviously

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.680 
resets the game at all because obviously
the<00:06:48.720> turn<00:06:49.340> did<00:06:50.340> not<00:06:50.490> go<00:06:50.760> for<00:06:50.940> a<00:06:50.970> fast<00:06:51.270> expand

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
the turn did not go for a fast expand

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.630 
the turn did not go for a fast expand
and<00:06:51.990> has<00:06:52.140> therefore<00:06:52.650> more<00:06:53.070> you<00:06:53.220> know<00:06:53.280> two<00:06:53.370> more

and has therefore more you know two more

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.560 
and has therefore more you know two more
tech<00:06:53.940> generally<00:06:54.630> speaking<00:06:55.940> yeah<00:06:56.940> he<00:06:57.240> has<00:06:57.330> this

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
tech generally speaking yeah he has this

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.960 
tech generally speaking yeah he has this
tack<00:06:57.810> here<00:06:57.990> he<00:06:58.200> has<00:06:58.320> those<00:06:58.590> minds<00:06:59.040> but<00:06:59.550> he<00:06:59.880> is

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
tack here he has those minds but he is
