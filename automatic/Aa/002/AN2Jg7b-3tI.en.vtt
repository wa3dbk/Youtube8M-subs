00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.160

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.849
 it chops but today I tell you 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.609
 I will open the recipe how to make chops 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:20.490
 juicy and soft and appetizing for 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.800
 this we need the usual meat 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.230
 pork 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.830
 soy sauce vegetable oil salt 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.060
 pepper 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.050
 one egg and flour so let's get started and then I 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.969
 already repulsed means we will scream 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.809
 steel a little bit to put there meat we 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.079
 put 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.320
 salt you can pour in on your 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.340
 taste is like an amateur what's next we 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.570
 do we water this whole meat 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.420
 soy sauce 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.129
 honestly of course not very helpful when 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:03.020
 frequent use of it but if you 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.960
 want to make with 11 more piquant them 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.670
 not exquisite then its very good 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.790
 use in very very good 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.580
 places the meat we get from the model 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.180
 every piece he even slightly change 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.370
 after while we shoot them down i 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.840
 I'll put up a griddle and 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.870
 added infidelity and carefully butter 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:35.210
 must be very well warmed up so 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:39.619
 what do we do next add here 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.070
 a little salt or friend dough meat you 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.330
 You can also pepper but it's an amateur 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:53.660
 pits above them for baked moment 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:56.390
 so I add only to call that we 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.180
 we do continue to wait until our 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.130
 the carate griddle is not 0 eaten before 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:07.729
 a bit of warming up to make it faster 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:12.770
 then first we we first dip 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.410
 meat is very important not to leave on 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.890
 very good review on fine so as not 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.580
 was to live them over then we are to face and 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.580
 put in the pan 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.040
 when we put the meat in the pan 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.340
 First let it be a big fire and 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.490
 then we make her not so she 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.070
 burned and fried on each side 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.390
 Well, yes, the red crust if in time 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.540
 about two minutes 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.400
 on one side two minutes on the second 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.980
 the parties then explain are fried 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.250
 I turned over the object I need to cover 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.840
 even more cover to do 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.570
 minimum fire and put another on 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.550
 a few seconds in the meantime while 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:04.880
 I am roasted from guilt I have already started 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:07.880
 cut salad open so small 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.870
 secret ordinary break their fighters 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.180
 and cabbage on and green onions and to 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.430
 make it more naughty and delicious 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.580
 you can add a little manasarovar 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.400
 syrup from this, he gets up even more 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.490
 delicious and very very unusual on 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.700
 taste and for those who love it and you can 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.270
 even add a few more pieces 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.850
 laminate is not just one syrup but it is 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.220
 very much on the amateur knife combination cucumbers 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.850
 diagnosis is very very tasty with your fingers 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.380
 several pieces can be added here 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.870
 get a very exotic taste on 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.240
 machine but surely understand the syrup yet 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.520
 need to add vegetable oil. 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.620
 usually plant for our individual 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:59.970
 look how appetizing they are 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.970
 how soft they are beautiful 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.840
 all add more salad sell that 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.900
 chops are very cool so that the books 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.790
 combines almost any side dish but I 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.930
 most certainly love this one 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:22.049
