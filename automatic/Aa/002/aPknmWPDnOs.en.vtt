 chubby because it's hot and I 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.660
 I'm burning my hand here because 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.160
 we are here in the kitchen 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.990
 today for many years doing 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.390
 these fat ones of the loteo I play that a 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.640
 occasion I came with dad here and he said 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.829
 here we stop because it smells like it smells 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.020
 tasty and they were the hotel guards and 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.079
 we have 27 years of being here in the 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.730
 road 27 years to see talk me which 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.620
 is the preparation because I know it is 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 different from those done there in 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.329
 santiago you put another 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.239
 formula is not the same the same is what 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.440
 same is the batch butter sugar and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.980
 egg but they prepare them well in the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.980
 in what is here the doing the steels 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.250
 true in steel so it's 10 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.560
 we go down based on heat previously 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.409
 they put on the steel above they put the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.510
 embers up and down but we already 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.320
 we had finished the field in so many years 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.479
 to get wood and hear but warm the 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.200
 cover to be able to curdle 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.110
 so that it is time to leave the mixture and 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.000
 time to flip the yaya than the joke 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.160
 everything is also the butter that carries 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.960
 do not 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.900
 previously it was with butter or 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.060
 thick butter but scream regularly 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.960
 people no longer consume it that is the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.430
 difference that there has been in the recipe in 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.039
 reality is now butter and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.680
 previously it was butter of iu sewed 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.500
 very fast and already being very hot 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.990
 the steels in 15 to 20 minutes every 15 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.479
 20 minutes really doing a lot of fat 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.280
 and above all or iron friend but we 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.350
 we spent more here for the kitchen 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.870
 because the guards have their point 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.170
 and other 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.690

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.290
 it's something very special we have for 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.050
 start what is the classic pout 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:16.319
 truth with a lot of vegetables like that is puchero 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:19.620
 beef broth as we call it here 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.069
 there is roast pork stewed of nets 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.549
 chilli stuffed pumpkin with meat 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.269

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.739

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.569

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:57.000
 you choose the right size, because 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.280
 worth it because there are times 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.469
 who asks for some stuffed chiles and they give 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.079
 a little something like that and they have a 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:06.000
