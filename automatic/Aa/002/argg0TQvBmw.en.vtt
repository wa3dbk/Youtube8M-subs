00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.830
 In this issue I will tell you how to people who 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:21.910
 don't know how to draw fast 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:25.869
 learn how to draw here since 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:29.500
 practically people can't draw 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.300
 know how to draw a formula 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.629
 the only thing they do well is 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.470
 encircle the finished shape but its 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.830
 need to see 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:42.489
 But how can he see her if she is not there? 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.860
 here is this one here is a way of drawing it 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.780
 good and especially show like children 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.260
 draw and so on pretty simple but 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.950
 and adults can also learn that for 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.739
 this is necessary 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.520
 lamp table pen object itself 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:01.590
 which we want to draw 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.740
 for example if we bring a paper object 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.020
 then we will see it on paper is all that 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.320
 we are left well, naturally 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:16.000
 secure it not to hold it 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.899
 take a circle around it because we see 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.740
 how is it drawn 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:26.170
 guilt he already has on paper circle it 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:29.039
 and so we get the value of 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.679
 projection here this is a brick 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.899
 and it is pretty accurate even 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:39.970
 if i do anyway 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:42.130
 it turns out that's a perfect accuracy and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.470
 This copy checks can draw in different 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.649
 projections in different here in such here 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.149
 look showed here 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.630
 child is especially interesting to give 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.209
 adult see so we can 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.280
 teach him just tell you what 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.110
 such a projection 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.590
 that is, here here so here 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.459
 tilted eat show it on 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.649
 scissors here scissors 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.560
 we can have them like this 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.650
 straight and can be depicted with 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.890
 turning in the projection showed how it 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:25.290
 what happens is 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.290
 Here we have a projection so goes 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:38.700
 so so the authors naturally already behind these 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:44.380
 scissors for this pen 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:47.739
 This is how we understand that 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.230
 one pen tick on 2 understandable 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.230
 projections can be drawn practically 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.800
 any subjects but the most interesting is that 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.930
 we can draw them in different kinds and 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.880
 increases on a different scale i.e. he 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.970
 maybe a little one to one 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.420
 and perhaps that is extremely large 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.690
 simple way and for both children and 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.690
 adults
