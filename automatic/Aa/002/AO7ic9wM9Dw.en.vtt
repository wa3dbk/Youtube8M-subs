00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.520
 of looting the biggest shark I ever caught was a white shark over 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.640
 one thousand kilos 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.760
 there are also more than a thousand kilos and in 83 in Spain this boat reminds me of 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.689
 old wooden shark the radio barely works 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.659
 I do not know if we will arrive 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.669
 if they want to catch a shark they will need bait 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.789
 it's called umbrella is a rig that has different in duels basically 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.529
 yes four of them have hooks and the others are just to bring us to 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.909
 bring them before each one 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.050
 These umbrella-shaped rigs are used to fish the garlic 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.770
 will serve as bait the sharks has applied the law 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.179
 I had not realized 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.120
 they soon have all the issues they need 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.880
 we are at the top 4 so we also have a good day 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.720
 they keep alive at the time more on the deck of the ship but not for long 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.090
 time love is already great well done the mission accomplished 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.150
 in the hole 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.050
 I am here we are in the middle of nowhere 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.440
 the territory of sharks 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.369
 this appetizing puppies is called food bucket 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.270
 is full of homemade recipes of various parts of fish and viscera and 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.270
 dives into the water to attract sharks 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.360
 then marc 1-2 throws pieces of fish overboard to open the 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.150
 Appetite of sharks 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.550
 I saw a little more viscera 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.250
 marc I do not look 1 tells you if what happens when the sharks appear 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.860
 according to when I piqued that rod it will fly and if it tries to get away from you 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.140
 you have to throw repeatedly with short strokes and it's gasquet and so 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.280
 will nail the hook and from there we will have the instructions 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.380
 finally the moment comes when the young woman met her creator 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.380
 7 sushi for sharks 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.210
 good fillet of jÃ³dar 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.900
 aldaketa the shark food erario 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.320
 the blue sharks like them a lot 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.090
 instead of using the heavy civilian traditional equipment uses a cane 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.830
 light throw that has taken with him 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.830
 well then he left it sunken until he does not see it 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.019
 it is already 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.659
 this is how shark fishing once the bait is in the water there is no 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.599
 much more to do apart from enjoying the landscape 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.599
 the birds the works and that's it 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.719
 they begin to see fins on the surface but they are not sharks they are 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.719
 only dolphins that come attracted by the viscera 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.969
 something is going to happen 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:36.159
 audi markham minced voucher 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.649
 let's go to many other 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:42.649
 Judge 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.020
 thanks to that today is that 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.659
 nothing is done until the song is sung 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.550
 this cane weighs a lot 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.879
 whatever it is is great 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.969
 goes on and wonders what kind of shark will have a maroon rod 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.499
 altaria true good not necessarily not always I have caught many mako 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:05.359
 that looked like blue sharks do not know until the last moment 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.309
 again since the test should get him a little Tuesday a little later 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:12.139
 valero agreement for it 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.369
 the secret is to work as a team the captain of one's captain is in the 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.589
 part of the front ruling the ship to keep the sharks in the 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:20.599
 back side 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.650
 by the way I'm going from one side of the boat to the other to try to keep it 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.700
 away from the hull and the elites so that it does not break and is done for 20 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.700
 years 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.069
 the good place very well is in a good position 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.469
 after that it's sharks in wool directors and the global 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.159
 as 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.179
 let's go let's go let's go let's go come on 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:49.529
 the letter is discarded 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:54.539
 percent twenty minutes later they see the shark for the first time 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:59.019
 the blue shark project is settled at least 70 kilos the closer to 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.339
 the shark lights stronger fighting angels moving is prepared 

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:04.469
 still of 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.059
 determinant aida 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.059
 and in the terminal 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.939
 all that line has disappeared 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.939
 - the race 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:17.559
 this thing does not want to give up 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:23.059

 that's 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:27.939
 nothing 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:30.939
 very well goes on like this 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.309
 one of these guarantees 

00:04:35.309 --> 00:04:38.719
 This title is tired but it is clear that I too 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.029
 is already coming to the bass lines 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:43.840
 is near 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.770
 After 30 minutes of civil war finally manages to raise the shark on deck 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.210
