00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello girls welcome to make a put 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.230
 how are you I hope that very well today 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.730
 I have a video that you asked me 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.150
 I've been asking for a while 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.330
 to start a video from scratch so that 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.609
 see my routine and this is a video 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.949
 great for those who want something 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.650
 super natural where you do not want to take 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.439
 a lot and maybe if they think they are 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.660
 Many products believe me that the more 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.609
 practice it and do it daily more 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.369
 the attention to do and this in five 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.860
 Minutitos are not going to have as much of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.850
 this depends on your speed so I hope 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.489
 you enjoy this video 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.609
 you're going to start with a test of 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.640
 makeup this is to make you last longer 

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:48.789
 time in makeup and you can also 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.800
 give you extra lighting even if 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.530
 you have very beautiful skin you can use 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.979
 only the prebase now let's use 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:01.089
 the makeup this has a coverage 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:03.010
 medium and complete but if you have a skin 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.830
 without imperfections you can use a 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.869
 bicrim a physical or simply to your 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.440
 makeup you can add a cream 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:14.080
 moisturizer to make it lighter and not 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.319
 have as much coverage what we want is 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.869
 that the makeup looks like it's 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.479
 A skin 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.350
 simply illuminated very natural as 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.940
 you can see here now for my dark circles 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.440
 I need a correct card 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.710
 I apply in the form of a triangle 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.630
 illuminating indoor and not apply in 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.010
 outside parties where we have more the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.230
 wrinkles in the eyes 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.310
 Then I want a very natural look 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:44.430
 and I want to give more color to my eyebrows 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.130
 to apply a gel 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.050
 very simple is just me 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.810
 giving more color to my eyebrows in the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.730
 is defining how you can see here is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.220
 just another trick that we can 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.460
 use later is the test I know of 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.800
 eyes so that shadow lasts all the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.780
 day and although we are going to use very little 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.550
 product in the eyes we want it to be 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.490
 keep there and that the 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.810
 lines of fat or product in the 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.030
 eyelid after we will use a 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.220
 bronzer is something very light 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.430
 we're just going to go over the basin 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.580
 of the eye and ready nothing more to give 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.890
 dimension to that eyelid and that looks more 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.250
 jovial then let's use a 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.200
 down to outline and this is pegadito 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.200
 to the eyelashes apologizing what I 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.140
 hit so much that you blur it but it's 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.959
 attached to the eyelashes let them assure you and 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.420
 then with a mascara we're just going to 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.830
 give volume to those tabs so that 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.230
 open your eyes more 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.100
 again we have been using our 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.620
 bronzer duo with a little blush this 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.080
 sorry with a little bronzer and what 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.330
 let's do in the form of 3 nothing else 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.870
 to define the face in a very 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.690
 subtle and then we go with the blush in 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.300
 the cheeks on the apples to give 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.100
 color never forget to apply something 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.800
 of color in the cheeks so that we do not 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:16.450
 let's see flat all the couples after 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.390
 finally a lipstick in tone like coffee 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.300
 milestone coral to lift and color 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.209
 to our skin and also combines with the 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.880
 blush that we applied previously is a 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:32.970
 look super simple natural good that we 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.970
 Makes you look pretty for our day 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.269
 Well guys, it's that simple 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.459
 you can fix there are no pretexts and 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.750
 You have dark circles if you have something of 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.459
 spots on the skin 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.519
 everything can be arranged and you can look 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.489
 super pretty with very healthy skin 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.129
 and look very natural that what 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.230
 I love it because your skin comes out 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.629
 You hope that you too have 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.700
