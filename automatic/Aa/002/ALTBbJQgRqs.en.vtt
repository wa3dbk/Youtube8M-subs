00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.370

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.730
 subscribers of the pokemon life of 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:15.500

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.500
 play against for one more ay ay ay 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.210
 and good to see this is going to be in principle 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.369
 pretty simple has two onix 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.410
 come back here is the first one and I'm going to 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.630
 put tour 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.730
 and this one is already in place 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 selected and you're comfortable and now 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.329
 comes the strategic part that we 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.010
 they would remove they wanted to edit because the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.129
 flying attacks as it makes the little 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.050
 fight all that but not because he has 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.120
 certain moment called tombs rocks that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.989
 how it catches me land it's going to sit 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.770
 like a kick in the ass so better 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.420
 stop what we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.579
 plan the defense 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.350
 with mairena and when I can not upload more 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.600
 and it is more then we would be tour is already 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.370
 in a matter of spam what is employed 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.369
 in the ethical code what is changing the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.630
 call of duty but but here in mega plan 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:13.330
 there's the high hook that pupa here you have to 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:18.340
 I was today another no please someone 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:21.820
 fear ay ay what a shame they are dead 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:35.440
 at the time 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:38.760
 and that's how he sees there as little surf 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.470
 You have to leave tranquilito 3 calm 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.600
 Well this is the one I care about 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.850
 everyone 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.979
 because the male is the strongest that 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.770
 has bruno because with one arm he takes you 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.180
 of the neck with the other of the hair and with 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.440

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.659

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.159
 coach 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.159
 but it looks like it's going to be 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.050
 pretty simple we have not raised the 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.020
 butt defense but let's go 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.000

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.000

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.400

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:27.300
 they get bored and it's me I do not like that 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.300
 this time as if you want can be better 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.740

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.100
