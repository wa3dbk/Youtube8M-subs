00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
jellyfish is clear you see right through

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.420 
jellyfish is clear you see right through
it<00:00:16.850> and<00:00:17.180> you<00:00:17.960> only<00:00:18.170> really<00:00:18.530> notice<00:00:19.010> it<00:00:19.130> by<00:00:19.370> the

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
it and you only really notice it by the

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.270 
it and you only really notice it by the
distortions<00:00:20.330> it<00:00:20.690> makes<00:00:21.050> in<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:21.380> water<00:00:22.010> and

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:22.280 
distortions it makes in the water and

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.860 
distortions it makes in the water and
the<00:00:22.550> water<00:00:22.700> being<00:00:23.030> distorted<00:00:23.360> as<00:00:23.600> it<00:00:23.750> is

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:23.870 
the water being distorted as it is

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.800 
the water being distorted as it is
anyway<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:24.470> like<00:00:24.680> perfectly<00:00:25.130> camouflage

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
anyway so it's like perfectly camouflage

anywhere from a foot to two feet long
and<00:00:40.360> what<00:00:41.360> really<00:00:41.540> sucks<00:00:41.660> about<00:00:42.140> these<00:00:42.470> box

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
and what really sucks about these box

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.100 
and what really sucks about these box
jellyfish<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:44.360> they<00:00:44.540> are<00:00:44.600> like<00:00:44.899> one<00:00:45.079> of

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
jellyfish is that they are like one of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.799 
jellyfish is that they are like one of
the<00:00:45.320> most<00:00:45.530> poisonous<00:00:46.100> jellyfish<00:00:46.970> on<00:00:47.300> the

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
the most poisonous jellyfish on the

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.580 
the most poisonous jellyfish on the
planet<00:00:48.470> they're<00:00:49.309> all<00:00:50.180> over<00:00:50.540> Southeast<00:00:51.200> Asia

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
planet they're all over Southeast Asia

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.100 
planet they're all over Southeast Asia
not<00:00:52.130> just<00:00:52.399> Philippines<00:00:52.940> there<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:53.540> Thailand

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
not just Philippines there in Thailand

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.650 
not just Philippines there in Thailand
Cambodia<00:00:54.640> they're<00:00:55.640> all<00:00:55.790> over<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.239> place<00:00:56.270> out

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
Cambodia they're all over the place out

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.310 
Cambodia they're all over the place out
here<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.969> problem<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.690> again<00:00:59.989> I<00:01:00.020> can't

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
here and the problem and again I can't

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.760 
here and the problem and again I can't
remember<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:00.739> think<00:01:01.040> it's<00:01:01.219> right<00:01:02.000> around<00:01:02.180> what

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
remember I think it's right around what

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.090 
remember I think it's right around what
January<00:01:03.770> through<00:01:04.540> through<00:01:05.540> may<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:06.170> believe<00:01:06.889> is

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
January through through may I believe is

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.370 
January through through may I believe is
their<00:01:07.310> season<00:01:07.939> when<00:01:08.090> they're<00:01:08.270> most<00:01:08.539> in<00:01:09.229> the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
their season when they're most in the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.050 
their season when they're most in the
shallow<00:01:09.619> waters<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.520> rest<00:01:10.700> of<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.909> year

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
shallow waters the rest of the year

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.340 
shallow waters the rest of the year
they're<00:01:11.329> little<00:01:11.659> further<00:01:11.929> out<00:01:12.369> but<00:01:14.139> the<00:01:15.139> thing

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
they're little further out but the thing

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.569 
they're little further out but the thing
with<00:01:15.530> those<00:01:15.799> is<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:18.380> insane<00:01:18.920> they<00:01:19.189> get<00:01:19.340> their

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:19.579 
with those is it's insane they get their

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.809 
with those is it's insane they get their
tentacles<00:01:20.029> on<00:01:20.389> you<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.369> that's<00:01:22.369> it<00:01:22.609> you're

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
and the pictures are really gruesome the

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.159 
and the pictures are really gruesome the
pain<00:01:43.279> is<00:01:43.639> so<00:01:44.569> intense<00:01:44.599> that<00:01:45.669> it<00:01:46.990> pretty<00:01:47.990> much

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:48.169 
pain is so intense that it pretty much

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:51.550 
pain is so intense that it pretty much
paralyzes<00:01:48.950> you<00:01:49.099> and<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:50.539> if<00:01:51.049> you<00:01:51.200> have<00:01:51.529> a

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
paralyzes you and and if you have a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.659 
paralyzes you and and if you have a
heart<00:01:51.919> condition<00:01:52.359> it's<00:01:53.359> really<00:01:53.959> an<00:01:54.079> issue

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:54.669 
heart condition it's really an issue

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:57.449 
heart condition it's really an issue
these<00:01:55.669> things<00:01:55.999> apparently<00:01:56.450> are<00:01:56.929> just

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
these things apparently are just

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.629 
these things apparently are just
incredibly<00:01:58.459> insanely<00:01:59.450> painful<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:01.069> encounter

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
incredibly insanely painful to encounter

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:06.190 
incredibly insanely painful to encounter
so<00:02:02.569> I<00:02:04.060> when<00:02:05.060> I<00:02:05.090> go<00:02:05.299> to<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.509> beach<00:02:05.719> and<00:02:06.079> I'm

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
so I when I go to the beach and I'm

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.219 
so I when I go to the beach and I'm
their<00:02:06.499> time<00:02:06.799> in<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.069> water<00:02:07.690> I'm<00:02:08.690> not<00:02:08.929> just

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
their time in the water I'm not just

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.250 
their time in the water I'm not just
splashing<00:02:09.709> around<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.520> being<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.630> total<00:02:11.840> nut

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
splashing around and being a total nut

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.830 
splashing around and being a total nut
I'm<00:02:13.190> kind<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.700> keeping<00:02:13.820> an<00:02:14.120> eye<00:02:14.270> out<00:02:14.300> for<00:02:14.780> these

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
I'm kind of keeping an eye out for these

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.130 
I'm kind of keeping an eye out for these
box<00:02:15.110> jellyfish

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
box jellyfish

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.650 
box jellyfish
now<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.440> chances<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:16.980> running<00:02:17.190> into<00:02:17.430> one<00:02:17.819> yeah

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
now the chances of running into one yeah

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.840 
now the chances of running into one yeah
maybe<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.350> low<00:02:19.650> maybe<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.610> better

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
maybe it's low maybe I have a better

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.580 
maybe it's low maybe I have a better
