00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.220

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.020
 years 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.610
 by the way and myanmar are like being in 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.790
 the kitchen 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.060
 I think I'm pretty normal as if I do not 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.140
 you will listen not also channel once 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.140
 exactly that 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.460
 do not even make a laredo egg break 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.670
 with great force they do not remove me please 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.310
 teach me 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.310
 and it's fine I think 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.830
 so 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.580
 and only mister bears you're fine if I'm 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.770
 well or if you knew the reason for that 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.530
 the segob this lady is because it irritates the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.420
 membrane in the nose not the eyes 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.870
 yes I heard it would be helpful if this 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.870
 person says 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.260
 tell me 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.860
 naturally 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.569
 that smells really good and then it seems that 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.879
 he is in charge of cooking in our 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.530
 group that you feel about having a 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:03.180
 Man cook is great but I already 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.030
 I would like a girl to cook for you 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.040
 it's not true that he had never happened 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.799
 of course that last line was not 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.170
 necessary so obviously it works 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.519
 also the reverse we man keeps 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.599
 question of a girl true girls 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.829
 so if I give you prepared lunch 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:25.110
 for me you lived that you do not call me 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.260
 unpleasant then that speaks 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.440
 pretty average damn average 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.840
 they call me 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.840
 for the flame you could not pass the wine 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.800
 white and red 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.810
 how do you make the flan 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.040
 the aroma is added to the dish and also 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.040
 to cover the smell of meat 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:01.810
 lightning is no longer a little bad no 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.810
 sacristan you're trying to suggest 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.030
 let's burn and so we will 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.130
 turn on the gas 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.310
 It is clear that I can not be turned on 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:18.120
 he seems to have a lot of fun there says 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.650
 have for her with some truth in 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.650
 your mansion and you're sure of what 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.040
 guys who are doing must be done 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.960
 spacious crack during the blood draw 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.680
 the air needs to throw the hamburger 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.680
 from top to bottom 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.000
 I have an idea 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.830
 for that I have the hamburgers of 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 someone who knows spins as strong as 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.350
 Fire to learn what you are saying no 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.230
 no one has food that way 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.680
 when I returned the crankcase glove already 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.480
 is perfection worn or something like that 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.800
 if that happens for sure they squeezed a 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.800
 increase in that catch
