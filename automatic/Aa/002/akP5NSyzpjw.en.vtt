both<00:00:02.220> being<00:00:02.520> HP<00:00:04.100> g63

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.390 

it's<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.639> G<00:00:11.969> 62<00:00:12.660> anyway<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.590> important<00:00:14.099> thing

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
it's a G 62 anyway the important thing

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.349 
it's a G 62 anyway the important thing
is<00:00:14.809> this<00:00:15.859> battery<00:00:16.859> here<00:00:17.250> that's<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.940> CMOS

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
is this battery here that's the CMOS

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.120 
is this battery here that's the CMOS
battery<00:00:20.900> maybe<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.990> can<00:00:22.109> see<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.350> better<00:00:22.560> now

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.920 

kind<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.189> nicely<00:00:26.369> made<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.970> old-style<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.869> you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
kind of nicely made it old-style and you

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.419 
kind of nicely made it old-style and you
can<00:00:28.109> just<00:00:28.230> pop<00:00:28.410> it<00:00:28.590> out<00:00:28.680> without<00:00:28.920> having<00:00:29.189> only

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
can just pop it out without having only

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.429 
can just pop it out without having only
to<00:00:29.640> reach<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.300> around<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.900> get<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.109> plug

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
to reach it around and get a plug

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.410 
to reach it around and get a plug
because<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.769> always<00:00:31.949> know<00:00:32.279> how<00:00:32.520> they<00:00:32.790> like<00:00:33.390> to

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
because you always know how they like to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.490 
because you always know how they like to
fail<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.890> let's<00:00:35.460> memory<00:00:36.030> that's<00:00:36.870> your<00:00:37.110> Wi-Fi

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
fail and let's memory that's your Wi-Fi

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.590 
fail and let's memory that's your Wi-Fi

card that's speaks with a triangle thing
here<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.079> your<00:00:43.290> hard<00:00:43.530> drive<00:00:47.030> extra<00:00:48.030> space<00:00:48.390> in

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
here is your hard drive extra space in

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.979 
here is your hard drive extra space in
here<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.020> something<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.719> hook<00:00:51.870> up

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
here for something and you can hook up

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.970 
here for something and you can hook up
another<00:00:52.230> hard<00:00:52.559> drive<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:57.079> so<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.379> am<00:00:58.649> going

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
another hard drive on this so I am going

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.880 
another hard drive on this so I am going
to<00:00:59.070> pop<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.469> somehow

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.030 

just<00:01:08.550> like<00:01:08.760> that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:58.250 

I<00:01:14.190> can<00:01:15.190> unplug

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.219 

there's<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.560> circuit<00:02:00.010> now<00:02:00.930> we'll<00:02:01.930> leave<00:02:02.080> it

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
there's the circuit now we'll leave it

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.930 
there's the circuit now we'll leave it
sit<00:02:02.440> for<00:02:02.470> 30<00:02:02.680> minutes<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.400> see<00:02:03.550> if<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.729> boots

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
sit for 30 minutes and see if it boots

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.639 
sit for 30 minutes and see if it boots
Linux<00:02:04.420> again<00:02:05.520> never<00:02:06.520> seen<00:02:06.790> that<00:02:06.880> before
