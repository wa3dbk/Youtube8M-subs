many<00:00:02.070> people<00:00:02.460> think<00:00:02.700> that<00:00:02.909> just<00:00:03.179> because

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
many people think that just because

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.450 
many people think that just because
they're<00:00:03.780> near<00:00:03.959> someone<00:00:04.410> that<00:00:04.560> has<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.740> cold<00:00:05.190> or

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
they're near someone that has a cold or

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.130 
they're near someone that has a cold or
a<00:00:05.520> touch<00:00:05.819> so<00:00:06.000> long<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.330> person<00:00:06.899> touched

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
a touch so long that that person touched

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.190 
a touch so long that that person touched
they're<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:07.980> get<00:00:08.099> sick<00:00:08.719> the<00:00:09.719> fact<00:00:09.960> is

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
they're going to get sick the fact is

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.200 
they're going to get sick the fact is
that<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.500> common<00:00:10.860> cold<00:00:11.070> virus<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.730> costly

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
that the common cold virus is costly

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.700 
that the common cold virus is costly
around<00:00:12.480> us<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.080> only<00:00:13.139> reason<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.530> we

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
around us and the only reason that we

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.049 
around us and the only reason that we
don't<00:00:13.920> get<00:00:14.099> sick<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.490> because<00:00:14.519> our<00:00:14.880> immune

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
don't get sick is because our immune

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.150 
don't get sick is because our immune
system<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.660> constantly<00:00:16.260> defending<00:00:16.710> us<00:00:16.890> and

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
system is constantly defending us and

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.250 
system is constantly defending us and
our<00:00:17.940> immune<00:00:18.060> system<00:00:18.449> slips<00:00:18.750> up<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:19.080> two<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
our immune system slips up for two the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.220 
our immune system slips up for two the
title<00:00:19.740> ii<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.609> could<00:00:21.029> mean<00:00:21.210> we<00:00:21.570> get<00:00:21.720> sick<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
title ii it could mean we get sick and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.050 
title ii it could mean we get sick and
some<00:00:22.650> very<00:00:22.920> bad<00:00:23.160> things<00:00:23.400> happening<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:23.970> we

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
some very bad things happening so we

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.589 
some very bad things happening so we
want<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.359> strong<00:00:24.689> immune<00:00:24.900> system<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:27.390> of

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
want a strong immune system and of

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.019 
want a strong immune system and of
course<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:28.170> our<00:00:28.260> muses<00:00:28.830> nose<00:00:28.980> gets<00:00:29.220> weak<00:00:29.730> it

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
course if our muses nose gets weak it

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.359 
course if our muses nose gets weak it
will<00:00:30.060> highly<00:00:30.810> increase<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.380> chance<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.890> a

cold the only cause of a infection in
the<00:01:06.420> sinus<00:01:06.720> area<00:01:06.869> but<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.100> huge

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the sinus area but it's a it's a huge

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.330 
the sinus area but it's a it's a huge
one<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:10.740> might<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.890> wondering<00:01:10.979> why<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
one now you might be wondering why the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.039 
one now you might be wondering why the
heck<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.549> even<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.909> sinuses<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> great

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
heck you even have sinuses it's a great

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.929 
heck you even have sinuses it's a great
question<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:14.100> reason<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.520> science<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
question the reason we have science is

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.469 
question the reason we have science is
because<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.479> makes<00:01:15.570> our<00:01:15.750> voice<00:01:16.020> louder<00:01:16.500> it

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
because it makes our voice louder it

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.149 
because it makes our voice louder it
reduces<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> way<00:01:18.689> overhead<00:01:18.960> which<00:01:19.590> might

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
reduces the way overhead which might

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.649 
reduces the way overhead which might
help<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.729> might<00:01:20.970> protect<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> brain<00:01:21.600> from

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
help but it might protect the brain from

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.570 
help but it might protect the brain from
injuries<00:01:22.229> because<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.650> space<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.280> there

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
injuries because like a space in there

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.179 
injuries because like a space in there
and<00:01:24.049> of<00:01:25.049> course<00:01:25.080> helps<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.680> smelling<00:01:25.950> as

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and of course helps with smelling as

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.480 
and of course helps with smelling as
well<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.520> breathing

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
well as with breathing

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.800 
well as with breathing
now<00:01:29.490> there's<00:01:29.729> blockage<00:01:30.240> harmful<00:01:30.720> bacteria

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
now there's blockage harmful bacteria

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.219 
now there's blockage harmful bacteria
will<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.590> trapped<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.570> create<00:01:33.570> an<00:01:33.720> infection

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
will get trapped and create an infection

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.630 
will get trapped and create an infection
it's<00:01:34.890> very<00:01:35.070> similar<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.549> pimple<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:36.810> in

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
it's very similar to a pimple see in

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.069 
it's very similar to a pimple see in
your<00:01:38.640> skin<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> thing<00:01:39.509> called<00:01:39.720> pores

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
your skin here is the thing called pores

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.310 
your skin here is the thing called pores
and<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.130> bit<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:42.049> bacteria<00:01:43.049> germs

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
and if a little bit of a bacteria germs

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.649 
and if a little bit of a bacteria germs
it<00:01:43.649> gets<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.159> stuck<00:01:44.399> in<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.640> pore<00:01:44.939> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
it gets kind of stuck in that pore it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.120 
it gets kind of stuck in that pore it
creates<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.200> pimple<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.890> like<00:01:47.009> this

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
creates this pimple which is like this

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.149 
creates this pimple which is like this
bump<00:01:47.460> comes<00:01:47.790> up<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:49.350> whole<00:01:49.530> redness<00:01:50.070> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
bump comes up and the whole redness of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.580 
bump comes up and the whole redness of
the<00:01:50.189> bump<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:50.850> inflammation<00:01:51.720> which

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the bump is all inflammation which

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.020 
the bump is all inflammation which
interestingly<00:01:52.860> enough<00:01:53.100> inflammation<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
interestingly enough inflammation is the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.780 
interestingly enough inflammation is the
main<00:01:54.299> cause<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.540> pain<00:01:54.930> with<00:01:55.140> arthritis<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.860> a
