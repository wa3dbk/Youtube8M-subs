in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> toes<00:01:35.340> they're<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:36.000> no<00:01:36.290> actual<00:01:37.290> toe

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
in the toes they're really no actual toe

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
in the toes they're really no actual toe
whatsoever<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.430> no<00:01:38.610> toenail<00:01:39.090> either<00:01:39.360> it's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
whatsoever it's no toenail either it's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.499 
whatsoever it's no toenail either it's
just<00:01:39.990> sort<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.610> sort<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.729> bulb<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> big

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
just sort of a sort of a bulb for a big

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
just sort of a sort of a bulb for a big
toe<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> little<00:01:43.740> bit<00:01:43.890> limited<00:01:44.250> there

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
toe so a little bit limited there

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.410 
toe so a little bit limited there
especially<00:01:44.700> when<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.850> look<00:01:44.970> at<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> level<00:01:45.329> of

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
especially when you look at the level of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.530 
especially when you look at the level of
detailing<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.170> get<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.540> Hulkbuster

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
detailing that you get in the Hulkbuster

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.499 
detailing that you get in the Hulkbuster
figure<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:49.020> well<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.649> even<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.070> Ultron<00:01:50.820> so

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
figure as well as even in Ultron so

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
figure as well as even in Ultron so
spinning<00:01:52.320> him<00:01:52.409> around<00:01:52.470> now<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> take<00:01:53.189> check

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
spinning him around now to take check

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.319 
spinning him around now to take check
out<00:01:53.520> his<00:01:53.640> back<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.180> they're

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
out his back you can see they're

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.760 
out his back you can see they're
basically<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> battery<00:01:55.020> slot<00:01:55.170> takes<00:01:55.560> two

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
basically the battery slot takes two

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.160 
basically the battery slot takes two
double-a<00:01:56.189> batteries<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:57.630> down<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:58.049> you've

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
double-a batteries and down there you've

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.550 
double-a batteries and down there you've
got<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> purple<00:01:58.590> pants<00:01:59.040> and<00:02:00.320> into<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> back

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
got the purple pants and into the back

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
got the purple pants and into the back
of<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> legs<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.159> all<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.369> calves<00:02:02.579> as

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
of the legs there see all the calves as

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.200 
of the legs there see all the calves as
I<00:02:03.630> said<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.259> he<00:02:04.320> stays<00:02:04.530> quite<00:02:04.770> well<00:02:05.030> you<00:02:06.030> can

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
I said so he stays quite well you can

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.749 
I said so he stays quite well you can
swivel<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.200> head<00:02:07.380> left<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.770> right<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.039> you

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
swivel the head left and right but you

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.550 
swivel the head left and right but you
are<00:02:08.910> pretty<00:02:09.030> limited<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.660> posing<00:02:10.080> in

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
are pretty limited in the posing in

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.780 
are pretty limited in the posing in
which<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.129> so<00:02:11.310> it's<00:02:11.430> pretty<00:02:11.550> much<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
which you can do so it's pretty much a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.180 
which you can do so it's pretty much a
basic<00:02:12.120> action<00:02:13.050> figure<00:02:13.319> toy<00:02:13.470> but

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
basic action figure toy but

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.560 
basic action figure toy but
probably<00:02:14.640> great<00:02:14.820> for<00:02:15.030> those<00:02:15.120> younger<00:02:15.360> ones

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
probably great for those younger ones

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.000 
probably great for those younger ones
who<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.470> manage<00:02:16.680> their<00:02:16.830> toys

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
who like to just manage their toys

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.040 
who like to just manage their toys
around<00:02:17.190> but<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.270> say<00:02:18.420> even<00:02:18.450> on<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> display

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
around but as I say even on the display

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.800 
around but as I say even on the display
piece<00:02:19.290> he's<00:02:19.560> not<00:02:19.710> too<00:02:19.860> bad<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:21.390> next<00:02:21.630> to<00:02:21.720> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
piece he's not too bad and next to the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.050 
piece he's not too bad and next to the
Hulkbuster<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.380> can<00:02:22.530> see<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.860> he<00:02:22.980> is

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
Hulkbuster you can see that he is

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.490 
Hulkbuster you can see that he is
genuinely<00:02:24.060> smaller<00:02:24.450> which<00:02:24.960> i<00:02:25.170> think<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.470> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
genuinely smaller which i think is a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.800 
genuinely smaller which i think is a
movie<00:02:25.980> accurate<00:02:26.130> probably<00:02:27.090> about<00:02:27.270> one<00:02:27.570> or<00:02:27.660> two

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
movie accurate probably about one or two

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.740 
movie accurate probably about one or two
inches<00:02:27.990> below<00:02:28.520> but<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> nice<00:02:30.060> comparison

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
inches below but is a nice comparison

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.200 
inches below but is a nice comparison
and<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.710> hold<00:02:32.250> him<00:02:32.400> behind<00:02:32.670> there<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.120> you

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
and I can hold him behind there so you

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.300 
and I can hold him behind there so you
can<00:02:33.360> see<00:02:33.540> him<00:02:33.750> basically<00:02:34.470> up<00:02:34.800> in<00:02:34.980> line<00:02:35.160> with

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
can see him basically up in line with

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.420 
can see him basically up in line with
sort<00:02:35.940> of<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.060> hulkbusters<00:02:36.600> chest<00:02:36.900> so<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:38.220> see

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
sort of a hulkbusters chest so to see

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.890 
sort of a hulkbusters chest so to see
there<00:02:38.670> you've<00:02:38.880> got<00:02:38.910> his<00:02:39.120> sense<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.600> sensor

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
there you've got his sense of the sensor

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.540 
there you've got his sense of the sensor
there<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.380> sort<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.040> front

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
there is in sort of like the the front

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.370 
there is in sort of like the the front
of<00:02:41.640> his<00:02:41.760> belt<00:02:42.000> if<00:02:42.510> he<00:02:42.690> wants<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.080> wearing<00:02:43.290> a

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
of his belt if he wants to be wearing a

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.560 
of his belt if he wants to be wearing a
belt<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.400> see<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.300> chest

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
belt and you can see the the chest

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.660 
belt and you can see the the chest
button<00:02:45.870> there<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> believe<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.190> works<00:02:47.400> by

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
button there so I believe this works by

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.870 
button there so I believe this works by
just<00:02:48.030> pushing<00:02:48.450> his<00:02:48.930> chest<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.790> pointing<00:02:50.790> him

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
just pushing his chest and pointing him

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.920 
just pushing his chest and pointing him
towards<00:02:51.180> Hulkbuster<00:02:56.330> say<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.630> there's<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
towards Hulkbuster say and there's the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:10.690 
towards Hulkbuster say and there's the
Hulkbuster<00:02:58.500> talking<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.430> oh<00:03:02.990> you<00:03:03.990> do<00:03:04.110> get<00:03:04.290> some

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.950 

so<00:03:11.700> there<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:11.910> go<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.330> works<00:03:12.780> quite

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
so there you go so that works quite

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.050 
so there you go so that works quite
nicely<00:03:13.050> with<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:14.310> Hulkbuster<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.000> I'd

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
nicely with the the Hulkbuster and I'd

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.460 
nicely with the the Hulkbuster and I'd
say<00:03:15.270> if<00:03:15.420> anything<00:03:15.630> there's<00:03:15.960> collectors<00:03:16.350> out

say if anything there's collectors out

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.930 
say if anything there's collectors out
there<00:03:16.560> or<00:03:16.830> just<00:03:16.860> even<00:03:17.100> film<00:03:17.400> fanatics<00:03:17.820> out

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.670 
there or just even film fanatics out
