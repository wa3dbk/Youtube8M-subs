00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.790
 still forty days to go before the start of the Olympic Games there 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.090
 Orange for nothing less than gold in addition, the Netherlands will be anyway 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.659
 have to peak 

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:13.659
 piquet did the team coach team despite his penalty area four 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.589
 matches were lost, the most important against Austria on Monday 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.730
 10 The Netherlands will already be in the group stage during the anticipation of Philip 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.859
 kooke from studio sport closely followed this tournament 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.670
 it was played in a random manner in May 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.839
 I like that 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.829
 Attacking very nice things from the very good place 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:31.640
 had 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.640
 he defends intent to have quit time there were some stitches dropped 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.540
 you don't know so well 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.420
 how strong we are the other teams who have acted the bosom how far they are in 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.020
 training structures in the west are conditional 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.030
 bah way of the dutch guys 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.140
 that in the last ten minutes almost every game as a goal against 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.010
 to get 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.210
 yes there you can see that they are not 100 percent fit but that will be 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.720
 Beijing is so to convince the goals not against a soldier is it 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.210
 adventure 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.600
 Australia is not where opponent is in the first group phase we are going 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.360
 encounter that wish not just a tournament 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.330
 if you don't just think of it 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.330
 they do have a very good selection is also just very fit selection 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.980
 reasons that the australian yes declined with korea 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.820
 that's not true either 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.190
 he played hide and seek in the college and australian 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.120
 those are very much i always play well in egypt who can do very well with 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.890
 that tropical heat 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.070
 they are also top 40, we have a very good throughput speed when changing 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.930
 so what that your group classification with this fall as Ferrari and the Netherlands 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.580
 the pool can sit there 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.190
 and if there is more time left in the power ratio that needs to be polder 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.870
 applications in the netherlands can continue and that does not have pounds 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.580
 at least favorable for the men 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.180
 yes, and those other teams that are a work of art and certainly at the olympic level 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.180
 no one will give it away but a substance that looks at power relationships 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.180
 Australia and the Netherlands is normally through from ado finale 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.240
 I did not have the idea that the national coach said a little looking for a month 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.280
 the ideal setup and with the a9 n9 in midfield 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.320
 yes, but in midfield and then with the back 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.010
 the power a bit the how to make 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.060
 CEO has positioned himself over the past few weeks, but I'm glad I don't have a boat 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.629
 I am, by the way, national coach 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.139
 I can hope that the worst practical thing is to find here, there are 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.739
 doubted about his salek 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.749
 yes you have salt or they need you 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.959
 Let your routine go before the boys who have played two 300 international matches 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.299
 is becoming 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.799
 at 150 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.239
 or do you need some new guys my heart hemorrhage 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.109
 some proposals that he was on the initiative of beijing he thinks well 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.290
 i need a few young boys now there is the chance to give it a little 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.259
 rejuvenation but then you have to disappoint again with routiniers 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:39.539
 he is at the forefront of bakery bart 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:42.750
 kg in that time is beyond orange to buy these chips 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.820
 indeed, prizes were for the top scorers of the past season and 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.970
 also the mayor of the city on the mesh it rains and the award
