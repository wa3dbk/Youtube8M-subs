guys checked out the link in description
for<00:00:24.869> more<00:00:24.900> codes<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.980> first<00:00:26.250> thing<00:00:26.369> first<00:00:26.519> go

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
for more codes so first thing first go

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.220 
for more codes so first thing first go
down<00:00:26.939> extra<00:00:27.330> menus<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:27.869> you've<00:00:27.990> never<00:00:28.109> done

this<00:00:28.410> before<00:00:28.560> borders<00:00:29.070> shift<00:00:29.279> codes<00:00:29.460> they'll

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
this before borders shift codes they'll

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.150 
this before borders shift codes they'll
be<00:00:30.630> overlay<00:00:31.050> over<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.439> video<00:00:31.679> with<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> codes

be overlay over the video with the codes

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.709 
be overlay over the video with the codes
right<00:00:32.369> away<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.850> they'll<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> link<00:00:33.600> in

instruction how to enter it inside of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.080 
instruction how to enter it inside of
your<00:00:36.809> shift<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.760> I'm<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:38.850> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.030> go

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
your shift and I'm just going to go

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.400 
your shift and I'm just going to go
ahead<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> put<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.719> code<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.079> me<00:00:40.170> myself

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
ahead and put in a code for me myself

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.630 
ahead and put in a code for me myself
just<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.800> show<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.010> guys<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.370> works

hundred percent like i was doing my

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.350 
hundred percent like i was doing my

other video so if you're the enter the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.090 
other video so if you're the enter the
code<00:00:45.600> thanks<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.050> watching<00:00:46.079> until<00:00:46.559> next<00:00:46.770> time

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
code thanks for watching until next time

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.520 
code thanks for watching until next time
peace<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.360> first<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.809> first<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.320> where

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
peace so first and first this is where

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.369 
peace so first and first this is where
ps3<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.570> needs<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> know<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.320> that

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
ps3 is so it just needs to know is that

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.490 
ps3 is so it just needs to know is that
you<00:00:52.739> can't<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> code<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.960> once<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
you can't put in the code all at once it

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.590 
you can't put in the code all at once it
needs<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.890> separately<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.149> piece<00:00:57.390> by<00:00:57.570> piece

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
needs to be separately so piece by piece

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.110 
needs to be separately so piece by piece
basically<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.070> usually<00:00:59.520> always<00:00:59.730> five

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
basically and it's usually always five

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.080 
basically and it's usually always five
digits<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:00.899> once<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.579> move<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.879> to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
digits at once and then you move on to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.620 
digits at once and then you move on to
the<00:01:03.210> next<00:01:03.239> section<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.500> put<00:01:04.650> any<00:01:04.830> more<00:01:04.949> code

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
the next section to put any more code

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.179 
the next section to put any more code
this<00:01:06.630> code<00:01:06.689> pacifically<00:01:07.530> will<00:01:07.799> be<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
this code pacifically will be for the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.000 
this code pacifically will be for the
playstation<00:01:08.850> 3<00:01:09.470> so<00:01:10.470> i'm<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.710> go<00:01:10.799> in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
playstation 3 so i'm going to go in

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.980 
playstation 3 so i'm going to go in
except<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> code<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.180> will<00:01:12.600> show<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
except the code and that will show that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.820 
except the code and that will show that
i<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.970> enough<00:01:14.970> ship<00:01:15.299> goes<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.900> go<00:01:16.409> ahead<00:01:16.530> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
i have enough ship goes to go ahead and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.490 
i have enough ship goes to go ahead and
get<00:01:16.890> some<00:01:17.040> more<00:01:17.189> stuff<00:01:21.020> if<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.170> guys<00:01:22.320> don't
