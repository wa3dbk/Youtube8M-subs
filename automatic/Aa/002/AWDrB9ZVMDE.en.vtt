00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
really important to make this space feel

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.460 
really important to make this space feel
really<00:00:20.880> light<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.449> airy<00:00:21.689> because<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.230> only

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
really light and airy because it's only

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.279 
really light and airy because it's only
45<00:00:22.949> square<00:00:23.490> feet<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> play<00:00:25.109> on

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
45 square feet I like to do a play on

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.200 
45 square feet I like to do a play on
colors<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.039> even<00:00:26.369> though<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.490> chose<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> white

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
colors so even though I chose a white

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.630 
colors so even though I chose a white
subway<00:00:27.570> tile<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.320> backsplash<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:29.220> did<00:00:29.609> a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
subway tile for the backsplash I did a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.299 
subway tile for the backsplash I did a
natural<00:00:30.240> gray<00:00:30.599> grout<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.529> showed<00:00:31.859> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
natural gray grout so that it showed the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.280 
natural gray grout so that it showed the
contrast<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.210> did<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:33.690> white<00:00:33.930> than<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
contrast but I did more white than the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.959 
contrast but I did more white than the
grace<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.070> see<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> doesn't<00:00:35.610> make<00:00:35.940> it

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
grace as you can see it doesn't make it

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.490 
grace as you can see it doesn't make it
feel<00:00:36.270> smaller<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> same<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
feel smaller and the same with the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.619 
feel smaller and the same with the
shower<00:00:37.739> curtain<00:00:38.219> it's<00:00:38.730> white<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.420> got<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
shower curtain it's white but it's got a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
shower curtain it's white but it's got a
ton<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.930> texture<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.500> layers<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.219> makes<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
ton of texture in layers so it makes a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.400 
ton of texture in layers so it makes a
big<00:00:41.850> statement<00:00:42.090> but<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.930> still<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.110> really

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
big statement but it's still a really

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.580 
big statement but it's still a really
light<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.860> airy<00:00:43.980> color<00:00:44.989> one<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.200> biggest

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
light and airy color one of the biggest

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.830 
light and airy color one of the biggest
things<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.010> find<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.550> small<00:00:47.820> spaces<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.600> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
things I find in small spaces is that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.170 
things I find in small spaces is that
there's<00:00:49.079> not<00:00:49.410> enough<00:00:49.710> lighting<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.700> always

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
there's not enough lighting so I always

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.299 
there's not enough lighting so I always
encourage<00:00:51.629> people<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.860> some<00:00:53.160> room

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
encourage people if you have some room

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.850 
encourage people if you have some room
in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> budget<00:00:53.699> add<00:00:54.090> extra<00:00:54.899> lighting<00:00:55.110> in<00:00:55.440> this

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
in the budget add extra lighting in this

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.830 
in the budget add extra lighting in this
case<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.309> did<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> nice<00:00:56.789> vanity<00:00:57.360> light<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
case I did a nice vanity light but I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
case I did a nice vanity light but I
also<00:00:58.109> did<00:00:58.469> an<00:00:58.620> antique<00:00:58.980> chandelier<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.879> add

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
also did an antique chandelier to add

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.270 
also did an antique chandelier to add
interest<00:01:00.570> which<00:01:00.899> gives<00:01:01.140> plenty<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.829> light<00:01:02.039> and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
interest which gives plenty of light and

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.039 
interest which gives plenty of light and
what<00:01:02.489> does<00:01:02.609> light<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:03.000> light<00:01:03.480> makes<00:01:03.750> things

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
what does light do light makes things

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.940 
what does light do light makes things
feel<00:01:04.290> bigger<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> trick<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:06.950> really

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
feel bigger so that's the trick I really

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.770 
feel bigger so that's the trick I really
feel<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.310> vanity<00:01:08.640> mirror<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.390> one<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
feel like a vanity mirror is one of the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.910 
feel like a vanity mirror is one of the
things<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.290> make<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.799> big

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
things that can make a really big

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.370 
things that can make a really big
statement<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.850> small<00:01:12.180> space<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.110> found

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
statement in a small space and I found

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.320 
statement in a small space and I found
this<00:01:13.560> old<00:01:13.860> mirror<00:01:14.460> at<00:01:14.610> an<00:01:14.729> antique<00:01:15.030> store<00:01:15.090> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
this old mirror at an antique store I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.670 
this old mirror at an antique store I
ended<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.689> painting<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.200> white<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
ended up painting it white because I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.649 
ended up painting it white because I
wanted<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.310> light<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.180> has<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> lot

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
wanted it to be light but it has a lot

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.810 
wanted it to be light but it has a lot
of<00:01:18.689> character<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.439> detail<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.159> really<00:01:20.610> make

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
of character and detail that really make

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240 
of character and detail that really make
it<00:01:20.850> pop<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.689> vanity<00:01:22.110> piece<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.590> smaller<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.220> I

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
it pop this vanity piece is smaller so I

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.010 
it pop this vanity piece is smaller so I
really<00:01:23.610> wanted<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.909> make<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> stand<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.960> I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
really wanted to make it stand out so I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.929 
really wanted to make it stand out so I
did<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> vessel<00:01:25.680> sink<00:01:25.890> that's<00:01:26.130> raised<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.850> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
did a vessel sink that's raised so it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.370 
did a vessel sink that's raised so it
really<00:01:27.210> makes<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> statement<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:28.229> not

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
really makes a statement it's not

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.350 
really makes a statement it's not
necessarily<00:01:29.100> large<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> fact<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.210> it

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
necessarily large but the fact that it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.840 
necessarily large but the fact that it
comes<00:01:30.540> up<00:01:30.840> above<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.500> countertops<00:01:32.070> gives<00:01:32.700> it

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
comes up above the countertops gives it

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.219 
comes up above the countertops gives it
the<00:01:32.939> illusion<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.689> bigger<00:01:33.900> than<00:01:34.020> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the illusion that this is bigger than it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.280 
the illusion that this is bigger than it
really<00:01:34.350> is

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
really is

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.810 
really is
when<00:01:37.290> you're<00:01:37.500> working<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.040> smaller<00:01:38.400> space

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
when you're working with a smaller space

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.490 
when you're working with a smaller space
you<00:01:39.000> know<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.270> everything<00:01:39.720> fits<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.230> small

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you know not everything fits in a small

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
you know not everything fits in a small
vanity<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.130> can't<00:01:41.370> make<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.730> vanity<00:01:42.090> any

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
vanity and I can't make this vanity any

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.540 
vanity and I can't make this vanity any
larger<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.350> trick<00:01:43.620> is<00:01:43.650> how<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.400> you

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
larger so the trick is how do you

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.060 
larger so the trick is how do you
maximize<00:01:45.210> your<00:01:45.390> space<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.020> contain<00:01:46.770> things

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
maximize your space and contain things

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.660 
maximize your space and contain things

in a creative way the fun thing about
being<00:01:54.270> creative<00:01:54.510> with<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> way<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.650> contain

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
being creative with the way you contain

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.800
