00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.870
 everything 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.410
 hello today we will talk about overlay 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.540
 ping what is it overlapping 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.420
 spacing through stretch american 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.630
 the names of the English language in large 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.970
 In principle, this is not bad because 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.730
 what a kind of sign we are 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 we can always carry on a dialogue and when we are 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:37.530
 communicate call spacing overlapping we 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:43.170
 let's understand what we are talking about in essence 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.840
 everything is translated into Russian but more convenient 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.220
 when one short name but it 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.320
 such a small introduction 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.460
 still we are talking about today 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 fight pings and 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.070
 and let me tell you what it is. 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.660
 overlapping is essentially not 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.559
 simultaneity of what is happening which means 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.790
 not simultaneity what is happening not 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.439
 simultaneity of action for example 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.729
 she meets hand movement when i 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:18.479
 moving my arm does not move my shoulder and 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:21.210
 the hand is overwhelmed by the result 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.030
 the ping overlay is a crush that is 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.659
 when the hand moves slightly 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.450
 behind here is such a crust it happens 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.549
 for example and in the motion of the pendulum if our 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.549
 pendulum consists of several parts 

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:41.729
 the first part is moving and the second 

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:45.200
 belatedly overlapping 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.329
 also found in motion 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.459
 character in for example in the body in 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.200
 the spine ie the spine too 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:58.109
 working late for a step for example 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.170
 or when moving from the pelvis 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.850
 upper body slightly lagging behind the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.220
 there is not moving everything 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.290
 apart from each other but she 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.200
 moves a bit late as it were in 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:15.540
 overlap can even disassemble overlapping 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.950
 in poses when turning for example 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.810
 call the first pose 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:24.600
 and the pose is straight and the second pose is 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.740
 there will be a turn in the direction then this turn 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.010
 will happen with tracking too, am 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.960
 first we turn our eyes then 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.580
 head and already go the body that is here 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.580
 overlapping movement too 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.360
 animators use this principle 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:50.220
 constantly in their own hands 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.270
 and therefore it is worth fixing it on the very 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.910
 entry level 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.580
 to move on in learning 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.580
 animations , we also understand that overlapping 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.680
 works like 2d animations and 3d 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.810
 animations 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.780
 it's just different techniques 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.890
 do our animation we wish good luck 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.890
 and forward
