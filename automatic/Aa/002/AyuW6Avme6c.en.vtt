00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 all hello to you andrew and welcome 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.569
 welcome to random building this for 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.599
 buildings we like black wool 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.370
 then brown clay new shine 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.070
 can use cinnamon wool but 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.650
 in my opinion for secret construction more 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.939
 brown clay fits and so 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.710
 I want the wool well or light green 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:27.109

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.899

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.159
