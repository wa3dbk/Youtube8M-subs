00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:18.270
 And then everyone here talks about davi and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.380
 Today I'm going to show you how to do it. 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.890
 the work and put both talking in the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.410
 overclock 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.480
 Geez, I'll explain a little about the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.510
 I remember you guys, I do not know that much. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.690
 about her but I'm going to tell you 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.880
 people watch clock is like an accelerator 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.570
 of processors 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.700
 when you make it your processor 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.620
 so automatically it increases is today 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.020
 his garrett 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.579
 for example here I've already done up lay 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.579
 you show here for you 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.030
 kayaking 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:12.470
 3g counter in the jacuzzi gym we go 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:16.040
 here, the 8gb network is an old one that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:20.150
 It is the previous version that I noticed that 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.600
 the powerful computer comes and I've changed 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.990
 Overclocked 2016 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.780
 but I downloaded it is really little 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.660
 if you increase too much you will end up 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.630
 burning your processor to the internet 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.600
 so come on 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.770
 to see clock already the broken galley showing 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.940
 How do you do when you see Claudia Beauty? 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:52.930
 went and came back here guys now I'm 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:57.440
 restarting the pc and it will start here 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.259
 for us to overclock know that in 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:08.720
 del and dell but it can if you can 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:12.620
 to serve 24 any command there guys 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.350
 here my view put this my blog 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.850
 but there was very simple is the intel 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.690
 celeron my processor 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:27.350
 so if your was intel or you will be 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:33.380
 practically almost this on them 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:37.610
 so come on you go on the second option 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.730
 here dad on it is not our say mark 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:46.040
 god is not in the second option again and 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:49.459
 tac guys that m networks 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:54.010
 is the one you download and if this 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:59.909
 would have increased by 240 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:03.459
 is the maximum potential of the intel celeron 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:08.319
 because mine is just a nucleus your can 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:15.940
 be you boot 260 but is due to 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:20.129
 blue do not like here you can download or 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.739
 So if you like this blue screen I know 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:26.560
 If it was him alone, it's not my fault. 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.019
 I'm making the video here to 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.470
 teach you understand 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:34.470
 so come on guys I'll go down here 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:45.250
 sheet 2 35 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:49.540
 my maximum is 265 plus I'm going to download 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.930
 You guys are going to see people here. 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.599
 O 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.870
 here, in order not to be 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.169
 manual will go into default 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.940
 You put the manual in the last option. 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.940
 so it's not that you're going 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:27.050
 235 ready on until you save f10 the f10 and 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:30.100
 enter will start your pc again aiea 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.100
 start again 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.940
 my little slow guys who do not know what 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.180
 It happened it slowed down like that. 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:48.080
 but it can prepare you that you will have 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.760
 a computer port with this 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.200
 overclocking your processor will 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.200
 get much better than before 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:06.930
 mine was not as good as I think not 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:10.590
 I know who it was but it improved a bit more 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.040
 What was the team before? 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:25.620
 show you 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:29.850
 right-click menu 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:33.990
 property hold and goes property 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.630
 there and look at your bass potential 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.010
 guys because of the low bird 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.520
 also 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:47.490
 but you will be much taller than 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:53.669
 that if you are 2.8 stay 3.16 if 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:58.530
 put two and 40 there guys I'll leave the 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:01.440
 list if the cefor 86 and is 180 will stay 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:08.729
 This way I'm going to put a gang of 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:12.590
 institution tricked and people were 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:14.850
