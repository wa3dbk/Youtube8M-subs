 And this time a Mars number orthodox 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.260
 As a transition method, it is an accent insistence or not or not or not or not or not or not or not 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.230
 Unreasonable 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.640

 I think it will 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.860
 First of all there is no procedure 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.400

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:13.230
 Is due to many things because this practice of Paradis dollar 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:16.630
