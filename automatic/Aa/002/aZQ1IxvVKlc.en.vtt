00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:09.700
 the bongiorno with today's movie 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:14.200
 let's take a little look at this 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.980
 this biomass thermal plant that 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.449
 has realized the thermo-hydraulics 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.220
 christian pesc is the one with us 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.300
 we are practically working now 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.269
 fixed and with the assembly of a bio hydra 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.309
 28 has first of all 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.529
 let's take a quick look to see the 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:35.230
 precision of both the tubes and the whole 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.110
 perfect picture look here also the 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.990
 precision with which he worked christian 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.940
 pes and his brother 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.150
 this is to say not all the work 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.580
 jobs are the same and let's see how 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:55.020
 made the plant then we have one here 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.020
 bio hydra 28 large 28 kilowatts 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:07.869
 here it is connected to the smoke system 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:10.299
 joint of 10 two curves three sections e 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.100
 then it goes into the chimney 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.149
 the two tax curves all have e 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.880
 two the inspection in this manner 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.880
 thanks to the presence of the team and also 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 here look at the precision with which 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.700
 amounted tubes leaving leaving 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.179
 free 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.579
 the t to be clean and to the two curves 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:34.600
 with the inspection the pipes can be cleaned 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:38.740
 without practically ever taking them apart 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.880
 therefore a nice comfort this boilers 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.779
 this bebo them nor was matched 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.399
 sanitary water production 

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:50.920
 this boiler is also prepared for 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.619
 then attach the panels 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.819
 solar then the boiler what to do one 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.979
 once it starts to heat the water let's say 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:05.069
 heat the water part of the part 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.929
 top of the boilers then from here on up 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:11.080
 when it reaches the desired temperature 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.340
 trigger this valve to 3d and that 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.819
 we have put out 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.739
 you see there is the gray one ii and the water 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.900
 of themselves, turn two more into the radiator 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.940
 small end if I show you the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.180
 valve also with dense and I hope 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.549
 original mounted in the return in this 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.970
 so the body of the machine works 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:38.090
 always about 55 degrees reducing in fact 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:45.290
 the condensates almost zero and lengthening the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:47.180
 machine life this is boiler at 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.790
 second solar coil 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.819
 so right now i'll do you 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.790
 see the boiler is burning I hope 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:00.290
 that you see why there is a little dark 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:05.000
 burning chopped peanuts e 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:09.140
 of the marc and burning waste 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.940
 we look at the yes but we have the temperature 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.560
 where here is the temperature in 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.870
 then boiler the water that is turning 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:21.470
 also in the 55th theme he has made 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.579
 65 as a point of arrival and temperature 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.880
 of the sanitary ware at 51 degrees 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.380
 this burning of scraps you see 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.049
 also the presence of the two phases of 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.970
 expansion one for sanitary water e 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.450
 one for the plant 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.069
 this because of the new laws 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.959
 the expansion vessel that is already present 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.019
 in the car you see it was at the bottom 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.220
 the red flat one with inflexible 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.919
 yellow 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.989
 enough only for the water contained 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.500
 in the machine a vase is therefore necessary 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.359
 more expansion if it was 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.269
 possible there were no problems here 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:02.060
 space we could put instead of a 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.069
 boiler a pouf of ten quintals and there the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.650
 solar would also help us to 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.599
 the heating system, however, already 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.599
 so a very very nice facility
