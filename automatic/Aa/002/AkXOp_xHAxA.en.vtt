first<00:00:00.329> question<00:00:01.079> this<00:00:02.040> is<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.550> APC<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.570> AHIMA

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
first question this is a APC and AHIMA

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.179 
first question this is a APC and AHIMA
certifications<00:00:05.130> we've<00:00:05.910> had<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.240> one<00:00:06.450> before

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
certifications we've had this one before

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.620 
certifications we've had this one before
actually<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.370> we<00:00:08.460> got<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:09.059> question<00:00:09.330> I

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
actually and we got this question I

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.200 
actually and we got this question I
think<00:00:09.660> two<00:00:10.050> or<00:00:10.080> three<00:00:10.260> times<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.580> week<00:00:11.639> alone

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
think two or three times this week alone

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.410 
think two or three times this week alone
so<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:13.019> thought<00:00:13.290> maybe<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.769> better<00:00:14.299> revisit<00:00:15.299> it

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
so I thought maybe we better revisit it

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:36.100 
so I thought maybe we better revisit it
again

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.810

there's a lot of hospitals so there

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.260 
there's a lot of hospitals so there
might<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.350> more<00:01:55.500> jobs<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.850> hospital

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
might be more jobs in the hospital

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.900 
might be more jobs in the hospital
setting<00:01:57.420> versus<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.800> rural<00:01:58.979> area<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.670> me

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
setting versus in a rural area like me

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.180 
setting versus in a rural area like me
there<00:02:00.690> there<00:02:01.080> isn't<00:02:01.289> there's<00:02:01.619> only<00:02:01.740> two<00:02:02.009> main

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
there there isn't there's only two main

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.150 
there there isn't there's only two main
hospitals<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.590> you're<00:02:04.590> probably<00:02:04.770> not<00:02:05.069> going

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
hospitals so you're probably not going

hospitals so you're probably not going
to<00:02:05.220> have<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> better<00:02:05.580> chance<00:02:05.670> landing<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.450> job<00:02:06.690> as

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
to have a better chance landing a job as

is<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.549> easier<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.090> break<00:03:00.269> into<00:03:00.510> then<00:03:01.379> in<00:03:01.739> the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
is it's easier to break into then in the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.210 
is it's easier to break into then in the
hospital<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:03.209> now<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.079> also<00:03:04.500> had<00:03:04.920> on<00:03:05.099> the<00:03:05.220> slide

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
hospital so now I also had on the slide

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.819 
hospital so now I also had on the slide
this<00:03:08.250> AHIMA<00:03:08.640> versus<00:03:09.209> AAPC<00:03:09.900> comparison<00:03:10.590> grid

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
this AHIMA versus AAPC comparison grid

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.160 
this AHIMA versus AAPC comparison grid
that<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.010> did<00:03:11.340> when<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> covered<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:12.659> question

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
that I did when I covered this question

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.190 
that I did when I covered this question
before<00:03:13.310> let<00:03:14.310> me<00:03:14.400> see<00:03:14.610> if<00:03:14.730> I<00:03:14.819> can<00:03:15.030> enlarge<00:03:15.930> this

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
before let me see if I can enlarge this

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.110 
before let me see if I can enlarge this
a<00:03:16.260> little<00:03:16.590> bit<00:03:18.260> okay<00:03:19.260> so<00:03:19.400> what<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.430> have<00:03:20.670> here<00:03:20.700> is

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
a little bit okay so what I have here is

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.960 
a little bit okay so what I have here is
is<00:03:21.329> different<00:03:21.629> variables<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:22.620> then<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.310> AAPC

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
is different variables and then the AAPC

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.630 
is different variables and then the AAPC
column<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.599> the<00:03:24.930> AHIMA<00:03:25.260> column<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.400> first

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
column and the AHIMA column so the first

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.240 
column and the AHIMA column so the first
variable<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:28.079> physician<00:03:28.260> based<00:03:28.680> exam

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
variable is the physician based exam

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.000 
variable is the physician based exam
what<00:03:29.549> is<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.910> credential<00:03:30.480> for<00:03:30.690> their

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
what is the credential for their

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
physician based exam so for the AAPC

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.589 
physician based exam so for the AAPC
it's<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.650> CPC<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.310> certified<00:03:35.909> professional

very<00:04:18.930> difficult<00:04:19.500> in<00:04:19.739> my<00:04:20.099> opinion<00:04:20.519> compared<00:04:21.329> to

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
very difficult in my opinion compared to

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.640 
very difficult in my opinion compared to
the<00:04:21.599> others<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:22.079> think<00:04:22.260> it's<00:04:22.380> the<00:04:22.500> most

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
the others I think it's the most

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.300 
the others I think it's the most
difficult<00:04:23.599> now<00:04:24.599> I<00:04:24.900> did<00:04:25.410> want<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.650> emphasize<00:04:25.710> at

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
difficult now I did want to emphasize at

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.850 
difficult now I did want to emphasize at
the<00:04:26.400> cpc-h<00:04:27.090> because<00:04:27.690> h<00:04:27.900> means<00:04:28.229> hospital

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
the cpc-h because h means hospital

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.790 
the cpc-h because h means hospital
throws<00:04:29.430> a<00:04:29.460> lot<00:04:29.849> of<00:04:30.000> people<00:04:30.300> off<00:04:30.449> it<00:04:30.720> only<00:04:31.349> means

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
throws a lot of people off it only means
