next is prilosec and I have mentioned
this<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.020> other<00:01:28.259> sample<00:01:28.950> hauls<00:01:29.189> before<00:01:29.549> or

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
this in other sample hauls before or

if you've gotten it before they come up
to<00:01:38.579> find<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.850> guesstimate<00:01:39.299> i<00:01:39.329> would<00:01:39.540> say<00:01:39.659> about

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
to find a guesstimate i would say about

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.560 
to find a guesstimate i would say about
four<00:01:40.079> times<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.409> year<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.310> definitely<00:01:41.790> keep

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
four times a year so definitely keep

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
four times a year so definitely keep
