00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.920
 everything is fine this area somewhere 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.920

 a field in which she will be landing 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.469
 located on the edge of the village this is 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.799
 I flipped through the center 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:33.829
 here you can see how the grass is plowed high 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:38.770
 the grass was weathered 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:42.889
 Here is this fair to force and plowed 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.799
 we had no time for the edge of the tractor 

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:50.840
 agreed therefore plowed along with 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:53.329
 grass nothing I think over the winter rot 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.229

 It has dropped to the thickness of the snow 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.099

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.359
 10 it was all under the snow now on 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:30.730
 the new year the snow melted 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:40.659

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.569
 garden and blackened by frost 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.900
