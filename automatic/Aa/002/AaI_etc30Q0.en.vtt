00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.880 
there's no bounce that means this part
of<00:02:05.640> his<00:02:05.759> spine<00:02:06.149> isn't<00:02:06.780> moving<00:02:07.350> correctly

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
of his spine isn't moving correctly

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.450 
of his spine isn't moving correctly
what's<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.700> correlate<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
what's that correlate to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.640 
what's that correlate to
we<00:02:12.460> pretend<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.510> this<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.140> spine<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.620> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
we pretend that this is the spine of the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.350 
we pretend that this is the spine of the
horse<00:02:14.920> this<00:02:15.160> rope<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.850> spine<00:02:16.120> of<00:02:16.270> the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
horse this rope is the spine of the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.970 
horse this rope is the spine of the
horse

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
horse

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.500 
horse
Jodie's<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.130> head<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.490> horse<00:02:18.940> I'm<00:02:19.240> the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
Jodie's the head of the horse I'm the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.130 
Jodie's the head of the horse I'm the
back<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:19.990> horse<00:02:20.460> when<00:02:21.460> I<00:02:21.490> create<00:02:21.940> energy

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
back of the horse when I create energy

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.290 
back of the horse when I create energy
that<00:02:23.140> energy<00:02:23.320> travels<00:02:24.250> fluently<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:25.210> the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
that energy travels fluently to the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.060 
that energy travels fluently to the
front<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:25.690> horse<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.710> energy<00:02:27.010> is

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
front of the horse so the energy is

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.450 
front of the horse so the energy is
generated<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.820> back<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.210> the<00:02:28.270> horse

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
generated in the back of the horse

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.340 
generated in the back of the horse
transmitted<00:02:30.460> to<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.670> front<00:02:30.910> of<00:02:31.000> horse<00:02:31.350> when

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
transmitted to the front of horse when

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.640 
transmitted to the front of horse when
part<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.710> his<00:02:32.830> spine<00:02:33.160> doesn't<00:02:33.430> move<00:02:33.700> that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
part of his spine doesn't move that

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.640 
part of his spine doesn't move that
transmission<00:02:35.650> goes<00:02:36.130> out<00:02:36.750> okay<00:02:37.750> just<00:02:38.500> like

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
transmission goes out okay just like

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.200 
transmission goes out okay just like
when<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.920> transmission<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.670> your<00:02:39.760> car<00:02:40.000> goes

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
when the transmission and your car goes

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.140 
when the transmission and your car goes
out<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:41.020> energy<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.650> no<00:02:41.770> longer<00:02:42.130> flow<00:02:42.400> so

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
out that energy can no longer flow so

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.510 
out that energy can no longer flow so
we're<00:02:43.720> getting<00:02:43.900> some<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.320> that<00:02:44.350> in<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:45.250> horse

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
we're getting some of that in this horse

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.850 
we're getting some of that in this horse
even<00:02:45.790> though<00:02:45.910> he's<00:02:46.030> running<00:02:46.420> well<00:02:46.710> we're<00:02:47.710> just

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
even though he's running well we're just

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.260 
even though he's running well we're just
not<00:02:48.040> getting<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.400> transmission<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.030> was

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
not getting the transmission that was

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.820 
not getting the transmission that was
 then<00:02:50.020> let's<00:02:50.260> go<00:02:50.380> ahead<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.680> have<00:02:50.770> him

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
 then let's go ahead and have him

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.920 
 then let's go ahead and have him
walk<00:02:51.220> away<00:02:51.490> from<00:02:51.850> us<00:02:52.000> again<00:02:57.750> notice<00:02:58.750> how<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
walk away from us again notice how the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.530 
walk away from us again notice how the
right<00:02:59.170> side<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.740> his<00:02:59.830> hip<00:03:00.070> pelvis<00:03:00.550> comes<00:03:01.330> up

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
right side of his hip pelvis comes up

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.180 
right side of his hip pelvis comes up
higher<00:03:01.780> than<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.170> left<00:03:02.350> side<00:03:02.470> does<00:03:02.860> when<00:03:03.100> he

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
higher than the left side does when he

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.250 
higher than the left side does when he
walks<00:03:03.400> away<00:03:03.580> from<00:03:03.730> us<00:03:04.090> bring<00:03:04.690> him<00:03:04.810> back<00:03:05.020> and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
walks away from us bring him back and

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:15.500 
walks away from us bring him back and
let's<00:03:05.410> do<00:03:05.560> it<00:03:05.590> one<00:03:05.770> more<00:03:05.800> time

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.280 

go<00:03:16.510> ahead<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:16.720> walk<00:03:16.870> him<00:03:17.020> away<00:03:17.170> again

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
go ahead and walk him away again

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.790 
go ahead and walk him away again
straight<00:03:18.220> away<00:03:18.280> from<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.640> camera

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
straight away from the camera

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.470 
straight away from the camera
watch<00:03:20.800> how<00:03:21.040> he's<00:03:21.190> how<00:03:21.490> is<00:03:21.640> how<00:03:21.940> his<00:03:22.060> pelvis

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
watch how he's how is how his pelvis

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.030 
watch how he's how is how his pelvis
moves<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.840> right<00:03:23.020> side<00:03:23.320> comes<00:03:23.620> up<00:03:23.830> higher

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
moves that right side comes up higher

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.420 
moves that right side comes up higher
than<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.460> left<00:03:24.670> side<00:03:24.760> does<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:27.220> right

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
than the left side does and the right

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.550 
than the left side does and the right
side<00:03:27.700> doesn't<00:03:28.090> really<00:03:28.240> drop<00:03:28.630> below<00:03:28.960> below

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
side doesn't really drop below below

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.430 
side doesn't really drop below below
neutral<00:03:30.130> either<00:03:30.870> okay<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:31.930> now<00:03:32.200> I'm<00:03:32.290> going<00:03:32.380> to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
neutral either okay so now I'm going to

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.990 
neutral either okay so now I'm going to
go<00:03:32.560> ahead<00:03:32.650> and<00:03:32.830> adjust<00:03:32.890> him<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.550> then<00:03:33.880> we'll

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
go ahead and adjust him and then we'll

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.510 
go ahead and adjust him and then we'll
see<00:03:34.180> if<00:03:34.240> we<00:03:34.360> can<00:03:34.480> fix<00:03:34.750> those<00:03:35.020> things<00:03:35.400> when<00:03:36.400> we

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
see if we can fix those things when we

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.620 
see if we can fix those things when we
look<00:03:36.670> at<00:03:36.790> him<00:03:36.970> after<00:03:37.240> our<00:03:37.330> adjustment<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.540> we

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
look at him after our adjustment so we

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.240 
look at him after our adjustment so we
went<00:03:40.750> ahead<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.140> we<00:03:41.260> adjusted<00:03:41.710> trouble<00:03:42.130> we

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
went ahead and we adjusted trouble we

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.730 
went ahead and we adjusted trouble we
work<00:03:42.640> someone<00:03:43.030> his<00:03:43.180> lower<00:03:43.360> neck<00:03:43.660> works<00:03:44.410> um<00:03:44.620> in

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
work someone his lower neck works um in

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.950 
work someone his lower neck works um in
the<00:03:44.830> middle<00:03:45.040> of<00:03:45.130> his<00:03:45.190> back<00:03:45.460> and<00:03:45.760> worked<00:03:46.630> on<00:03:46.810> his

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
the middle of his back and worked on his

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.140 
the middle of his back and worked on his
SI<00:03:47.260> joints<00:03:47.680> or<00:03:47.800> sacroiliac<00:03:48.310> joints<00:03:48.790> back<00:03:48.970> here

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
SI joints or sacroiliac joints back here

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.300 
SI joints or sacroiliac joints back here
in<00:03:49.240> the<00:03:49.330> back<00:03:49.480> end<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:50.680> we're<00:03:50.920> going<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.070> start

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
in the back end so we're going to start

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.860 
in the back end so we're going to start
out<00:03:51.520> let's<00:03:51.790> have<00:03:51.940> him<00:03:52.030> walk<00:03:52.270> away<00:03:52.420> from<00:03:52.750> us

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
out let's have him walk away from us

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.050 
out let's have him walk away from us
again<00:03:53.200> here<00:03:53.440> and<00:03:53.590> we'll<00:03:54.460> notice<00:03:54.820> that<00:03:54.910> that

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
again here and we'll notice that that

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.760 
again here and we'll notice that that
left<00:03:55.330> side<00:03:55.600> is<00:03:55.930> starting<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.290> come<00:03:56.500> up<00:03:56.650> a

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
left side is starting to come up a

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.740 
left side is starting to come up a
little<00:03:56.920> bit<00:03:57.160> more<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.820> right<00:03:58.000> side<00:03:58.360> isn't

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
little bit more the right side isn't

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.270 
little bit more the right side isn't
coming<00:03:59.020> is<00:03:59.140> high<00:03:59.350> and<00:03:59.620> it's<00:03:59.770> starting<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.190> go

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
coming is high and it's starting to go

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.660 
coming is high and it's starting to go
down<00:04:00.520> below<00:04:00.760> neutral<00:04:01.390> again<00:04:01.740> okay<00:04:02.740> then<00:04:03.400> as<00:04:03.520> we

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
down below neutral again okay then as we

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.110
