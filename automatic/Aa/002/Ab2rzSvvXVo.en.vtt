00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello to you, cloud marsik and 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.500
 Today I'll show you how to make yourself 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.330
 Inter good sip many probably 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 ask well how to ask myself and 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.880
 that's how this dude did inter beautiful 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.699
 Why I could do these things up to 2TB growth 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.310
 they are just so smart they just know 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.689
 that is in the world, there are still 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.730
 such things are called templates 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:30.090
 which you can just download 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:33.450
 enter your text and save here and 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.380
 today I will show you how to do it in 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.360
 first we already have a website bar books.ru 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.690
 this is your great site essentially here for 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.870
 about such departments all about 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.079
 save all garbage that's all business 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.019
 so here then 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.530
 here there get down shorter down us 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.329
 Today the program is interested in cinema 4d 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.210
 with the help of it we will do ourselves 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.370
 Inter here is a lot of things here too 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.820
 lessons are all things but they are a little bit 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.500
 incomprehensible so I decided to make you 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.500
 for you for your subscribers more 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.080
 understandable though I do n’t use it myself 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.790
 subway here is shorter in principle 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.119
 great this very choice of inter these 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.119
 is full 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.510
 again pages well in this principle 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.100
 little thing is not a lot of 5 pages 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:33.480
 here for minecraft here are good meters 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.510
 boxing territory but today we are us 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.610
 interested here such winds here give 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.000
 Let's go take a look something inside look 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.520
 First you download with the people easier to 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.460
 part rather than site bit over there yet 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.600
 wait for all this garbage from the people 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.630
 In principle, you threw someone and went here 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.729
 after you download this this 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.700
 the very template 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.180
 kernel unpack it somewhere either 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.759
 and you will have these files now 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.670
 I will explain that they give it she just 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.170
 system as if it is not needed at all 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.420
 this is a lesson 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.520
 so she is also not interviewed in principle 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.680
 it is clear there are lessons like in English 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.250
 in my opinion almost everything 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.260
 so I decided to do my lesson and so 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.849
 this file interests us 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.760
 this is the subway motif template itself to shower 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:35.260
 man document is already open 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.849
 Now it's all here in short we like 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.390
 would the background be further deceived and not shift 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.310
 this 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.970
 you will explain later shorter on account of this 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.970
 in the end 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.510
 here here let's say we have this 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.810
 our intro will look like this 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.810
 Scotch 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.430
 Okay, some kind of mistake, everything is scary 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.620
 Essentially things here write with your this 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.620
 most name well as the name of herbs 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.750
 here we will have a text test 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.930
 or it may also change the font 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.530
 no big deal if you change 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.900
 I suppose let it be here like this 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.280
 this one 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.380
 That principle is very beautiful 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.230
 it turns out 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.540
 from many pieces 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.469
 going to text 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.540
 here we go further render settings 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:35.579
 here is this button next to the orange 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.439
 the button to the right of the orange 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.760
 buttons in general 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.980
 the main thing here is not touching anything full 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.379
 rendar output here too nothing 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.629
 touch as it were, see the main thing so that 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.519
 there was all the frames here and there 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:51.569
 such screen resolution 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.480
 but the sense here is metro saving 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.099
 then go here here choose how 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.319
 where will things be here 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.319
 put the system clips avi it ​​will 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.950
 war as a battle save the clip they are there 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.190
 pictures for example here 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.019
 etc. do not touch anything here 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.030
 principle that's all you don't need 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.190
 smoothing here you can insert geometry 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.010
 you can set the maximum maximum 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.900
 in fact, it’s better because she’s 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.910
 more beautiful effect does not look like this 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.850
 my render settings for now 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.800
 also finished here you can immediately 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:31.310
 insert music 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.250
 but it is in cinema 4d but it will just be long 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.090
 rendered and no matter how fine 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:42.280
 ok man and you will wait for it 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.280
 this it is in this time to allow 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.270
 insert say 10 seconds to 10 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:53.040
 second 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:55.910
 music from seconds videos and how would 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.270
 in general, and shorter because of the ten-second 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.880
 from Odessa fuck for 10 seconds nai music 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.729
 you will wait about two hours 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.110
 this grinder is bigger 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.780
 here 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.520
 that's what I wanted to say and then just 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.020
 click on this orange button 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.390
 and click render with the gift of that garbage in 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.110
 Basically nothing terrible 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.670
 so there will probably be some 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.200
 hours here will have to wait 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:33.640
 Render this inter in principle he himself 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.350
 how would this most justify come in handy 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.250
 it's always an intro but I don't use them 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.280
 because I just don't need them and how 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.730
 would just not be willing to wait for a render 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.380
 here and how this slider when to 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.130
 the end can come just calm 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.630
 close and that's it, but I won't 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.240
 naturally it will be very long 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.120
 so let's get started right away 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.720
 to that 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.620
 for an explanation of these chickens audio recordings 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.210
 what to do with them 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:09.240
 bam bam bam well come in first your 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:12.870
 fuck video video editor it can 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.030
 be work there hi this could be 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.780
 vegas pro can be generally camtasia to 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:21.810
 Essentially open your subways in essence. 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.910
 Are you behind the render whether through cinema 4d 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.490
 and open any of these 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:31.770
 audio recordings 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:36.160
 here and here let's say just insert this 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:39.460
 this audio file on your video as if 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.150
 and she herself will rise and everything will coincide there 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.490
 in fact it is not difficult 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.500
 I can't show now like mine 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.210
 I just do not have Kamtasia yet 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.610
 installed not that not to stop 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.300
 just having problems with her 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.680
 reinstall 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.990
 here 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.000
 and you just get a beautiful yantra 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.990
 can it again for rendering 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.190
 well 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:05.230
 what a good daddy is all essentially laz 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.120
 But if we assume you need Hapkido steel 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:10.240
 where does the thread come from ? 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:15.640
 do your video and 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:18.010
 It will be beautiful I think the lesson is clear if 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.440
 have any questions ask 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.320
