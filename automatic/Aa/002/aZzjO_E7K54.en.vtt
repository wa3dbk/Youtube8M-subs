00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
you like at least I think it's going to

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.710 
you like at least I think it's going to
be<00:01:54.409> yeah<00:01:54.560> it's<00:01:54.770> it's<00:01:55.700> really<00:01:55.909> cool<00:01:56.090> it<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.360> like

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
be yeah it's it's really cool it I like

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.389 
be yeah it's it's really cool it I like
this<00:01:56.900> effect<00:01:57.259> because<00:01:57.380> it's<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.130> know<00:01:58.250> it's

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
this effect because it's a you know it's

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.060 
this effect because it's a you know it's
the<00:01:58.520> 20<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:58.940> 90<00:01:59.360> with<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.020> bit<00:02:00.259> of<00:02:00.290> modulation

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
the 20 to 90 with a bit of modulation

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.090 
the 20 to 90 with a bit of modulation
like<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> classic<00:02:01.850> chorus<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.960> fatten<00:02:03.380> up<00:02:03.560> sort

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
like a classic chorus to fatten up sort

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.430 
like a classic chorus to fatten up sort
of<00:02:04.190> if<00:02:04.670> I'm<00:02:04.880> using<00:02:05.060> harmonics<00:02:05.509> or<00:02:05.960> say<00:02:06.320> I'm

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
of if I'm using harmonics or say I'm

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.290 
of if I'm using harmonics or say I'm
doing<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.770> rhythmic<00:02:07.159> thing<00:02:07.190> it'll<00:02:08.000> just<00:02:08.149> give

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
doing a rhythmic thing it'll just give

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.760 
doing a rhythmic thing it'll just give
it<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> little<00:02:08.539> bit<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.750> depth<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.229> character

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
it a little bit of depth and character

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.340 
it a little bit of depth and character
and<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.850> delay<00:02:11.120> is<00:02:11.180> useful<00:02:11.630> for<00:02:11.840> me<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.260> the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
and the delay is useful for me and the

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.140 
and the delay is useful for me and the
in<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.739> sense<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.070> just<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.610> buys<00:02:13.880> me<00:02:14.120> time

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
in the sense it just it buys me time

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.840 
in the sense it just it buys me time
onstage<00:02:14.570> to<00:02:15.350> do<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.739> so<00:02:16.070> while<00:02:16.250> my<00:02:16.430> singer<00:02:16.760> is

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
onstage to do this so while my singer is

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290

22-9<00:02:27.709> it's<00:02:27.920> like<00:02:28.040> one<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.250> my<00:02:28.760> favorite<00:02:29.120> delays

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
22-9 it's like one of my favorite delays

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.210 
22-9 it's like one of my favorite delays
I<00:02:29.570> remember<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.500> know<00:02:30.590> when<00:02:30.739> I<00:02:30.830> was<00:02:30.920> younger

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
rackmount 2290 for the first time and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.830 
rackmount 2290 for the first time and
how<00:02:36.640> gorgeous<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:38.030> sounded<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.569> I'm<00:02:38.630> back

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
then I didn't ever use the delay but I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.180 
then I didn't ever use the delay but I
knew<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.660> needed<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:42.110> have<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.410> but<00:02:42.920> I<00:02:42.980> didn't

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
knew I needed to have that but I didn't

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.150 
knew I needed to have that but I didn't
have<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.430> cash<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.450> now<00:02:45.140> I<00:02:45.170> do<00:02:45.440> in<00:02:45.769> the<00:02:45.860> Vettel

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
have the cash but now I do in the Vettel

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.190 
have the cash but now I do in the Vettel
here<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.450> using<00:02:48.079> that

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
here and so and so using that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.900 
here and so and so using that
combination<00:02:48.440> I'm<00:02:48.920> able<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.280> do<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.549> like

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
combination I'm able to do this like

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.789 
combination I'm able to do this like
rhythmic<00:02:50.750> thing<00:02:51.019> that<00:02:51.200> I'm<00:02:51.290> doing<00:02:51.440> right<00:02:51.739> now

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
rhythmic thing that I'm doing right now

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.420 
rhythmic thing that I'm doing right now
and<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.329> think<00:02:53.709> I'll<00:02:54.709> probably<00:02:54.920> call<00:02:55.250> this

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
and so I think I'll probably call this

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.280 
and so I think I'll probably call this
tone<00:02:55.850> print<00:02:56.120> sort<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:56.450> like<00:02:56.600> tailgating

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
tone print sort of like tailgating

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.979 
tone print sort of like tailgating
because<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:58.220> idea<00:02:58.519> behind<00:02:58.670> ISM<00:02:59.180> pretty

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
because of the idea behind ISM pretty

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.580 
because of the idea behind ISM pretty
much<00:03:00.140> chasing<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.840> delay<00:03:03.110> is<00:03:03.260> chasing

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
much chasing the the delay is chasing

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.530 
much chasing the the delay is chasing
the<00:03:03.890> riff<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:04.730> it's<00:03:04.910> kind<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.209> like<00:03:05.360> it's

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
the riff so it's kind of like it's

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.600 
the riff so it's kind of like it's
bumping<00:03:05.870> up<00:03:05.989> against<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.440> which<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:06.829> hence

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
bumping up against it which is hence

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:27.090 
bumping up against it which is hence
today<00:03:08.090> it's<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.079> cool

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.850 

good<00:03:28.100> that's<00:03:28.640> cool
