00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:33.840 

and<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.590> other<00:01:23.829> side

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.280 

and<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:34.510> guys<00:01:34.660> are<00:01:34.810> gonna<00:01:34.900> think<00:01:35.080> I'm<00:01:35.200> a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
and you guys are gonna think I'm a

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.870 
and you guys are gonna think I'm a
broken<00:01:35.620> record<00:01:35.710> because<00:01:36.220> I<00:01:36.340> say<00:01:36.520> this<00:01:36.700> all<00:01:36.850> the

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
broken record because I say this all the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.760 
broken record because I say this all the
time<00:01:36.970> but<00:01:37.570> it's<00:01:37.720> better<00:01:37.930> if<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.230> wiggle<00:01:38.470> the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
time but it's better if you wiggle the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.810 
time but it's better if you wiggle the
brush<00:01:38.920> back<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.370> forth<00:01:39.610> slightly<00:01:41.640> helps<00:01:42.640> to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
brush back and forth slightly helps to

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:55.440 
brush back and forth slightly helps to
coat<00:01:43.060> every<00:01:43.450> lash<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.680> let's<00:01:50.890> see<00:01:52.979> um<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.850> think

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
coat every lash so let's see um I think

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.620 
coat every lash so let's see um I think
it's<00:01:55.540> okay<00:01:55.840> um<00:01:56.680> it's<00:01:57.100> not<00:01:57.430> what<00:01:58.000> I<00:01:58.300> was<00:01:58.479> hoping

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
it's okay um it's not what I was hoping

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.950 
it's okay um it's not what I was hoping
for<00:01:58.870> it's<00:01:59.440> not<00:01:59.740> as<00:02:00.270> crazy<00:02:01.270> as<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:01.630> thought<00:02:01.660> it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
for it's not as crazy as I thought it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.660 
for it's not as crazy as I thought it
would<00:02:02.050> be<00:02:02.200> popular<00:02:02.770> athletes<00:02:03.220> mean<00:02:03.370> to<00:02:03.460> think

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
would be popular athletes mean to think

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.580 
would be popular athletes mean to think
that<00:02:03.760> it's<00:02:03.910> gonna<00:02:04.030> be<00:02:04.210> like<00:02:04.240> really<00:02:04.870> crazy<00:02:05.260> and

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
that it's gonna be like really crazy and

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.560 
that it's gonna be like really crazy and
I<00:02:05.979> guess<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.250> could<00:02:06.400> keep<00:02:06.550> applying<00:02:06.940> layers<00:02:07.210> if

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
I guess I could keep applying layers if

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.359 
I guess I could keep applying layers if
I<00:02:07.660> wanted<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:08.110> but<00:02:08.320> again<00:02:08.410> it's<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:08.920> hot<00:02:09.160> where

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
I wanted to but again it's so hot where

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.870 
I wanted to but again it's so hot where
work<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.840> dryer<00:02:11.310> mascara<00:02:12.310> I<00:02:12.459> feel<00:02:12.730> like

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
work it's a dryer mascara I feel like

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.660 
work it's a dryer mascara I feel like
it's<00:02:13.060> not<00:02:13.209> super<00:02:14.050> wet<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.530> like<00:02:15.070> wet<00:02:15.340> ones<00:02:15.550> I

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
it's not super wet I like wet ones I

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.830 
it's not super wet I like wet ones I
know<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.820> lot<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.000> people<00:02:16.240> don't<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.630> like

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
know a lot of people don't but I like

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.270 
know a lot of people don't but I like
really<00:02:17.050> wet<00:02:17.200> my<00:02:17.410> scares<00:02:17.709> I<00:02:17.860> feel<00:02:18.010> like<00:02:18.100> they

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
really wet my scares I feel like they

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.660 
really wet my scares I feel like they
look<00:02:18.459> better<00:02:18.700> um<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.630> prefer<00:02:20.560> plush<00:02:20.980> lash<00:02:21.250> I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
look better um I prefer plush lash I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.510 
look better um I prefer plush lash I
think<00:02:22.060> max<00:02:22.510> plush<00:02:22.810> lash<00:02:23.020> to<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.520> populations

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
think max plush lash to the populations

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.710
