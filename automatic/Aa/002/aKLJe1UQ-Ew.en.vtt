 of this emblem that is a desserts of 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.480
 very delicious Puerto Rican from a 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.940
 very nice texture resembling a flan 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.539
 but that cloying oven is pretty 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.539
 delicate 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.890
 and I do not understand but I'm not for the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.960
 chopping not like in my kitchen 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.360
 so how is it so difficult I decided 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.040
 buy the coconut meat that is coming 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.000
 frozen the packet like this in the 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.230
 Supermarket 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.290
 we are going to use two large cups 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.920
 and we're also going to use three quarters 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:44.150
 of milk cup I'm going to use my milk 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.920
 soy for this recipe this is flour 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:52.010
 of corn that is finite 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.070
 that here is called cons card is a 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.339
 very very finite flour that is used 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.230
 to thicken food despite 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.809
 that she is in Libya or is not thick 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.210
 pretty much everything we do sauce 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.080
 Desserts etc 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.530
 and we're also going to need a milk of 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.680
 coconut is already coming liquid not cream 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:20.020
 coconut milk and they will use the half cup 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.960
 I need my glasses 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.350
 let's also use half a cup of milk 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.350
 condensed 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.950
 few drops of lemon three little things of 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:37.570
 Lemon lemon peel 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:41.050
 let's use a pinch of salt and two 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:44.770
 spoonfuls of here I'm going to show you 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:49.530
 how is the shaking after what 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.970
 we have processed that according to the recipe and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.450
 slowly beating each of the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.940
 ingredients and thickening all the whole 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.280
 mixture 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.020
 now we 're going to let it cool down 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.910
 little before going to the goals 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.960
 greased and then we put it in the 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.840
 good fridge is ready and assemble them 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.430
 these annoying Catalan cream we are going to 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.240
 let cool a little before 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.390
 put it 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:21.030
 between 6 and 24 hours that's why I tell you that 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.700
 they can do it a noon before the 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.550
 the time to serve or a day before and 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.800
 you have it ready for 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.110
 a way to serve the temper that 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.910
 it can be toasting 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.790
