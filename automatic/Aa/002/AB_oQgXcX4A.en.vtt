00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
back to the original pattern so I'm

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.639

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
going to go to knit white pearl blue and

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.039 
going to go to knit white pearl blue and
I'm<00:01:28.799> always<00:01:28.979> dealing<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.670> pairs<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.539> stitches

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I'm always dealing in pairs of stitches

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.599 
I'm always dealing in pairs of stitches
so<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> good<00:01:32.579> look<00:01:32.759> at<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:32.999> row<00:01:33.299> now

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
so if I have a good look at this row now

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:36.499 
so if I have a good look at this row now
you'll<00:01:35.609> be<00:01:35.640> able<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.880> see<00:01:36.090> where<00:01:36.270> I've<00:01:36.359> made

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you'll be able to see where I've made

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.660 
you'll be able to see where I've made
the<00:01:36.719> color<00:01:36.929> changes<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.280> read<00:01:38.490> it

the color changes you have to read it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.709 
the color changes you have to read it
quite<00:01:38.939> hard<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.570> or<00:01:40.079> quite<00:01:40.439> carefully<00:01:41.719> there's

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
quite hard so or quite carefully there's

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.819

white white knit blue purl one two three

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.029 
white white knit blue purl one two three
four<00:01:47.579> five<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.450> them<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:49.530> there's<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> double

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
four five of them then there's a double

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.160 
four five of them then there's a double
blue<00:01:50.219> stitch<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.270> good<00:01:51.450> indicator<00:01:51.899> that

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
blue stitch that's a good indicator that

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.770 
blue stitch that's a good indicator that
that's<00:01:52.409> where<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> color<00:01:52.950> change<00:01:53.280> took<00:01:53.549> place

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
that's where the color change took place

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.410 
that's where the color change took place
then<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:54.929> blue<00:01:55.259> knit<00:01:55.530> white<00:01:55.890> purl<00:01:56.189> one<00:01:56.759> two

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
then it's blue knit white purl one two

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.489 
then it's blue knit white purl one two
three<00:01:58.200> four<00:01:59.069> five<00:02:00.049> there's<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> double

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499 
three four five there's the double

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.139 
three four five there's the double
stitch<00:02:01.770> that's<00:02:02.340> where<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.609> color<00:02:02.819> change

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
stitch that's where the color change

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.120 
stitch that's where the color change
took<00:02:03.359> place<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.499> there<00:02:04.649> are<00:02:04.740> two<00:02:04.950> more

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
took place and then there are two more

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.099 
took place and then there are two more
pairs<00:02:05.399> with<00:02:05.729> white<00:02:05.999> knits<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.600> blue<00:02:06.780> pearls

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
pairs with white knits and blue pearls

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.340 
pairs with white knits and blue pearls
so<00:02:07.950> we've<00:02:08.160> changed<00:02:08.520> color<00:02:09.030> over<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.720> section

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
so we've changed color over that section

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.820 
so we've changed color over that section
of<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> road<00:02:10.860> now<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> paint<00:02:11.760> rock<00:02:11.970> scarf

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
of the road now in the paint rock scarf

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.070 
of the road now in the paint rock scarf
we<00:02:13.830> actually<00:02:14.160> add<00:02:14.310> an<00:02:14.490> extra<00:02:15.050> degree<00:02:16.050> of

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
we actually add an extra degree of

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.600 
we actually add an extra degree of
interest<00:02:16.560> by<00:02:16.830> putting<00:02:17.130> some<00:02:17.310> reverse

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.210 
interest by putting some reverse
stocking<00:02:18.060> stitches<00:02:18.600> into<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.530> squares<00:02:19.920> of

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
stocking stitches into the squares of

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.060 
stocking stitches into the squares of
color<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:21.780> let's<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:22.260> set<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.590> hands<00:02:22.920> up

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
color so let's just set the hands up

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.300 
color so let's just set the hands up
again

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
again

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.030 
again
and<00:02:24.690> we're<00:02:25.690> going<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.959> match<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.470> colors<00:02:26.830> but

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
and we're going to match the colors but

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.610 
and we're going to match the colors but
not<00:02:27.099> necessarily<00:02:27.730> map<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.239> stitches<00:02:28.690> so

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
not necessarily map to the stitches so

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.190 
not necessarily map to the stitches so
I'm<00:02:29.709> going<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.040> knit<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.520> one<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.569> purl<00:02:31.959> that

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
I'm going to knit that one and purl that

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.589 
I'm going to knit that one and purl that
one<00:02:34.590> knit<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:38.860> one<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.390> now<00:02:40.390> I'm<00:02:40.480> at

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
one knit this that one and now I'm at

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.770 
one knit this that one and now I'm at
the<00:02:40.720> color<00:02:40.930> change<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.209> time<00:02:43.510> instead

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
the color change but this time instead

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.080 
the color change but this time instead
of<00:02:43.959> working<00:02:44.560> these<00:02:44.860> white<00:02:45.160> stitches<00:02:45.610> as<00:02:45.790> knits

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
of working these white stitches as knits

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.660 
of working these white stitches as knits
I'm<00:02:46.390> going<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.750> work<00:02:46.870> them<00:02:47.080> as<00:02:47.200> pearls<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:48.580> in

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
I'm going to work them as pearls so in

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.280 
I'm going to work them as pearls so in
actual<00:02:48.970> fact<00:02:49.180> my<00:02:49.480> yarn<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.140> right

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
actual fact my yarn is in the right

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.979 
actual fact my yarn is in the right
position<00:02:50.530> already<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.390> don't<00:02:52.450> have<00:02:52.810> to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
move it in order to knit the blue one so

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.320 
move it in order to knit the blue one so
when<00:02:57.190> I'm<00:02:57.280> actually<00:02:57.459> working<00:02:57.790> reversed
