the<00:02:13.930> guns<00:02:14.140> only<00:02:14.260> doing<00:02:14.560> 12<00:02:14.830> damage<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.519> it<00:02:15.879> is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the guns only doing 12 damage so it is

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.780 
the guns only doing 12 damage so it is

very very limited range wise which is

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
very very limited range wise which is
why<00:02:18.910> you're<00:02:19.060> going<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.209> want<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.480> run<00:02:19.660> around

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810

even say anything a certain distance so

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.820 
even say anything a certain distance so
I<00:02:31.299> really<00:02:31.959> don't<00:02:32.110> have<00:02:32.230> any<00:02:32.500> long-range

rather<00:02:34.780> run<00:02:35.260> with<00:02:35.470> one<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.799> the<00:02:35.920> mechanics

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
rather run with one of the mechanics

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
people at longer ranges is a good

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.990 
people at longer ranges is a good
alternative<00:02:40.780> but<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.860> being<00:02:42.099> said<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.790> gun

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
options so as long as you can get to

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.670 
options so as long as you can get to
that<00:02:46.390> engagement<00:02:46.569> distance<00:02:47.380> then<00:02:47.560> you're

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
that engagement distance then you're

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.500

because<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.950> just<00:03:15.129> doesn't<00:03:15.549> have<00:03:15.760> enough<00:03:16.299> ammo

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
because it just doesn't have enough ammo

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.479 
because it just doesn't have enough ammo
the<00:03:17.079> extended<00:03:17.590> mags<00:03:17.799> will<00:03:18.040> allow<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.340> to

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
the extended mags will allow you to

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.690 
the extended mags will allow you to
basically<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.269> 25<00:03:19.810> rounds<00:03:20.049> in<00:03:20.260> a<00:03:20.350> magazine

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
basically have 25 rounds in a magazine

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.979 
basically have 25 rounds in a magazine
26<00:03:21.700> with<00:03:21.880> one<00:03:22.120> in<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:22.359> chamber

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
26 with one in the chamber

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.420 
26 with one in the chamber
that'll<00:03:23.500> give<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.769> little<00:03:23.950> bit<00:03:24.100> better

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
that'll give you a little bit better

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.099 
that'll give you a little bit better
damage<00:03:25.000> potential<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.569> would<00:03:25.690> have<00:03:25.780> been<00:03:25.900> nice

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
damage potential it would have been nice

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
rounds in a magazine because that would

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.940 
rounds in a magazine because that would
have<00:03:30.670> one<00:03:31.090> been<00:03:31.359> more<00:03:31.569> realistic<00:03:32.139> into<00:03:32.500> made

dustbowl after the dust storm has
actually<00:03:41.049> passed<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.709> something<00:03:42.010> that

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
actually passed this is something that

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.309 
actually passed this is something that
you<00:03:42.250> don't<00:03:42.430> see<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:42.760> often<00:03:43.359> on<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.900> map<00:03:44.109> the

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
you don't see that often on the map the

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.199 
you don't see that often on the map the
dust<00:03:44.530> storm<00:03:44.799> usually<00:03:45.489> doesn't<00:03:45.669> roll<00:03:45.970> into

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
dust storm usually doesn't roll into

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.150 
dust storm usually doesn't roll into
like<00:03:46.569> the<00:03:46.720> very<00:03:46.959> end<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.530> round<00:03:47.739> and<00:03:48.069> then

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
like the very end of the round and then

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.129 
like the very end of the round and then
you<00:03:48.609> only<00:03:48.760> experience<00:03:49.090> this<00:03:49.389> kind<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.690> dusty

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139 
you only experience this kind of dusty

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.720 
you only experience this kind of dusty
looking<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.799> for<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.099> little<00:03:51.340> bit<00:03:51.489> but<00:03:51.700> I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
looking that for a little bit but I

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.339 
looking that for a little bit but I
actually<00:03:51.880> got<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.269> play<00:03:52.299> on<00:03:52.510> it<00:03:52.599> for<00:03:53.109> quite<00:03:53.290> a

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
actually got to play on it for quite a

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.349 
actually got to play on it for quite a
while<00:03:53.560> it<00:03:53.829> does<00:03:54.040> make<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.400> map<00:03:54.639> look<00:03:54.970> less

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
while it does make the map look less

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:57.629 
while it does make the map look less
attractive<00:03:55.959> kind<00:03:56.260> of<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.530> same<00:03:57.130> effect<00:03:57.519> you

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
attractive kind of the same effect you

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.460 
attractive kind of the same effect you
get<00:03:57.849> when<00:03:58.030> playing<00:03:58.299> siege<00:03:58.599> of<00:03:58.750> Shanghai<00:03:58.810> after

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
get when playing siege of Shanghai after

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.990 
get when playing siege of Shanghai after
the<00:03:59.560> skyscraper<00:04:00.099> comes<00:04:00.400> down<00:04:00.579> everything

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
the skyscraper comes down everything

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.089 
the skyscraper comes down everything
kind<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.239> turns<00:04:01.419> into<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.750> white<00:04:02.019> box<00:04:02.290> map<00:04:02.620> but

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
kind of turns into a white box map but

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.009 
kind of turns into a white box map but
it<00:04:03.220> is<00:04:03.370> still<00:04:03.669> kind<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.150> interesting<00:04:04.660> to<00:04:04.810> see

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
it is still kind of interesting to see

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.780 
it is still kind of interesting to see
unfortunately<00:04:05.620> when<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.280> dust<00:04:06.430> storm<00:04:06.669> is

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
unfortunately when the dust storm is

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.699 
unfortunately when the dust storm is
actually<00:04:07.060> going<00:04:07.269> on<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:07.660> map<00:04:07.930> you<00:04:08.200> think<00:04:08.620> it

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
actually going on this map you think it

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:09.809 
actually going on this map you think it
would<00:04:08.829> make<00:04:08.859> it<00:04:09.160> a<00:04:09.220> lot<00:04:09.370> better<00:04:09.519> for

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
would make it a lot better for

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.699 
would make it a lot better for
close-quarter<00:04:10.419> combat<00:04:10.450> but<00:04:11.139> it<00:04:11.349> essentially

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
close-quarter combat but it essentially

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.990 
close-quarter combat but it essentially
just<00:04:11.829> makes<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.310> really<00:04:12.519> hard<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.819> find

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
just makes it really hard to find

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.550 
just makes it really hard to find
anybody<00:04:13.419> and<00:04:13.780> then<00:04:13.930> if<00:04:14.049> you<00:04:14.169> happen<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.410> get

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
anybody and then if you happen to get

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.319 
anybody and then if you happen to get
spotted<00:04:14.919> you're<00:04:15.220> pretty<00:04:15.549> much<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.760> dead<00:04:16.120> man

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
spotted you're pretty much a dead man

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.759 
spotted you're pretty much a dead man
walking<00:04:16.599> because<00:04:17.049> you<00:04:17.169> can't<00:04:17.349> see<00:04:17.560> anything

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
walking because you can't see anything

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.400 
walking because you can't see anything
except<00:04:18.280> everybody<00:04:18.669> can<00:04:18.849> see<00:04:19.000> your<00:04:19.239> red<00:04:20.200> little

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
except everybody can see your red little

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.740 
except everybody can see your red little
triangle<00:04:20.919> just<00:04:21.370> fine<00:04:21.729> so<00:04:22.060> I'm<00:04:22.270> not<00:04:22.450> crazy

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
triangle just fine so I'm not crazy

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.570 
triangle just fine so I'm not crazy
about<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.229> death<00:04:23.409> storm<00:04:23.650> on<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:23.950> map<00:04:24.130> but<00:04:24.370> at

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
about the death storm on the map but at

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.459 
about the death storm on the map but at
least<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:25.000> doesn't<00:04:25.330> last<00:04:25.539> too<00:04:25.719> long<00:04:25.900> now<00:04:26.409> the

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:26.469 
least it doesn't last too long now the

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:27.629 
least it doesn't last too long now the
gas<00:04:26.710> grenade<00:04:27.039> gas<00:04:27.310> mask

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
gas grenade gas mask

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.339 
gas grenade gas mask
combo<00:04:27.999> was<00:04:28.180> one<00:04:28.389> of<00:04:28.479> my<00:04:28.569> favorites<00:04:29.050> in<00:04:29.229> this

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
combo was one of my favorites in this

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.409 
combo was one of my favorites in this
game<00:04:29.620> it<00:04:29.770> doesn't<00:04:30.129> give<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.430> instant

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
game it doesn't give you that instant

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.719 
game it doesn't give you that instant
kill<00:04:31.780> ability<00:04:32.409> necessarily<00:04:33.039> you<00:04:33.189> can<00:04:33.400> kill

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
kill ability necessarily you can kill

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.249 
kill ability necessarily you can kill
people<00:04:33.909> with<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.240> gas<00:04:34.419> grenade<00:04:34.749> it's<00:04:34.960> just

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
people with the gas grenade it's just

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.260 
people with the gas grenade it's just
very<00:04:35.409> hard<00:04:35.530> to<00:04:35.830> do<00:04:35.979> but<00:04:36.430> it<00:04:36.610> does<00:04:36.789> allow<00:04:36.939> you<00:04:37.150> to

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
very hard to do but it does allow you to

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.510 
very hard to do but it does allow you to
throw<00:04:37.870> grenades<00:04:38.229> at<00:04:38.379> your<00:04:38.529> feet<00:04:38.949> especially

throw grenades at your feet especially

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.950 
throw grenades at your feet especially
when<00:04:39.669> inside<00:04:40.029> of<00:04:40.150> a<00:04:40.210> building<00:04:40.569> this<00:04:40.659> can<00:04:40.840> be<00:04:40.930> a

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
when inside of a building this can be a

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.200 
when inside of a building this can be a
really<00:04:41.199> useful<00:04:41.400> defense<00:04:42.400> tactic<00:04:42.879> if<00:04:42.999> you<00:04:43.090> know

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
really useful defense tactic if you know

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.820 
really useful defense tactic if you know
somebody's<00:04:43.599> rushing<00:04:44.020> you<00:04:44.139> they<00:04:44.319> rush<00:04:44.560> into

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
somebody's rushing you they rush into

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.769 
somebody's rushing you they rush into
the<00:04:45.009> gas<00:04:45.189> grenade<00:04:45.550> obstructing<00:04:46.330> their<00:04:46.419> vision

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:46.779 
the gas grenade obstructing their vision

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:48.540 
the gas grenade obstructing their vision
and<00:04:46.870> making<00:04:47.199> them<00:04:47.319> take<00:04:47.469> double<00:04:47.889> damage<00:04:48.310> which

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
and making them take double damage which

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.459 
and making them take double damage which
allows<00:04:48.879> you<00:04:49.029> to<00:04:49.150> 2-shot<00:04:49.449> anybody<00:04:50.139> with<00:04:50.319> this

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:50.469 
allows you to 2-shot anybody with this

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:51.959 
allows you to 2-shot anybody with this
gun<00:04:50.710> very<00:04:50.740> quickly<00:04:51.249> and<00:04:51.520> if<00:04:51.580> they<00:04:51.729> have<00:04:51.819> any

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:51.969 
gun very quickly and if they have any

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:53.670 
gun very quickly and if they have any
damage<00:04:52.539> done<00:04:52.689> to<00:04:52.749> them<00:04:52.960> you're<00:04:53.349> gonna<00:04:53.439> kill

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
damage done to them you're gonna kill

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.830 
damage done to them you're gonna kill
them<00:04:53.800> so<00:04:54.159> insanely<00:04:54.669> fast<00:04:54.999> it's<00:04:55.330> just<00:04:55.449> crazy

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
them so insanely fast it's just crazy

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.989 
them so insanely fast it's just crazy
it's<00:04:56.409> also<00:04:56.560> great<00:04:56.830> for<00:04:57.039> building<00:04:57.249> clearing<00:04:57.849> or

00:04:57.989 --> 00:04:57.999 
it's also great for building clearing or

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.969 
it's also great for building clearing or
locating<00:04:58.870> enemies<00:04:59.319> so<00:04:59.469> you<00:04:59.529> throw<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.770> gas

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
locating enemies so you throw a gas

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.379 
locating enemies so you throw a gas
grenade<00:05:00.310> into<00:05:00.490> a<00:05:00.610> building<00:05:00.849> and<00:05:01.029> it<00:05:01.150> gives<00:05:01.300> you

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
grenade into a building and it gives you

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.760 
grenade into a building and it gives you
hit<00:05:01.539> markers<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:01.990> know<00:05:02.139> there's<00:05:02.289> somebody<00:05:02.590> in

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
hit markers you know there's somebody in

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.320 
hit markers you know there's somebody in
there<00:05:02.949> it's<00:05:03.340> harder<00:05:03.639> to<00:05:03.789> see<00:05:04.000> than<00:05:04.270> the

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
there it's harder to see than the

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.360 
there it's harder to see than the
incendiary<00:05:04.870> grenade<00:05:05.409> so<00:05:05.620> people<00:05:05.919> are<00:05:06.009> likely

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
incendiary grenade so people are likely

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.219 
incendiary grenade so people are likely
to<00:05:06.490> run<00:05:06.610> into<00:05:06.969> them<00:05:07.090> so<00:05:07.360> if<00:05:07.689> you<00:05:07.779> throw<00:05:08.020> them<00:05:08.080> at

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
to run into them so if you throw them at

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.869 
to run into them so if you throw them at
an<00:05:08.349> entry<00:05:08.770> point<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:09.159> a<00:05:09.189> building<00:05:09.610> and<00:05:09.789> you

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:09.879 
an entry point to a building and you

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.369 
an entry point to a building and you
don't<00:05:10.060> necessarily<00:05:10.180> get<00:05:10.689> hit<00:05:10.870> markers<00:05:11.199> right

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:11.379 
don't necessarily get hit markers right

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:13.260 
don't necessarily get hit markers right
off<00:05:11.469> the<00:05:11.620> bat<00:05:11.800> but<00:05:12.250> you<00:05:12.340> do<00:05:12.520> later<00:05:12.789> it<00:05:13.029> tells

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
off the bat but you do later it tells

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.730 
off the bat but you do later it tells
you<00:05:13.419> that<00:05:13.569> somebody<00:05:13.870> is<00:05:13.960> actually<00:05:14.110> moving

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
you that somebody is actually moving

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.350 
you that somebody is actually moving
into<00:05:15.099> that<00:05:15.189> building<00:05:15.580> or<00:05:15.699> moving<00:05:15.969> out<00:05:16.180> of<00:05:16.210> that

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
into that building or moving out of that

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.209 
into that building or moving out of that
building<00:05:16.659> granted<00:05:17.409> this<00:05:17.500> can<00:05:17.710> be<00:05:17.889> a<00:05:17.919> great<00:05:18.189> way

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
building granted this can be a great way

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.490 
building granted this can be a great way
to<00:05:18.370> thwart<00:05:18.909> novice<00:05:19.419> players<00:05:19.719> but<00:05:20.020> if<00:05:20.229> there's

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
to thwart novice players but if there's

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.230 
to thwart novice players but if there's
veterans<00:05:20.979> moving<00:05:21.339> around<00:05:21.550> and<00:05:21.849> they're<00:05:22.000> using

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
veterans moving around and they're using

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.570 
veterans moving around and they're using
gas<00:05:22.569> masks<00:05:22.990> can<00:05:23.379> be<00:05:23.500> a<00:05:23.529> great<00:05:23.860> way<00:05:24.099> to<00:05:24.129> trick

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
gas masks can be a great way to trick

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.219 
gas masks can be a great way to trick
somebody<00:05:24.789> out<00:05:25.089> especially<00:05:25.360> if<00:05:25.689> you<00:05:25.779> see<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:25.960> gas

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
somebody out especially if you see a gas

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.719 
somebody out especially if you see a gas
grenade<00:05:26.529> come<00:05:26.740> into<00:05:27.039> a<00:05:27.069> building<00:05:27.310> you<00:05:27.580> can

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
grenade come into a building you can

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.579 
grenade come into a building you can
hide<00:05:27.999> right<00:05:28.330> next<00:05:28.689> to<00:05:28.779> it<00:05:28.870> with<00:05:28.960> your<00:05:29.110> gas<00:05:29.289> mask

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:29.589 
hide right next to it with your gas mask

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:31.589 
hide right next to it with your gas mask
on<00:05:29.830> somebody<00:05:30.610> I'll<00:05:30.729> run<00:05:30.939> in<00:05:31.089> thinking<00:05:31.479> that

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
on somebody I'll run in thinking that

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.149 
on somebody I'll run in thinking that
nobody's<00:05:32.020> there<00:05:32.259> and<00:05:32.439> you<00:05:32.560> can<00:05:32.710> just<00:05:32.740> waste

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
nobody's there and you can just waste

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.010 
nobody's there and you can just waste
them<00:05:33.430> so<00:05:33.729> that<00:05:34.210> is<00:05:34.389> the<00:05:34.569> thing<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:34.839> have<00:05:34.960> to

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
them so that is the thing you have to

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.499 
them so that is the thing you have to
watch<00:05:35.259> out<00:05:35.500> for<00:05:35.740> but<00:05:36.069> if<00:05:36.490> you're<00:05:36.729> expecting<00:05:37.150> it

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
watch out for but if you're expecting it

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.420 
watch out for but if you're expecting it
or<00:05:37.629> you're<00:05:37.870> always<00:05:38.020> on<00:05:38.289> your<00:05:38.319> toes<00:05:38.500> thinking

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
or you're always on your toes thinking

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.769 
or you're always on your toes thinking
that<00:05:39.580> veteran<00:05:39.879> players<00:05:40.120> might<00:05:40.330> be<00:05:40.479> around

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
that veteran players might be around

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.240 
that veteran players might be around
hopefully<00:05:41.110> you<00:05:41.409> can<00:05:41.529> deal<00:05:41.740> with<00:05:41.770> them<00:05:42.039> because

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
hopefully you can deal with them because

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.029 
hopefully you can deal with them because
again<00:05:42.460> you<00:05:42.939> have<00:05:42.969> a<00:05:43.120> very<00:05:43.240> very<00:05:43.839> lethal<00:05:44.229> cqb

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
again you have a very very lethal cqb

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.679 
again you have a very very lethal cqb
weapon<00:05:45.069> the<00:05:45.669> iron<00:05:45.879> sights<00:05:46.089> on<00:05:46.240> this<00:05:46.360> gun<00:05:46.539> are

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:46.689 
weapon the iron sights on this gun are

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:48.659 
weapon the iron sights on this gun are
surprisingly<00:05:47.379> good<00:05:47.560> I<00:05:47.770> had<00:05:48.039> no<00:05:48.250> problem

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
surprisingly good I had no problem

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.790 
surprisingly good I had no problem
tracking<00:05:49.210> targets<00:05:49.659> with<00:05:49.810> it<00:05:49.960> obviously<00:05:50.560> a<00:05:50.589> red

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
tracking targets with it obviously a red

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.860 
tracking targets with it obviously a red
dot<00:05:51.009> would<00:05:51.219> be<00:05:51.370> somewhat<00:05:51.939> better<00:05:52.120> but<00:05:52.419> if<00:05:52.750> I

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
dot would be somewhat better but if I

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.139 
dot would be somewhat better but if I
had<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.349> run<00:05:53.560> without<00:05:54.159> a<00:05:54.189> red<00:05:54.460> dot<00:05:54.639> sight<00:05:54.939> this

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:55.149 
had to run without a red dot sight this

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:56.639 
had to run without a red dot sight this
would<00:05:55.330> certainly<00:05:55.539> be<00:05:55.870> one<00:05:56.020> of<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.229> guns<00:05:56.469> that

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:56.649 
would certainly be one of the guns that

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:58.439 
would certainly be one of the guns that
I<00:05:56.710> would<00:05:57.009> pick<00:05:57.189> to<00:05:57.219> do<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:57.610> with<00:05:57.759> especially

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
I would pick to do it with especially

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.300 
I would pick to do it with especially
considering<00:05:58.930> that<00:05:58.960> it's<00:05:59.289> still<00:05:59.529> a<00:05:59.800> great<00:06:00.069> gun

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
considering that it's still a great gun

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.010 
considering that it's still a great gun
for<00:06:00.550> hip<00:06:00.669> firing<00:06:01.000> so<00:06:01.180> if<00:06:01.330> you<00:06:01.449> don't<00:06:01.659> want<00:06:01.899> to

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
for hip firing so if you don't want to

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.990 
for hip firing so if you don't want to
use<00:06:02.139> the<00:06:02.289> iron<00:06:02.529> sights<00:06:02.740> you<00:06:03.159> don't<00:06:03.370> have<00:06:03.610> to

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000
