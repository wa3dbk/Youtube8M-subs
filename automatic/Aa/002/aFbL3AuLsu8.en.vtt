00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.229
 and then we're back with the next let's play means power again 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.900
 I thought about it now I want to explore a few caves 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:17.880
 and because of what his charring so far has existed in my area has been relative 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.150
 was uninteresting 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.369
 I have decided 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.369
 Heimann outpost you can trust 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.789
 Bohmann 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.479
 at the principle percent 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:32.770
 maybe Dorner 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.680
 to find a reasonably interesting cave 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.940
 Floor carpet Nemo I'm the same with this way 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.680
 and we look back there Cup I think I do not like markings 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.770
 set 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.260
 less history for me 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.300
 I do not know what that was anymore 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.910
 I hope 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.910
 that it is not a 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.400
 Place is where we find a few really nice raise 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.050
 Harburg I honestly just can not remember 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.020
 shrinking market 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.780
 went 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.980
 not off 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.280
 from the well still on the us futures Köthen is for me 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.590
 to press 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.590
 Ali defense not Jürgen outside percent 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.710
 leave what farmer 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.470
 Household my 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.200
 in a flat 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.010
 then they test us 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.010
 Cris foul that always forward he must be able to work 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.970
 Leoni you 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.970

 Emmendingen 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.689
 long 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.329
 they meant 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.329
 With 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:46.079
 Well 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.229
 Altena could 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.229
 min 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.849
 is 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.459
 it does not exist yet 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.719
 You have to be able to help somewhere 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.239
 Leg strength say so much 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.509
 Bracht the stands I have my garden 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.189

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.189
 The NATO troops is Mainz Bonn point 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.409
 Kehl 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.829
 m 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.199
 maybe I would have needed it for that 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.199
 to do both 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.499
 I could cross the water and Piero quickly Brian Horton with many 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.499
 beautiful mountains 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:30.240
 Hans Sturm clearly behind might be something 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.499
 No 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.919
 you have to say 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.419
 Name Heights Seats 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.610
 a whole 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.770
 Area in which I am here right education there is not so 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.360
 a lot of 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.279
 Among other things, I've already found myself in percent of him 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:14.279
 but not year 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.259
 what can I say 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.259
 Grossberg Digiden not really 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.720
 what we found 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.839
 both flynt 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:27.509
 what we found were in principle a few opponents and 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.039
 the few materials 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.650
 buy price 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.650
 What really interesting did not exist then 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.509
 Altach 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.240
 That sounds theoretically promising 

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:59.749
 Euro best at Kuhn 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.129
 You can see everywhere where mountains are 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.199
 there can be no question 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.199
 but does not have to 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.770
 Minute and further and look what's going on behind there, we are yes 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.639
 also recorded again 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:48.639
 bigger mountain 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:02.849
 that was not good 

00:07:03.809 --> 00:07:06.809
 rank 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.219
 Now this man is standing 

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:15.219
 she can not see 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:25.139
 WoW we should admonish Kristin Daleiden 

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.280
 personally at first glance, not really what's going on in hell 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.360
 going 

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.360
 before 

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.479
