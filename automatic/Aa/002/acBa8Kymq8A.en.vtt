00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:10.350
 Yahoo! Promotional ads are largely two approaches to attracting customers to your site 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:13.860
 Promote and support business success 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:20.369
 Display the ad on the type zaku result page 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:22.950
 People who are interested in sponsored search and your product service are browsing 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.920
 Display ads on content pages 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:31.340
 Interest match 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:33.170
 If you are using a sponsored search now, just display the ad in the search results ok 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.370
 Do not you think 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:42.750
 A sufficient display advertising opportunities are 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:48.180
 Do you want to make more effective advertising created by ingenuity? 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:53.790
 In addition to the ad display on the search results page, Yahoo! 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.860
 Ads can also be displayed on the content pages of major affiliate sites such as Japan 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.270
 I will 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:03.610
 The person who is looking for your goods service by this 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.300
 You can approach both people who are interested 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.600
 In addition to display ads on content pages 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:16.210
 It also makes it easy to connect to sales up 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:20.110
 Why do some people show ads on content pages to boost sales? 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:26.710
 Some people may feel they are connected 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:28.409
 Concretely, the flow to display the ad and achieve the purpose of the site is immediately 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:35.870
 I understand 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:43.240
 For example, assume that the ad's impressions, or ad's impressions, are 500th a month 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:47.380
 If 500 people see your ad, not all of them will click on your ad. 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.829
 Supposing ad click rate is that it was 2% 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:56.840
 20 people visit the web site a month 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:02:00.830
 How often do people who visit websites in a cell buy products ? 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.210
 If the conversion rate is 1% 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:10.069
 Only 0.12 a month leads to a purchase 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:16.310
 In this way , it will not be able to swear the old lawmaker of one step in 10 months 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:23.209
 In other words, such a CTR or conversion rate attracts customers that leads to increased sales 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:25.730
 In order to do that, it was important to have more opportunities to show your ad first 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.870
 It is to say 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:35.390
 Internet users also spend most of their time 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:41.959
 Do you know the fact that you are using it to browse content pages 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:44.569
 It has the seasoning and interest in your goods and services by displaying ads on content pages 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.210
 I have not searched yet 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:55.150
 You can push the back of such future customers 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:58.569
 It is more likely that you will come to your site, so it's better than just waiting to be searched 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.989

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:08.640
 Moreover, the advertisement was registered in the Sponsored Search 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:10.480
 It can also be displayed at fixed times, so it does not take time to create new advertisements 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.209
