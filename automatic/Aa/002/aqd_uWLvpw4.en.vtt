00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
solos I mean when I'm in a band and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.969 
solos I mean when I'm in a band and
we're<00:01:36.570> playing<00:01:36.780> songs<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.439> there's<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.680> part

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
we're playing songs and there's a part

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.219 
we're playing songs and there's a part
that<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.490> play<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.909> course<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:40.110> know

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
that I have to play of course you know

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.340 
that I have to play of course you know
but<00:01:40.850> in<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.119> right<00:01:42.360> right<00:01:42.720> makes<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
but in this one right right makes it the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.670 
but in this one right right makes it the
signature<00:01:43.799> song<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.570> exactly<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.560> as

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
signature song that it is exactly but as

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.530 
signature song that it is exactly but as
far<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> improvising<00:01:47.579> goes<00:01:47.759> I<00:01:48.000> think<00:01:48.450> you

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
far as the improvising goes I think you

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
far as the improvising goes I think you
have<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.750> take<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.079> step<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.979> open<00:01:50.490> up

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
have to take that step and just open up

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.600 
have to take that step and just open up
your<00:01:50.670> mind<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:52.259> let<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> flow<00:01:52.920> right

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
your mind and just let it flow right

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.090 
your mind and just let it flow right
through<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.570> then<00:01:54.840> try<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> put<00:01:55.920> that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
through you and then try to put that

passion and that feeling out to the
audience<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.149> know<00:02:00.659> that's<00:02:00.930> what<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.320> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
audience you know that's what I think is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.760 
audience you know that's what I think is
the<00:02:01.469> most<00:02:01.649> important<00:02:02.100> thing<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.409> can

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the most important thing and if you can

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.100 
the most important thing and if you can
do<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.630> past<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.350> point<00:02:07.950> of

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
do that and and get past that point of

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.290 
do that and and get past that point of
nervousness<00:02:09.860> is<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.340> think<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:10.820> would<00:02:11.000> usually

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
nervousness is I think it would usually

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.780 
nervousness is I think it would usually
is<00:02:11.600> for<00:02:11.750> most<00:02:11.930> people<00:02:12.050> just<00:02:12.500> take<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.340> step

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
is for most people just take that step

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.630 
is for most people just take that step
you<00:02:14.120> know<00:02:14.270> because<00:02:14.840> it's<00:02:15.040> staying<00:02:16.040> there<00:02:16.340> and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
you know because it's staying there and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:25.060 
you know because it's staying there and
playing<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.180> know<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:24.080> know<00:02:24.260> that's<00:02:24.740> a<00:02:24.860> cool

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
playing you know you know that's a cool

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.280 
playing you know you know that's a cool
thing<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.430> do<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.270> learn<00:02:26.480> those<00:02:26.720> solos<00:02:27.110> at

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
thing to do and to learn those solos at

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.530 
thing to do and to learn those solos at
one<00:02:27.530> point<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:28.100> had<00:02:28.550> tried<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.880> memorize<00:02:29.120> as

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
one point I had tried to memorize as

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.930 
one point I had tried to memorize as
many<00:02:29.570> Little<00:02:30.140> Walter<00:02:30.260> Souls<00:02:30.710> as<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.070> could<00:02:31.310> and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
many Little Walter Souls as I could and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.530 
many Little Walter Souls as I could and
I'm<00:02:32.510> sure<00:02:33.340> sometimes<00:02:34.340> those<00:02:34.820> come<00:02:35.060> out<00:02:35.240> now

you<00:02:35.570> know<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.770> I<00:02:37.840> think<00:02:38.840> it's<00:02:39.020> better<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.380> if

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860
