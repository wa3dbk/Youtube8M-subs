00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:35.750
 a pa created by gianpi that's who it is 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.080
 this one 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:43.330
 that for nothing but I don't know now let's see 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.330
 up the stairs captain 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.070
 in canada 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.899
 ok player one here and I gave him the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.440
 2 of what is played multiplayer 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.769
 then 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.769
 read all signs in utah ti 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.089
 helps the ingot techfor gianpi is the 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:09.250
 word 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.229
 but for it it is speculating laws and rules 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.829
 immediately to your left on a wall 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.210
 these would be the rules we read now 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:21.719
 bad rules you have to press the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.719
 second explosive trigger button 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.720
 press buttons people bullet 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.550
 according to the time it takes us to stop 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.960
 activate the attention button though 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.410
 nothing is defined as the distance from the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:37.330
 body to win you have to use 800 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.330
 points to use all the motions 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.820
 in fine right out of the not today 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.920
 missing in the dough is played 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.950
 the survival mode is in peaceful ok I don't 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.079
 I'm the only way 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.079
 because I have to try the whole saint 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.620
 leave the motorcycle machines alone 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.400
 this can be useful for you to see 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:10.530
 better you can see them apart 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:14.910
 huge trees you can see the dots 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.050
 180 and 50 we will have to hit those 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.600
 pour this on the side of the 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:26.130
 player a part of the player 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.130
 so I said two ok for the wall 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.570
 I make myself say better and it is hardly possible 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.060
 sorry the minecraft sometimes yes 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.860
 populates 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.290
 so 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.879
 so 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.709
 this is the activation button 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.709
 this bullet is no explosives 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.130
 here are the tnt cleaning 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.640
 I gave only in Greece so it is not 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.640
 that I 'm leaving so much 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.970
 Leedens with a theme are almost mine 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.810
 paper then you see why it's written here 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.510
 to set up new personnel use the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.100
 rails but first take the colored wool 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.320
 in the certainty that they are there 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.810
 but not yet as I said before 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:27.710
 I also show you what I feel then 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.710
 let's put aicraft 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.780
 which tlt to connect the cannon 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.299
 if you want to see how to make a 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.299
 cannon of the genus 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.160
 go to see my tutorial on how 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:51.080
 let's make a tnt canoe then we come 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.080
 explosive trigger let's wait a while 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.569
 improves look 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.219
 ok i didn't get anything 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.219
 but that demonstration I can do 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.020
 clear 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.980
 mum 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.980
 and if I do so 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.019
 once they managed to get them 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.000
 I understood 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.110
 shit glory 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:56.810
 yes no cabbage for little excuse me and now 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.810
 race are to do this thing 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.909
 something or not the cabbage thing 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.190
 mah na mah na mah 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.120
 I know if I can't 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.530
 to this blow 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.249
 no oh well 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.249
 but I hit him 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:41.180
 the target breaks so much 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.180
 to football to encaustic 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.720
 you buy so or even more 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:06:00.540
 to take our karts and our 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.540
 wool 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.880
 and then they are tracks from over rails you see 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.090
 must have gone may be broken on 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.910
 number 100 or if the number 80 is broken 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.380
 or 50 in our case above all 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.300
 50's corrupted so we'll go 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.940
 out of four if they ever get sick here 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.310
 paper we leave 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.740
 the only thing is that you can let it down 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.200
 of hearts because the tap in and bass has it 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.680
 made a little lower a thing that does not 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.000
 I like it 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.000
 how fucked up 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.540
 all right 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:50.880
 I understood however this way 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:52.210
 let's see if I remember it becomes so totÃ² it is 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:57.569
 optional 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.569
 obvious that you are optional anyway 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.780
 c 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.780
 Hello 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.370
 let's go find ourselves for safety 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.370
 here 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:24.149
 I think he showed everything though 

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:24.149
 try doing another 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.099
 but another shot though I doubt 

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.180
 cazzola 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.110
 I've done it 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:45.440

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:45.440
