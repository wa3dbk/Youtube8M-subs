squirrel and I just had like given up I
think<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.360> because<00:00:15.419> they're<00:00:15.629> in<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.809> room

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
noticed right away it was I only had

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.620 
noticed right away it was I only had
like<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.690> couple<00:01:04.050> of<00:01:04.170> pieces<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.550> that<00:01:06.300> it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
like a couple of pieces of it that it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.649 
like a couple of pieces of it that it
probably<00:01:06.990> was<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:07.470> right<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.700> me<00:01:08.760> my<00:01:09.210> system

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
probably was not right for me my system

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.290 
probably was not right for me my system
so<00:01:10.229> i<00:01:10.560> shelved<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.790> quick<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.270> possible

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
so i shelved that as quick as possible

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.850 
so i shelved that as quick as possible
and<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> was<00:01:12.869> actually<00:01:13.050> very<00:01:13.229> glad<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.650> my

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and it was actually very glad that my

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.149 
and it was actually very glad that my
husband<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.570> devoured<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.979> he<00:01:17.130> did

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
husband you know devoured it like he did

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.680 
husband you know devoured it like he did
so<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.820> didn't<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> worry<00:01:18.420> about<00:01:18.540> it

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
so I didn't have to worry about it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.260 
so I didn't have to worry about it
calling<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.110> name<00:01:19.170> as<00:01:19.500> far<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.369> nuts<00:01:20.729> yes<00:01:21.090> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
calling my name as far as nuts yes I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.630 
calling my name as far as nuts yes I
think<00:01:21.649> macadamia<00:01:22.649> nuts<00:01:22.860> probably<00:01:23.399> should<00:01:23.520> not

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
think macadamia nuts probably should not

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.820 
think macadamia nuts probably should not
be<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:24.030> house<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.530> able<00:01:25.649> to

the verdicts still out on that one I'm

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.020 
the verdicts still out on that one I'm
still<00:02:18.320> trying<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.680> decide<00:02:18.770> because<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.970> do

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
still trying to decide because I do

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.000 
still trying to decide because I do
believe<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.690> it's<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.050> good<00:02:21.350> nut<00:02:21.620> for<00:02:21.860> your

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
believe that it's a good nut for your

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.059 
believe that it's a good nut for your
system<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.520> also<00:02:22.670> it's

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
system and also it's

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.119 
system and also it's
it's<00:02:24.579> a<00:02:24.640> good<00:02:24.819> fat<00:02:25.090> for<00:02:25.359> your<00:02:25.480> system<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.129> I'm

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
it's a good fat for your system so I'm

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.379 
it's a good fat for your system so I'm
still<00:02:27.400> trying<00:02:27.609> to<00:02:27.700> determine<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:28.150> because

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:28.389 
still trying to determine that because

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.000 
still trying to determine that because
i'm<00:02:28.450> not<00:02:28.629> sure<00:02:28.810> if<00:02:28.959> maybe<00:02:29.170> it's<00:02:29.739> still<00:02:29.950> a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
i'm not sure if maybe it's still a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.489 
i'm not sure if maybe it's still a
trigger<00:02:30.370> for<00:02:30.459> me<00:02:30.639> to<00:02:30.760> want<00:02:30.999> to<00:02:31.180> then<00:02:31.359> eat<00:02:31.629> more

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:32.499 
trigger for me to want to then eat more

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.700 
trigger for me to want to then eat more
food<00:02:32.829> or<00:02:33.099> other<00:02:33.159> foods<00:02:34.049> besides<00:02:35.049> the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
food or other foods besides the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.700 
food or other foods besides the
they<00:02:37.310> also<00:02:37.460> had<00:02:37.670> some<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.880> those<00:02:37.970> last<00:02:38.270> night

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
they also had some of those last night

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.220 
they also had some of those last night
too<00:02:39.710> so<00:02:40.130> that's<00:02:41.120> why<00:02:41.300> I'm<00:02:41.420> thinking<00:02:41.780> nuts<00:02:42.020> may

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
too so that's why I'm thinking nuts may

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.170 
too so that's why I'm thinking nuts may
be<00:02:42.290> just<00:02:42.830> as<00:02:42.950> too<00:02:43.100> much<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.400> trigger<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.880> the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
be just as too much of a trigger of the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.660 
be just as too much of a trigger of the
wanting<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.990> nibble<00:02:45.170> once<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.710> start<00:02:46.070> delving

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
wanting to nibble once I start delving

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.430 
wanting to nibble once I start delving
into<00:02:46.940> that

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
into that

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.600 
into that
and<00:02:48.780> besides<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.410> think<00:02:50.680> also<00:02:50.890> with<00:02:51.190> p3

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
and besides that I think also with p3

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.730 
and besides that I think also with p3
why<00:02:51.790> messed<00:02:52.120> up<00:02:52.270> was<00:02:52.420> because<00:02:52.680> even<00:02:53.680> though

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
why messed up was because even though

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.500 
why messed up was because even though
there's<00:02:53.920> wonderful<00:02:54.280> recipes<00:02:54.970> out<00:02:55.120> there<00:02:55.180> for

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
there's wonderful recipes out there for

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.780 
there's wonderful recipes out there for
p3<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.710> people<00:02:56.980> that<00:02:57.130> have<00:02:57.340> made<00:02:57.520> them

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
p3 and the people that have made them

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.880 
p3 and the people that have made them
have<00:02:58.180> been<00:02:58.390> very<00:02:58.900> kind<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.470> share<00:02:59.710> them<00:02:59.860> with

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
have been very kind to share them with

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.730 
have been very kind to share them with
us<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.430> think<00:03:01.330> because<00:03:01.600> p3<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.170> normally

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
us I think because p3 is normally

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.870 
us I think because p3 is normally
expected<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.610> be<00:03:03.760> like<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.090> three-week

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
expected to be like a three-week

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.090 
expected to be like a three-week
situation<00:03:06.990> you<00:03:07.990> don't<00:03:08.200> suddenly<00:03:08.680> start

making that stuff like the day you go

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.740 
making that stuff like the day you go
