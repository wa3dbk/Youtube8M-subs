these<00:02:38.600> turning<00:02:39.350> pieces<00:02:39.680> on<00:02:39.799> it<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:41.090> can<00:02:41.269> never

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
these turning pieces on it you can never

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.390 
these turning pieces on it you can never
gather<00:02:41.630> ones<00:02:41.900> just<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.590> put<00:02:42.769> them<00:02:42.890> on<00:02:43.010> there<00:02:43.190> for

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
gather ones just I put them on there for

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.750 
gather ones just I put them on there for
whatever<00:02:43.700> reason<00:02:45.160> that's<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.280> first<00:02:46.489> part<00:02:46.670> of

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
whatever reason that's the first part of

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.240 
whatever reason that's the first part of
the<00:02:46.850> attack<00:02:47.090> ring<00:02:47.590> you're<00:02:48.590> going<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.769> get<00:02:48.829> a<00:02:48.890> 4

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
the attack ring you're going to get a 4

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.250 
the attack ring you're going to get a 4
by<00:02:49.400> 4<00:02:50.380> i'm<00:02:51.380> going<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.620> put<00:02:51.769> on<00:02:51.980> here<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:54.170> the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
by 4 i'm going to put on here in the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.690 
by 4 i'm going to put on here in the
middle<00:02:54.440> in<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:54.920> middle<00:02:55.100> space<00:02:55.340> cuz<00:02:55.579> there

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
middle in that middle space cuz there

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.699 
middle in that middle space cuz there
should<00:02:55.850> have<00:02:55.880> been<00:02:56.019> enough<00:02:57.019> for<00:02:57.079> full<00:02:57.410> before

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
should have been enough for full before

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.610 
should have been enough for full before
then<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.459> have<00:02:58.730> this<00:02:58.880> little<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.900> layer<00:03:00.230> drop

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
then you have this little to layer drop

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.460 
then you have this little to layer drop
right<00:03:00.950> there<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.370> middle<00:03:01.519> on<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.269> back

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
right there in the middle on the back

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.979 
right there in the middle on the back
you're<00:03:03.470> going<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.650> get<00:03:03.829> 4<00:03:04.790> 2<00:03:05.030> by<00:03:05.209> 3<00:03:05.239> you're

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
you're going to get 4 2 by 3 you're

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.160 
you're going to get 4 2 by 3 you're
going<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.170> put<00:03:06.320> them<00:03:06.410> around<00:03:06.560> like<00:03:06.920> so<00:03:07.959> just<00:03:08.959> so

in<00:03:29.480> that's<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.720> attack<00:03:30.990> thing<00:03:31.940> pretty<00:03:32.940> heavy

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
in that's the attack thing pretty heavy

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.010 
in that's the attack thing pretty heavy
for<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:35.040> attack<00:03:35.600> now<00:03:36.600> i'm<00:03:36.720> going<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.930> make

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
for this attack now i'm going to make

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.360 
for this attack now i'm going to make
the<00:03:37.140> bitch<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:37.980> just<00:03:38.160> simple<00:03:38.790> 2<00:03:39.300> x<00:03:39.420> 2<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:41.340> x

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
the bitch it it's just simple 2 x 2 to x

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.570 
the bitch it it's just simple 2 x 2 to x
two<00:03:42.200> circular<00:03:43.200> two<00:03:43.290> by<00:03:43.410> two<00:03:43.470> regular<00:03:44.280> tip<00:03:44.430> i<00:03:44.520> do

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
two circular two by two regular tip i do

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.480 
two circular two by two regular tip i do
but<00:03:45.180> i<00:03:45.240> prefer<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.630> use<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.930> spending<00:03:46.230> ones

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
but i prefer to use the spending ones

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.160 
but i prefer to use the spending ones
because<00:03:47.490> i'm<00:03:47.640> pretty<00:03:47.940> sure<00:03:48.180> upgrades<00:03:48.930> attack

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
because i'm pretty sure upgrades attack

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.330 
because i'm pretty sure upgrades attack
power<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:50.330> it<00:03:51.330> also<00:03:51.480> looks<00:03:51.870> cool<00:03:52.110> so<00:03:52.440> there<00:03:52.680> so

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
power and it also looks cool so there so

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.470 
power and it also looks cool so there so
then<00:03:53.640> you're<00:03:53.730> gonna<00:03:53.820> put<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.360> middle

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
then you're gonna put it in the middle

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.930 
then you're gonna put it in the middle
once<00:03:54.780> you've<00:03:54.900> made<00:03:55.080> that<00:03:55.110> and<00:03:55.550> you<00:03:56.550> catch<00:03:56.790> your

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
once you've made that and you catch your

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.930 
once you've made that and you catch your
attacker<00:03:57.210> in<00:03:57.540> your<00:03:57.660> bit<00:03:57.780> chip<00:03:57.990> and<00:03:58.860> see<00:03:59.730> I've

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
attacker in your bit chip and see I've

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.880 
attacker in your bit chip and see I've
really<00:04:00.270> just<00:04:00.300> made<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.780> latest<00:04:01.110> cuz<00:04:01.410> i<00:04:01.590> really

think you guys can figure that out you
just<00:04:03.780> get<00:04:03.990> a<00:04:04.220> circular<00:04:05.220> four<00:04:05.490> by<00:04:05.640> four<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.180> you

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
just get a circular four by four and you

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.470 
just get a circular four by four and you
get<00:04:07.170> four<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.040> these<00:04:08.370> four<00:04:08.880> by<00:04:09.000> four<00:04:09.240> curved

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
get four of these four by four curved

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.920 
get four of these four by four curved
pieces<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:11.670> you<00:04:12.240> just<00:04:12.420> stick<00:04:12.690> them<00:04:12.780> all

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
pieces and you just stick them all

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.190 
pieces and you just stick them all
around<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.560> can<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.740> circle<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:15.420> then<00:04:15.690> for<00:04:16.140> the

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
around you can a circle and then for the

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.470 
around you can a circle and then for the
running<00:04:16.380> for<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:17.430> just<00:04:17.580> get<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.760> normal<00:04:17.940> two<00:04:18.299> by

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
running for you just get a normal two by

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.720 
running for you just get a normal two by
two<00:04:19.310> flat<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.790> know<00:04:21.140> then<00:04:22.140> you<00:04:22.230> get<00:04:22.730> tall

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
two flat you know then you get tall

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.700 
two flat you know then you get tall
circular<00:04:24.300> two<00:04:24.450> by<00:04:24.600> two<00:04:25.640> you<00:04:26.640> put<00:04:26.880> it<00:04:27.000> on<00:04:27.590> two<00:04:28.590> by

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
circular two by two you put it on two by

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.580 
circular two by two you put it on two by
two<00:04:28.770> like<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.990> then<00:04:31.020> you're<00:04:31.320> going<00:04:31.410> to<00:04:31.470> get

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
two like so and then you're going to get

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.570 
two like so and then you're going to get
a<00:04:31.650> one<00:04:31.919> by<00:04:32.070> one<00:04:33.890> you<00:04:34.890> can't<00:04:35.070> really<00:04:35.190> see<00:04:35.310> that

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
a one by one you can't really see that

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.960 
a one by one you can't really see that
well<00:04:35.760> but<00:04:36.090> yeah<00:04:37.220> you<00:04:38.220> know<00:04:38.280> what<00:04:38.490> i<00:04:38.610> wanted<00:04:38.850> and

well but yeah you know what i wanted and
then<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.180> just<00:04:39.360> put<00:04:39.540> it<00:04:39.630> in<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.870> middle<00:04:40.020> of

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
then you just put it in the middle of

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.220 
then you just put it in the middle of
the<00:04:40.530> second<00:04:41.130> infographic<00:04:41.669> it's<00:04:42.360> not<00:04:42.630> you<00:04:42.960> get

to<00:04:47.910> running<00:04:48.000> core<00:04:48.360> in<00:04:48.480> the<00:04:48.570> middle<00:04:48.840> of<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
to running core in the middle of the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.820 
to running core in the middle of the
white<00:04:49.230> disc<00:04:49.580> like<00:04:50.580> so<00:04:51.380> you're<00:04:52.380> gonna<00:04:52.620> keep
