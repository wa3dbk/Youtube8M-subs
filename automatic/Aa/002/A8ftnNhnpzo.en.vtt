nether well apart from the end account
but<00:00:14.590> you<00:00:14.980> never<00:00:15.130> know

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
but you never know

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.580 
but you never know
could<00:00:15.759> be<00:00:15.910> another<00:00:16.150> theme<00:00:16.420> as<00:00:16.689> opposed<00:00:17.080> but

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
could be another theme as opposed but

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.200 
could be another theme as opposed but
anyway<00:00:17.830> so<00:00:17.890> to<00:00:18.400> start<00:00:18.610> off<00:00:18.700> we're<00:00:18.880> gonna<00:00:18.970> show

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
anyway so to start off we're gonna show

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.909 
anyway so to start off we're gonna show
you<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.360> know<00:00:19.509> the<00:00:19.630> cow<00:00:19.779> itself<00:00:20.140> which<00:00:20.770> is

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:20.919 
you the know the cow itself which is

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:22.470 
you the know the cow itself which is
very<00:00:21.099> fitting<00:00:21.340> considering<00:00:21.759> we're<00:00:22.270> in<00:00:22.390> the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
very fitting considering we're in the

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.830 
very fitting considering we're in the
nether

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
nether

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.810 
nether
so<00:00:23.349> these<00:00:23.890> cows<00:00:24.189> actually<00:00:24.520> have<00:00:24.640> a<00:00:24.669> load

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
so these cows actually have a load

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.760 
so these cows actually have a load
different<00:00:25.149> features<00:00:25.570> which<00:00:25.899> make<00:00:26.140> them<00:00:26.290> very

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
different features which make them very

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.069 
different features which make them very
different<00:00:27.250> normal<00:00:27.640> cowls<00:00:27.849> so<00:00:28.509> how<00:00:29.020> you

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
different normal cowls so how you

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.900 
different normal cowls so how you
actually<00:00:29.290> obtain<00:00:29.529> another<00:00:30.009> cow<00:00:30.250> is<00:00:30.489> that<00:00:30.700> when

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
actually obtain another cow is that when

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.420 
actually obtain another cow is that when
you<00:00:31.090> kill<00:00:31.360> a<00:00:31.390> zombie<00:00:31.630> pigman<00:00:32.230> there's<00:00:32.680> a<00:00:32.770> 5%

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
you kill a zombie pigman there's a 5%

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.240 
you kill a zombie pigman there's a 5%
chance<00:00:33.760> it'll<00:00:34.270> drop<00:00:34.870> am<00:00:35.230> know<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.920> cow<00:00:36.070> egg

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
chance it'll drop am know the cow egg

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.480 
chance it'll drop am know the cow egg
and<00:00:36.460> when<00:00:36.700> you<00:00:36.790> kill<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.080> ghast<00:00:38.080> there's<00:00:38.650> a<00:00:38.770> 25%

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.490 
and when you kill a ghast there's a 25%

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.160 
and when you kill a ghast there's a 25%
chance<00:00:39.550> that<00:00:39.880> your<00:00:39.970> drop<00:00:40.000> another<00:00:40.360> cow<00:00:40.570> egg<00:00:40.720> so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
chance that your drop another cow egg so

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.290 
chance that your drop another cow egg so
that's<00:00:41.320> useful<00:00:41.470> to<00:00:41.770> know<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:42.580> the<00:00:42.910> first<00:00:43.120> week

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
that's useful to know so the first week

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.520 
that's useful to know so the first week
I'm<00:00:43.420> going<00:00:43.510> to<00:00:43.600> show<00:00:43.690> you<00:00:43.750> is<00:00:43.930> that<00:00:44.140> when<00:00:44.380> these

I'm going to show you is that when these
cows<00:00:44.800> walk<00:00:45.100> over<00:00:45.400> soul<00:00:45.610> sound<00:00:45.880> to<00:00:46.300> have<00:00:46.420> placed

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
cows walk over soul sound to have placed

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.720 
cows walk over soul sound to have placed
down<00:00:46.750> some<00:00:46.960> salt<00:00:47.170> on<00:00:47.290> here<00:00:47.560> you<00:00:48.310> can<00:00:48.490> see<00:00:48.610> the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
down some salt on here you can see the

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.640 
down some salt on here you can see the
nether<00:00:48.940> warts<00:00:49.210> grow<00:00:49.450> so<00:00:50.020> if<00:00:50.110> you<00:00:50.260> want<00:00:50.440> to<00:00:50.530> get

nether warts grow so if you want to get

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.840 
nether warts grow so if you want to get
loads<00:00:50.800> another<00:00:50.980> water<00:00:51.250> instead<00:00:51.670> of<00:00:51.730> just

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
loads another water instead of just

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.370 
loads another water instead of just
making<00:00:52.000> another<00:00:52.240> walk<00:00:52.510> farm<00:00:52.750> you<00:00:53.110> can<00:00:53.200> just

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
making another walk farm you can just

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.690 
making another walk farm you can just
use<00:00:53.500> these<00:00:53.620> cows<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.190> they'll<00:00:54.340> quit<00:00:54.550> some

use these cows and they'll quit some

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.220 
use these cows and they'll quit some
another<00:00:54.850> walk<00:00:55.060> for<00:00:55.239> you<00:00:55.390> although<00:00:55.870> they<00:00:56.110> don't

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
another walk for you although they don't

another walk for you although they don't
fully<00:00:56.650> grow<00:00:56.980> they're<00:00:57.370> just<00:00:57.550> planting<00:00:58.420> them<00:00:58.510> I

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
fully grow they're just planting them I

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.830 
fully grow they're just planting them I
suppose

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
suppose

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.740 
suppose
and<00:00:59.050> the<00:00:59.860> next<00:01:00.579> feature<00:01:00.760> is<00:01:00.880> that<00:01:01.090> if<00:01:01.300> you

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
and the next feature is that if you

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.780 
and the next feature is that if you
right-click<00:01:02.050> with<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.680> water<00:01:02.860> bowl<00:01:03.070> on<00:01:03.250> the

right-click with the water bowl on the

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.009 
right-click with the water bowl on the
cow<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.239> we<00:01:04.269> just<00:01:04.479> close<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.659> gate<00:01:04.869> so

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
cow and we just close the gate so

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.960 
cow and we just close the gate so
they're<00:01:05.140> in<00:01:05.229> an<00:01:05.290> escape<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.979> you<00:01:06.670> can<00:01:06.790> see<00:01:06.939> I

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
they're in an escape and you can see I

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.730 
they're in an escape and you can see I
get<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.299> potion<00:01:07.540> now<00:01:08.170> you<00:01:08.229> can<00:01:08.380> either<00:01:08.470> get<00:01:08.620> an

awkward<00:01:09.010> potion<00:01:09.370> a<00:01:09.490> fire<00:01:10.120> resistance<00:01:10.479> potion

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:10.870 
awkward potion a fire resistance potion

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.710 
awkward potion a fire resistance potion
or<00:01:11.020> if<00:01:11.650> you're<00:01:11.950> very<00:01:12.159> lucky<00:01:12.370> and<00:01:12.720> invisibility

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
potion but those are very rare so you

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.880 
potion but those are very rare so you
not<00:01:15.520> like<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.790> get<00:01:15.940> those<00:01:16.120> so<00:01:17.080> it<00:01:17.620> looks<00:01:17.770> like

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
finally I've got a fire resistance just

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.289 
finally I've got a fire resistance just
to<00:01:21.040> prove<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.460> I'm<00:01:21.820> actually<00:01:22.030> saying

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.360 
yeah that's awesome - and finally I
can't<00:03:02.500> really<00:03:02.590> show<00:03:02.800> you<00:03:02.830> this<00:03:02.980> because<00:03:03.250> we're

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
can't really show you this because we're

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.160 
can't really show you this because we're
in<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.490> nether<00:03:03.670> but<00:03:03.910> these<00:03:04.630> cows<00:03:05.020> are

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
in the nether but these cows are

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.810 
in the nether but these cows are
actually<00:03:05.410> very<00:03:05.620> vulnerable<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.280> water<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.760> if

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
actually very vulnerable to water so if

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.430 
actually very vulnerable to water so if
you<00:03:06.940> spawn<00:03:07.180> water<00:03:07.420> on<00:03:07.600> them<00:03:07.750> they'll<00:03:08.140> actually

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
you spawn water on them they'll actually

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.510 
you spawn water on them they'll actually
die<00:03:08.680> which<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:09.010> a<00:03:09.040> bit<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.280> shame

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
die which is a bit of a shame

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.160 
die which is a bit of a shame
considering<00:03:09.970> you'll<00:03:10.180> have<00:03:10.300> to<00:03:10.420> have<00:03:10.510> killed

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
considering you'll have to have killed

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.420 
considering you'll have to have killed
the<00:03:11.290> ender<00:03:11.500> dragon<00:03:11.740> to<00:03:11.830> get<00:03:11.980> them<00:03:12.130> you<00:03:12.310> don't

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
the ender dragon to get them you don't

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.770 
the ender dragon to get them you don't
want<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.610> kill<00:03:12.760> them<00:03:12.850> instantly<00:03:13.150> afterwards<00:03:13.510> -

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
want to kill them instantly afterwards -

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.380 
want to kill them instantly afterwards -
unless<00:03:14.440> you're<00:03:14.650> really<00:03:14.920> evil<00:03:15.430> but<00:03:15.730> anyway<00:03:16.000> so

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
unless you're really evil but anyway so

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.210

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
yeah on to the next cow which is very

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.060 
yeah on to the next cow which is very
interesting<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.880> this<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.209> ender<00:03:19.570> cow<00:03:20.070> so

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
interesting and this is the ender cow so

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.040 
interesting and this is the ender cow so
to<00:03:21.130> breed<00:03:21.459> nd<00:03:21.790> cows<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.180> actually<00:03:22.450> use<00:03:22.630> need

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
to breed nd cows you actually use need

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.040 
to breed nd cows you actually use need
to<00:03:23.170> use<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.560> eye<00:03:23.590> of<00:03:23.920> ender<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:24.700> if<00:03:24.970> we<00:03:25.330> they

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
to use the eye of ender so if we they

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.240 
to use the eye of ender so if we they
always<00:03:26.230> want<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.470> escape<00:03:26.769> when<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:26.980> come<00:03:27.160> in

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
always want to escape when I come in

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
anyway so to breed them you just

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.690 
anyway so to breed them you just
right-click<00:03:29.380> with<00:03:29.680> an<00:03:29.769> eye<00:03:29.860> of<00:03:29.890> ender<00:03:30.340> like

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
right-click with an eye of ender like

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.759 
right-click with an eye of ender like
that<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.150> then<00:03:31.720> you'll<00:03:31.900> get<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.080> little<00:03:32.440> baby

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
and a cow so yeah and the next feature

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.699 
and a cow so yeah and the next feature
is<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.209> they'll<00:03:37.360> also<00:03:37.600> die<00:03:38.080> when<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.560> and

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
is that they'll also die when you and

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.160 
is that they'll also die when you and
place<00:03:38.890> water<00:03:39.100> near<00:03:39.340> them<00:03:39.489> so<00:03:39.610> yeah<00:03:40.450> bear<00:03:40.989> that

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
place water near them so yeah bear that

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.330 
place water near them so yeah bear that
in<00:03:41.260> mind<00:03:41.290> you<00:03:41.560> don't<00:03:41.709> want<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:41.890> kill<00:03:42.010> loads<00:03:42.220> of

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
in mind you don't want to kill loads of

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.940 
in mind you don't want to kill loads of
ender<00:03:42.610> cows<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.060> these<00:03:44.050> actually<00:03:44.650> drop

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
ender cows and these actually drop

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.310 
ender cows and these actually drop
there's<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.790> 50%<00:03:46.269> drop<00:03:46.420> rate<00:03:46.750> when<00:03:46.989> you<00:03:47.019> kill

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
there's a 50% drop rate when you kill

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.840 
there's a 50% drop rate when you kill
Enderman<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:47.890> you<00:03:47.980> can<00:03:48.070> get<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:48.370> decals<00:03:48.700> by

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
Enderman so you can get in decals by

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.490 
Enderman so you can get in decals by
killing<00:03:49.150> Enderman<00:03:49.510> which<00:03:49.959> really<00:03:50.290> makes

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
killing Enderman which really makes

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.800 
killing Enderman which really makes
sense<00:03:50.680> when<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:50.920> think<00:03:51.130> about<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.400> and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
sense when you think about it and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.240 
sense when you think about it and
finally<00:03:52.810> I'll<00:03:53.320> show<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:53.769> last<00:03:53.980> for<00:03:54.190> a

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
finally I'll show you this last for a

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.580 
finally I'll show you this last for a
reason<00:03:54.550> when<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.120> hurt<00:03:55.330> them<00:03:55.570> they<00:03:56.050> teleport

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
reason when you hurt them they teleport

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.170 
reason when you hurt them they teleport
away<00:03:56.739> like<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.070> and<00:03:57.250> that<00:03:57.670> cows<00:03:57.940> just

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
away like that and that cows just

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.420 
away like that and that cows just
completely<00:03:58.540> disappeared<00:03:58.989> so<00:03:59.980> if<00:04:00.070> I<00:04:00.160> hit<00:04:00.310> this

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
completely disappeared so if I hit this

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.600 
completely disappeared so if I hit this
one<00:04:00.900> should<00:04:01.920> teleport<00:04:02.920> away<00:04:02.980> like<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.280> and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
one should teleport away like that and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.220 
one should teleport away like that and
they<00:04:03.910> also<00:04:04.060> have<00:04:04.209> like<00:04:04.239> an<00:04:04.480> indoor<00:04:04.810> aurora

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
they also have like an indoor aurora

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.020 
they also have like an indoor aurora
around<00:04:05.769> them<00:04:05.920> if<00:04:06.070> you've<00:04:06.280> noticed<00:04:06.489> so<00:04:06.880> they

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
around them if you've noticed so they

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.979 
around them if you've noticed so they
like<00:04:07.180> Enderman<00:04:07.600> and<00:04:08.190> now<00:04:09.190> there<00:04:09.700> goes<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:10.180> XP

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
like Enderman and now there goes the XP

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.470 
like Enderman and now there goes the XP
cow<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.830> obviously<00:04:12.310> wasn't<00:04:12.519> resistance<00:04:13.330> to

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
cow it obviously wasn't resistance to

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.060 
cow it obviously wasn't resistance to
love<00:04:13.630> or<00:04:13.780> anything<00:04:13.959> and<00:04:14.230> neither's<00:04:14.680> this<00:04:14.860> one

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
love or anything and neither's this one

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.770 
love or anything and neither's this one
put<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.670> lava<00:04:15.880> cow<00:04:16.150> which<00:04:16.419> I'll<00:04:16.570> show<00:04:16.720> you

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
put the lava cow which I'll show you

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.690 
put the lava cow which I'll show you
next<00:04:16.930> actually<00:04:17.410> is<00:04:17.560> so<00:04:18.310> yeah<00:04:18.489> that's<00:04:18.640> pretty

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
next actually is so yeah that's pretty

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.449 
next actually is so yeah that's pretty
much<00:04:18.940> all<00:04:19.150> for<00:04:19.479> this<00:04:19.570> cow<00:04:20.190> there's<00:04:21.190> not<00:04:21.310> really

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
much all for this cow there's not really

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.980 
much all for this cow there's not really
much<00:04:21.669> bout<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.090> but<00:04:22.240> it<00:04:22.330> is<00:04:22.419> really<00:04:22.660> cool<00:04:22.810> the

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
much bout it but it is really cool the

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.870 
much bout it but it is really cool the
way<00:04:23.020> they<00:04:23.229> teleport<00:04:23.620> but<00:04:24.190> finally<00:04:24.669> we've<00:04:24.850> got

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
way they teleport but finally we've got

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.930 
way they teleport but finally we've got
the<00:04:25.150> lava<00:04:25.510> cow<00:04:25.890> so<00:04:26.890> there's<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.370> 20%<00:04:27.669> chance

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
the lava cow so there's a 20% chance

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.330 
the lava cow so there's a 20% chance
that<00:04:28.210> blazes<00:04:28.660> will<00:04:28.840> drop<00:04:29.110> lava<00:04:29.710> cow<00:04:29.979> spawn

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
that blazes will drop lava cow spawn

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.679 
that blazes will drop lava cow spawn
eggs<00:04:30.550> when<00:04:30.760> they<00:04:30.789> die<00:04:31.120> so

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 
eggs when they die so

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.089 
eggs when they die so
that<00:04:31.839> kind<00:04:32.289> of<00:04:32.349> makes<00:04:32.499> sense<00:04:32.709> considering

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
that kind of makes sense considering

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.679 
that kind of makes sense considering
bayes's<00:04:33.519> love<00:04:33.729> fire<00:04:33.969> and<00:04:34.149> stuff<00:04:34.330> like<00:04:34.479> that

and discount water has a load of

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:38.579 
and discount water has a load of
features<00:04:36.699> too<00:04:36.909> so<00:04:37.569> if<00:04:37.899> we<00:04:38.080> get<00:04:38.289> in<00:04:38.439> without

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:38.589 
features too so if we get in without

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:40.499 
features too so if we get in without
letting<00:04:38.949> them<00:04:39.009> escape<00:04:39.159> we<00:04:39.999> can<00:04:40.239> right<00:04:40.479> click

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
letting them escape we can right click

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.629 
letting them escape we can right click
with<00:04:40.809> a<00:04:40.839> bucket<00:04:41.349> and<00:04:41.499> get<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.949> lava<00:04:42.159> bucket<00:04:42.519> out

with a bucket and get to lava bucket out
the<00:04:42.759> go<00:04:42.879> which<00:04:43.179> is<00:04:43.209> interesting<00:04:44.019> and<00:04:44.489> next

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:45.489 
the go which is interesting and next

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:47.699 
the go which is interesting and next
these<00:04:45.819> cows<00:04:46.449> as<00:04:46.719> you'd<00:04:46.869> probably<00:04:47.019> expect<00:04:47.229> or

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:47.709 
these cows as you'd probably expect or

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:50.399 
these cows as you'd probably expect or
lava<00:04:48.579> resistant<00:04:49.149> but<00:04:49.539> not<00:04:49.689> water<00:04:49.869> resistance

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
lava resistant but not water resistance

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.919 
lava resistant but not water resistance
if<00:04:51.339> you<00:04:51.519> place<00:04:51.729> down<00:04:51.909> water<00:04:52.179> they<00:04:52.389> will<00:04:52.659> die

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:52.929 
if you place down water they will die

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:54.959 
if you place down water they will die
subtly<00:04:53.529> I<00:04:53.679> think<00:04:54.099> it'd<00:04:54.189> actually<00:04:54.309> be<00:04:54.519> cool<00:04:54.729> if

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
subtly I think it'd actually be cool if

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.429 
subtly I think it'd actually be cool if
when<00:04:55.239> you<00:04:55.329> place<00:04:55.539> down<00:04:55.719> water<00:04:55.929> they<00:04:56.110> turn<00:04:56.259> into

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:56.439 
when you place down water they turn into

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:58.259 
when you place down water they turn into
an<00:04:56.529> obsidian<00:04:56.829> cow<00:04:57.249> or<00:04:57.399> something<00:04:57.429> or<00:04:57.819> a<00:04:57.879> cobble

00:04:58.259 --> 00:04:58.269 
an obsidian cow or something or a cobble

00:04:58.269 --> 00:05:00.059 
an obsidian cow or something or a cobble
cow<00:04:58.389> actually<00:04:59.259> think<00:04:59.469> about<00:04:59.529> that<00:04:59.860> you'd<00:04:59.949> have

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
cow actually think about that you'd have

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.289 
cow actually think about that you'd have
to<00:05:00.159> have<00:05:00.219> a<00:05:00.309> cow<00:05:00.489> for<00:05:00.549> every<00:05:00.849> single<00:05:01.089> block<00:05:01.269> in

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:01.299 
to have a cow for every single block in

00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:02.909 
to have a cow for every single block in
the<00:05:01.449> game<00:05:01.599> that'll<00:05:02.199> be<00:05:02.289> a<00:05:02.319> bit<00:05:02.469> interesting

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
the game that'll be a bit interesting

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.469 
the game that'll be a bit interesting
imagine<00:05:03.189> having<00:05:03.369> like<00:05:03.549> a<00:05:03.579> field<00:05:03.939> of<00:05:04.149> every

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
imagine having like a field of every

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.019 
imagine having like a field of every
single<00:05:04.689> block<00:05:05.079> ID<00:05:05.289> a<00:05:05.589> cake<00:05:06.249> cow<00:05:06.519> now<00:05:06.819> that

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:07.029 
single block ID a cake cow now that

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.819 
single block ID a cake cow now that
would<00:05:07.179> be<00:05:07.209> cool<00:05:07.569> but<00:05:08.050> anyway<00:05:08.319> to<00:05:08.379> breed<00:05:08.679> these

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:08.829 
would be cool but anyway to breed these

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:10.649 
would be cool but anyway to breed these
lava<00:05:09.159> cows<00:05:09.399> you<00:05:09.909> could<00:05:10.059> just<00:05:10.209> right-click

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
lava cows you could just right-click

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:12.869 
lava cows you could just right-click
with<00:05:10.869> a<00:05:10.899> magma<00:05:11.349> going<00:05:11.559> like<00:05:11.709> that<00:05:11.739> and<00:05:12.039> you<00:05:12.759> can

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
with a magma going like that and you can

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.309 
with a magma going like that and you can
breed<00:05:13.089> them<00:05:13.119> like<00:05:13.389> that<00:05:13.569> and<00:05:13.839> you<00:05:14.169> can<00:05:14.259> also

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
breed them like that and you can also

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.809 
breed them like that and you can also
heal<00:05:14.649> up<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.889> cows<00:05:15.069> if<00:05:15.249> you<00:05:15.339> damage<00:05:15.639> them

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819

heal up the cows if you damage them
using<00:05:16.119> mac<00:05:16.569> well<00:05:17.050> yeah<00:05:17.499> magma<00:05:17.709> creams<00:05:18.009> so<00:05:18.639> yeah

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
using mac well yeah magma creams so yeah

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.939 
using mac well yeah magma creams so yeah
and<00:05:19.059> now<00:05:19.449> we've<00:05:19.599> got<00:05:19.749> a<00:05:19.779> little<00:05:19.899> cute<00:05:20.649> baby

and now we've got a little cute baby
lava<00:05:21.550> cow<00:05:21.759> so<00:05:22.179> yeah<00:05:22.389> and<00:05:22.569> finally<00:05:23.529> the<00:05:23.829> last

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
lava cow so yeah and finally the last

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.169 
lava cow so yeah and finally the last
feature<00:05:24.219> for<00:05:24.429> this<00:05:24.519> is<00:05:24.759> that<00:05:24.939> if<00:05:25.029> you

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:25.179 
feature for this is that if you

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:28.350 
feature for this is that if you
right-click<00:05:25.449> with<00:05:26.379> a<00:05:26.709> fire<00:05:27.099> charge<00:05:27.429> the<00:05:28.119> cow

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
right-click with a fire charge the cow

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.089 
right-click with a fire charge the cow
sets<00:05:28.659> on<00:05:28.779> fire<00:05:28.989> and<00:05:29.169> then<00:05:29.289> sets<00:05:29.529> every<00:05:29.799> single

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
sets on fire and then sets every single

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:31.979 
sets on fire and then sets every single
block<00:05:30.339> it<00:05:30.549> walks<00:05:30.759> on<00:05:30.939> on<00:05:31.119> fire<00:05:31.329> which<00:05:31.959> is

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:31.989 
block it walks on on fire which is

00:05:31.989 --> 00:05:34.169 
block it walks on on fire which is
interesting<00:05:32.619> so<00:05:33.189> if<00:05:33.309> we<00:05:33.459> set<00:05:33.699> this<00:05:33.819> cow<00:05:34.029> on

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:34.179 
interesting so if we set this cow on

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:35.969 
interesting so if we set this cow on
fire<00:05:34.389> with<00:05:34.779> a<00:05:34.809> fire<00:05:35.199> charge<00:05:35.499> you<00:05:35.679> can<00:05:35.829> see

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
fire with a fire charge you can see

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.459 
fire with a fire charge you can see
everywhere<00:05:36.309> it<00:05:36.429> walks<00:05:36.610> it's<00:05:37.149> it's<00:05:37.389> on<00:05:37.539> fire<00:05:37.719> so

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
everywhere it walks it's it's on fire so

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:39.689 
everywhere it walks it's it's on fire so
that'll<00:05:38.949> be<00:05:39.009> a<00:05:39.039> bit<00:05:39.189> scare<00:05:39.399> if<00:05:39.459> you<00:05:39.550> walk<00:05:39.669> down

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
that'll be a bit scare if you walk down

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.540 
that'll be a bit scare if you walk down
a<00:05:39.879> round<00:05:40.779> a<00:05:40.839> corner<00:05:40.989> and<00:05:41.319> then<00:05:41.439> saw<00:05:41.709> a<00:05:41.739> flaming

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.790 
a round a corner and then saw a flaming
lava<00:05:43.179> cow<00:05:43.419> I<00:05:43.629> mean<00:05:44.139> you'd<00:05:44.349> want<00:05:44.499> to<00:05:44.559> run<00:05:44.649> away

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
lava cow I mean you'd want to run away

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.259 
lava cow I mean you'd want to run away
from<00:05:44.919> that<00:05:45.069> but<00:05:45.369> suddenly<00:05:45.550> they're<00:05:45.849> well

happily they are peaceful so they

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:49.350 
happily they are peaceful so they
weren't<00:05:47.979> at<00:05:48.069> a<00:05:48.159> key<00:05:48.339> which<00:05:48.879> is<00:05:49.029> awesome

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
weren't at a key which is awesome

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.029 
weren't at a key which is awesome
although<00:05:49.779> if<00:05:50.169> you<00:05:50.319> walk<00:05:50.469> near<00:05:50.709> them<00:05:50.889> you're

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
although if you walk near them you're

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.709 
although if you walk near them you're
gonna<00:05:51.159> need<00:05:51.309> fire<00:05:51.579> resistance<00:05:52.059> because<00:05:52.539> that

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:52.719 
gonna need fire resistance because that

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.439 
gonna need fire resistance because that
could<00:05:52.929> hurt<00:05:53.199> I<00:05:53.409> suppose<00:05:53.709> so<00:05:54.489> yeah<00:05:54.789> and<00:05:55.059> also

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
could hurt I suppose so yeah and also

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.689 
could hurt I suppose so yeah and also
that<00:05:55.869> gas<00:05:56.229> if<00:05:56.499> you<00:05:56.589> didn't<00:05:56.829> know<00:05:56.919> have<00:05:57.159> a<00:05:57.189> 75

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 
that gas if you didn't know have a 75

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.999 
that gas if you didn't know have a 75
percent<00:05:57.789> chance<00:05:58.179> of<00:05:58.329> dropping<00:05:58.809> a<00:05:59.110> fire<00:05:59.679> charge

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
percent chance of dropping a fire charge

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.799

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.699 
finally we have the end of staff and to

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:14.709 
use this you just right-click and it

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:16.829 
use this you just right-click and it
requires<00:06:15.069> a<00:06:15.219> end<00:06:15.729> opposed<00:06:16.029> to<00:06:16.239> work<00:06:16.389> so<00:06:16.689> when

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:16.839 
requires a end opposed to work so when

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:18.239

enderpearl<00:06:18.669> like<00:06:19.089> that<00:06:19.269> I<00:06:19.509> don't<00:06:20.319> know<00:06:20.439> how

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:20.619 
enderpearl like that I don't know how

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:22.259 
enderpearl like that I don't know how
this<00:06:20.769> is<00:06:20.829> differs<00:06:21.219> from<00:06:21.339> just<00:06:21.579> firing<00:06:21.849> a.m.

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:22.269 
this is differs from just firing a.m.

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:24.059 
this is differs from just firing a.m.
and<00:06:22.539> a<00:06:22.629> poll<00:06:22.809> normally<00:06:23.199> but<00:06:23.649> suppose<00:06:23.889> it's

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
and a poll normally but suppose it's

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.589 
and a poll normally but suppose it's
cool<00:06:24.249> if<00:06:24.429> you're<00:06:24.579> holding<00:06:24.819> a<00:06:24.909> staff<00:06:25.149> then<00:06:25.479> I'm

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
cool if you're holding a staff then I'm

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.089 
cool if you're holding a staff then I'm
walking<00:06:26.079> around<00:06:26.169> with<00:06:26.469> interpose<00:06:26.860> in<00:06:27.009> your

walking around with interpose in your
hand<00:06:27.219> and<00:06:27.449> this<00:06:28.449> actually<00:06:28.779> has<00:06:28.929> 64<00:06:29.409> uses

before it runs out and to craft it

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.509 
before it runs out and to craft it
you're<00:06:32.019> gonna<00:06:32.139> need<00:06:32.319> to<00:06:32.619> blaze<00:06:32.829> rods<00:06:33.099> and<00:06:33.279> an

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:35.609 
enderpearl
arranged<00:06:34.599> like<00:06:34.779> that<00:06:34.959> in<00:06:35.079> the<00:06:35.169> crafting<00:06:35.469> table

00:06:35.609 --> 00:06:35.619 
arranged like that in the crafting table

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:37.529 
arranged like that in the crafting table
and<00:06:35.979> then<00:06:36.459> you<00:06:36.550> can<00:06:36.639> get<00:06:36.759> yourself<00:06:36.849> an<00:06:37.269> Ender

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:37.539 
and then you can get yourself an Ender

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:38.969 
and then you can get yourself an Ender
staff<00:06:37.749> so<00:06:38.289> it<00:06:38.379> doesn't<00:06:38.589> really<00:06:38.709> do<00:06:38.829> anything

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
staff so it doesn't really do anything

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:41.159 
staff so it doesn't really do anything
special<00:06:39.279> you<00:06:39.699> just<00:06:39.729> fire<00:06:40.629> it<00:06:40.659> and<00:06:40.959> you<00:06:41.019> can

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
special you just fire it and you can

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:43.439 
special you just fire it and you can
fire<00:06:41.709> into<00:06:41.919> poles<00:06:42.129> out<00:06:42.309> of<00:06:42.399> it<00:06:42.490> I'm<00:06:43.179> not<00:06:43.240> sure

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:43.449 
fire into poles out of it I'm not sure

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.269 
fire into poles out of it I'm not sure
if<00:06:43.749> it's<00:06:43.899> any<00:06:44.019> more<00:06:44.319> beneficial<00:06:44.860> than<00:06:44.979> just

00:06:45.269 --> 00:06:45.279 
if it's any more beneficial than just

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.580 
if it's any more beneficial than just
using

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
poles on their own but there you go so
