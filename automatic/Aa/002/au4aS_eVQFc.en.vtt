00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.790
 or play Alba a role this weekend trouble the week 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.509
 was created there is the trouble the handball coach Sinn Basler mass home 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.190
 We talk about it later and there was trouble because of the Offenbacher 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.650
 Football fans, you know how it is. There are always fans who think so 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.539
 God only that he let the linden so that he the ball in the 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.829
 Goal of the opponent just drift away 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.789
 if all of this is then exaggerated for feasting then 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.359
 Local patriots Guy broke out of the wild fanatics and that's questionable 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.399
 During the week there were phrases such as criminal conditions and there were in 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.190
 Bad Soden so even the remark of war or this clarification if 

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:43.699
 because the Offenbacher came and today had the Kickers in Dirt so then get 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.570
 Two questions were important the first 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.920
 the answers to two questions pointed the game exactly like Cigana the second 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.510
 because the circumstances 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.510
 Similar to Dirk 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.850
 Large deployment for the police around 100 officials were in use one feared 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.110
 Riots similar to Profen 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.560
 just before the game peaceful kickers fans the Kickers are allowed to 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.010
 just do not lose and now wars I should have come referee squad 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.220
 been 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.130
 will be replaced during the World Cup white-blue, whether she is open » 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.910
 the place in Bad soden-salmünster the bad state 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.220
 the hosts make their first interesting attack after twelve minutes 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.720
 nothing pulls off the first sample for Offenbach goalkeeper drove the Kickers 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.270
 with a weak start 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.600
 Tigers 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.450
 no problem for goalkeeper Lauterbach 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.180
 often Groninger was wanted 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.180
 but it was very difficult in the first half 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.810
 an almost usual scene 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 how that gave the ball 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.320
 can escape almost undisturbed is not attacked 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.350
 is right 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.149
 Offenbach coach more than dissatisfied until 27 minutes 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.380
 is waiting for Chile 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.210
 vain 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.670
 Bad Soden came with the space better to right 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.109
 expands passports with consequences 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.849
 Bangert goes past a judge over here 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.819
 his passport lift 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.949
 that could have been 1 0 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:21.989
 The Tigers did not find a recipe against the defense Bad Soden's Groninger tried it 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.139
 here on the right 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.819
 he leaves side 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.899
 a good rule of thumb of goalkeeper Lauterbach 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:34.799
 the lawn if you call it that is allowed to take Endler in the mud place the 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.429
 tigers fans had to wait for goals 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.429
 the strongest scene of Offenbach four minutes before the half-time whistle 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.939
 the defense Bad Sodens does not get the ball away 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.199
 but Riegler mydays himself in vain 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:51.549
 Zero to zero that was the halftime level in front of about 3,000 spectators a moderate 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.709
 first halftime 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.719
 played five minutes of the second half but Borchers only meets here 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.059
 let that go 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.059
 only two minutes later 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:08.969
 once more values 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.269
 here is the kicker defense 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.239
 the hosts made pressure 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.399
 how are you 

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:18.879
 Offenbach in the defensive Bad Soden was getting stronger 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:24.009
 a wonderful flank 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.289
 from Bangert 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.289
 and splendor parade of drove 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.839
 20 minutes were played in the second half 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.849
 this bad passport 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.849
 gets the ball 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.049
 Ritler leaves 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.049
 the redeeming one to zero 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.319
 18 minutes later with the Kickers, it's the bigger routine 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.319
 noticeable 

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.289
 Confusion in the defense of Bad Soden 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.629
 comes to the shot 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.629
 the 2 to zero 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.749
 and it could have been better 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:16.749
 completely free in front of the gate 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.029
 but the additional margin does not bring anything 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.289
 Apparently, after a weak start, Bad Soden beats the visitors with 2 to 0 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.289
 Fans laugh contentedly and it stayed peaceful 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.969
