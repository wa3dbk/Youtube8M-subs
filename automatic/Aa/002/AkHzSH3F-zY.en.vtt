people<00:00:27.789> they<00:00:28.480> were<00:00:28.539> highly<00:00:29.140> trained<00:00:29.470> here

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
people they were highly trained here

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.060

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
in takedowns every single day I mean a

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.050 
in takedowns every single day I mean a
day<00:00:40.210> didn't<00:00:40.570> go<00:00:40.600> by<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:42.280> we<00:00:42.550> didn't<00:00:42.820> have<00:00:42.910> to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.060 
day didn't go by that we didn't have to

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.660 
day didn't go by that we didn't have to
have<00:00:43.090> three<00:00:43.720> three<00:00:44.649> adults<00:00:45.130> coming<00:00:45.370> and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
have three three adults coming and

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.690 
have three three adults coming and
restrain<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.120> kid<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.960> I<00:00:47.560> begin<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:47.950> say<00:00:48.130> how<00:00:48.340> is

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
restrain a kid and I begin to say how is

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.080 
restrain a kid and I begin to say how is
that<00:00:48.850> possible<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:50.559> doesn't<00:00:50.649> make<00:00:51.160> sense<00:00:51.190> and

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
that possible it doesn't make sense and

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.160 
that possible it doesn't make sense and
it<00:00:53.079> was<00:00:53.200> out<00:00:53.440> of<00:00:53.649> that<00:00:53.710> that<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:55.570> developed

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
it was out of that that really developed

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.190 
it was out of that that really developed
what<00:00:56.320> we<00:00:56.410> call<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:57.219> conflict<00:00:57.820> cycle<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.450> the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
what we call the conflict cycle and the

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.930 
what we call the conflict cycle and the
missing<00:00:59.620> piece<00:01:00.180> was<00:01:01.180> that<00:01:01.480> behavior<00:01:02.110> is<00:01:02.350> not

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
missing piece was that behavior is not

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.289 
missing piece was that behavior is not
stimulus<00:01:03.940> response<00:01:04.259> it's<00:01:05.259> circular<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.090> the

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
stimulus response it's circular and the

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.410 
stimulus response it's circular and the
fact<00:01:07.749> is<00:01:08.020> that<00:01:08.229> when<00:01:08.439> you<00:01:08.560> work<00:01:08.859> with<00:01:09.420> troubled

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
fact is that when you work with troubled

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.529 
fact is that when you work with troubled
kids<00:01:10.509> you<00:01:11.079> don't<00:01:11.229> realize<00:01:11.859> they<00:01:12.850> have<00:01:13.209> the

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
kids you don't realize they have the

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.989 
kids you don't realize they have the
ability<00:01:13.659> to<00:01:16.289> create<00:01:17.289> in<00:01:17.829> you<00:01:18.189> they're

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999 
ability to create in you they're

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:21.840 
ability to create in you they're
identical<00:01:19.509> feelings<00:01:20.170> and<00:01:20.590> if<00:01:21.490> you're<00:01:21.670> not

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
identical feelings and if you're not

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.569 
identical feelings and if you're not
aware<00:01:22.149> of<00:01:22.209> it<00:01:22.450> if<00:01:23.020> you<00:01:23.200> don't<00:01:23.380> accept<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:24.009> you

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
aware of it if you don't accept that you

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.870 
aware of it if you don't accept that you
will<00:01:24.609> mirror<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:26.049> behavior<00:01:26.770> then<00:01:27.549> you<00:01:27.579> will

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
will mirror that behavior then you will

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.999 
will mirror that behavior then you will
escalate<00:01:28.359> it<00:01:28.719> and<00:01:28.899> then<00:01:29.409> it<00:01:29.529> will<00:01:29.649> start<00:01:29.889> going

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
escalate it and then it will start going

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.249 
escalate it and then it will start going
around<00:01:30.340> around<00:01:30.700> and<00:01:30.939> until<00:01:31.569> it<00:01:31.689> gets<00:01:31.840> crazy

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
around around and until it gets crazy

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.120 
around around and until it gets crazy
and<00:01:32.679> that<00:01:33.639> became<00:01:34.119> really<00:01:34.479> our<00:01:34.719> paradigm<00:01:35.380> for

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
and that became really our paradigm for

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.580 
and that became really our paradigm for
the<00:01:36.189> rest<00:01:36.429> of<00:01:36.520> our<00:01:36.639> kabab<00:01:36.969> rest<00:01:37.209> of<00:01:37.299> my<00:01:37.389> career

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the rest of our kabab rest of my career

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.639 
the rest of our kabab rest of my career
in<00:01:38.590> which<00:01:38.889> we<00:01:39.189> said<00:01:39.990> reasonable<00:01:40.990> people<00:01:41.289> are

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
in which we said reasonable people are

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.289 
in which we said reasonable people are
victims<00:01:42.189> are<00:01:42.369> working<00:01:42.729> with<00:01:42.880> troubled<00:01:43.060> kids

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
victims are working with troubled kids

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.289 
victims are working with troubled kids
and<00:01:43.719> that's<00:01:44.170> why<00:01:44.469> nice<00:01:45.340> people<00:01:45.700> can't<00:01:46.090> work

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
and that's why nice people can't work

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.929 
and that's why nice people can't work
with<00:01:46.479> troubled<00:01:46.869> kids<00:01:47.520> unless<00:01:48.520> they're

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
with troubled kids unless they're

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.739 
with troubled kids unless they're
trained<00:01:49.380> unless<00:01:50.380> they<00:01:50.679> are<00:01:50.889> aware<00:01:51.249> of<00:01:51.749> what's

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
trained unless they are aware of what's

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.050 
trained unless they are aware of what's
happening<00:01:53.319> and<00:01:53.499> we've<00:01:54.279> always<00:01:54.520> talked<00:01:54.969> about

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
happening and we've always talked about

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.809 
happening and we've always talked about
the<00:01:55.329> concept<00:01:55.569> that<00:01:55.899> that<00:01:56.549> management<00:01:57.549> begins

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
the concept that that management begins

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.800 
the concept that that management begins
with<00:01:57.999> you<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.509> not<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.749> kid<00:01:59.099> unless<00:02:00.099> you<00:02:00.810> can

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
with you and not the kid unless you can

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.870 
with you and not the kid unless you can
understand<00:02:02.529> what's<00:02:02.889> happening<00:02:03.340> inside<00:02:03.520> of

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
understand what's happening inside of

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.139 
understand what's happening inside of
you<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.389> use<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:06.279> appreciate<00:02:06.909> what's

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
you and use that to appreciate what's

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.930 
you and use that to appreciate what's
going<00:02:07.209> on<00:02:07.569> in<00:02:07.719> him<00:02:07.869> then<00:02:08.349> you<00:02:08.500> got<00:02:08.679> choice<00:02:08.950> then

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
going on in him then you got choice then

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.540 
going on in him then you got choice then
your<00:02:10.149> skills<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.720> interventions<00:02:11.470> begin<00:02:12.370> to

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
your skills and interventions begin to

your skills and interventions begin to
work
