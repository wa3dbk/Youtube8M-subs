enemy will be doing so hopefully he will
be<00:00:57.970> doing<00:00:58.089> exactly<00:00:58.390> this<00:00:58.839> because<00:00:59.470> it<00:00:59.589> is<00:00:59.680> not

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
be doing exactly this because it is not

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.320 
be doing exactly this because it is not
there<00:01:00.070> might<00:01:00.189> be<00:01:00.220> a<00:01:00.339> little<00:01:00.430> difficult<00:01:00.640> but
