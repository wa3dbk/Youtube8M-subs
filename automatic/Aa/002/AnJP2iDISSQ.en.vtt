00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:34.430
 And this time 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:37.060
 This time in the dish Dane without this grass unevenness 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.060
 In the grass 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.149
 Well, I like my house and grass like this 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.149
 Let me say 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.950
 I would like to set up a wild pokemon to appear here 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.840
 First of all 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:59.290
 There is no grass 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:02.550
 If you want the beast to appear in the area very much 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:05.640
 At first we put the grass in this way 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.790
 There and towards the top 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.020
 The setting and location of this appearance Pokemon 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.020

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.910
 First of all 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.020
 Here is the place of the type and here the grass 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.770
 There are four types of seaplane tree 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.600
 There are four 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.600
 But this time in the grass 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.430
 Then 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.280
 This cinemas 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.340

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.270

00:01:52.190 --> 00:02:02.840
 Check where you want Pokemon to appear 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.330
 Since there was water originally in the Masala team, there is a check on the water here 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.860
 But 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.930

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.480

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.990

 Set the PokÃ©mon coming out at what time it will be the instructor in the Dere period 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.610
 It's a book, is it like a legend ? 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.260
 It is a generation 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.690
 I vacant I do not know whether you want to Qi phosphorus is the most in the price of even Iida Te quality of here 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.750
 I will 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.180
 Here is the name of Pokemon coming out here 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.050
 First person is the largest 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.660
 The position on the left side is the number of one 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:02.160
 Which pokemon's 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:05.090
 The beginning of the hormone that comes out is the right here with the level here 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.590
 It is the maximum level of Pokemon coming out a 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.920
 Because this is the beginning of the story 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:17.520
 Oh dear 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:20.340
 The first maximum in the first bad box-consuming or crushed Showa City wonder if that first choice 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:25.550
 Thailand die will like to 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.550
 I came out like that and there are 52 schools in total 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.560
 It will set 12 all of the 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.450
 For example, it may be sufficient to 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:41.250
 Even if you say that the base alone is enough in 10 minutes 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.250
 I have to hug everything here 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.970
 Reason 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:53.540
 Good if you do not understand 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:54.569
 First of all , I will write only one piece of this egg- brother as a sample from Japan . 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:01.530
 Yes 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:08.150
 It is the principle of exposure that is on the job where it is used for emergence where this number is the emergence position 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.150
 If this is 0 par , Pokemon will not come out even if you set Pokemon, so here 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.580
 Large media 50 d done 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.340
 I can't walk in Japan 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.680
 I will pay attention 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.680
 You can change even nine days 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.760
 Then 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:29.960
 This Save is Click Save Here 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:34.350
 After clicking save here 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:39.260
 Click here to save to rom 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.260
 Yes I will save my chest 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.270
 8 place in the 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.940
 This is true 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.870
 Oh well yer 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.870
 You will see here 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:56.050
 For example Yes confirmation 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:56.050
 I tried starting with Visual Boy's Advance 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.340
 Let's go into the grass to try it out 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.790
 There is a low probability of that thing Kuppa 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.930
 Yes 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.930
 The movie in such Fu will come Wakewakan Nente' 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.210
 This year is I think when I wonder what Reberu had this to lose weight today 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.210
 It is not used 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.520
 Thus the sick lord does not come out 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:40.909
 1 of the probability of the number 12 minutes 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:40.909
 I already dream 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.150
 As I confirmed earlier 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.870
 Ryokichi one did not come out 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.620
 And say look at why 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.620
 Likely making full use of hand 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:01.249
 First of all, you have to bury all the 1 to 12 back of this Pokemon 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.860
 is 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:06.720
 Things like that because that will come out is that strange flashy guy If you do not fill all 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.700
 This 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:14.320
 Probably this is easy to understand the Donors with all 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.320
 All in my room 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.629
 I filled the Econo curtain at the same Pokemon all 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:33.180
 Even if this class does not blame all classmen, it is all right 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:33.180
 In unwound squid for confirmation 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.449
 For confirmation in hot water 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.810
 I think I want to do it here 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.949
 Yes 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:00.910
 Properly Yes Well was successful 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:04.230
 The model came out with 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.230
 Contact is the cat this Pokemon 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:15.100
 Well, if you make the Pokemon here more detailed , you will see the level etc. 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:19.990
 In the early stages of Masala Town 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:23.529
 It also is not it a dream to complete the party of the big three 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:29.820
 If this is familiar something good Do other day 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:32.780
 Yes or more, I 'm done with the rough use of advanced maps 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:35.650
 There is an event inside 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:41.030
 I think I want to chan 's 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:43.060
 Creating a map like this one Insert a map etc. 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:45.580
 I would like to do it if possible 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:49.830
 For example Well, once in this 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.830
 The advanced map series is the end
