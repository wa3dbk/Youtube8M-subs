the tail up towards the head like this
if<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.410> were<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.619> use<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> spoon<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.760> do

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
if you were to use the spoon you do

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.880 
if you were to use the spoon you do
basically<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> same<00:00:31.170> technique<00:00:31.500> as<00:00:32.009> such

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
basically the same technique as such

towards the head of the fish you'll

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.299 
towards the head of the fish you'll
notice<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.600> problem<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.170> scaling<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.860> that

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
notice a problem with scaling is that

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
notice a problem with scaling is that
all<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.610> scales<00:00:41.940> fly<00:00:42.360> all<00:00:42.629> over<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.020> kitchen

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
all the scales fly all over the kitchen

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.799 
all the scales fly all over the kitchen
and<00:00:43.530> make<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> mess<00:00:44.010> everywhere<00:00:44.660> we<00:00:45.660> can

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
and make a mess everywhere we can

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.350 
and make a mess everywhere we can
minimize<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.530> mess<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.070> flying<00:00:47.460> scales<00:00:48.030> in

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
minimize the mess of flying scales in

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 
minimize the mess of flying scales in
the<00:00:48.450> kitchen<00:00:48.840> by<00:00:49.379> simply<00:00:49.829> moving<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.309> fish

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the kitchen by simply moving the fish

into a sink filled with cold water be
sure<00:00:54.210> though<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.539> your<00:00:54.960> sink<00:00:55.320> has<00:00:55.590> an

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
sure though that your sink has an

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.130 
sure though that your sink has an
adequate<00:00:56.100> particle<00:00:57.000> trap<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.809> drain

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
adequate particle trap in the drain

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.130 
adequate particle trap in the drain
because<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.100> don't<00:00:59.370> want<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.850> let<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.750> scales

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
because you don't want to let the scales

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.349 
because you don't want to let the scales
go<00:01:01.559> down<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.070> drain<00:01:02.340> after<00:01:02.969> you're<00:01:03.149> finished

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
go down the drain after you're finished

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.149 
go down the drain after you're finished
and<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> drain<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> water<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:05.010> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and you have to drain the water out of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.030 
and you have to drain the water out of
the<00:01:05.339> sink<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> we'll<00:01:06.810> move<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.200> fish<00:01:07.439> into<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the sink so we'll move the fish into the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.940 
the sink so we'll move the fish into the
water<00:01:08.150> completely<00:01:09.150> submerging<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.260> just

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
water completely submerging it and just

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.399 
water completely submerging it and just
continue<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.640> scaling<00:01:12.119> process<00:01:12.630> under<00:01:13.170> water

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
continue the scaling process under water

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.910 
continue the scaling process under water
in<00:01:13.740> your<00:01:13.950> kitchen<00:01:14.340> sink<00:01:14.689> all<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> scales<00:01:16.500> just

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
in your kitchen sink all the scales just

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.070 
in your kitchen sink all the scales just
float<00:01:17.280> off<00:01:17.490> into<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.970> water<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.540> eventually

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
float off into the water and eventually

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
float off into the water and eventually
collect<00:01:19.500> in<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> sink<00:01:20.070> trap<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> base<00:01:20.909> of

collect in the sink trap at the base of
the<00:01:21.210> sink<00:01:25.939> continue<00:01:26.939> scaling<00:01:27.240> all<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.990> way<00:01:28.080> up

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the sink continue scaling all the way up

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.920 
the sink continue scaling all the way up
to<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.530> edge<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:29.100> every<00:01:29.490> thin<00:01:29.850> right<00:01:30.659> up<00:01:30.810> to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
to the edge of every thin right up to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the edge of the fin here but be careful

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
the edge of the fin here but be careful
not<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> poke<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.170> finger<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.979> fin<00:01:35.220> rays

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
not to poke your finger on the fin rays

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.929 
not to poke your finger on the fin rays
of<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.150> fish<00:01:36.390> especially<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.220> dorsal<00:01:38.549> fin

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
of the fish especially on the dorsal fin

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.730 
of the fish especially on the dorsal fin
where<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> raised<00:01:39.509> can<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.200> very<00:01:40.439> sharp

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
where the raised can be very sharp

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.310 
where the raised can be very sharp
that's<00:01:41.549> why<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> scaler<00:01:42.420> has<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> fairly<00:01:43.110> long

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that's why the scaler has a fairly long

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590 
that's why the scaler has a fairly long
handle<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.579> reach<00:01:44.939> those<00:01:45.270> areas

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
handle so that you can reach those areas

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.960 
handle so that you can reach those areas
without<00:01:46.290> endangering<00:01:46.680> your<00:01:47.159> fingers<00:01:47.610> or<00:01:47.850> your

without endangering your fingers or your

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.109 
without endangering your fingers or your
hands<00:01:48.450> keep<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> fish<00:01:49.710> under<00:01:49.890> water<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.549> just

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
hands keep the fish under water and just

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.569 
hands keep the fish under water and just
keep<00:01:51.329> stroking<00:01:51.750> uniformly<00:01:52.649> towards<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.369> head

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
keep stroking uniformly towards the head

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.490 
keep stroking uniformly towards the head
of<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> fish<00:01:54.030> until<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.930> scales<00:01:55.229> are
