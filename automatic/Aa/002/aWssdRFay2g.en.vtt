00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hi all guys are the eyes to give 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.910
 and today we are here in the fifth episode 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.980
 of the clash of plans series 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.620
 from the beginning we start immediately as at 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.710
 usually with a nice excursus of the village 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.360
 and then we see that we have the defense 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.990
 level 2 was the castle of the clan 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.210
 level 2 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.980
 all other buildings the level 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.740
 maximum or even increased deposits 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.660
 so now I can contain well you know 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.720
 half a million gold is half a million 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.609
 of elixirs and finally we would miss them 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.340
 just these beautiful extractors 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.989
 but I believe I will do them calmly 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.239
 while I will put it to the town hall then it 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.640
 Today's purpose will be to build the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.270
 city ​​hall and if you have been very much 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.670
 beware or 500 two gems to build the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.559
 third bricklayer as usual and as in 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.559
 every episode we start immediately looking for 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.899
 someone to attack and then we say col 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.030
 town hall at 5 certainly the games 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.890
 they will start to get pretty 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.140
 funny because we will have many more things 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.910
 and I must say that I am very much 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.590
 satisfied because we really are 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.199
 going great themselves 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.360
 look at this here as much as yes yes yes yes 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.250
 stick for now I'm attacking with the solo 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.799
 with barbarians but I'm really attacking 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.680
 randomly like people like this let 's not see 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.689
 spin ok the municipalities we have destroyed 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.909
 now let's put the barbers right at random 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.790
 below and let's take a look at it 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.979
 some good gold barbarians take them 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.250
 obviously we won't be able to get it 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.670
 everything is fine though 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.119
 take them in between 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.880
 but among the last dead barbarian 98 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.439
 my gold at these levels are so many mi 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.689
 I call making decent troops 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.340
 ok at this point since we are 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.119
 waiting for the troops for the next 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.600
 attack 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.820
 let's go to resources go to the hut 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.159
 of the manufacturer exactly the third 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.860
 builder's hut costs 500 gems 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:56.979
 we place it here 3 2 1 go and there 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.770
 only two gems remain so we can 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.289
 put to enhance respectively one 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.360
 gold mine and an elixir extractor 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.340
 the city ​​hall will put it to the end 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.509
 of the episode so it creates a bit of 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.250
 suspense 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.650
 meanwhile we see a bit of war 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.709
 we just started it this time 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.580
 let's make a serious war last words 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.890

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.290

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.069

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.319

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.989

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.650
 a small advertisement do not lynch me 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.890
 simply skip it fresh 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.720

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:57.750

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.540
 our super mega super cool village 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.579

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.030

 so with my other village type fi 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.940
 jumps of joy but with this village 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:26.680
 what the hell i do i'm sorry i have to 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.489
 run away so much kids there 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.200
 let's make 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.450
 I wanted to try to make an attack like that 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.880
 to take a few trophies do a hundred 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.290
 percent the hell not go home 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.780
 and let's see if we can do some 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.330
 sale that gives us lots of trophies 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.310
 no I don't think so now the festival starts 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.959
 of all those with the drain village 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.090
 active shield those who are online 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.150
 Mamma mia, there's really nothing to do 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.770
 now no one is left by here 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:57.650
 here or but I don't know if it's worth it 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.200
 you attacked the arches that good now 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.709
 you get what you deserve we hope to 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.819
 do not spin five giant troops here 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.739
 how many three giants have died 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.170
 very bad 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.910
 that sucks guys we still have i 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.810
 giants level 6 that surely there 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.250
 they will give a big hand but no one knows 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.790
 let's put the wall splits going 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.770
 no, kids ca n't talk about themes 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.720
 what problems I have ayachi problems 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.630
 serious problems but the archers trust 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.050
 in you, however, these 6 giants are not 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.080
 really over power don't die then 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.540
 the only problem boys is time and it is 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.400
 a serious problem here is an archer not 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.240
 he will never succeed alone in destroying the 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.360
 city ​​Hall 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.860
 fingers crossed guys I don't think though 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.860
 in life everything is possible 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:05:01.250
 46 49 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:02.810
 no no no guys ok ok by at least this 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.810
 we must succeed in destroying it 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:10.820
 the town hall now I think not though though 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:13.700
 but from twenty seconds to 20 seconds more 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.650
 long in my life will seem like that 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.020
 I can do it for myself I don't know 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.000
 I do not know from the by by the from almost 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.919
 ok ok a stele made 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.240
 all a bad luck but not for a hair 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.430
 we can make two 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.789
 if maybe they didn't jump like gods 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.360
 baboons on snap traps maybe 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.820
 let's go home 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.490
 The time has come for everyone to be 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.380
 waiting for town hall level 4 you have been 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.990
 good you have been a faithful ally but it is 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.150
 come to bring you level 5 we see a 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.969
 little thing from the municipalities level 5 a 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.239
 new camp a 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.849
 a cannon an archer was an extractor 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:53.529
 25 walls a wow wizard tower 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.899
 the laboratory which is very much 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:57.309
 fundamental for the attacks and then 

00:05:55.899 --> 00:06:00.879
 in the traps so I would say we are 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:06:03.669
 ready in 21 b knows well in two days 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:05.019

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.399
