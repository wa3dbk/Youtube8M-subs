00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.020 
were you what were the issues well
actually<00:03:43.299> this<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.440> there<00:03:44.819> originally<00:03:45.819> it<00:03:45.850> was

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
actually this is there originally it was

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.699 
actually this is there originally it was
a<00:03:46.180> joint<00:03:46.450> venture<00:03:46.780> which<00:03:46.900> we<00:03:47.079> tried<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.530> build

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
a joint venture which we tried to build

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.360 
a joint venture which we tried to build
with<00:03:47.950> photon<00:03:48.400> for<00:03:49.060> tracks<00:03:49.420> or<00:03:50.019> then<00:03:50.739> the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
with photon for tracks or then the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.069 
with photon for tracks or then the
Chinese<00:03:51.730> side<00:03:51.910> suggested<00:03:52.569> that<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:52.780> would<00:03:52.900> be

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
Chinese side suggested that it would be

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.110 
Chinese side suggested that it would be
better<00:03:53.260> if<00:03:53.410> we<00:03:53.620> would<00:03:53.889> buy<00:03:54.069> a<00:03:54.100> stake<00:03:54.459> instead

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
better if we would buy a stake instead

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.059 
better if we would buy a stake instead
of<00:03:55.239> doing<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.600> joint<00:03:55.750> venture<00:03:56.139> now<00:03:56.709> this<00:03:56.920> would

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
of doing a joint venture now this would

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.559 
of doing a joint venture now this would
have<00:03:57.220> been<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.430> first<00:03:57.609> of<00:03:58.000> this<00:03:58.090> kind<00:03:58.329> in

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
have been the first of this kind in

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.599 
have been the first of this kind in
China<00:03:58.840> obviously<00:03:59.380> there<00:03:59.980> are<00:04:00.010> there<00:04:00.489> are

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
China obviously there are there are

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.490 
China obviously there are there are
government's<00:04:01.030> decided<00:04:01.510> not<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.900> go<00:04:02.049> that<00:04:02.290> path

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
government's decided not to go that path

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.319 
government's decided not to go that path
at<00:04:02.799> that<00:04:02.950> point<00:04:03.160> of<00:04:03.280> time<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.760> so<00:04:03.880> we<00:04:04.030> are<00:04:04.150> back

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
at that point of time and so we are back

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.530 
at that point of time and so we are back
to<00:04:04.600> check<00:04:05.590> for<00:04:06.130> joint<00:04:06.400> venture<00:04:06.760> which<00:04:06.940> we<00:04:07.120> most

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
to check for joint venture which we most

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.120 
to check for joint venture which we most
likely<00:04:07.750> will<00:04:07.959> build<00:04:08.260> together<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:08.829> it's<00:04:08.980> just

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
likely will build together so it's just

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.360 
likely will build together so it's just
a<00:04:09.340> different<00:04:09.519> form<00:04:09.940> but<00:04:10.359> not<00:04:10.600> a<00:04:10.630> total<00:04:10.930> stop

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
a different form but not a total stop

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.099 
a different form but not a total stop
how<00:04:12.370> is<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.910> health<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.450> industry<00:04:13.930> we

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
how is the health of the industry we

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.020 
how is the health of the industry we
keep<00:04:14.319> hearing<00:04:14.590> about<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:15.250> domestic<00:04:15.579> car

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
makers the Fords the gm's what do you

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.640 
makers the Fords the gm's what do you
think<00:04:19.359> about<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.720> market<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.349> is<00:04:20.470> there

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
think about the market and is there

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.719 
think about the market and is there
potential<00:04:20.979> for<00:04:21.220> growth<00:04:21.340> in<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.640> United

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
potential for growth in the United

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.629 
potential for growth in the United
States<00:04:23.010> obviously<00:04:24.010> we're

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
States obviously we're

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.749 
States obviously we're
very<00:04:25.120> different<00:04:25.979> situation<00:04:26.979> of<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.430> markets

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
very different situation of the markets

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.730 
very different situation of the markets
around<00:04:27.849> the<00:04:28.060> globe<00:04:28.199> in<00:04:29.199> the<00:04:29.259> s<00:04:29.530> the

around the globe in the s the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.649 
around the globe in the s the
perspectives<00:04:30.280> for<00:04:30.370> next<00:04:30.669> year<00:04:30.879> are<00:04:31.090> not<00:04:31.300> sir

too<00:04:32.259> great<00:04:32.499> we<00:04:32.860> expect<00:04:33.580> some<00:04:34.150> reduction<00:04:34.689> in

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:34.779 
too great we expect some reduction in

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
the total market Europe is about flat

the total market Europe is about flat
and<00:04:38.349> expectation<00:04:39.129> but<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.699> merchant<00:04:40.060> markets

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
America for instance are doing just

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.230 
America for instance are doing just
great<00:04:45.879> so<00:04:46.120> that<00:04:46.300> overall<00:04:46.689> their<00:04:47.439> sales<00:04:48.180> in<00:04:49.180> the
