00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.850
 many people who arrive in Japan without doing 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.860
 homework meets a wall 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.510
 every time you have to take a train the 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.890
 information panels are huge already 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.350
 times the names of the stations 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.820
 they come only in Japanese if this 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.070
 out there are several companies 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.530
 private companies that offer service with the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.540
 state company I know that can result 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.190
 confusing but use certain pages 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.190
 web will make life much easier 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.699
 in the panels below each name of 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.379
 each season comes the price that 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.570
 we have to pay from the station 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.500
 where we find the problem comes 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.379
 when the name is written in 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.609
 Japanese and we are not able to read it 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.739
 use pages like I doubt in sheet and 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.420
 perdiã will allow us not only to find 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.699
 a route that suits our 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.100
 needs but also know the price 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.710
 Ticket and streamline much of the decision 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.780
 decisions for example our hotel 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.310
 is in ikebukuro and we want to go to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.500
 marcano to get closer to the center 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.270
 commercial nakano broadway one of the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 points of interest of the phenomenon note q in 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.259
 Tokyo taking a quick look hyper 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.690
 day we will see that we have several routes to 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.700
 choose the first one sends us attacked not 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.679
 is going to invite us to change to the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.690
 metro line the journey is 14 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.060
 minutes and the 300 yen price 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.679
 if we keep looking we see that the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.470
 next route sends us to the station 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.869
 from shinjuku to change to the line j r 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.509
 joe the journey 13 minutes and the price 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.470
 170 yen almost half the route 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.090
 previous 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.100
 we take this route that is to say we go up to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.850
 train leaving high next local train 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.070
 of the line 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.600
 shaikh me from the platform 1 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.510
 we got off the train and shinjuku and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.880
 we have 4 minutes we got there 20 for 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.790
 move to platform 12 and take the train 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.770

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.270
 destination four minutes after that is to say 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.270
 at two and 28 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.770
 for distances a little longer another 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.930
 highly recommended option if we do not count 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.549
 with a japan rail pass is to buy 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.500
 our ticket in one of the many 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.810
 discount stores that we will find 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.580
 in many stations we can 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.930
 save a good amount whenever 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.330
 let's leave from 10 in the morning 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.310
 and come back before 5 in the afternoon 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.170
 that is, outside the peak hours 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.819

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.040
 kobe ​​and we want a ticket for the ak 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.620

 also ways to order it but this is 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.680
 possibly the simplest 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.630
