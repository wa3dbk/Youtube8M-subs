00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
so far the military has said that there

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.210 
so far the military has said that there
is<00:01:08.670> no<00:01:08.970> base<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.630> area<00:01:10.020> nor<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.979> there

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
is no base in that area nor was there

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.940 
is no base in that area nor was there
even<00:01:11.250> any<00:01:11.580> exercises<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.869> at<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.590> time

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
even any exercises going on at that time

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.950 
even any exercises going on at that time
and<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.369> course<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.820> space<00:01:15.030> program<00:01:15.479> said<00:01:15.750> no

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and of course the space program said no

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.200 
and of course the space program said no
there<00:01:16.170> were<00:01:16.259> no<00:01:16.439> launches<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.340> all<00:01:17.520> either<00:01:17.790> my

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
there were no launches at all either my

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
there were no launches at all either my
guess<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.930> could<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.110> another<00:01:19.290> comment

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
guess is it could be another comment

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
guess is it could be another comment
that<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.220> came<00:01:20.400> crashing<00:01:20.970> down<00:01:21.000> like<00:01:21.390> you

last<00:01:25.979> year<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.520> asteroids<00:01:27.090> actually<00:01:27.600> can

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
last year this asteroids actually can

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.230 
last year this asteroids actually can
explode<00:01:28.619> above<00:01:29.100> ground<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.850> don't<00:01:30.000> need<00:01:30.119> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
explode above ground they don't need to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.450 
explode above ground they don't need to
hit<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> ground<00:01:30.540> all<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.960> time<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.560> Astro

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
hit the ground all the time but Astro

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
noma vadym and christiansí rules out the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.039 
noma vadym and christiansí rules out the
fact<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.759> could<00:01:36.000> be<00:01:36.150> an<00:01:36.299> asteroid<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
fact that it could be an asteroid and

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
fact that it could be an asteroid and
says<00:01:37.229> it's<00:01:37.470> probably<00:01:37.770> something<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.610> do<00:01:38.790> with

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939
