needs in mind and where we go architect

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.590 
needs in mind and where we go architect
and<00:00:58.579> we<00:00:58.670> think<00:00:58.850> about<00:00:59.090> manageability

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
and we think about manageability

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.180 
and we think about manageability
security<00:01:00.320> and<00:01:00.739> other<00:01:00.829> features<00:01:01.160> and

security and other features and

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.279 
security and other features and
businesses<00:01:01.610> would<00:01:01.730> care<00:01:01.940> about<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.420> for

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
businesses would care about and for

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.100 
businesses would care about and for
example<00:01:03.739> when<00:01:04.519> you<00:01:04.610> combine<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.420> Intel<00:01:05.659> 6000

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110

series<00:01:06.259> with<00:01:06.710> Intel<00:01:07.070> vPro<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:08.000> get<00:01:08.180> much

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
series with Intel vPro you get much

as<00:03:20.139> ninety<00:03:20.470> percent<00:03:20.620> now<00:03:21.549> we<00:03:21.609> ran<00:03:21.819> the<00:03:21.940> same

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
as ninety percent now we ran the same

test<00:03:22.480> with<00:03:23.169> the<00:03:23.709> Intel<00:03:23.980> 6300<00:03:24.790> card<00:03:25.030> right<00:03:25.299> well

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
test with the Intel 6300 card right well

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.909 
test with the Intel 6300 card right well
everything<00:03:26.019> else<00:03:26.139> around<00:03:26.290> here<00:03:26.560> stays<00:03:26.769> the

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
everything else around here stays the

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:28.530 
everything else around here stays the
same<00:03:27.099> and<00:03:27.310> we<00:03:27.760> found<00:03:27.970> no<00:03:28.090> matter<00:03:28.239> where<00:03:28.510> we

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
same and we found no matter where we

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.599 
same and we found no matter where we
moved<00:03:28.930> it<00:03:29.169> within<00:03:29.470> this<00:03:29.590> area<00:03:30.010> the

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
moved it within this area the

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.580 
moved it within this area the
performance<00:03:31.060> was<00:03:31.180> pretty<00:03:31.419> consistent<00:03:31.959> so<00:03:32.500> my

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
performance was pretty consistent so my

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.050 
performance was pretty consistent so my
