damage<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:41.310> game<00:02:41.489> but<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.420> some<00:02:42.600> odd

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
damage in this game but for some odd

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.820 
damage in this game but for some odd
reason<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:43.170> know<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.380> still<00:02:43.560> get<00:02:43.680> hit

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
reason you know you still get hit

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.960 
reason you know you still get hit

does like three hundred percent damage
this<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.430> not<00:02:59.550> like<00:02:59.700> for<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.000> specific

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660

sniper rifle but you can go look at the
damage<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.300> it's<00:03:03.420> ridiculous<00:03:03.989> but<00:03:04.019> yet

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
sometimes we get like a tag straight to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.830 
sometimes we get like a tag straight to
the<00:03:05.880> chest<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.239> you're<00:03:06.390> just<00:03:06.569> gonna<00:03:06.660> like

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.620 
obviously the snipers in this game way
better<00:03:11.190> than<00:03:11.310> black<00:03:11.550> ops<00:03:11.790> black<00:03:12.030> ops<00:03:12.239> sniping

know<00:03:18.660> sniping<00:03:19.079> in<00:03:19.170> cod4<00:03:19.410> was<00:03:19.799> by<00:03:19.950> far<00:03:19.980> I'm<00:03:20.610> in

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
know sniping in cod4 was by far I'm in

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.150 
know sniping in cod4 was by far I'm in
my<00:03:21.000> opinion<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.420> best<00:03:21.720> sniping<00:03:22.650> ever<00:03:22.860> and

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
my opinion the best sniping ever and

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.560 
my opinion the best sniping ever and
Morrow<00:03:23.370> for<00:03:23.430> three<00:03:23.579> it<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.000> still<00:03:24.209> very<00:03:24.420> very

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
Morrow for three it is still very very

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.270 
Morrow for three it is still very very
fun<00:03:25.049> it's<00:03:25.260> very<00:03:25.320> similar<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.739> model<00:03:26.010> for<00:03:26.040> two

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
fun it's very similar to model for two

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.310 
fun it's very similar to model for two
and<00:03:26.549> you<00:03:27.000> know<00:03:27.090> it's<00:03:27.239> actually<00:03:27.570> enjoyable<00:03:28.079> to

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
and you know it's actually enjoyable to

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.100 
and you know it's actually enjoyable to
go<00:03:28.410> around<00:03:28.590> sniping<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.310> it's<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:30.510> crazy<00:03:30.750> to

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
go around sniping and it's so crazy to

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.170 
go around sniping and it's so crazy to
play<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.440> dome<00:03:31.650> with<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:31.890> sniper<00:03:32.070> too<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:32.730> that's

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
play on dome with a sniper too so that's

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.940 
play on dome with a sniper too so that's
why<00:03:33.329> you<00:03:33.420> see<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.720> have<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.079> ACOG<00:03:34.410> slapped<00:03:34.739> on<00:03:34.920> I

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
why you see I have the ACOG slapped on I

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.920 
why you see I have the ACOG slapped on I
think<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.250> have<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.400> kick<00:03:35.670> proficiency<00:03:36.269> when

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
think you have the kick proficiency when

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.630 
think you have the kick proficiency when
I<00:03:36.959> played<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.350> game<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.590> really<00:03:38.010> hadn't

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
I played this game I really hadn't

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.759 
I played this game I really hadn't
played<00:03:38.760> with<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:38.970> ACOG<00:03:39.360> I<00:03:39.720> mean<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.049> l<00:03:40.200> 118<00:03:40.530> at

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
played with the ACOG I mean the l 118 at

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.500 
played with the ACOG I mean the l 118 at
all<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.370> everything<00:03:41.850> was<00:03:41.910> kind<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.150> like<00:03:42.239> bear

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
all so everything was kind of like bear

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.509 
all so everything was kind of like bear
in<00:03:42.720> stock<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:42.989> didn't<00:03:43.380> have<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> speed<00:03:43.950> on<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.310> and

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
in stock I didn't have a speed on it and

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.890 
in stock I didn't have a speed on it and
I<00:03:44.700> feel<00:03:44.880> like<00:03:44.910> speed<00:03:45.269> is<00:03:45.420> probably<00:03:45.660> one<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.810> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
I feel like speed is probably one of the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.720 
I feel like speed is probably one of the
best<00:03:46.019> proficiency<00:03:46.620> speed<00:03:46.920> or<00:03:47.040> impact<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.549> don't

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
best proficiency speed or impact I don't

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.310 
best proficiency speed or impact I don't
know<00:03:47.790> because<00:03:48.120> you<00:03:48.239> know<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.600> don't<00:03:49.019> know<00:03:49.170> if

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
know because you know I don't know if

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.750 
know because you know I don't know if
impact<00:03:49.890> kind<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.130> feels<00:03:50.310> like<00:03:50.430> Full<00:03:50.640> Metal

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
impact kind of feels like Full Metal

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.210 
impact kind of feels like Full Metal
Jacket<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.299> me<00:03:51.540> well<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.350> my<00:03:52.380> mind<00:03:52.530> it<00:03:52.920> does<00:03:53.040> so

Jacket to me well in my mind it does so

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.560 
Jacket to me well in my mind it does so
if<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.400> don't<00:03:53.549> have<00:03:53.700> full<00:03:53.850> metal<00:03:54.090> jacket<00:03:54.420> on<00:03:54.540> I

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
if I don't have full metal jacket on I

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.300 
if I don't have full metal jacket on I
feel<00:03:54.840> like<00:03:54.930> I'm<00:03:55.079> missing<00:03:55.260> out<00:03:55.530> on<00:03:55.590> damage<00:03:56.100> so<00:03:56.280> I

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
feel like I'm missing out on damage so I

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.130 
feel like I'm missing out on damage so I
always<00:03:56.609> make<00:03:57.000> sure<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.120> put<00:03:57.299> impact<00:03:57.630> on<00:03:57.810> plus

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140

you know going for the wall bangs with
scopes<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.299> also<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.630> lot<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.870> fun<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.230> do<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:01.560> by

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
scopes is also a lot of fun to do and by

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.620 
scopes is also a lot of fun to do and by
getting<00:04:02.489> like<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> hitmarker<00:04:03.060> through<00:04:03.390> a<00:04:03.420> wall

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
getting like a hitmarker through a wall

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.380 
getting like a hitmarker through a wall
it's<00:04:04.590> not<00:04:04.859> very<00:04:05.100> fun<00:04:05.430> like<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:05.700> mean<00:04:05.850> it's<00:04:06.090> dome

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
it's not very fun like I mean it's dome

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.640 
it's not very fun like I mean it's dome
especially<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.140> could<00:04:07.290> shoot<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.530> guy

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
especially like you could shoot a guy

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.930 
especially like you could shoot a guy
through<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.980> crate<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.489> the<00:04:08.549> little<00:04:08.760> you

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
through the crate and the little you

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.690 
through the crate and the little you
know<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.299> don't<00:04:09.660> know<00:04:09.750> two<00:04:09.810> inches<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.700> aluminum

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700

know I don't know two inches of aluminum
whatever<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.329> metal<00:04:12.630> is<00:04:12.750> i'm<00:04:12.900> pretty<00:04:13.079> sure

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
whatever that metal is i'm pretty sure

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.050 
whatever that metal is i'm pretty sure
it's<00:04:13.320> aluminum<00:04:13.709> all<00:04:13.950> like<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.340> metal<00:04:14.640> on<00:04:14.790> this

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060

map but shooting a guy through and
getting<00:04:17.039> a<00:04:17.190> tag<00:04:17.430> most<00:04:18.359> likely<00:04:18.539> you'll<00:04:18.810> kill

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
getting a tag most likely you'll kill

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.810

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
don't have impact you'll get a hitmarker

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.360 
don't have impact you'll get a hitmarker
and<00:04:22.349> that'll<00:04:22.560> be<00:04:22.650> annoying<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.070> if<00:04:23.159> you<00:04:23.250> guys

guy that had the car 98 k and you picked
it<00:05:36.960> up<00:05:37.050> you<00:05:37.260> would<00:05:37.380> get<00:05:37.470> to<00:05:37.590> keep<00:05:37.740> it<00:05:37.920> until<00:05:38.550> you

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
it up you would get to keep it until you

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.400 
it up you would get to keep it until you
died<00:05:38.970> so<00:05:39.330> you<00:05:39.390> would<00:05:39.570> kill<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:39.870> keep<00:05:39.960> it<00:05:40.140> a<00:05:40.200> long

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
died so you would kill to keep it a long

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.140 
died so you would kill to keep it a long
time<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.680> that's<00:05:41.220> what<00:05:41.430> I<00:05:41.460> really<00:05:41.730> liked<00:05:41.940> or

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150 
time and that's what I really liked or

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.340 
time and that's what I really liked or
you<00:05:42.330> could<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.540> think<00:05:42.990> you<00:05:43.080> could<00:05:43.230> have

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
you could I think you could have

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.260 
you could I think you could have
actually<00:05:43.530> you<00:05:44.010> could<00:05:44.130> keep<00:05:44.370> it<00:05:44.520> and<00:05:44.760> you<00:05:45.150> could

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
actually you could keep it and you could

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.730 
actually you could keep it and you could
have<00:05:45.450> the<00:05:45.600> moisan<00:05:46.020> also<00:05:46.350> so<00:05:46.470> you<00:05:46.560> could<00:05:46.650> have

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
have the moisan also so you could have

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.500 
have the moisan also so you could have
two<00:05:46.950> rifles<00:05:47.160> so<00:05:47.610> if<00:05:47.730> you<00:05:47.850> you<00:05:48.000> know<00:05:48.030> ran<00:05:48.360> out<00:05:48.480> of
