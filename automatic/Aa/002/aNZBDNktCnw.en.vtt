00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
here somehow worst expansion ever I miss

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160 
here somehow worst expansion ever I miss
two<00:02:29.370> expansions<00:02:30.000> ago<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.630> then<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.930> next

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
two expansions ago and then the next

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.810 
two expansions ago and then the next
expansion<00:02:31.470> comes<00:02:31.920> out<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.460> cycle

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
expansion comes out and the cycle

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.470 
expansion comes out and the cycle
repeats

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
repeats

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.270
