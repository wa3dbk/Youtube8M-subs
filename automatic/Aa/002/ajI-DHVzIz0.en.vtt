00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
issues really of manufacturing where we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.390 
issues really of manufacturing where we
are<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:20.659> think<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.900> lot<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> people<00:01:22.590> we're

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
are I think a lot of people we're

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.530 
are I think a lot of people we're
interesting<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> fact<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.420> were<00:01:24.509> in

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
interesting the fact that we were in

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.270 
interesting the fact that we were in
some<00:01:24.659> sense<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.170> Somerset<00:01:25.770> has<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.979> good

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
some sense I think Somerset has a good

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.289 
some sense I think Somerset has a good
feel<00:01:26.549> about<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
feel about it

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.499 
feel about it
it's<00:01:27.689> known<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.439> its<00:01:28.770> innovation<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:30.180> known

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it's known for its innovation it's known

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.109 
it's known for its innovation it's known
for<00:01:30.540> its<00:01:30.810> food<00:01:30.990> businesses<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.890> therefore

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
for its food businesses and therefore

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.170 
for its food businesses and therefore
people<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.720> mark<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> quality<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
people see it as a mark of quality you

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.550 
people see it as a mark of quality you

and<00:01:57.630> actually<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.710> had<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> lot<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> involvement

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
and actually I had a lot of involvement

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.420 
and actually I had a lot of involvement
with<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> business<00:02:00.899> not<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.469> locally<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.280> in

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
with a business not so locally but in

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.370 
with a business not so locally but in
the<00:02:02.549> next<00:02:02.790> County<00:02:03.270> who<00:02:03.540> helped<00:02:03.899> me<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.020> huge

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the next County who helped me a huge

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.859 
the next County who helped me a huge
amount<00:02:04.530> with<00:02:04.829> my<00:02:05.009> business<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.719> starting<00:02:06.719> up

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
amount with my business and starting up

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.600 
amount with my business and starting up
and<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.079> think<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:07.680> what's<00:02:07.860> important<00:02:08.399> is

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and I think that's what's important is

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.729 
and I think that's what's important is
does<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.239> suit<00:02:09.420> your<00:02:09.569> business<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.500> what

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
does it suit your business is that what

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.800 
does it suit your business is that what
you<00:02:10.920> want<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.120> then<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.480> think<00:02:12.660> it's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
you want and if it is then I think it's

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.440 
you want and if it is then I think it's
a<00:02:12.840> great<00:02:13.020> place<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.260> be
