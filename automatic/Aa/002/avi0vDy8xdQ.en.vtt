right now it's standing so now you've

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.400 
right now it's standing so now you've
got<00:00:20.070> something<00:00:20.340> new<00:00:20.760> here<00:00:21.240> which<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.840> iris

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
got something new here which is the iris

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.040 
got something new here which is the iris
plus<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.609> iris<00:00:23.880> plus<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.420> what

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
plus the iris plus and what

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.630 
plus the iris plus and what
distinguishes<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.710> from<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.949> original<00:00:26.340> iris

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
distinguishes it from the original iris

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.230 
distinguishes it from the original iris
well<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.869> new<00:00:28.140> iris<00:00:28.590> plus<00:00:28.910> that<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.000> just

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
well the new iris plus that we just

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 
well the new iris plus that we just
released<00:00:30.539> has<00:00:31.369> quite<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> few<00:00:32.550> different

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
released has quite a few different

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.850 
released has quite a few different
features<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.690> we've<00:00:33.840> improved<00:00:34.140> upon<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
features that we've improved upon the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.459 
features that we've improved upon the
original<00:00:35.340> iris<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:36.600> thing<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.079> really

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
original iris one thing I really really

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.200 
original iris one thing I really really
like<00:00:37.620> about<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.010> aircraft<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
like about this aircraft is the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.819 
like about this aircraft is the
self-tightening<00:00:39.980> screw-on<00:00:40.980> drops<00:00:41.520> oh<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
self-tightening screw-on drops oh so the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.290 
self-tightening screw-on drops oh so the
threads<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.340> opposite<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> direction<00:00:45.000> of

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
threads are opposite the direction of

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.930 
threads are opposite the direction of
the<00:00:45.390> rotation<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> motor<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.920> what<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the rotation of the motor and what that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940 
the rotation of the motor and what that
means<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.050> construe<00:00:49.500> them<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.770> backwards

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
means is you construe them on backwards

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.580 
means is you construe them on backwards
and<00:00:50.520> as<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> motor<00:00:51.449> spins<00:00:51.809> its<00:00:52.199> self

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
and as the motor spins its self

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.020 
and as the motor spins its self
heightening<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.430> when<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.610> need<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> put<00:00:53.940> it

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
heightening and when you need to put it

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.700 
heightening and when you need to put it
back<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.329> case<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.870> change<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.260> prop<00:00:55.469> it's

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
back in the case for change of prop it's

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.560 
back in the case for change of prop it's
very<00:00:55.980> very<00:00:56.309> easy<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> thought<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.360> was

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
very very easy so I thought that was

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.479 
very very easy so I thought that was
really<00:00:57.840> smart<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.710> don't<00:00:59.039> worry<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.250> thought<00:00:59.399> of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
really smart I don't worry we thought of

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.439 
really smart I don't worry we thought of
that<00:00:59.609> sooner<00:00:59.699> I'm<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.359> those

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that sooner I'm one of those

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.389 
that sooner I'm one of those
unfortunates<00:01:01.199> back<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> day<00:01:01.890> where<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.219> had

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
unfortunates back in the day where I had

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.640 
unfortunates back in the day where I had
a<00:01:02.430> prop<00:01:02.879> nut<00:01:03.120> separate<00:01:03.690> once<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> aircraft

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
a prop nut separate once on the aircraft

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.170 
a prop nut separate once on the aircraft
with<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> hundred<00:01:05.189> feet<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.610> air<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.030> on

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
with a hundred feet up in the air and on

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.350 
with a hundred feet up in the air and on
fpv<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> other<00:01:07.439> propellant<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.850> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
fpv and the other propellant and the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.830 
fpv and the other propellant and the
aircraft<00:01:09.770> yep<00:01:10.770> no<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> great

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
aircraft yep no this is a great

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.300 
aircraft yep no this is a great
innovation<00:01:12.840> new<00:01:13.380> propellers<00:01:13.890> higher

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
innovation new propellers higher

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.580 
innovation new propellers higher
efficiency<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:15.720> flexibility<00:01:16.290> for

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
efficiency or more flexibility for

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.280 
efficiency or more flexibility for
civility<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.100> control<00:01:17.780> that's<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> cross<00:01:19.110> we

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
civility and control that's the cross we

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.830 
civility and control that's the cross we
got<00:01:19.409> new<00:01:19.619> motors<00:01:19.979> okay<00:01:20.939> or<00:01:21.150> more<00:01:21.330> efficient

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
got new motors okay or more efficient

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.100 
got new motors okay or more efficient
the<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.640> frame<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.150> body<00:01:24.360> material<00:01:24.630> itself

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the the frame and body material itself

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.190 
the the frame and body material itself
is<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.710> new<00:01:26.220> composition<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.049> deal

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
is a new composition I'm here to deal

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.620 
is a new composition I'm here to deal
own<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.740> lot<00:01:28.920> lighter<00:01:29.220> Oh<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:30.299> lot<00:01:30.479> more

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
own so it's a lot lighter Oh a lot more

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
own so it's a lot lighter Oh a lot more
durable<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.140> flexible<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.490> goes<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> weight

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
durable and flexible so it goes a weight

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.789 
durable and flexible so it goes a weight
yeah<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.570> check<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.810> oh<00:01:33.960> wait<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.590> that's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
yeah you can check out oh wait so that's

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.440 
yeah you can check out oh wait so that's
like<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.189> flying<00:01:35.430> weight<00:01:35.640> minus<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.119> battery

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
like the flying weight minus the battery

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.179 
like the flying weight minus the battery
of<00:01:36.540> course<00:01:36.780> that's<00:01:36.960> not<00:01:37.140> bad<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.890> changed

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
of course that's not bad so we changed

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.980 
of course that's not bad so we changed
the<00:01:38.310> mixture<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:39.030> don't<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.450> what<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> was

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the mixture up I don't know what it was

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.530 
the mixture up I don't know what it was
exactly<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.250> lighter<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.360> more

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
exactly but it's lighter and it's more

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.030 
exactly but it's lighter and it's more
flexible<00:01:42.780> which<00:01:43.170> means<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.619> much<00:01:43.860> more

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
flexible which means it's much more

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
flexible which means it's much more
durable<00:01:44.310> if<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.270> happen<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.600> bump<00:01:45.810> into

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
durable if you do happen to bump into

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.889 
durable if you do happen to bump into
something<00:01:46.229> outstanding<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.970> you've<00:01:48.299> seen<00:01:48.720> me

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
something outstanding and you've seen me

rail<00:02:16.680> new<00:02:17.680> legs<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:18.310> think<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.180> saved<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.959> way

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
rail new legs I think we saved the way

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.500 
rail new legs I think we saved the way
savings<00:02:20.500> was<00:02:20.709> like<00:02:20.890> two<00:02:21.730> hundred<00:02:21.880> percent<00:02:22.420> or

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
savings was like two hundred percent or

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.360 
savings was like two hundred percent or
something<00:02:22.780> it's<00:02:23.110> substantially<00:02:23.800> better<00:02:23.980> with

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
something it's substantially better with

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.060 
something it's substantially better with
the<00:02:24.490> legs<00:02:24.700> with<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.060> new<00:02:25.180> carbon<00:02:25.540> fiber<00:02:25.750> legs

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
the legs with the new carbon fiber legs

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.250 
the legs with the new carbon fiber legs
well<00:02:27.070> its<00:02:27.310> carbon<00:02:27.550> fiber<00:02:27.850> and<00:02:28.270> fiber<00:02:28.420> rod<00:02:28.690> Wow

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
well its carbon fiber and fiber rod Wow

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.590 
well its carbon fiber and fiber rod Wow
defeat<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.250> new<00:02:30.400> goes<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.300> same<00:02:31.480> spot

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
defeat and the new goes in the same spot

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.370 
defeat and the new goes in the same spot
as<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:31.810> old<00:02:31.990> r<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:33.030> wider<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.450> camera<00:02:35.050> angle

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
as the old r is wider like camera angle

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.560 
as the old r is wider like camera angle
ok<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.310> think<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:36.640> this<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.970> that's<00:02:37.420> nice

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
ok so you think so this is that's nice

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.780 
ok so you think so this is that's nice
position<00:02:37.959> out<00:02:38.350> here<00:02:38.590> is<00:02:38.709> because<00:02:38.739> i<00:02:39.070> get<00:02:39.670> this

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
position out here is because i get this

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.670 
position out here is because i get this
nice<00:02:40.000> view<00:02:40.239> from<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.480> camera<00:02:40.840> sure<00:02:41.320> sure

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
nice view from the camera sure sure

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.430 
nice view from the camera sure sure
we've<00:02:42.250> relocated<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.180> telemetry<00:02:43.600> intent<00:02:44.260> so

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
we've relocated the telemetry intent so

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.680 
we've relocated the telemetry intent so
we<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.800> better<00:02:45.430> signal<00:02:46.330> on<00:02:46.660> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
we can have a better signal on the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.000 
we can have a better signal on the
ground<00:02:46.989> we're<00:02:47.170> pointing<00:02:47.440> it<00:02:47.500> downwards<00:02:47.860> now

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
ground we're pointing it downwards now

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.830 
ground we're pointing it downwards now
which<00:02:48.610> through<00:02:49.090> all<00:02:49.180> our<00:02:49.330> testing<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:49.780> all

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
which through all our testing and all

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.600 
which through all our testing and all
the<00:02:49.930> aircraft<00:02:50.230> people<00:02:50.440> i<00:02:50.470> found<00:02:50.770> out<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.100> you

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
the aircraft people i found out that you

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.370 
the aircraft people i found out that you
put<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.880> antenna<00:02:52.120> downward<00:02:52.570> is<00:02:52.989> actually

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
put the antenna downward is actually

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.750 
put the antenna downward is actually
less<00:02:53.560> blocking<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:54.130> from<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.370> ground<00:02:54.459> station

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
less blocking it from the ground station

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.640 
less blocking it from the ground station
and<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.510> works<00:02:55.690> way<00:02:55.930> better<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.230> know<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.530> our

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
and it works way better you know in our

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.020 
and it works way better you know in our
latest<00:02:56.920> designs<00:02:57.340> we've<00:02:57.550> discovered<00:02:57.850> the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
latest designs we've discovered the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.880 
latest designs we've discovered the
exact<00:02:58.330> same<00:02:58.510> thing<00:02:58.690> why<00:02:59.050> we<00:02:59.200> ever<00:02:59.350> mounted<00:02:59.709> an

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
exact same thing why we ever mounted an

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.400 
exact same thing why we ever mounted an
antenna<00:03:00.280> on<00:03:00.610> an<00:03:00.880> aircraft<00:03:01.030> pointing<00:03:01.780> up<00:03:01.959> it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
antenna on an aircraft pointing up it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.960 
antenna on an aircraft pointing up it
seemed<00:03:02.769> like<00:03:02.800> the<00:03:03.100> right<00:03:03.220> thing<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.550> do<00:03:03.730> that's

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
seemed like the right thing to do that's

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.860 
seemed like the right thing to do that's
totally<00:03:04.450> not<00:03:04.709> all<00:03:05.709> right<00:03:06.480> but<00:03:07.480> that's<00:03:07.720> why

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
totally not all right but that's why

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.630 
totally not all right but that's why
this<00:03:07.930> stuff<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.320> exciting<00:03:08.860> because<00:03:09.010> you<00:03:09.549> know

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
this stuff is exciting because you know

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.910 
this stuff is exciting because you know
we're<00:03:10.209> constantly<00:03:10.570> evolving<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.590> learning

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
we're constantly evolving and learning

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.229 
we're constantly evolving and learning
new<00:03:12.070> techniques<00:03:12.370> like<00:03:12.700> that's<00:03:12.910> why<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.090> enjoy

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
new techniques like that's why I enjoy

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.630 
new techniques like that's why I enjoy
it<00:03:13.570> yes<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.560> most<00:03:14.830> important<00:03:15.280> thing<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.580> I

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
it yes the most important thing that I

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.810 
it yes the most important thing that I
like<00:03:15.880> new<00:03:16.480> battery<00:03:16.840> system<00:03:17.280> losi<00:03:18.280> discharged

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
like new battery system losi discharged

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.360 
like new battery system losi discharged
battery<00:03:19.120> we're<00:03:19.690> ray<00:03:20.040> overrated<00:03:21.040> we<00:03:21.160> can<00:03:21.280> have

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
battery we're ray overrated we can have

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.710 
battery we're ray overrated we can have
a<00:03:21.400> lot<00:03:21.670> of<00:03:21.700> power<00:03:21.910> but<00:03:22.090> we<00:03:22.239> found<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.570> most

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
a lot of power but we found that most

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.030 
a lot of power but we found that most
people<00:03:22.989> don't<00:03:23.019> need<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:23.560> kind<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.829> power

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
people don't need that kind of power

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.490 
people don't need that kind of power
level<00:03:24.430> ok<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:24.880> what<00:03:25.420> we<00:03:25.570> did<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:25.810> we<00:03:25.959> drop<00:03:26.380> the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
level ok so what we did is we drop the

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.410 
level ok so what we did is we drop the
sea<00:03:26.680> rating<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.519> what<00:03:27.640> that<00:03:27.670> allows<00:03:27.850> us<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.269> do

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
sea rating and what that allows us to do

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.900 
sea rating and what that allows us to do
is<00:03:28.450> have<00:03:29.049> more<00:03:29.320> capacity<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.220> battery<00:03:30.579> for

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
is have more capacity in the battery for

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.880 
is have more capacity in the battery for
this<00:03:31.030> for<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.299> given<00:03:31.480> weight<00:03:31.750> oh<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:32.739> we've

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
this for a given weight oh so we've

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.610 
this for a given weight oh so we've
dropped<00:03:33.160> to<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.730> think<00:03:34.060> an<00:03:34.239> AC<00:03:34.420> battery<00:03:34.780> 50<00:03:35.470> 100

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620

milliamps from a thirty five hundred
million<00:03:38.280> well<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.820> we've<00:03:40.360> been<00:03:40.840> able<00:03:41.019> to

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
million well so we've been able to

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.199 
million well so we've been able to
achieve<00:03:41.350> a<00:03:41.769> one<00:03:42.100> hundred<00:03:42.400> percent<00:03:42.430> increase

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209
