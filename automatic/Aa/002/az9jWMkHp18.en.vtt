00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
heat damage and um I'm really just

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.040 
heat damage and um I'm really just
trying<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:46.730> see<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.000> can<00:00:48.149> restore<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.840> hair

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.830 
trying to see if I can restore the hair
because<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.160> find<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.449> hair<00:00:51.600> gets

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
because I find that when the hair gets

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.160 
because I find that when the hair gets
wet<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.320> gets<00:00:52.350> very<00:00:52.980> puffy<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.329> I'm<00:00:54.629> hoping

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
wet it gets very puffy so I'm hoping

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
wet it gets very puffy so I'm hoping
that<00:00:55.440> maybe<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:56.129> cuticles<00:00:56.640> are<00:00:56.789> just<00:00:57.030> clogged

rid<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.450> she<00:02:09.750> did<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> variance<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.830> so

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
rid of it and she did a variance and so

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.210 
rid of it and she did a variance and so
I've<00:02:11.730> always<00:02:12.000> wanted<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.630> one<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.140> I'm<00:02:13.470> from

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
I've always wanted to do one so I'm from

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.070 
I've always wanted to do one so I'm from
watching<00:02:14.520> her<00:02:14.670> video<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.209> did<00:02:15.450> some<00:02:15.630> research

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
watching her video I did some research

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.690 
watching her video I did some research
and<00:02:16.350> then<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.709> said<00:02:16.920> okay<00:02:17.100> I'm<00:02:17.190> gonna<00:02:17.310> go<00:02:17.489> and

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
and then I said okay I'm gonna go and

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.010 
and then I said okay I'm gonna go and
try<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.000> my<00:02:18.120> hair<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.390> see<00:02:18.690> if<00:02:18.840> your

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
try that on my hair to see if your

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.320 
try that on my hair to see if your
restores<00:02:19.560> because<00:02:20.459> I'm<00:02:20.580> hoping<00:02:20.940> maybe<00:02:21.090> my

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
restores because I'm hoping maybe my

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.310 
restores because I'm hoping maybe my
cuticles<00:02:21.810> are<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.170> clogged<00:02:22.470> but<00:02:22.860> uh<00:02:24.320> you

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
cuticles are just clogged but uh you

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.540 
cuticles are just clogged but uh you
guys<00:02:25.440> could<00:02:25.650> see<00:02:25.770> I'm<00:02:25.860> hoping<00:02:26.040> as<00:02:26.250> much<00:02:26.400> as

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
guys could see I'm hoping as much as

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.910 
guys could see I'm hoping as much as
damage<00:02:27.000> I'm<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:27.360> hoping<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.800> know

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
damage I'm really hoping you know

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.280 
damage I'm really hoping you know
especially<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.520> front<00:02:29.910> as<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.959> see<00:02:31.170> it's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
especially in the front as you see it's

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.110 
especially in the front as you see it's
just<00:02:31.410> much<00:02:31.680> more<00:02:31.709> than<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.190> birth<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
just much more than that birth in the

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.410 
just much more than that birth in the
front<00:02:33.560> so<00:02:34.560> I'm<00:02:34.920> going<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.670> attempt<00:02:36.209> on

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
front so I'm going to attempt on

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.930 
front so I'm going to attempt on
correcting<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.440> problem<00:02:37.950> with<00:02:38.070> my<00:02:38.220> hair<00:02:38.489> by

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
correcting the problem with my hair by

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180 
correcting the problem with my hair by
doing<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.420> difference<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.470> wanted<00:02:40.800> for

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
doing the difference and I wanted for

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.380 
doing the difference and I wanted for
you<00:02:41.340> guys<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:42.030> watch<00:02:42.540> along<00:02:42.810> with<00:02:43.050> me<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:45.150> see

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.690 
you guys to watch along with me to see
I'm<00:02:45.780> hoping<00:02:46.230> because<00:02:46.680> if<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.160> know<00:02:47.489> I'm

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
I'm hoping because if not I know I'm

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.310 
I'm hoping because if not I know I'm
probably<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.299> have<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.570> kind<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.140> get

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
probably going to have to kind of get

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.780 
probably going to have to kind of get
cut<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.769> don't<00:02:49.830> want<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.100> cut<00:02:50.310> because<00:02:50.519> I

what I can do to fix this problem other
than<00:03:16.290> cutting<00:03:16.530> cuz<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:16.950> already<00:03:17.040> know<00:03:17.280> that's

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
than cutting cuz I already know that's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.360 
than cutting cuz I already know that's
probably<00:03:17.670> one<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.540> number<00:03:19.500> one<00:03:19.650> options<00:03:20.250> I

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
probably one of the number one options I

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.440 
probably one of the number one options I
might<00:03:20.579> have<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.390> cut<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:23.120> I'm<00:03:24.120> gonna<00:03:24.269> go

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
might have is to cut but I'm gonna go

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.140 
might have is to cut but I'm gonna go
ahead<00:03:24.720> and<00:03:24.959> do<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.200> variance<00:03:25.709> I'm<00:03:26.340> going<00:03:26.850> to

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
ahead and do the variance I'm going to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.319 
ahead and do the variance I'm going to
