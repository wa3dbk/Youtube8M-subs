00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.470
 This time preppy college is 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:23.160
 Takahisa Okamura from Links appears 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:25.360
 Cut basic Okamura's popular talent utilizing both world top class becomes stronger in the short 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.039
 And electromagnetic the 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:36.030
 The clarity of the cut theory is origami 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.020
 Heh small I part shining in the form is out thus greatly HeKKon to the site each part of the hairline 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 The part 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.140
 And a small, lying part that's big 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.680
 Then there is a feature in the way that it's a big lie and a big one 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.030
 I will 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:56.019
 This is the same as the same layer 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:58.800
 Round of the cup is the will to wig all drawn Western be against the roundness of the head head 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:05.129
 I struggled parallel to 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.909
 It will be fick It will be divided into 2 upper and lower because it is wider 8 freshly 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.500
 First is the lower panel 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:16.900
 This part is facing backwards, so a little panel 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.900
 Go in the draw meaning behind some 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.170
 The 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.160
 Then I think that I want to cut mens from now 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:41.800
 The difference with the raw milk layer explained earlier 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:43.280
 Cut the Rukoto and the weight section in the cut of the gradient Kariage the side 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.030
 I'm going 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:51.290
 And around the face while putting a direction behind 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:56.890
 I think that I want to cut so that a person remains long 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.890
 Pull the panel on the midline on base 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.600
 We will cut in a total of 9 cities in the same layer 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.930
 Cut with gradation cut in conjunction with under fiction 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:26.190
 Now I will cut the front from the pier stick in the state that I put a direction behind 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.190
 I will 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.630
 It is an image of the finish 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:40.150
 First of all it is a play that is a sense of hair on the tip of the neck 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:43.260
 And I put a beautiful round with gradation made in the weight section and sharp 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.260
 I make a form 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.930
 eh 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:03:00.720
 I think that I want to cut women from now 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.810
 Unlike the wick, cut the 8 under section with a gradation cut. 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.470
 Yeah 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.800
 We will cut the weight section with a gradation cut 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.940
 Huh 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.160
 Basically it's a little short but a little room like a short gradient 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.990
 I would like to have a style of 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.990
 so 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:24.320
 In the back standing panel, we will shift from a slight angle towards the side to a near side panel again 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.320
 We will make the face a little heavy style 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.319
 Oh 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.330
 Rice number on the midline 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:41.370
 Pull out 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.000
 In the cut of the gradation 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.740
 I will continue to struggle without changing the length of the outline 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.650
 Switch around the face with 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:55.900
 In just a little bit without changing the name the way of sideburns 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.900
 And switching a layer of cut 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.810
 Around the face 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.959
 And I understand the cause 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.870
 Model talk of fertilization model 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:27.640
 Basically the whole is cut with gradation base, so it's still feminine roundness 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.640
 I think Tte of is that it is a point
