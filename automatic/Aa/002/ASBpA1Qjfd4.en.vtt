00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.760
 every year thousands of undocumented 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:10.030
 They try to cross the Mexican Republic 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.490
 to get to the US is 8,000 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.940
 kilometers from the southern border to 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.020
 the northern border and on its way 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.539
 many of the illegals do not prove 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.919
 food nor water and many days and it is here 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.369
 where the work of the 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:23.369
 patrons 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.500
 Well, the patron saints tell us because here 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.170
 It is always celebrated on the 12th of 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.780
 december the saint the birthday of the 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.730
 virgin of guadeloupe and that's why the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.730
 congregation is called the patron saint 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.960
 the patrons prepare up to 200 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.960
 daily servings of food 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.310
 without resting until Sundays there is no 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.680
 day that is not seen every day or what 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.830
 there is no there is not a day that is not 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.830
 of 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.629
 they should be ready because when it sounds 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.629
 the train whistle 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.520
 all must run to the tracks with the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.520
 food 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.840
 you saw the speed it takes 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.820
 this time sometimes so much for them 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.020
 as it costs us a lot for us 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.300
 give them the food but we try to make it 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.970
 go be well served in what 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.040
 We could because the engineer does not 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 low speed 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.030
 there is no time for the train to pass 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.150
 neither do you know how many undocumented 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.850
 will come three for two in wagons one 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.960
 so immigrants are given water 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:59.190
 they pass and they grab here and they take 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.800
 your water that's why this is tied to you 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.300
 hilito so they can grab the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.040
 Water 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.790
 dona leonila was the pioneer of 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.009
 The 73-year-old patron is still giving 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.110
 eat the migrants 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.049
 the lack of sleep since my initials 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.850
 we enter the 16th and we do not tire 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.860
 true 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.260
 and then we are not happy and we do 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.770
 we make the tubes and saw some tooth 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.770
 what do we do 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.270
