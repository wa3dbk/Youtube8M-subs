coming from the sea flag usually when

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.920 
coming from the sea flag usually when

you come up a hill really isn't that

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500 
you come up a hill really isn't that
much<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.260> advantage<00:01:01.760> but<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.850> really<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.300> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
much of advantage but you really have to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.420 
much of advantage but you really have to
transverse<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.650> around<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.280> want

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
maps are great maps I mean a lot of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.490

people<00:01:47.909> say<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.270> map<00:01:48.450> reminds<00:01:48.960> them<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.259> a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
people say this map reminds them of a

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.039 
people say this map reminds them of a
battlefield<00:01:49.829> math<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.490> I'm<00:01:50.549> I'm<00:01:51.390> assuming

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
battlefield math and I'm I'm assuming

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:52.999 
battlefield math and I'm I'm assuming
that's<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> slap<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.860> face

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
that's like a slap in the face

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.179 
that's like a slap in the face
battlefield<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.090> whatever<00:01:55.020> here<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.070> go

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
battlefield so whatever here you can go

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
battlefield so whatever here you can go

the top of that book crate just shoot
them<00:02:24.300> as<00:02:24.450> they<00:02:24.570> come<00:02:24.600> up<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.930> hill<00:02:25.020> here<00:02:25.770> you

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
them as they come up the hill here you

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.140 
them as they come up the hill here you
can<00:02:25.950> see<00:02:26.070> they<00:02:26.160> got<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.370> holes<00:02:26.580> inside<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
can see they got the holes inside the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.780 
can see they got the holes inside the
top<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.450> roof<00:02:27.660> great<00:02:28.020> for<00:02:28.230> grenade

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
top of the roof great for grenade

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.030 
top of the roof great for grenade
placement<00:02:30.080> and<00:02:31.080> then<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.320> power<00:02:31.560> plant<00:02:31.920> in

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
placement and then the power plant in

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.430 
placement and then the power plant in
the<00:02:32.130> back<00:02:32.480> usually<00:02:33.480> if<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.630> start<00:02:33.989> killing

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the back usually if you start killing

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.160 
the back usually if you start killing
them<00:02:34.590> killing<00:02:35.100> them<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.720> smaller<00:02:36.720> maps<00:02:36.989> they

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
them killing them in smaller maps they

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.570 
them killing them in smaller maps they
would<00:02:37.290> spawn<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.890> other<00:02:38.010> side<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.459> you'd

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
would spawn on the other side and you'd

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.729 
would spawn on the other side and you'd
flip<00:02:38.820> them<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.690> on<00:02:39.780> this<00:02:39.900> map<00:02:40.170> they<00:02:40.320> just<00:02:40.530> keep

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
flip them but on this map they just keep

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.370 
flip them but on this map they just keep
spawning<00:02:41.190> further<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.239> further<00:02:42.570> and<00:02:42.810> further

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
spawning further and further and further

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.620 
spawning further and further and further
back<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.489> got<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.760> right<00:02:44.940> side<00:02:45.239> that

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
back so you got the right side that

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.180 
back so you got the right side that
really<00:02:45.900> does<00:02:46.020> have<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> building<00:02:46.709> named<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.010> call

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
really does have a building named I call

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.530 
really does have a building named I call
that<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.430> refinery<00:02:47.880> part<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.300> then<00:02:48.390> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
that the refinery part and then the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.780 
that the refinery part and then the
other<00:02:48.570> side<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:49.020> building<00:02:49.380> 3<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.070> then<00:02:50.700> you

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
other side is building 3 and then you

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.120 
other side is building 3 and then you
come<00:02:51.000> down<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.300> hill<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.810> then<00:02:52.709> you're

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
come down this hill and then you're

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.670 
come down this hill and then you're

will notice to always get the transverse

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.180 
will notice to always get the transverse
here<00:03:18.000> use<00:03:18.209> nice<00:03:18.510> angle<00:03:19.079> right<00:03:19.709> into<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.070> blue

go right here and yeah so usually if

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.400 
go right here and yeah so usually if
they<00:03:27.299> you<00:03:27.510> kill<00:03:27.780> them<00:03:27.870> right<00:03:27.959> there<00:03:28.200> they'll

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
they you kill them right there they'll

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.140 
they you kill them right there they'll
spawn<00:03:28.680> back<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.130> let<00:03:29.250> me<00:03:29.340> go<00:03:29.459> further<00:03:29.700> back<00:03:29.940> in

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
spawn back and let me go further back in

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.210 
spawn back and let me go further back in
the<00:03:30.180> loop<00:03:30.540> around<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.900> rock<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.440> it's<00:03:31.590> it's

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
the loop around the rock so it's it's

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.940 
the loop around the rock so it's it's
basically<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.910> big<00:03:33.480> huge<00:03:33.900> circle<00:03:34.470> with<00:03:34.709> two

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
basically a big huge circle with two

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.580 
basically a big huge circle with two

the<00:03:38.489> thing<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:39.090> going<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.329> have<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.510> learn

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
the thing is just going to have to learn

OJT on-the-job training baby this is one
of<00:03:44.970> those<00:03:45.090> maps<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.690> can<00:03:45.720> see<00:03:45.989> right<00:03:46.019> here<00:03:46.350> I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
of those maps you can see right here I

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.650 
of those maps you can see right here I
get<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.709> nice<00:03:46.890> aerial<00:03:47.340> view<00:03:47.610> that's<00:03:48.510> where

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
get a nice aerial view that's where

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.150 
get a nice aerial view that's where
they'll<00:03:48.810> spawn<00:03:49.079> and<00:03:49.440> they're<00:03:49.530> just<00:03:49.650> they'll

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
they'll spawn and they're just they'll

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.039 
they'll spawn and they're just they'll
take<00:03:50.370> lanes<00:03:50.670> just<00:03:51.180> like<00:03:51.360> running<00:03:51.750> off<00:03:51.870> for
