 Puntocom practice for those who do not 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.650
 know I am normal today 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:20.580
 I bring a video of crafts we are going to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.080
 make salt dough or homemade play dough 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.750
 super practical and natural this mass me 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.099
 love it because we can use it 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.170
 Primarily to make the impression 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.870
 of the hands and feet of our 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.820
 babies to have that milestone memory that 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.030
 We also love can do 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.520
 for decoration to give the day of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.430
 mothers the father's day the day of the 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.650
 boy the day of the grandfather and our Christmas 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.050
 they also make all your ornaments 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.480
 Christmas your spheres in some way 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.150
 especially for the day of love and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 friendship for nothing else because they like it 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.180
 make figurines so let's go to the video 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.480
 today but first bring the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.120
 ingredients 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.740
 We're going to need a cup of flour 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.760
 white half cup of water half cup of 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.890
 salt a container or container 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.979
 Vegetable dyes or paints 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.530
 acrylics that I comment and right now 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:23.229
 cookie cutters container or 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.320
 container let's put our cup of 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.320
 flour 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.700
 let's put our half cup of salt 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.619
 and we're going to put the half cup of water 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.890
 always leave a little more water for 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:46.950
 If your mass needs it and we are going to mix 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.950
 all this we pass to the mix 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.930
 and we keep kneading 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.230
 and there they are we already have our 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.000
 plasticine or salt dough 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.200
 this is the consistency that has to 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.710
 be ok since we have our mass of 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.540
 salt so perfect that we can not stick it 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.700
 what we have to do is put the 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.040
 coloring a very important thing is that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.280
 we are going to put it very little because if 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.870
 it will not soften our mass much 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.560
 It is also another thing we can do is 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.650
 leave it in the in the natural color as 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.740
 he leaves it music and since it is dry 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.960
 we can paint it with acrylic paints 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.350
 how are you 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.470
 but these are already when we have our 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:42.120
 completely dry mass we are going to put you 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.600
 little color to our mass since we have 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.190
 our masses with color well let's 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.280
 give it shape in that that is very easy 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.870
 we can use cookie cutters 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.870
 any type of cutter 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.130
 with a roller if it makes it easier with 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.520
 the roll is postponed so it does not look too 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.280
 delgadito 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.230
 and let's take our cutter quoted from 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.860
 cookie and looks good our cutter 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.790
 cookies 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.950
 and like any other plasticine like that 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.010
 very nice you can stick a magnet and 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.860
 We can paste them in the refrigerator by 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.850
 your piece of waxed bronx paper in 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.600
 our table and we take our mass of 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.220
 salt or plasticine either colored or 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.730
 natural natural color let's 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.620
 stretch it here and you can stop the 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.560
 size that you want me to use 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.099
 a cutter 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.000
 so that the box remains so that 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.000
 look nicer 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.500
 and now we are going to bring the guest of the 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.840
 today I have this doll 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.930
 to show them true but good 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.660
 you consume, I recommend you 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.750
 at the foot he cited the baby we are going to put a 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:05.570
 little of 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.200
 petroleum jelly or baby oil so you do not 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:12.040
 paste and make it easier to take the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.120
 print to your piece and tone 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.160
 since it's like this now we're going to take 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.410
 our play dough and we will put your 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.890
 foot quoted pressing 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.530
 we withdraw from space so we will 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.770
 remain the impression and here below because 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.830
 You can put your name or date on the 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.010
 who made their impression for the most 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.710
 we follow the same procedure 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.950
 and we just press our fingers into the dough 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.190
 so that our hand is marked as 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.190
 here 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.750
 ah 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:55.280
 and well, you can leave this 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.199
 Drying in the sun is going everything is going to 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.960
 take about one or two days 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.249
 approximately or we can put it to 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.159
 oven 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:07.129
 to the conventional oven that's what 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:10.219
 I will do and I taught them how 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:13.309
 our impressions ended 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:15.889
 we put in the oven at 180 degrees for half 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:18.520
 time to me these figurines I like that 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:21.729
 are inflated 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.710
 and good out of the oven that 's how 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.909
 we have the colored salt mass 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:32.530
 natural so I decorate them with these 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:36.009
 permanent markers can put the 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.099
 outline nothing else or paint them with 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:43.150
 acrylic paints also to the hands 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:46.440
 I put them to 120 degrees or so 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.379
 approximately 40 to 45 minutes 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:54.020
 so they do not inflate and it will look great 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:56.690
 marked hands 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.090
 practices girls and boys we finished the 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.069
