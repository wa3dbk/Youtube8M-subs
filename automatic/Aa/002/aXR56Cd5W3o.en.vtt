00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.600
 Friends of televisadeportes.com what a pleasure 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.060
 greet them eduardo shine anselmo alonso 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.460
 with the summary of the match atlas against 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.250
 pop a tie to 0 my dear lalo 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.110
 bricio that on the one hand is satisfied 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.050
 to the fringe team and very angry to 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.910
 take and of course I think the little dot 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.310
 say of both teams because they move away 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.619
 even a little bit of the Atlantic tomorrow 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.570
 receives tigers in Cancun and is 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.960
 a match very fought but at half 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.990
 court 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.970
 clear goal arrivals an option is 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.129
 new one the pretty one 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.989
 it would justify what attitude 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.999
 people that are going to defend themselves to take out 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.010
 puntito by the question of the descent by 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:41.659
 Of course I think that in these 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.609
 championship heights and given the 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.079
 circumstances of people to you to tender 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.420
 find points when there is a point 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.979
 in someone else's yard is very valid that has 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.469
 two home games still the 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.909
 team from the fringe and a visit and they are 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.909
 nine points takes you 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.220
 6 to the plant team that tomorrow 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.020
 play and then it's the town like that 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.220
 he arranged his non-defensive encounter me 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.840
 I think that he lacked ideas 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.299
 offensive clarity 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.799
 arrival went to the organic team that did not 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.840
 he had depth he had not had 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.539
 creativity did not have variants he did not 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.759
 middle distance shots a box of 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.789
 francisco crouched back as we see that 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.109
 here the wake maicon was injured by 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.869
 there I mentioned in the prevention that 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.340
 was well bandaged maybe there he lost great 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.200
 part of its offensive power the team 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.479
 black and red and this ended but for being 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.850
 then that puts the tip of the shoe in 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.759
 the grass and it is bent no further than 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.679
 that yes it was well bandaged not so 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.929
 would have happened in allows was a 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.000
 accident of the game and so he did 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.520
 changes he tried taken he went to the front 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.920
 but I repeat when a team does not have 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.899
 offensive ideas and has no spaces is 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.849
 very difficult to generate and today people are leaving 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.310
 angry with the atlas because I wanted to win 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:55.079
 that match because of having won 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.060
 they would be very close to salvation 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.429
 logic, I'll get you to flavio saints 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.200
 then he takes it out he does not let him play a 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.299
 full time then goes in face to 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.709
 arch and claims him trying to blame them 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.259
 of the misfortunes of his team was 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.929
 fundamental and very clear let's go thank you 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.690
 friends of televisadeportes.com puebla 0 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.320
 to back 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.320
 we go
