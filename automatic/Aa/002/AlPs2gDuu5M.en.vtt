00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.510
 real to real 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.579

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:16.709
 earlier they will lose from this 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.079

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:37.979
 cel 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.979
 the trend is that something knows 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:54.969
 death 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.969

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.039
 the moment when for the sake of cleanliness spent 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.529
 the first is the opposite 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:13.879
 this 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.609

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:27.680
 teaspoons 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.680
 probably this particular project 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.680
 all finds repeatedly 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.840
 I called the police further 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.539
 let's you see there are no apples 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.080

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.720

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.720
 is rent

 According to Vladimir Voronin 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:00.909
 at 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.339
 so popular 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:05.179
 such virtualization projects and who 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:07.289
 it's my fault 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.089
 team support measures from 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.169
 imminent goal yet another why so 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.819
 started off 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.089
 why any amount 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:19.599

 Euro 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.360

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.370
 bronze winners of the Olympiad 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.249
 according to Medvedev speaking of 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:47.349
 in a report done but evolve if 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.400
 it will turn out the bank 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.409
 but years 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.550
 and this operation which could 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.490
 conveyed 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.490

 forced data tax authorities for 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:17.869
 the role of the media sometimes 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:22.019
 I seemed to lead you all a wonderful salvation 

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:25.969
