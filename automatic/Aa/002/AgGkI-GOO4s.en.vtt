00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

colors<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.390> got<00:00:57.800> milkshake<00:00:59.120> Pierre<00:01:00.120> Hollywood

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
colors I got milkshake Pierre Hollywood

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.640 
colors I got milkshake Pierre Hollywood
vamp<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.879> potion<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> formula<00:01:04.500> I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
vamp and potion so for the formula I

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.460 
vamp and potion so for the formula I
find<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.210> easy<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:07.049> work<00:01:07.229> with

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
find that it is really easy to work with

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.410 
find that it is really easy to work with
because<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> thicker<00:01:08.549> liquid<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.210> it's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
because it is a thicker liquid like it's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
because it is a thicker liquid like it's
almost<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.470> very<00:01:10.650> Airy<00:01:10.979> feeling<00:01:11.580> like

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
almost like it's very Airy feeling like

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760 
almost like it's very Airy feeling like
as<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.360> whipped<00:01:12.570> mousse<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.320> something

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
as if it's a whipped mousse or something

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
as if it's a whipped mousse or something
so<00:01:14.250> when<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.520> put<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:14.939> oh<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.540> know<00:01:15.840> what

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
so when you put it on oh you know what

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.600 
so when you put it on oh you know what
it's<00:01:16.049> similar<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.409> it's<00:01:16.740> similar<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.340> mat

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it's similar to it's similar to the mat

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's similar to it's similar to the mat
the<00:01:18.360> NYX<00:01:18.600> matte<00:01:18.840> lip<00:01:19.170> creams<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:20.130> that's

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the NYX matte lip creams I think that's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.550 
the NYX matte lip creams I think that's
what<00:01:20.400> they're<00:01:20.490> called<00:01:20.750> it<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:22.049> seems<00:01:22.409> very

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
what they're called it just seems very

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890 
what they're called it just seems very
Airy<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.520> since<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.119> thicker<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.600> easier

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
Airy so since it is thicker it's easier

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.370 
Airy so since it is thicker it's easier
to<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.200> spread<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> product<00:01:25.799> around<00:01:27.380> most

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
to like spread the product around most

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.780 
to like spread the product around most
liquid<00:01:28.680> lipsticks<00:01:28.979> are<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.220> soot<00:01:29.490> some<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
them are super runny which can cost

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.429 
them are super runny which can cost
streaking<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.420> one<00:01:33.600> doesn't<00:01:33.810> streak<00:01:34.170> too

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
streaking this one doesn't streak too

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:34.999 
streaking this one doesn't streak too

smearing it like this which makes it

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.350 
smearing it like this which makes it
worse<00:05:21.190> so<00:05:21.220> then<00:05:21.550> you're<00:05:21.670> just<00:05:21.760> pushing<00:05:22.030> all
