00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
ranged once I at 50 I'm going to

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.689 
ranged once I at 50 I'm going to
probably<00:00:19.260> go<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.529> Blue<00:00:20.010> Dragons<00:00:22.369> just<00:00:23.369> because

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
probably go to Blue Dragons just because

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:33.100 
probably go to Blue Dragons just because
they're<00:00:24.090> more<00:00:24.300> AF<00:00:24.480> cable<00:00:24.930> Oh<00:00:26.930> 50<00:00:27.930> range<00:00:29.029> yeah

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.049 

the<00:00:34.110> reason<00:00:34.350> I'm<00:00:34.440> going<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.710> doing<00:00:35.059> Blue

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the reason I'm going to be doing Blue

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.030 
the reason I'm going to be doing Blue
Dragons<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.649> because<00:00:37.950> they

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
Dragons is because I can is because they

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.470 
Dragons is because I can is because they
have<00:00:38.129> more<00:00:38.280> HP<00:00:38.430> than<00:00:38.640> green<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.450> just

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
have more HP than green so I can just

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.010 
have more HP than green so I can just
sit<00:00:39.780> there<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.700> attack<00:00:41.700> away<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.660> also

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
sit there and attack away and also

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.299 
sit there and attack away and also
because<00:00:43.260> they're<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.530> moldy<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> don't

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
because they're not moldy so I don't

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.080 
because they're not moldy so I don't
have<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.460> worry<00:00:44.640> about<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:46.219> um<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.730> will

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
have to worry about that um I will

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.400 
have to worry about that um I will
obviously<00:00:48.329> do<00:00:48.600> green<00:00:48.809> jegs<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.260> money

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
obviously do green jegs for money

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.830 
obviously do green jegs for money
because<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.489> faster<00:00:50.640> money<00:00:51.030> than<00:00:51.239> blues<00:00:51.739> but

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
because it's faster money than blues but

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.069 
because it's faster money than blues but
these<00:00:54.840> lots<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.410> blues<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.399> yeah<00:00:56.960> it's<00:00:57.960> my

these lots of blues so yeah it's my
plants<00:00:58.440> for<00:00:58.649> range<00:00:59.039> training<00:00:59.370> I'm<00:01:00.270> poor<00:01:00.600> I

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
plants for range training I'm poor I

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.859 
plants for range training I'm poor I
need<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.440> make<00:01:01.559> money<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:03.650> yeah<00:01:05.570> i'm<00:01:06.570> using

best stats either obviously i'm going to
be<00:01:16.530> i'm<00:01:17.280> probably<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.119> 42

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
be i'm probably going to go for 42

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.080 
be i'm probably going to go for 42
defense<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.200> avoid<00:01:19.470> pure<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.939> won't

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
defense and be avoid pure so this won't

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.840 
defense and be avoid pure so this won't
affect<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.890> i'm<00:01:22.890> going<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> quest<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.700> this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
affect my i'm going to quest it so this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.690 
affect my i'm going to quest it so this
won't<00:01:23.970> affected<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.600> only<00:01:24.810> 1.9<00:01:25.380> k<00:01:25.619> xb<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.670> i

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
won't affected it's only 1.9 k xb so i

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.310 
won't affected it's only 1.9 k xb so i
will<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.119> able<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.479> make<00:01:27.600> my<00:01:27.780> defense<00:01:28.080> base

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
will be able to make my defense base

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.120 
will be able to make my defense base
basically<00:01:29.040> fully<00:01:29.280> quested<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:30.060> 42<00:01:30.890> if<00:01:31.890> that's

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
basically fully quested at 42 if that's

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.310 
basically fully quested at 42 if that's
what<00:01:32.250> i<00:01:32.280> end<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.700> doing

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.149 

but<00:01:38.100> yeah<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.390> I'll<00:01:39.810> probably<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.470> getting<00:01:40.560> 42

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
but yeah so I'll probably be getting 42

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.990 
but yeah so I'll probably be getting 42
defense<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.890> hopefully<00:01:43.890> 60<00:01:44.340> range<00:01:44.550> I

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
defense and hopefully 60 range I

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.750 
defense and hopefully 60 range I
probably<00:01:45.330> will<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.570> able<00:01:45.660> to<00:01:45.780> find<00:01:46.020> any<00:01:46.760> good

both the void mage and rage on so I can
go<00:02:24.600> void<00:02:24.780> hybriding<00:02:26.030> i'll<00:02:27.030> probably<00:02:27.270> get<00:02:27.450> like

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
go void hybriding i'll probably get like

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.920 
go void hybriding i'll probably get like
82<00:02:27.959> mage<00:02:28.350> or<00:02:28.590> 85<00:02:29.040> mage<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.090> i<00:02:30.150> can<00:02:30.300> t<00:02:30.450> be<00:02:30.630> with

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
82 mage or 85 mage so i can t be with

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.960 
82 mage or 85 mage so i can t be with
like<00:02:31.110> 80<00:02:31.410> plus<00:02:31.709> range<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.400> then<00:02:32.640> do<00:02:32.940> some

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
like 80 plus range and then do some

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.650 
like 80 plus range and then do some
hybriding<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.780> void<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.470> stuff<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.280> yeah

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
hybriding and void and stuff so yeah

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.350 
hybriding and void and stuff so yeah
that<00:02:36.660> should<00:02:36.840> be<00:02:36.930> good<00:02:37.970> will<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.090> eventually

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
that should be good will be eventually

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.170 
that should be good will be eventually
max<00:02:39.870> out<00:02:40.110> but<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.830> don't<00:02:41.580> know<00:02:41.700> if<00:02:41.820> that'll<00:02:42.000> be

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
max out but I don't know if that'll be

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.280 
max out but I don't know if that'll be
like<00:02:42.330> 70<00:02:42.720> def<00:02:42.930> 75<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.570> don't<00:02:45.570> know<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.959> I'll<00:02:46.049> i

like 70 def 75 I don't know that I'll i
don't<00:02:46.530> know<00:02:46.620> if<00:02:46.769> i'll<00:02:46.890> go<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.190> 99<00:02:47.580> just

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
don't know if i'll go for 99 just

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.170 
don't know if i'll go for 99 just
because<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.410> way<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.709> game<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:49.950> like<00:02:50.910> i'd

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
because of the way the game is like i'd

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.850 
because of the way the game is like i'd
rather<00:02:51.450> have<00:02:51.570> more<00:02:51.930> accurate<00:02:52.440> hits<00:02:52.650> with

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
rather have more accurate hits with

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.880 
rather have more accurate hits with
lower<00:02:53.040> defense<00:02:53.430> i<00:02:53.700> think<00:02:54.380> but<00:02:55.380> we'll<00:02:55.590> see<00:02:55.769> how

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
lower defense i think but we'll see how

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.410 
lower defense i think but we'll see how
that<00:02:55.950> turns<00:02:56.070> out<00:02:56.489> a<00:02:56.790> few<00:02:57.000> months<00:02:57.090> down<00:02:57.360> the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
that turns out a few months down the

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.020 
that turns out a few months down the
road<00:02:57.540> once<00:02:57.840> more<00:02:58.440> people<00:02:58.799> are<00:02:58.920> higher<00:02:59.670> level

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
road once more people are higher level

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.250 
road once more people are higher level
or<00:03:00.150> whatever<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:00.660> i<00:03:00.720> think<00:03:00.930> i'll<00:03:01.019> probably

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
or whatever but i think i'll probably

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.890 
or whatever but i think i'll probably
end<00:03:01.380> up<00:03:01.530> staying<00:03:01.769> like<00:03:02.010> 75<00:03:02.549> at<00:03:02.760> most<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.329> i'll

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
end up staying like 75 at most and i'll

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.449 
end up staying like 75 at most and i'll
probably<00:03:04.140> be<00:03:04.350> 40<00:03:04.650> for<00:03:04.829> a<00:03:04.860> bit<00:03:05.070> but<00:03:05.160> i<00:03:05.220> do<00:03:05.340> plan

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
probably be 40 for a bit but i do plan

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.340 
probably be 40 for a bit but i do plan
on<00:03:05.670> getting<00:03:05.970> 70<00:03:06.329> eventually<00:03:06.840> because<00:03:07.079> i<00:03:07.170> want

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
on getting 70 eventually because i want

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
on getting 70 eventually because i want
to<00:03:07.380> hybrid<00:03:07.739> in<00:03:08.390> arabs<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.570> such<00:03:09.920> voids<00:03:10.920> nice

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
to hybrid in arabs and such voids nice

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.420 
to hybrid in arabs and such voids nice
but<00:03:11.700> yeah<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:11.910> want<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.239> defense<00:03:12.540> too<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:14.280> yeah

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
but yeah I want the defense too so yeah

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.970 
but yeah I want the defense too so yeah
I'm<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.760> killing<00:03:15.090> some<00:03:15.269> blue<00:03:16.170> dragons<00:03:16.650> in

hard leather body because I'm ten

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.280 
hard leather body because I'm ten
defense<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.890> little<00:03:28.849> more<00:03:29.060> accurate<00:03:29.480> not<00:03:30.140> by

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
defense a little more accurate not by

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.849 
defense a little more accurate not by
much<00:03:30.469> but<00:03:30.530> whatever<00:03:31.269> probably<00:03:32.269> going<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.480> get

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
much but whatever probably going to get

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:38.170 
much but whatever probably going to get
70<00:03:33.859> range<00:03:34.099> dear<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.859> what<00:03:37.250> well<00:03:37.819> I'll

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
70 range dear and that what well I'll

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.059 
70 range dear and that what well I'll
get<00:03:38.540> void<00:03:38.780> at<00:03:38.959> some<00:03:39.170> point<00:03:39.409> I'm<00:03:39.560> not<00:03:39.590> sure<00:03:39.769> one

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
get void at some point I'm not sure one

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.089 
get void at some point I'm not sure one
exactly<00:03:40.579> but<00:03:40.790> right<00:03:41.000> now<00:03:41.180> my<00:03:41.450> main<00:03:42.170> goal<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.769> 70

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
exactly but right now my main goal is 70

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.890 
exactly but right now my main goal is 70
range<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.640> i'll<00:03:43.700> get<00:03:43.819> void<00:03:44.060> at<00:03:44.209> some<00:03:44.420> point<00:03:44.689> or

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
range and i'll get void at some point or

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.099 
range and i'll get void at some point or
at<00:03:45.049> Stephanie<00:03:45.560> range<00:03:46.359> obviously<00:03:47.359> i<00:03:47.750> often<00:03:48.019> get

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
at Stephanie range obviously i often get

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.380 
at Stephanie range obviously i often get
my<00:03:48.260> defense<00:03:48.590> up<00:03:48.799> so<00:03:49.129> i'll<00:03:49.220> do<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:49.430> questing

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
my defense up so i'll do I questing

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.819 
my defense up so i'll do I questing
maybe<00:03:50.629> some<00:03:50.900> training<00:03:51.230> I<00:03:51.319> don't<00:03:51.500> know<00:03:51.560> because

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
maybe some training I don't know because

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.379 
maybe some training I don't know because
I'm<00:03:51.950> obviously<00:03:52.099> going<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:52.489> get<00:03:52.639> over<00:03:53.000> 42

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
I'm obviously going to get over 42

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.160 
I'm obviously going to get over 42
defense<00:03:53.829> but<00:03:54.829> yeah<00:03:55.689> i'll<00:03:56.689> have<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.930> get<00:03:56.989> these

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
defense but yeah i'll have to get these

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.929 
defense but yeah i'll have to get these
ones<00:03:57.379> up<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.680> I'll<00:03:58.010> get<00:03:58.250> those<00:03:58.430> up<00:03:58.609> before<00:03:58.909> I

00:03:58.929 --> 00:03:58.939 
ones up to I'll get those up before I

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.309 
ones up to I'll get those up before I
train<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.269> defense<00:03:59.599> just<00:03:59.870> because<00:04:00.049> it'll

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
train the defense just because it'll

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.819 
train the defense just because it'll
help<00:04:00.349> with<00:04:00.500> their<00:04:00.769> training<00:04:02.230> after<00:04:03.230> did<00:04:03.439> do

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
help with their training after did do

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.339 
help with their training after did do
this<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.220> obviously<00:04:04.669> but<00:04:05.090> there's<00:04:05.900> really<00:04:06.109> not

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
this to obviously but there's really not

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.140 
this to obviously but there's really not
much<00:04:06.500> use<00:04:06.709> for<00:04:06.829> it<00:04:06.980> until<00:04:07.310> um<00:04:07.489> 94<00:04:07.970> mage<00:04:10.150> aside

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
much use for it until um 94 mage aside

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.990 
much use for it until um 94 mage aside
from<00:04:11.299> 82<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:11.959> 85<00:04:12.409> for<00:04:12.769> Blitzen<00:04:13.250> TB<00:04:13.609> once<00:04:13.849> I

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
from 82 and 85 for Blitzen TB once I

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.659 
from 82 and 85 for Blitzen TB once I
want<00:04:14.180> to<00:04:14.239> hybrid<00:04:14.569> but<00:04:14.810> for<00:04:14.989> like<00:04:15.139> edge<00:04:15.799> PK<00:04:16.400> and

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
want to hybrid but for like edge PK and

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:17.830 
want to hybrid but for like edge PK and
void<00:04:16.849> which<00:04:17.090> is<00:04:17.239> what<00:04:17.389> I'm<00:04:17.479> going<00:04:17.599> to<00:04:17.660> be<00:04:17.720> doing

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
void which is what I'm going to be doing

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.810 
void which is what I'm going to be doing
first<00:04:18.229> there's<00:04:18.979> not<00:04:19.070> really<00:04:19.130> really<00:04:19.669> much

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820
