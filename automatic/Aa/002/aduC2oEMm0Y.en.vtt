00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.270
 the little ones already cut in half we're going 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.260

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.159
 this already we cut them in small pieces 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.960
 and now let's prepare the oil and 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.830
 the other ingredients to be able to 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.400
 mix and here we have in a bowl let's 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.680
 to put 3 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:33.890
 extra virgin if yes it is possible 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.890
 two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.430
 we have half a teaspoon of salt after 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.350
 you can adjust the salt of course and 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.600
 the pepper that we are putting 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.780
 also pepper only a quarter of 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.780
 teaspoonful 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.409
 and a teaspoon of dried parsley 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.420
 I was missing the garlic 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.820
 here we have 3 garlic cloves equal 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.980
 only minced can put them well 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.440
 chopped or squeezed with a juicer 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:11.820
 like these here are the 3 teeth 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.820
 garlic this is fabulous terrific 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.260
 because it is much faster 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.250
 and ready 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.940
 this we are going to mix it well first 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:29.260
 to put it on 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.980
 and ready we mix it well 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.230
 in the oven you have to heat it when 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.470
 we started to prepare our 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.470
 ingredients at 400 degrees fahrenheit 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.549
 and we're going it to month since we mix well 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.610
 that everything has been distributed in our 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.980
 cauliflower we also now have a 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.040
 tray with aluminum and already greased with 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:05.280
 spray or how you want to oil and go 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.269
 to empty the distribute them well 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.370
 accommodate them so they do not remain 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.370
 how is he standing here 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:19.350
 but they may not be up just 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:24.330
 and they are lying and we 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:29.130
 to bake for approximately 25 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:33.930
 30 minutes or until they are 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.580
 color so golden brown or the taste but as 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.510
 let's say at 10 minutes we can 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.280
 move a little bit moving them so that 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.560
 they leave 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.010
 baking even good we put it to the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.010
 oven 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:55.330
 and now if I repeat we are going to leave for 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.270
 25 minutes to 30 you have to be 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:02.120
 moving also to be paid for 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.350
 here is 15 minutes and then we 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.880
 we flipped 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:13.230
 to continue the cooking equal to 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:18.050
 tourists were 25 minutes and you can see 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:22.710
 who are more than ready to 

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:25.770
 enjoy them we will take them out and 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.470
 we are going to present in my villa and nothing else 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:31.170
 what a delight here we already serve ourselves in a 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.060
 family-style dish so that we 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.320
 can only be eating like this with a 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.680
 little melted butter like this is your 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.970
 I like to do it like that, not only like that they are 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.950
 delicious you can adjust salt but 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.730
 Here we already tried it and it's perfect 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.810
 these can also be used as 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:54.300
 garnish for any dish 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.849
