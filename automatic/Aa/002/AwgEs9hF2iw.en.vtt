00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:12.769
 she is always welcome on the trades of each model then 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.050
 today I present you a plan with carrots ground parmesan cheese with 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.699
 who she has a little bit of to drink pink you'll see a preparation 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.739
 was it delicious 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.639
 so to start this little velvety carrot you first have to 

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:33.829
 peel% and so all your carrots you remove both ends 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.370
 and then you want to listen by rating her so here's a program 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.810
 of average help not too worried because it's so long to cook 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.399
 for its part active in the sale of equipment is 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.550
 you're touching the potatoes so the same huh and for you do some 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.590
 linden trees the titles in his name like that 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.460
 and a year if you want to spend a little bit under the clear you can book 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.560
 1 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.800
 so if you go take a big pot put about two 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.730
 lines of hot water and you bring to a boil and you put yourself the 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.740
 chicken broth to be degreased 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.380
 and you too dive all the vegetables so there I wanted to film% 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.380
 just the party here you peel anonymous you cut it years in small 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.170
 fine slices like that 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.250
 and wanted to add to the preparation - with carrots and potatoes and 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.810
 the tsunami 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.880
 the chicken broth of the locker rooms we do not turn you a little bit and has 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.700
 started for the ammo you lower the fire so that it does not overflow 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.280
 long term 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.850
 little by little 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.939
 and you're going to cook like that for a good half hour it's necessary that m that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.920
 all the vegetables are as tender as it will be easier to 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.690
 mixer 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.520
 so you plant yourself the tip of a knife that checked once in a while 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.520
 these thirty minutes is not enough even prolong cooking 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.640
 then after 30 minutes you mix turn your vegetables and book well 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.020
 cooking water what you need it 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.700
 to get this set he noted so the more you add so more with 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.230
 the team so if you want a soup of a point to be added of course 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.180
 even earlier so you put everything in a salad bowl and you add salt 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.770
 and pepper have roses 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.759
 e a pinch of nutmeg of fresh cream 1 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.159
 and percent and the famous parmesan so about a tablespoon 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.829
 and if he wanted it to be even more fragrant of life in the game the 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.349
 eventually a third so percent then you mix up a lot more 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.839
 vast everything is well homogeneous 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.839
 so here is in any case there is a mix anything you can address 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:36.009
 in small malignant alas if you wish you can buy a 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.850
 decoration 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.120
 so I took some time before imposing a new respite a little bit 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.389
 of internal parmesan 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.059
 spied you can add of course a little bit of parsley or korian 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.259
 ahoussou what you like at a small point of the euro stables who have even 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:52.669
 cumin seeds 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:57.059
 so here and well I wish you intrepid a recipe and you can 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.999
 find all the proportions on the block 3 w escapes but the com point
