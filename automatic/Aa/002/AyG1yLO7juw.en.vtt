00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello and good day here is mega 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.990
 valencia 10 and i want to go to the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.460
 text chopin creator imagine or wants 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.620
 I say that now to download 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.210
 but still wants to be ready 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.260
 very briefly show its functionality 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.810
 I 've been thinking about it for a while 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.130
 made as I do it at all 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.300
 does not mean like me now 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.310
 but I like that 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.949
 I am finally publishing now 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.170
 come to the conclusion that I have a free 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.449
 version and a premium version so 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.430
 version now also english so all 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.820
 make a version will publish 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.309
 will 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.530
 The premium currently only has one 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.600
 single advantage and that one the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.629
 can change resolution that means if 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.809
 I could start the whole thing now 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.590
 I for example between 16 times 16 or 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:53.870
 256x256 is even bigger than 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.250
 hd textures pack to make 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.289
 the default setting for this 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.190
 free is 16 times 16 will be so too 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.899
 can not change 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.969
 why I did that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.570
 I do not quite know myself 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.909
 but I'll be fine if I can 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.900
 a little bit 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:16.140
 So I just need two somehow 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.880
 different parts just better 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.920
 I know I just see myself myself 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.299
 Just start the whole thing one way 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.920
 must click the icon you have to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.240
 just install and this looks 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.950
 just like that, that means I have that 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.970
 design looks a bit different 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.150
 maybe you might also see 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.340
 it does not really matter 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.750
 and yes , there is everything here now 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.299
 new so there is this once 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 open and once the create that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.100
 means that creates the textures 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.899
 pack and yes down here right that is 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.530
 is that is the blog someone has mine 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.210
 every tip is one for the state 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.229
 create new folder and textures 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.240
 to call and then yes if you could 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.329
 going to the internet is going on pictures 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.299
 just for example grass gives to 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.409
 For example, take another grass and take 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.689
 Just give us that here 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.429
 since it is 16 16 you can say 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.950
 that you already save is wrong 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.959
 on the save 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.730
 and then goes to textures and saves 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.690
 the next one you can even chip now 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.569
 saves that I have now 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.920
 added so as jpg files can 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.060
 Now just call that grass 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.930
 You can do the same for example too 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.550
 to do a mess 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.470
 Do you also know this whole round? 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.819
 I actually play where is okay 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.470
 I do not care what you are next to 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.610
 you can, for example, just know 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.050
 I do not take that what here 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.390
 maybe looks ugly or too 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.250
 not then it could be dirt then 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.519
 save and then we can 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.540
 for example, one last example of wood 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:47.360
 make and then we take to 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.579
 Just try that and you 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.040
 Write your wood out like that and then have it 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.950
 Well, this is so good here 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.959
 and moment I go back to 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.230
 desktop so and it goes on easily here 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.579
 open and then you can you here 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.130
 choose what you want to do there 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.170
 simply give up textures and times 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.940
 Get in here now and you can 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.370
 this is how the grass block looks so much 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.400
 and here is also the grass next to it 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.109
 but you want to insert, for example 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.940
 the grass again to edit 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.100
 For example, a new grass or you 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.569
 so then you have to do then you can 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.000
 you can use the arrow keys here 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.650
 steer at which point so 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.299
 which position should be edited 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.720
 and then you just go for example 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.040
 easy here and then go here 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.319
 open again and take for example 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.730
 the wood that means in this case 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.709
 the wood had been taken over here 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.079
 I hope it does not arise too much 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.600
 confusion by being here below 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.220
 this dice 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.049
 that's just what it is right now 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.180
 was created and not the above 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.489
 this symbol is here i hope that 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.530
 donor not too much confusion because 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.269
 who stupid if it causes confusion 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.970
 but then I can not do anything 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.900
 I have to change that honestly 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.549
 maybe someday will come 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.940
 second block in or so I will 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.290
 Let's see how it fits and so goes 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.209
 you can also do the whole thing from then on 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.829
 at the beginning, for example, just that down here 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.790
 for example, edit this part of 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.769
 open bed and do dirt 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.169
 So you put the thing in and then it is 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.209
 just here so great then what next 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.639
 you have to go create this is 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.710
 that here and then no idea it comes 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.270
 right now no message 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.740
 but as long as no message states 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.720
 basically that it did it 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.759
 but where is he? 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.560
 done that very easily and indeed 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.180
 always where you last got the texture 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.009
 has taken out that is in this 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.560
 in our case these are 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.669
 you can already see texture pack here 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.949
 you can now take a look here 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.419
 and yes as I said when the rooms 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.039
 you can zoom run here just now 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.630
 see that is what we inserted here 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.550
 to have 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:53.560
 we have a part here made out 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.889
 and so and so you can just that 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.479
 Everything looks great as what 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.410
 Next we want the whole thing 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.280
 integrate 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.460
 then we do not have to do anything other than 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.229
 either a zip file that we call 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.340
 now we make it the new folder 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:15.759
 Let's just call that sex too 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:23.289
 do they do that this is a race 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:26.139
 the order in add that now to the archive 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.389
 so add that as a zip to have that 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.639
 Here is this text 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:34.900
 so , for example, he is about to move 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:37.449
 three percent minecraft texture pack that 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.840
 i just got old inka real doing her 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:42.010
 simply there new text club and then 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.210
 Do you have to do it that way? 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.789
 but I do not have any right now 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.500
 guarantee that it works 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.789
 otherwise it is also different so that 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.470
 But you know yourself as with textures 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.389
 packs to the making I wanted 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.620
 actually an editor imagine yes that 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:54.699
 It was as far as I hope 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.169
 you can help yourself download link is 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.599
 in the description of the premium would like 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:59.470
 can write me and I'm going to 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:01.510
 let me think 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.220
 I'm not big before me 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.570
 somehow or so it was 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.949
 but I am always feeble-minded 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.720
 a little hard because that's how it works for you 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.370
 from as if I was the big asshole what 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.020
 do not want to give out his stuff here 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.880
 But the other way round it would have to be like that 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.320
 see that for example while is 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.300
 now stupid example but when we go to 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.389
 example newspaper publisher since and me 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.849
 the newspaper and then the door sets 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.990
 then 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:28.399
 I do not have to do it anyway 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.369
 gets her money to make her 

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:32.869
 before the door I put my newspaper is 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:33.409
 but of course it does 

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:35.949
 easy 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:38.779
 why do you get money from the publisher? 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:40.879
 is almost the same as if you are now 

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:42.409
 why do you complain ? 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:44.629
 all your programs that you have there 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:48.289
 free time I write for free 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:50.059
 But that's easy and me 

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.039
 give me all this trouble possible 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:53.149
 is really free but in some 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.179
 Then I have to do a certain thing 

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:57.139
 drag restriction 

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:58.999
 I hope that goes without saying 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.439
 somehow it can not be that way 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:03.949
 I also understand, for example 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:04.419
 not why, for example, I know too 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.860
 Not 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:08.059
 various programs cost money to 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.610
 for example, no idea 

00:07:08.059 --> 00:07:12.429
 I find that somehow stupid but leaves 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:16.309
 not change 

00:07:12.429 --> 00:07:19.099
 yes that was it at the moment how 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:20.479
 So said the premium is necessarily 

00:07:19.099 --> 00:07:23.839
 i want to write to me i think 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:25.159
 it gets then otherwise enough 

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:26.959
 I think so, too, the other one 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:28.339
 I'll work on it in the future 

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:30.079
 which might be new features 

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:32.119
 let it be done and that was mine 

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:33.229
 little video until then and looks 

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:36.099
 times the description is the link 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:36.099
 kiss
