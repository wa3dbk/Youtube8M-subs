00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.060
 Hi guys 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.870
 Let's talk a little bit today about the 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.240
 role of parents in feeding during the 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.560
 feeding your children how 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:36.039
 they can intervene in a way 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:38.829
 positive effect on the child's 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.019
 different from that of an adult to 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.730
 child is growing 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.460
 she needs to receive a diet 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.640
 balanced and carbohydrate terms 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.609
 proteins and fats vitamins salts 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.579
 minerals exactly to that of your 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:56.199
 growth is balanced 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.219
 it is important that this be accompanied 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.219
 by your doctor 

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:08.950
 the pediatrician to a fundamental role for 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.159
 explain to the family because in their 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.649
 son does not want to eat because his son 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.460
 that is celebrated generated because your 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.619
 son just wants to eat junk food 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.930
 it is fundamental to understand that in the first 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.299
 year of life the great weight gain of 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.610
 child and the big gain of stature 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.130
 confuses parents a little 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.539
 they believe that the son will continue 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.600
 in this cagno huge progress of life 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.119
 only that great gain of the first year 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.430
 not repeated in the second year as if 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.850
 you needed a lot of fuel in the 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.579
 first year and from then on there is 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.920
 need fuels and physiological 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:54.159
 child needing less fuel 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.119
 it is natural for it to decrease the intake of 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.030
 foods 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.999
 if this is well understood by parents if 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.650
 the pediatrician can pass this type of 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:05.220
 information 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:14.010
 parents certainly have difficulties with 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:17.370
 power will decrease or jump 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.650
 important because the salt is certainly of 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.400
 a cumulative effect on the body of the being 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.540
 human then little salt but beautiful food 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.450
 It is delicious and as it grows 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.990
 learning to chew on the gums yet 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.959
 he will certainly be able to increase 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.300
 the consistency of the food 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.580
 making it he is antone of 1 year 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.370
 old is eating his plate 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.230
 Just like Mom and Dad's practice. 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.400
 remember Dad Mom they need 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.790
 give example 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.910
 this is like salad as the vegetables 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.390
 varied as meat like vegetables 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.240
 this is all possible and the parents 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.400
 certainly plays a key role in 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.500
 that your children can receive a 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:12.209
 adequate food is adequate and 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:14.970
 variable as they need less 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.019
 Fuel for example the 11 hours 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.390
 a cookie will surely kill the 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.450
 this child's lunch and the mother 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.570
 desperate and tomorrow ends up desperate to 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.850
 point of many times in those who 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.310
 impulses of his son 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.530
 he keeps shouting that he wants to be here 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.150
 a little potato potato and she did not 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.820
 What did she do? 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.370
 she relaxes with meal that should be 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.200
 the most complete and appropriate 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.269
 make a potato prof 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.519
 so it does not rarely get here in the 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.580
 My mother's mother's office only eats 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.220
 potato time hernanes or potatoes and 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.209
 popcorn 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.549
 consequently I tell her more 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.980
 who sent to potato popcorn was 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.080
 I'm going to rethink this and let's go 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.320
 start rethinking reasoning 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.830
 of what is the ideal of your child 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.840
 folks 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.670
 This was another class from 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.670
 nutrition see you
