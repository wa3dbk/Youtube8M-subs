bags or separate the front from the back
there's<00:02:10.929> also<00:02:11.050> a<00:02:11.200> privacy<00:02:11.830> screen<00:02:12.180> which<00:02:13.180> is

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
there's also a privacy screen which is

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.500 
there's also a privacy screen which is
very<00:02:13.750> thoughtful<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.440> something<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.610> most

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
very thoughtful and something that most

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.930 
very thoughtful and something that most
wagons<00:02:16.989> now<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.290> course<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.769> but<00:02:18.400> there<00:02:18.760> is

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
wagons now of course have but there is

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.490 
wagons now of course have but there is
not<00:02:19.209> a<00:02:19.239> lot<00:02:19.599> of<00:02:19.720> room<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:19.930> that's<00:02:20.140> kind<00:02:20.409> of<00:02:20.440> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
not a lot of room and that's kind of the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.710 
not a lot of room and that's kind of the
Achilles<00:02:20.830> heel<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.069> this<00:02:21.310> wagon<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.599> let's

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
Achilles heel of this wagon and let's

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.050 
Achilles heel of this wagon and let's
try<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.080> new<00:02:23.379> TfL<00:02:23.920> tripod<00:02:24.400> scale<00:02:24.700> because

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
try the new TfL tripod scale because

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.759 
try the new TfL tripod scale because
this<00:02:25.269> is<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.480> pretty<00:02:25.780> good<00:02:25.930> sized<00:02:26.140> tripod<00:02:26.560> let's

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
this is a pretty good sized tripod let's

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.470 
this is a pretty good sized tripod let's
see<00:02:26.860> if<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.010> fits<00:02:27.040> in<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.400> back<00:02:27.550> this<00:02:28.330> is

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
see if this fits in the back this is

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.460 
see if this fits in the back this is
about<00:02:28.629> the<00:02:28.780> size<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.700> your<00:02:30.700> bike<00:02:30.879> no<00:02:31.510> way<00:02:31.659> no

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
about the size of your bike no way no

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.030 
about the size of your bike no way no
way<00:02:32.590> Jose

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
way Jose

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.470 
way Jose
will<00:02:33.159> not<00:02:33.370> fit<00:02:33.610> back<00:02:33.790> here<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.150> that's<00:02:34.209> kind

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
will not fit back here and that's kind

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.580 
will not fit back here and that's kind
of<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.599> Achilles<00:02:34.870> heel<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.200> does<00:02:35.379> however

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
of the Achilles heel it does however

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.050 
of the Achilles heel it does however
yeah<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.670> pass<00:02:36.940> through<00:02:37.269> so<00:02:38.430> if<00:02:39.430> this<00:02:39.610> were<00:02:39.760> skis

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
yeah a pass through so if this were skis

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.350 
yeah a pass through so if this were skis
you<00:02:40.620> could<00:02:41.620> fit<00:02:41.799> them<00:02:41.890> like<00:02:42.040> that<00:02:42.239> now<00:02:43.239> you

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
you could fit them like that now you

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.250 
you could fit them like that now you
would<00:02:43.450> think<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.750> would<00:02:43.870> be<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.080> perfect

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
would think this would be the perfect

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.010 
would think this would be the perfect
car<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.740> take<00:02:45.220> to<00:02:45.370> Ikea<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:46.480> might<00:02:46.690> be<00:02:46.840> wrong

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
car to take to Ikea you might be wrong

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.990 
car to take to Ikea you might be wrong
the<00:02:47.680> other<00:02:47.830> problem<00:02:48.190> with<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:48.490> vehicle<00:02:48.700> is

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
the other problem with this vehicle is

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.550 
the other problem with this vehicle is
it's<00:02:49.150> a<00:02:49.270> little<00:02:49.690> tight<00:02:49.930> especially<00:02:50.440> for

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
it's a little tight especially for

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.350 
it's a little tight especially for
somebody<00:02:50.770> my<00:02:51.069> size<00:02:51.100> actually<00:02:51.790> for<00:02:52.000> anybody

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
somebody my size actually for anybody

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.850 
somebody my size actually for anybody
and<00:02:52.690> you<00:02:52.840> look<00:02:52.959> at<00:02:53.050> this<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.319> no<00:02:53.620> Headroom

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
and you look at this I have no Headroom

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.990 
and you look at this I have no Headroom
I<00:02:54.220> have<00:02:54.550> very<00:02:55.180> little<00:02:55.590> legroom<00:02:56.590> yes<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.670> can't

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
I have very little legroom yes I can't

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.870 
I have very little legroom yes I can't
put<00:02:58.180> this<00:02:58.300> up<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:59.250> potentially<00:03:00.250> put<00:03:00.459> a<00:03:00.490> very

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
put this up and potentially put a very

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.150 
put this up and potentially put a very
tiny<00:03:01.360> none<00:03:01.990> Swedish<00:03:02.350> purse<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.890> middle

I'm<00:03:24.640> excited<00:03:25.090> by<00:03:25.240> the<00:03:25.300> Volvo<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.930> because<00:03:26.349> I

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
I'm excited by the Volvo is because I

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.790 
I'm excited by the Volvo is because I
help<00:03:27.130> wagons<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:28.450> perhaps<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:29.230> marks<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
help wagons and perhaps that marks the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.170 
help wagons and perhaps that marks the
return<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.459> wagon<00:03:30.819> let's<00:03:30.970> face<00:03:31.150> it

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
return of the wagon let's face it

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.479 
return of the wagon let's face it
they're<00:03:31.810> smaller<00:03:32.140> or<00:03:32.560> more<00:03:32.709> fuel-efficient

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
they're smaller or more fuel-efficient

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.000 
they're smaller or more fuel-efficient
and<00:03:33.670> they're<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.030> lot<00:03:34.239> more<00:03:34.300> fun<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.840> drive<00:03:35.200> than

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
and they're a lot more fun to drive than

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.520 
and they're a lot more fun to drive than
the<00:03:36.060> massive<00:03:37.060> SUVs<00:03:37.599> and<00:03:37.750> crossovers<00:03:37.900> that<00:03:38.440> are

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
the massive SUVs and crossovers that are

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.229 
the massive SUVs and crossovers that are
now<00:03:38.680> roaming<00:03:39.130> our<00:03:39.250> streets<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.790> hopefully

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
now roaming our streets so hopefully

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.900 
now roaming our streets so hopefully
that<00:03:40.900> is<00:03:41.140> a<00:03:41.170> sign<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.709> things<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:42.069> come<00:03:42.190> and<00:03:42.610> for

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
that is a sign of things to come and for

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.850 
that is a sign of things to come and for
that<00:03:43.030> reason<00:03:43.090> on<00:03:43.569> the<00:03:43.630> TfL<00:03:43.870> scale<00:03:44.290> of<00:03:44.500> buy<00:03:44.680> at

that reason on the TfL scale of buy at
