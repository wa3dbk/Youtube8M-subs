00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
so uh I built the backpressure in the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.790 
so uh I built the backpressure in the
hooter<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.840> you<00:00:30.840> don't<00:00:31.019> have<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.260> squeeze<00:00:31.500> it

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
hooter and you don't have to squeeze it

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.440 
hooter and you don't have to squeeze it
as<00:00:31.949> hard<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:32.910> blow<00:00:33.239> as<00:00:33.420> hard

do that you can roll with your tongue or
your<00:01:35.880> throat<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.290> throat<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:38.009> I

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
your throat I like to throat because I

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.679 
your throat I like to throat because I
can<00:01:38.280> slow<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.119> bit<00:01:39.270> more<00:01:39.540> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
can slow it down a little bit more and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.450 
can slow it down a little bit more and
get<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> more<00:01:40.110> realistic<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.640> you

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
get it more realistic so I like you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.859 
get it more realistic so I like you
almost<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.790> you're<00:01:45.000> one<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> gargle<00:01:45.720> but

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
almost like you're one to gargle but

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.600 
almost like you're one to gargle but
you're<00:01:46.070> fluctuating<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.159> air<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.520> they're

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
you're fluctuating that air and they're

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.429 
you're fluctuating that air and they're
getting<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.210> vibrate<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> reeds<00:01:49.320> are

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
getting it to vibrate so the reeds are

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.300 
getting it to vibrate so the reeds are
gonna<00:01:49.590> vibrate

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.610 

like<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.550> now<00:01:55.330> when<00:01:55.510> I<00:01:55.540> laugh<00:01:55.870> I'm<00:01:56.230> basically

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
like that now when I laugh I'm basically

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.260 
like that now when I laugh I'm basically
pushing<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.100> little<00:01:57.250> harder<00:01:57.610> air<00:01:57.760> pressure<00:01:58.060> and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
pushing a little harder air pressure and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:08.609 
pushing a little harder air pressure and
saying<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.540> word<00:01:58.720> wah<00:02:07.050> now<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:08.110> can<00:02:08.380> change

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
saying the word wah now you can change

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.530 
saying the word wah now you can change
that<00:02:08.890> up<00:02:08.950> with<00:02:09.310> your<00:02:09.460> hand<00:02:09.700> manipulation<00:02:10.420> on

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
that up with your hand manipulation on
