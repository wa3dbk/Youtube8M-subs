00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.839 
okay today we're doing a video review on
Arkady<00:00:03.240> galaxies<00:00:05.330> these<00:00:06.330> go<00:00:06.629> with<00:00:07.639> these<00:00:08.639> bad

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
Arkady galaxies these go with these bad

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.970 
Arkady galaxies these go with these bad
boys<00:00:10.130> probably<00:00:11.130> i<00:00:11.160> would<00:00:11.460> say<00:00:11.670> probably<00:00:12.980> one

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
boys probably i would say probably one

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:23.210 
boys probably i would say probably one
of<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.370> best<00:00:15.049> nike<00:00:16.049> shoes<00:00:16.500> ever<00:00:16.740> made<00:00:21.980> so<00:00:22.980> I

of the best nike shoes ever made so I

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.470 
of the best nike shoes ever made so I
wanted<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:24.350> create<00:00:25.350> some<00:00:27.050> some<00:00:28.050> elites<00:00:28.380> that

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
wanted to create some some elites that

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.590 
wanted to create some some elites that
go<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.689> galaxy<00:00:31.320> theme<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.600> also

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
go with that galaxy theme and also

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.950 
go with that galaxy theme and also
represent<00:00:34.260> Katy<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.570> OKC<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:38.600> we<00:00:39.600> went<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
represent Katy and OKC so we went with a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.580 
represent Katy and OKC so we went with a
galaxy<00:00:40.680> theme<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> tightness<00:00:43.820> lightning

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
galaxy theme and tightness lightning

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
galaxy theme and tightness lightning
it's<00:00:46.590> pretty<00:00:46.890> sweet<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.390> really

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it's pretty sweet and then we really

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.799 
it's pretty sweet and then we really
changed<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.559> two<00:00:52.710> colors<00:00:53.809> so

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
changed it up with the two colors so

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.209 
changed it up with the two colors so
these<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.500> good<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.100> wear<00:00:56.280> them

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
these are really good when you wear them

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.979 
these are really good when you wear them
get<00:00:59.219> when<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.820> pair<00:01:00.120> these<00:01:00.719> will

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
get when you get your pair these will

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.470 
get when you get your pair these will
switch<00:01:01.289> sometimes<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.820> can't<00:01:03.059> guarantee

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
switch sometimes so we can't guarantee

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.260 
switch sometimes so we can't guarantee
that<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:04.769> know<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.339> Left<00:01:05.610> will<00:01:05.790> always<00:01:06.090> be

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that you know the Left will always be

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.219 
that you know the Left will always be
orange<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.830> right<00:01:08.420> will<00:01:09.420> always<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.960> blue

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
orange and the right will always be blue

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.380 
orange and the right will always be blue
so<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.729> doesn't<00:01:12.119> really<00:01:12.240> matter<00:01:14.030> but<00:01:15.030> again<00:01:15.119> we

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
so it doesn't really matter but again we

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.480 
so it doesn't really matter but again we
can't<00:01:15.630> print<00:01:15.960> right<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:16.680> there's<00:01:17.369> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
can't print right in here there's a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
can't print right in here there's a
slight<00:01:17.790> little<00:01:17.970> imperfection<00:01:18.720> right<00:01:18.900> here

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
slight little imperfection right here

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.499 
slight little imperfection right here
again<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> bottom<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> sock

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
again this is on the bottom of the sock

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.640 
again this is on the bottom of the sock
so<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.350> never<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.770> see<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:24.380> we<00:01:25.380> really

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
so you can never really see it we really

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.789 
so you can never really see it we really
make<00:01:26.280> sure<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.650> perfect

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
make sure that all of this is perfect

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.929 
make sure that all of this is perfect
obviously<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:31.920> try<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> make<00:01:32.460> sure<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.820> whole

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
obviously we try to make sure the whole

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.050 
obviously we try to make sure the whole
sock<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.450> perfect<00:01:34.189> but<00:01:35.189> again<00:01:35.280> we're<00:01:35.850> printing

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
sock is perfect but again we're printing

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.840 
sock is perfect but again we're printing
on<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> sock<00:01:36.659> so

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.539 

it's<00:01:40.180> sometimes<00:01:40.900> can<00:01:41.290> get<00:01:41.409> difficult<00:01:44.369> look<00:01:45.369> at

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
it's sometimes can get difficult look at

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.570 
it's sometimes can get difficult look at
me<00:01:45.640> get<00:01:46.090> all<00:01:46.360> this<00:01:46.420> kind<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.020> perfect

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
me get all this kind of perfect

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.100 
me get all this kind of perfect
sometimes<00:01:48.580> some<00:01:48.909> like<00:01:49.119> little<00:01:49.330> imperfections

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
sometimes some like little imperfections

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.620 
sometimes some like little imperfections
have<00:01:50.290> we<00:01:50.470> run<00:01:50.650> around<00:01:50.799> in<00:01:51.040> here<00:01:51.369> but<00:01:52.360> again

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
have we run around in here but again

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.320 
have we run around in here but again
when<00:01:52.780> you're<00:01:52.899> wearing<00:01:53.140> your<00:01:53.259> sandals<00:01:54.330> this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
when you're wearing your sandals this

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.990 
when you're wearing your sandals this
covers<00:01:55.570> up<00:01:55.930> so<00:01:56.740> really<00:01:57.009> what<00:01:57.310> sticks<00:01:57.610> out<00:01:57.790> is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
covers up so really what sticks out is

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.570 
covers up so really what sticks out is
this<00:01:58.299> and<00:01:59.289> about<00:01:59.409> right<00:01:59.740> up<00:01:59.890> from<00:02:00.159> here<00:02:00.460> and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
this and about right up from here and

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.990 
this and about right up from here and
this<00:02:01.000> usually<00:02:01.330> always<00:02:01.630> turns<00:02:02.049> out<00:02:02.200> perfect

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
this usually always turns out perfect

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.740 
this usually always turns out perfect
again<00:02:04.000> right<00:02:04.240> in<00:02:04.390> here<00:02:04.810> only<00:02:05.140> because<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:07.270> this

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
again right in here only because of this

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:19.160 
again right in here only because of this
part<00:02:08.080> right<00:02:08.170> here<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.650> these<00:02:11.650> are<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.920> front

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.120 

these<00:02:20.170> are<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.380> backs<00:02:22.709> get<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.800> colors<00:02:24.100> a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
these are the backs get the colors a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.400 
these are the backs get the colors a
little<00:02:24.489> off<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:25.150> here<00:02:25.900> because<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.380> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
little off in here because of the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.280 
little off in here because of the
lighting<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:28.120> try<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.630> minimize<00:02:29.080> that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
lighting but try to minimize that

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.380 
lighting but try to minimize that
stretching<00:02:29.860> we<00:02:30.310> do<00:02:30.489> kind<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.940> pre<00:02:31.209> stretch

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
stretching we do kind of a pre stretch

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.539 
stretching we do kind of a pre stretch
to<00:02:34.390> help<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:35.080> we<00:02:35.110> want<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.799> look<00:02:36.220> good<00:02:36.400> when

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
you're wearing them a lot of them out

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.250 
you're wearing them a lot of them out
there<00:02:38.980> um<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:40.390> get<00:02:40.630> them<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.019> put<00:02:41.200> them

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
there um you get them and you put them

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
there um you get them and you put them
on<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:42.720> once<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.959> stretch<00:02:44.320> them<00:02:44.560> they<00:02:45.010> show

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
on and once you stretch them they show

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.979 
on and once you stretch them they show
these<00:02:45.549> white<00:02:45.760> lines<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.299> stuff<00:02:48.780> we're<00:02:49.780> trying

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
these white lines and stuff we're trying

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.500 
these white lines and stuff we're trying
to<00:02:50.110> minimize<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:52.829> then<00:02:53.829> also<00:02:54.420> there's<00:02:55.420> a

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
to minimize that and then also there's a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.060 
to minimize that and then also there's a
little<00:02:55.750> this<00:02:56.590> little<00:02:56.620> line<00:02:57.130> down<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.370> middle

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
little this little line down the middle
