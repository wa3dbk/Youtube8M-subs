00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.929

 parts of it is stored right here in my 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.220
 bathroom on such a bedside table now 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.410
 I will quickly tell you a new one 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.180

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.279
 periodically starting to use and here 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.760
 my departure which I have already shown you 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.649

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.200

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.879
 lumene her tonic and there is a wash 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.360
 which is worth it to my feet 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.039
 because the bottom is cracked but 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.460
 in fact here are our dental 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:58.199

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.359
 masonry skins can be generally 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.729
 caring for your face 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.369
 stored here on the other hand with 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.030
 the opposite is also a bit of mine 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.530
 care products 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.689
 here is my hairbrush here this one 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.610
 organic shop peeling which is very me 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.180
 like let's go straight to care 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.220
 behind the face 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.240
 actually so I take you closer 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.360
 the basement 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.720
 and now show here 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.759
 of the net line I should scrub more 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.619
 one scrub from natura siberica which 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.799
 totally disliked and probably from 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.640
 I'll get rid of him too and by the way yes hereâ€™s one 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.079
 the only mask to cleanse the pores she 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.030
 designed for face and body 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.579
 therefore, it is actually here 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.570
 Well, she somehow is not particularly afraid of the heat 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.159
 but this simple calculation calculation points 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.229
 shampoo which i don't use i don't know 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.380

 kept the bathroom in the hallway smart 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.550

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.040

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.610

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.440
