00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Servus friends I hope you are fine now 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.180
 everything is clear with me and today it works 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.230
 to character characteristics with the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.030
 animal on the bag 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.650
 I mean I know that there is 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.660
 Certain people you just do not 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.219
 because you do not behave with that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.269
 I have my own club with me 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.220
 thought squint for you out there 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.199
 this will be known for sure 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.170
 and that's why I'm telling you now 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.170
 characters that most bother me on rain 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.760
 the innocent and we'll start soon 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.219
 with a particularly great properties 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 which one usually recognizes correctly 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.219
 on shoulder shrug the innocent lamb 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.290
 eludes any responsibility 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.850
 and I personally hate it when you do 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.530
 can not rely on people 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.059
 I find so many examples 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
 my own life, for example 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.860
 this here is mine now 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.260
 part of the report south africa is right 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.239
 lasted a long time and you have a part yes 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.949
 also made yesterday or do you have it 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.629
 itself so only once did no problem 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.520
 only then come from the other person 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.309
 This is how it really works 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.570
 they each had to I do not know what 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.799
 I have never heard that 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.420
 oh so i wanted to do that if somebody 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.930
 I'm sorry I'm sorry but me 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.830
 personally can 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.780
 when you are in important situations 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.150
 just have to rely on people and 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.150
 is then badly disappointed even goes 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.920
 not justify the kind of 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.930
 character traits for each one 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.090
 unpleasant situation a suitable one 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.920
 excuse has yahoo and a fh 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.900
 Stylist is not completely over 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.250
 or not because it is the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.229
 first of all, come up 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.549
 given false information so catches 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.640
 ever before then my father is also 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.600
 I wanted him to come with me 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.180
 mature change holds and last but not least 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.130
 is also the pc cut off you know 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.899
 yes without a pc is not even and 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.939
 if surprised friends throughout 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.430
 excuse is usually never the word 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.810
 Me, because this person is not her 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.369
 justifies itself and sought the blame 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.750
 in others , it should be synonymous if 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.159
 One finds out that the following 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.970
 person is lying and she is doing pretty well 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.260
 frequently 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.820
 with the goal in sight the blame of 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.230
 to ask yourself to be wise and beautiful 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.720
 to distribute to the other people 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.460
 had jammerlappen found this person 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.500
 first of all, everything 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.360
 difficult effort dangerous or 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.009
 not appropriate, which usually works 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.170
 the miracle drawn mouth angles durchs 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.340
 Negative live any statement you give her 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.560
 have placed and is located 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.270
 basically to harm everything 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.690
 rudi you have to go to the cinema 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.700
 reporter 8 has come out noble hockey 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.260
 It's not so good and on 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.360
 cinema I have been doing anyway not wanna 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.430
 It does not matter how important one is 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.690
 situation is I had my question was 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.400
 me, i moved last week 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.110
 and with that a few problems with the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.340
 lions still in the old apartment and me 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.780
 search help could have you there 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.030
 maybe come over and help me 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.890
 to bring you to the new apartment 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.600
 us with me is anyway high 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.580
 the rest of your body and if you only 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.240
 a helping hand does not look for it anyway 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.890
 the case 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.959
 most of the time this is because of this person 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.520
 a chronic pain on just about everything 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.170
 But in contrast to just work 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.850
 He does not try to justify himself 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.250
 somehow a responsibility applies 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.519
 discard no there already from 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.950
 in the beginning and does not do that 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.660
 Greatmouth prefers to speak in the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.680
 first person singular and for all those 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.260
 in German and I did not pay attention 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.480
 That's the one I hear and is 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.220
 even the sweetest topic is people like me 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.330
 now have my new macbook so can 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.060
 By the way, I'm even better now 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.920
 minecraft place on me do not want 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.380
 but I'll tell you just like that 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.330
 in my opinion, your pc is yes 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.640
 actually nothing against my I 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.519
 I have him so on and even with led 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.720
 lights and a really fat 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.700
 motherboards these especially for absolutely 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.890
 every talked about a situation 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.239
 your own life is now true 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.100
 or maybe she does not care 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.840
 not just much better than that 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.760
 told about the others in the 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.440
 shadow and even bigger 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.330
 We also try everything else 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.850
 bad to talk because you are yourself 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.519
 the best and gives your mustard everywhere 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.590
 yes, well, that is not allowed to take off 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.750
 I've paid my mind and that 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.180
 is the best over but right 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.570
 right fire department i had to pay him 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.830
 the know-it-all too pretty 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.459
 difficult guy and one of his 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.220
 favorite sentences is the following yes but if 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.230
 you will do that more than once 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.730
 be pretty sure that you one 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.500
 know-it-alls when you are 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.000
 constantly improved by this person 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.860
 will be with everything you say 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.450
 justifies why exactly her football club 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.310
 the better one is and still with 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.630
 some prove disgusting too 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.519
 still says why the taste of music 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.440
 this person the best is what total 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.390
 can be considered subjectively 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.160
 then it gets on already animal 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.690
 the johann if you keep the others 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.610
 stupid lets stand by simply 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.190
 a stupid comment about her things from 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.110
 So first he is called a stupid 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.430
 Comment because it is the comment 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.440
 I just wanted to say 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.610
 are the way also not be 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.610
 handy correct 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.190
 the blasphemy a pretty much wants and 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.780
 at the same time annoying 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.340
 character trait simply because 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.370
 she has the possibility whole 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.240
 destroy friendships or groups 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.250
 and that's what he has to do 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.290
 pretty easy to recognize either 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.330
 the reproached hand on lying 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.240
 index finger or conspiratorial 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.530
 Tonsystem makes it so difficult for videos 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.510
 fell out fight 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.500
 I just think it's pretty bold 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.360
 if you stand behind the back of 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.800
 car it does not matter if that tells 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.820
 right now or not 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.070
 Rumors set in the world or 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.790
 Secrets continue to promote that makes you 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.210
 simply not 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.310
 and the coach is what can i say 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.470
 a character trait like myself 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.270
 but at least 50 percent own 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.950
 Also I'm not particularly proud 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.540
 future well because so than simply 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.860
 Days and situations are where I am 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.240
 totally neat and also 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.650
 perfectionist we have on the 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.780
 other side are also moments in which 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.700
 I totally planned that cause 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.419
 biggest chaos loser find my things 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.479
