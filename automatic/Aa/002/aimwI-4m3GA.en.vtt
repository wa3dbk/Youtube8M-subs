00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.360
 each 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.080
 You're coming to the law school now and you're welcome. 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.759
 we invite people who know very well what this is 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.890
 to tell us a little bit like that experience in college goodbye 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.199
 Kate has changed for you after 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.449
 is to be in a higher education 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.730
 course makes all the difference in the professional life of a 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.399
 person 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.710
 the faculty it makes an internal change 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.460
 subscribing to inter, not because he changes his vision to his own vision with 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.170
 folks 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.050
 the world view and the market view 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.480
 this year because the market itself knows that it is open there are people who 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.649
 invests in knowledge it is open from the faces person who has beyond 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.640
 theoretical theoretical knowledge 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.679
 this world knowledge of people knowledge 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.330
 this knowledge of the market is a person who has a period course 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.470
 she is more likely to get a job than other people than 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.970
 suddenly did not have this opportunity they could not complete a course 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.980
 higher 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.990
 without fear of error I answer yes 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.530
 of course the market is open to those people who have a 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.770
 because beyond the knowledge 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.120
 technical knowledge of each area 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.630
 the market is looking for a person who has an enlarged view and college and 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.710
 a prism azores where are small our vision was said said thank you 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.920
 We're going to talk to the week 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.080
 she who is a student of the psychology course 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.730
 and let's talk a little bit about your expectation and tell us what your 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.100
 expectations an upper course 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.429
 not my expectations before entering college were very good 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.010
 and they are certainly being met 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.610
 only here 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.010
 a quiet person in the 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.800
 It's there with my colleague and he said 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800
 many phases changes occurring in that person's life 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.020
 a lot of responsability 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.800
 only so with every challenge that we overcome to each knowledge that people 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.469
 gets everything well worth it so really worth the person 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.760
 joining a college 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.099
 the undergraduate course 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.969
 now it's having a college degree nowadays 

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:14.120
 with the deference you realized that you had some differential 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.129
 in relation to other people 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.779
 certainly beyond theory 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.459
 practices that we have in our 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.729
 the subject then really make difference in undergraduate course 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.560
 Now who's coming today? 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.159
 with the message that you would leave as it is going to be 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.650
 the day-to-day arrival of people and now as I said are many 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.739
 changes in the person's life 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.269
 too much responsibility 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.419
 only here in the neighborhood and the pen is a differential that counts later in the market 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.580
 of work then I recommend the south graduation course 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:49.819
 there the opinion of our two guests 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.609
 Thank you very much, week 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.609
 Let's stay here. 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.829
