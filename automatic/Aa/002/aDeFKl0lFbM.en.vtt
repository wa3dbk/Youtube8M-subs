and I'm gonna show you how to replace
pedals<00:00:10.400> on<00:00:10.610> a<00:00:10.670> BMX<00:00:11.090> bike

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.250 

so<00:00:15.870> tools<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.620> job<00:00:16.830> would<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.450> pedal

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
so tools for the job would be a a pedal

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.780 
so tools for the job would be a a pedal
wrench<00:00:19.410> if<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.770> have<00:00:19.950> one<00:00:20.190> if<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.490> can<00:00:20.610> get

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
wrench if you have one if you can get

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.000 
wrench if you have one if you can get
one<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.480> not<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.960> could<00:00:22.080> always<00:00:22.230> use<00:00:22.620> a<00:00:22.650> 15

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
one if not you could always use a 15

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.269 
one if not you could always use a 15
millimeter<00:00:23.310> wrench<00:00:24.740> most<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.860> time<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.100> fits

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
millimeter wrench most of time it fits

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.450 
millimeter wrench most of time it fits
and<00:00:26.520> then<00:00:27.050> recommends<00:00:28.050> some<00:00:28.950> grease<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.340> some

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
and then recommends some grease or some

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.100 
and then recommends some grease or some
Lube

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
Lube

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.780 
Lube
so<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:31.259> first<00:00:31.470> step<00:00:31.740> would<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.640> remove

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
so the first step would be to remove

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.510 
so the first step would be to remove
your<00:00:33.150> old<00:00:33.270> pedals<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.530> grab<00:00:34.950> your<00:00:35.100> pedal

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
your old pedals so grab your pedal

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.370 
your old pedals so grab your pedal
wrench<00:00:35.670> or<00:00:35.970> your<00:00:36.240> 15<00:00:36.630> millimeter<00:00:36.990> wrench

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.069 

always<00:00:40.380> to<00:00:40.530> do<00:00:40.700> is<00:00:41.700> simply<00:00:44.690> unscrew<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.810> pedal

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
always to do is simply unscrew the pedal

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.250 
always to do is simply unscrew the pedal
but<00:00:46.440> very<00:00:46.920> important<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:48.060> left<00:00:48.330> pedal<00:00:48.570> is

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
but very important the left pedal is

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.170 
but very important the left pedal is
reverse<00:00:49.530> threaded<00:00:49.740> so<00:00:50.520> lefty<00:00:50.850> loosey<00:00:51.150> righty

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
reverse threaded so lefty loosey righty

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:01.090 
reverse threaded so lefty loosey righty
tighty<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:52.350> reversed

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.490 

you

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.830 

so<00:01:05.190> that<00:01:05.340> your<00:01:05.520> old<00:01:05.700> petals<00:01:05.970> are<00:01:06.090> off<00:01:06.240> extended

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so that your old petals are off extended

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
sure using the correct pedal you'll find

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.280 
sure using the correct pedal you'll find
in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> inside<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> spindle<00:01:12.150> on<00:01:12.450> pedals

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
in the inside of the spindle on pedals

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.290 
in the inside of the spindle on pedals
it'll<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> whore<00:01:13.980> and<00:01:14.280> L<00:01:14.370> on<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> same<00:01:15.030> left

or right left - left right - right and
that's<00:01:18.690> how<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.840> goes

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
that's how it goes

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.410 
that's how it goes
first<00:01:21.810> step<00:01:22.080> is<00:01:22.350> reckon<00:01:23.160> it's<00:01:23.910> not<00:01:24.030> necessary

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
first step is reckon it's not necessary

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
first step is reckon it's not necessary
but<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.630> recommended<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.260> grease<00:01:25.830> the

but it's recommended to grease the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.920 
but it's recommended to grease the
spindle<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.760> pedal<00:01:27.030> you're<00:01:27.660> just<00:01:27.840> gonna

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.080 

now<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:54.160> we<00:01:54.220> have<00:01:54.310> our<00:01:54.340> pedals<00:01:54.760> tightened

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
now that we have our pedals tightened

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.630 
now that we have our pedals tightened
down<00:01:55.120> we<00:01:55.570> tied<00:01:55.780> them<00:01:55.870> down<00:01:56.130> pretty<00:01:57.130> firmly<00:01:57.430> but

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
down we tied them down pretty firmly but

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.460 
down we tied them down pretty firmly but
not<00:01:57.700> too<00:01:58.000> tight<00:01:58.180> because<00:01:58.720> pedals<00:01:59.050> tennessee's

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
not too tight because pedals tennessee's

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.950 
not too tight because pedals tennessee's
up<00:01:59.620> sometimes<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.550> common<00:02:01.390> thing<00:02:01.540> people<00:02:01.780> have

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
up sometimes a common thing people have

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.230 
up sometimes a common thing people have
been<00:02:02.110> asking<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:02.890> if<00:02:03.460> they<00:02:03.729> could<00:02:03.880> just<00:02:04.030> switch

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
been asking is if they could just switch

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.969 
been asking is if they could just switch
their<00:02:04.420> cranks<00:02:04.720> around<00:02:04.990> when<00:02:05.590> doing<00:02:05.920> a

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
their cranks around when doing a

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.490 
their cranks around when doing a
left-hand<00:02:06.400> swap<00:02:06.760> on<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.390> drivetrain<00:02:07.810> you

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
left-hand swap on the drivetrain you

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.719 
left-hand swap on the drivetrain you
can't<00:02:08.770> because<00:02:09.070> then<00:02:09.190> your<00:02:09.310> pedals<00:02:09.550> will<00:02:09.670> be

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
can't because then your pedals will be

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.440 
can't because then your pedals will be
on<00:02:09.850> backwards<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.509> no<00:02:10.570> on<00:02:10.690> thread<00:02:10.929> themselves
