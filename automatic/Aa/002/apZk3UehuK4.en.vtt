a<00:00:10.830> good<00:00:11.040> candidate<00:00:11.460> for<00:00:11.519> Road<00:00:11.790> tubeless

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
a good candidate for Road tubeless

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.999 
a good candidate for Road tubeless
because<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> rim<00:00:13.080> bed<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.440> see<00:00:13.559> us<00:00:13.740> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
because the rim bed is see us and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.420 
because the rim bed is see us and
therefore<00:00:14.610> has<00:00:15.000> no<00:00:15.059> spoke<00:00:15.690> holes<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.170> seal<00:00:16.440> the

mounts<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.469> fine<00:00:40.649> by<00:00:40.829> hand<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.760> did<00:00:42.059> need

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
mounts just fine by hand but I did need

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.740 
mounts just fine by hand but I did need
to<00:00:42.329> use<00:00:42.480> tire<00:00:42.750> levers<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.350> retool<00:00:44.629> once<00:00:45.629> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
to use tire levers to retool once you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.779 
to use tire levers to retool once you
get<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> tire<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.649> do<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> quick<00:00:47.579> test

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
get the tire on there do a quick test

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.260 
get the tire on there do a quick test
inflation<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> seat<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> bead<00:00:50.270> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
inflation just to seat the bead the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.810 
inflation just to seat the bead the
trick<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.680> pressure<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
trick here is to put pressure on the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.060 
trick here is to put pressure on the
tire<00:00:54.059> directly<00:00:54.840> on<00:00:54.989> top<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> valve<00:00:55.860> stem

tire directly on top of the valve stem

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.720 
tire directly on top of the valve stem
this<00:00:56.910> seems<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.270> push<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.100> bead<00:00:59.100> up<00:00:59.370> against

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
this seems that push the bead up against

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.209 
this seems that push the bead up against
the<00:00:59.879> side<00:01:00.059> walls<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.690> rim<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.649> feels<00:01:02.070> pretty

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the side walls and rim it feels pretty

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.609 
the side walls and rim it feels pretty

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
quickly and the old pump up by fine pump

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.600 
quickly and the old pump up by fine pump
up<00:01:04.739> by<00:01:04.949> hand<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.430> fine<00:01:07.159> once<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.340> get<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
up by hand just fine once you get that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.690 
up by hand just fine once you get that
in<00:01:08.760> ad<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.060> time<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.390> add<00:01:09.479> sealant<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.700> fold

in ad it's time to add sealant I fold

in ad it's time to add sealant I fold
one<00:01:12.180> beat<00:01:12.450> off<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.869> tire<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.460> i'm<00:01:14.460> using<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
one beat off the tire and i'm using a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.249 
one beat off the tire and i'm using a
cup<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.350> stan<00:01:16.740> sealant<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> dump<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.090> in

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
cup of stan sealant just to dump it in

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.859 
cup of stan sealant just to dump it in
it's<00:01:19.259> easier<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.310> use<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.060> sealant<00:01:21.450> injector

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it's easier to use the sealant injector

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.560 
it's easier to use the sealant injector
of<00:01:22.080> some<00:01:22.560> type<00:01:22.799> through<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> valve<00:01:24.030> stem<00:01:24.210> or

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
of some type through the valve stem or

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.050 
of some type through the valve stem or
some<00:01:25.290> kind<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.650> syringe<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.640> i<00:01:26.670> didn't<00:01:26.970> have

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
some kind of a syringe but i didn't have

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.039 
some kind of a syringe but i didn't have
one<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.540> i<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.200> dumped<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.680> instead<00:01:30.049> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
one so i just dumped it in instead the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.990 
one so i just dumped it in instead the
intensive<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.590> very<00:01:31.950> tough<00:01:32.250> tire<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
intensive is very tough tire the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
intensive is very tough tire the
sidewalls<00:01:33.479> are<00:01:33.570> particularly<00:01:34.170> durable<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
sidewalls are particularly durable and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.260 
sidewalls are particularly durable and
so<00:01:35.220> these<00:01:35.340> make<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> good<00:01:35.790> candidate<00:01:36.210> for

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
so these make a good candidate for

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.660 
so these make a good candidate for
training<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:37.110> riding<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.560> bad<00:01:37.799> roads<00:01:37.829> gravel
