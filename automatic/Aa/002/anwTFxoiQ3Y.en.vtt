 This time is the time that opens confidently 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.650
 It is also clean as before. 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.320
 When one knows the heat rim te too 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.380

 My influences prices muffler ocean than any gasoline vehicle design, vehicle line equation 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.850
 Is it because 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:23.580
 Expert break saw a figure so this is a very good car and the right 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:26.790
 Now the car is out and there is a comparison . Why is it a little late? 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:31.230
 That 's what I showed you to easily understand. 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.610
 In exactly the same gasoline car fuel economy should be like a good diesel cars are diesel 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.280
 Pocah Chicago comes out. 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:43.350
 Can I show you a solid case ? Yes, fuel economy is good when I see a gasoline vehicle .

 Then it 's made. The muffler is made from the engine and it's muffler . 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.720
 This looked good and not talk about the mileage unconditionally because two output also not much difference between what 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.630
 You are good 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:05.730

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.980
 I have honey in it. 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.980
 I connected it to a muffler and measured it. 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.120
 I need to go to the 120 - mile 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:22.100
 Do you see the middle line on the computer screen 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.080
 Most of it is coming up. Yes. Actually, this number goes down to 120 . 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.420
 It's a good fuel economy car. 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:33.590
 Joseonghan that sounds pretty complete to me right not to get completely nunjom 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:38.900
 So, for example, do not give the master a little muff state of the first vehicle that Hitler also reported 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.920
 I do not know the high imitation report here, but the cleanliness of the creations 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.010
 Check 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.010
 I finally connected the machine 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:55.010
 I wrote on the screen like before . 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:58.400
 The increasingly shameful legs I end up acting as you say 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.040

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:06.650

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.370
 Oh, yeah. You need to measure your equipment . 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.689
 That's it. 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.650
 By the way , see who's watching or take an owner and a wooden leader will open up. 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:20.090
 When you buy a proof car , there is something to check if it rains. 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:25.070
 Cheap nuffs How about checking the sunroof ? 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:29.030
 Nowadays, there are many people who favor a person with a sunroof when buying a used car . 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.240
 So, Lee Sun-woo also needs to check out our new bird, Acei. 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:36.889
 Well, if a couple gets water, they need a load.

 * Zorro-site engine squat can it be wrong cause trouble about 2 degrees costs 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:44.060
 We have to do this because we are not 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.509
 Now let's see if we can not sure if Joe sunroof is irrational 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.520
 There is 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:53.570
 Is it really possible to confirm that I will lose as a piece of paper 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:56.660
 Once you observe the other behavior is reported crew 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.800
 You can not fall in love with the mane. 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.270
 I do not choose yet another example beorijyo got out and went back once more
