features here in a second it's going to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.110 
features here in a second it's going to
go<00:00:36.270> ahead<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.480> unbox<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:38.280> does<00:00:38.610> come<00:00:39.090> with

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
go ahead and unbox it it does come with

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.420 
go ahead and unbox it it does come with
30<00:00:39.899> set<00:00:40.489> 3600<00:00:41.489> RPM<00:00:42.090> motor<00:00:42.860> which<00:00:43.860> does<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
30 set 3600 RPM motor which does have a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.790 
30 set 3600 RPM motor which does have a
lifetime<00:00:44.730> warranty<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.960> other

features include special patent
extraction<00:00:50.730> technology<00:00:51.449> which<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.079> think

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
extraction technology which I think

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.139 
extraction technology which I think
basically<00:00:52.530> separates<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.610> know<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
basically separates you know like the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.240 
basically separates you know like the
peels<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.629> things<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.860> let's<00:00:56.129> go

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
peels and things like that so let's go

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.010 
peels and things like that so let's go
ahead<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.879> bad<00:00:57.120> boy<00:00:57.329> opened

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.900 

see<00:01:04.020> here<00:01:04.230> kind<00:01:04.590> of<00:01:04.620> got<00:01:04.800> a<00:01:04.830> recipes<00:01:05.550> for

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
see here kind of got a recipes for

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:31.200 
see here kind of got a recipes for
healthy<00:01:06.390> living<00:01:07.160> power<00:01:08.160> juicer<00:01:08.670> guide

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.310 

back<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.600> I<00:01:32.630> think<00:01:32.810> that's<00:01:32.990> what<00:01:33.170> we're<00:01:33.290> all

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
back and I think that's what we're all

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.279 
back and I think that's what we're all
kind<00:01:33.619> of<00:01:33.680> like<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.950> leftover<00:01:34.960> seeds<00:01:35.960> or<00:01:36.200> stems

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
kind of like the leftover seeds or stems

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.090 
kind of like the leftover seeds or stems
or<00:01:36.770> whatever<00:01:37.039> that<00:01:37.100> goes<00:01:37.490> in<00:01:37.670> there<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:39.100> let's

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
or whatever that goes in there and let's

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.200 
or whatever that goes in there and let's
go<00:01:40.280> down<00:01:40.670> in<00:01:40.850> there<00:01:41.000> like<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:43.000> then<00:01:44.000> this

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
go down in there like that so then this

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.410 
go down in there like that so then this
bar<00:01:44.869> slides<00:01:45.320> down<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:47.350> allows<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:49.360> let<00:01:50.360> me

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
bar slides down and allows you let me

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.850 
bar slides down and allows you let me
show<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.899> inside<00:01:51.670> this<00:01:52.670> part<00:01:53.030> right<00:01:53.090> here

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.160 

spark<00:01:57.860> comes<00:01:58.069> off<00:01:58.280> here<00:01:58.659> says<00:01:59.659> take<00:01:59.929> out

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170
