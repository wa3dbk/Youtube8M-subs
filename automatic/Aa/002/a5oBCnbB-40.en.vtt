00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
of them so far one in this game and it

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.930 
of them so far one in this game and it

does take us on to get Leroy fer in a
CDM<00:02:27.450> position<00:02:27.810> now<00:02:28.170> I'm<00:02:28.290> also<00:02:28.500> curious<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:29.130> to

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
CDM position now I'm also curious as to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.740 
CDM position now I'm also curious as to
whether<00:02:29.489> you<00:02:29.610> guys<00:02:29.819> want<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> see<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> formation

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
whether you guys want to see a formation

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.660 
whether you guys want to see a formation
change<00:02:31.230> whether<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.560> be<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.950> free<00:02:32.160> free<00:02:32.430> or

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
change whether it be for free free or

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.300 
change whether it be for free free or
even<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.569> ditching<00:02:34.260> moving<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.769> down<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.069> one

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
even just ditching moving it down to one

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.509 
even just ditching moving it down to one
striker<00:02:35.730> because<00:02:36.150> if<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.630> do<00:02:36.780> look<00:02:36.989> at<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
striker because if you do look at the

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.759 
striker because if you do look at the
the<00:02:38.519> Dutch<00:02:38.730> pool<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.150> players<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.769> strikers

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
the Dutch pool of players the strikers

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.740 
the Dutch pool of players the strikers
isn't<00:02:41.010> really<00:02:41.220> up<00:02:41.250> there<00:02:41.459> not<00:02:42.180> some<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> blight

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
isn't really up there not some a blight

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.720 
isn't really up there not some a blight
and<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.410> pretty<00:02:43.590> shocked<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.370> find<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
and I was pretty shocked to find that

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.400 
and I was pretty shocked to find that
Robin<00:02:45.209> he's<00:02:45.630> going<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> be<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:45.989> next<00:02:46.110> upgrade

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
Robin he's going to be the next upgrade

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.720 
Robin he's going to be the next upgrade
for<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.769> right<00:02:46.920> midfield<00:02:47.310> because<00:02:47.640> they

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
for the right midfield because they

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.340 
for the right midfield because they
don't<00:02:47.880> have<00:02:47.940> any<00:02:48.120> non<00:02:48.330> rare<00:02:48.569> gold<00:02:48.870> players<00:02:49.140> I

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
don't have any non rare gold players I

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.259 
don't have any non rare gold players I
thought<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.130> Dutch<00:02:50.340> pool<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.730> players<00:02:50.819> was

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
thought the Dutch pool of players was

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.120 
thought the Dutch pool of players was
brilliant<00:02:51.660> if<00:02:52.410> we<00:02:52.530> did<00:02:52.650> watch<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.830> best

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
brilliant if we did watch the best

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.860 
brilliant if we did watch the best
possible<00:02:53.310> netherlands<00:02:54.299> team<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.540> if<00:02:54.630> build<00:02:54.810> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
possible netherlands team and if build a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.140 
possible netherlands team and if build a
weekend<00:02:55.260> as<00:02:55.410> well<00:02:55.530> you'll<00:02:56.069> see<00:02:56.310> there<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:56.970> lots

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
weekend as well you'll see there is lots

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.390 
weekend as well you'll see there is lots
of<00:02:57.299> decent<00:02:57.660> players<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.140> there<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:59.099> and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
of decent players in there but and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.759 
of decent players in there but and
there's<00:02:59.970> no<00:03:00.150> Inbetweeners<00:03:01.049> and<00:03:01.319> that's<00:03:01.470> a

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
there's no Inbetweeners and that's a

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.070 
there's no Inbetweeners and that's a
pretty<00:03:02.489> bit<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.090> downfall<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.569> find<00:03:03.900> with

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
pretty bit of a downfall I find with

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.050
