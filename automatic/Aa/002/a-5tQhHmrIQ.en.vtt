00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.600
 speaking of sepsis just about the 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.180
 fic that went viral and the 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.730

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.750
 right now we discussed it I wanted to explain 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.750
 As much of this as I tell you 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.120
 almadÃ©n is chanted 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.970
 You come from nine as day the 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.970
 former external broker 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.620

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:48.090
 see a new author they added new 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.090
 annual actions of high but not 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.119
 outline 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:05.479
 spring valley 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.479
 waters the betis shout at you in javi veis 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:16.709
 the bridge is very effective in this nursery 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:20.000
 kind of very important very funny 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.000
 happy success 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:30.650
 then that is now a world exponent 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.500
 wow and youtube wifi 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.960
 Well, I have this story 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.260
 they were just combing their children 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.520
 to go to school 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.700
 they share the photo as anyone 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.230
 share the photos of your people who climb 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.690
 photos of the look what I can eat 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.490
 and it looks horrible that they shared 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.830
 that moment because that yes we get up 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.220
 every day at 5 in the morning and 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.310
 it was nice it goes viral because 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.940
 began this debate of whether couples 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.890
 homosexuals should have the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.960
 opportunity to adopt or could have 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.330
 children and there in the video says it 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.900
 we received comments from positive 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.870
 even negatives do not know us they do not know 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.530
 what is happening in our life and he 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.260
 He decides as he says there to buy a 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.230
 camera and start taking pictures of all 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.060
 their days of how they live and how happy 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.090
 what are the children because 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.340
 and finally they have a very very life 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.410
 happy I understand perfect because it 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.050
 returned to look at the very everyday scene 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.270
 I do not know is how you imagine what 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.069
 better more more cliches not to be of this 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.540
 part of the parents combing the girl or 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.330
 it's something like mulete is so good 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.010
 fact that it could be a commercial yes 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.950
 but the salt really if I could 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.840
 be like this or social inclusion I'm not 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.670
 Clear clear of the family every time 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.459
 is losing more being together 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.440
 spend time with children also 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.900
 children suddenly you no longer have time 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.160
 of combing if they go to school and 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.080
 children feel and maybe 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.940
 abandoned then what is good 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.580
 important because spinning because it 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.170
 see that there is a family life and 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.540
 are three girls do not do the ones 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.450
 they adopted then that too us etc 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.000
 it is always this as an approach to what to 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.530
 the everyday to the sentimental or the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.810
 paper combing the girl is a very image 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.800
 pretty as very close and 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.479
 they are both there in the position that 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.969
 we are not mom but in this 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.039
 morning roll predicted taxi 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:38.309
 say I raise the five in the 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.379
 tomorrow I raise my children the combs there 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:42.599
 one that is chaos also for them is 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:45.239
 super matter if the times I have 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.789
 to travel and I can not be with them if 

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:49.559
 they resent it as it is a moment 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.959
 sacred is in the morning and in the night 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:53.549
 when you go to side when you pray 

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:55.589
 with them when you talk about how they did 

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:57.899
 your day sings to you is a song or you read 

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:59.999
 with them clear they appreciate it very much and 

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:02.219
 these are the things that for the life 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.139
 everyday that we carry air if it is already 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.309
 not so much opportunity is what 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.349
 important is that every time you 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:10.829
 know let's do it why it's vital to 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:14.159
 the children a debate of whether they should or not 

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:16.349
 they should also open another topic that 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.389
 is the offensive that can be the people in 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:19.889
 social networks when it is anonymous what 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.399
 offensive that can be a person 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:25.739
 when when he does not say who you are or not 

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:28.259
 you have in front of the people because if 

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:31.409
 they put some very very comments 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.449
 offensive and that here and where 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.519
 want to see for my point of view is what 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.249
 more cowardly than there is insulting the 

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:39.480
 people through a social network when 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:42.960
 you do not even know him 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.670
 what I was just saying 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.320
 was impressed because he said no 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.000
 they know they do not even stop me well and 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.130
 Too bad they do not know how much they 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.810
 we love girls and they gave her light 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:55.000
 they know that continuity but of all 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.220
 modes that is the sample also of affection 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.050
 we invite you to continue questioning the 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.050
 information with the following videos
