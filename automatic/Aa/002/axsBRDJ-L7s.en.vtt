I'm really looking forward to this I
don't<00:02:30.760> wait<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:32.230> started<00:02:32.739> on<00:02:33.189> it<00:02:33.219> and<00:02:34.209> wait

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
don't wait to get started on it and wait

00:02:34.389 --> 00:03:03.420 
don't wait to get started on it and wait
for<00:02:34.599> this<00:02:35.219> console<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:02.219> basically<00:03:03.219> you<00:03:03.370> just

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
for this console so basically you just

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.390 
for this console so basically you just
have<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:04.569> can't<00:03:04.810> have<00:03:04.930> logos<00:03:05.620> here<00:03:05.919> so<00:03:06.340> you

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
have you can't have logos here so you

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.939 
have you can't have logos here so you
have<00:03:07.349> photos<00:03:08.349> music<00:03:08.739> videos<00:03:09.359> gain<00:03:10.359> and

have photos music videos gain and
gameplay<00:03:11.949> mean<00:03:12.219> and<00:03:13.349> I'll<00:03:14.349> guess<00:03:14.590> off<00:03:14.769> the

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
gameplay mean and I'll guess off the

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.399 
gameplay mean and I'll guess off the
Internet<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.609> that's<00:03:16.599> the<00:03:16.870> PlayStation

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
Internet and that's the PlayStation

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.939 
Internet and that's the PlayStation

output so just tell you what the thingie

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.939 
output so just tell you what the thingie
on<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.189> background<00:03:21.579> if<00:03:21.669> you<00:03:21.760> play<00:03:21.939> ps3<00:03:22.329> is
