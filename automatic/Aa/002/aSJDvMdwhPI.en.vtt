00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
it's really pretty cool um the reason I

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.590 
it's really pretty cool um the reason I
like<00:01:05.860> this<00:01:06.100> is<00:01:06.369> because<00:01:06.580> it's<00:01:07.119> a<00:01:07.299> hundred

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
like this is because it's a hundred

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.920 
like this is because it's a hundred
percent<00:01:07.690> sulfate<00:01:08.410> free<00:01:08.740> which<00:01:09.460> sulfates<00:01:10.090> dry

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
type but because curly hair is already a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.630 
type but because curly hair is already a
dryer<00:01:19.650> texture<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:23.260> gets<00:01:23.440> even<00:01:23.680> even<00:01:24.460> more
