00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
it's a snake bite and here we have just

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.799 
it's a snake bite and here we have just
a<00:00:42.570> carabiner<00:00:43.730> not<00:00:44.730> really<00:00:44.969> necessary<00:00:45.539> i<00:00:45.660> just

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
a carabiner not really necessary i just

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.729 
a carabiner not really necessary i just
put<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.469> then<00:00:47.210> this<00:00:48.210> slides<00:00:48.739> these

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
put on there and then this slides these

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.290 
put on there and then this slides these
are<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.010> slightly<00:00:50.430> knots<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.180> on

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
are the slightly knots you see on

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.110 
are the slightly knots you see on
necklaces<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> basically<00:00:56.579> i<00:00:56.699> could

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
necklaces so basically i could

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.819 
necklaces so basically i could
essentially<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.870> go<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.379> over<00:00:58.710> our

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
essentially just go like this over our

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.209 
essentially just go like this over our
loop<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.309> hook<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.120> through<00:01:00.920> with<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.039> loop

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
loop and hook it through with the loop

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.210 
loop and hook it through with the loop
in<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.879> would<00:01:03.000> create<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:04.220> little

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
in here and it would create that little

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.179 
in here and it would create that little
V<00:01:05.549> hook<00:01:06.770> in<00:01:07.770> there<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:10.500> would<00:01:10.680> create<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
V hook in there it would create that

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
V hook in there it would create that
little<00:01:11.490> loop<00:01:12.409> course<00:01:14.240> my<00:01:15.240> five<00:01:15.450> fingers<00:01:15.900> don't

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
little loop course my five fingers don't

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.380 
little loop course my five fingers don't
work<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.500> tiny<00:01:16.770> spot<00:01:17.159> here<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.299> get

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
work in this tiny spot here but you get

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.109 
work in this tiny spot here but you get
the<00:01:18.450> picture<00:01:22.100> but<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.220> kind<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.729> proud<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.939> it
