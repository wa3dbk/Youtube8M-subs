00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.450
 do you have 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.490
 very good to all for the chapter of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.040
 today I thought we could see the village 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.619
 great thing that I have and step by step commenting 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.660
 little certain aspects of it so 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.890
 let's go see here centurion visit 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.570
 good is 969 city hall level 8 is 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.820
 quite advanced but still has 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.130
 a lot to do to all the guns 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.380
 missing a level to the wizard towers 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.239
 are missing 270 is missing one the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.680
 mortars and they are at maximum the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.120
 we have in the tests the truth is that it is 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.800
 something that does not bother me much 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.789
 antiaircraft is missing a level but good 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.170
 is an affordable level for both 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.809
 towers of monkeys to the bottom nor one of 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.300
 the others are missing two anyway if you give 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.839
 account is completely symmetric has 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.329
 four sides east east east and east that 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.550
 they only have two blocks of walls but the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.980
 second is level 7 and then the others 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.540
 two have three level 6 blocks per 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.780
 therefore, it is quite difficult to reach 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.090
 center 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.700
 then 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.979
 I'm in gold 2 and I have the town hall 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.299
 out and I'm climbing glasses 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.729
 my goal is to reach the crystal for 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.710
 get to the gems that I need to 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.750
 get the fourth constructor I know that 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.310
 it's kind of weird to want to go up 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.069
 having the town hall outside but this 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.200
 has a very simple explanation of 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.329
 understand people are in leagues seek 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.189
 cups directly then see a 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.140
 city ​​hall out loose here some 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.750
 Archers will knock him down and retire with his 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.590
 Cups well, that's what gives me the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.840
 opportunity to have a shield 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.000
 to take advantage of when I went to do 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.610
 an attack even if you lose the shield and 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.069
 look for drinks and stay connected 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.659
 until generating again an army and 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.280
 revenge on the one who attacked me and how 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.530
 you know the revenge usually generate more 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.329
 cups over all people who also 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.509
 aspire to reach crystal and take what 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.060
 better 100 or 200 glasses the revenge is going 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.340
 to perfectly give 30 glasses up 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.079
 which all greatly facilitate the ascent 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.060
 while you make sure you have 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:15.640
 practically a shield always and that 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.350
 they rob you many resources that good as 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.360
 I'm on the rise of drinks because you see 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.120
 they are improving the stores 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.370
 but I have enough and good for me is 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.560
 quite elixir and I want to get to 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.990
 improve rival or at level 5 then it is 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.640
 what I protect most and good here I am 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.360
 making the traps that overwhelm us 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.770
 thank you very much but good of equal 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.590
 I'm going to put a repetition of a 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.040
 defense that came relatively 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.780
 little and you will see how the law works 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.700
 the one that kills that level 93 or is very 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.100
 superior to me the first thing he does is 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.780
 so drop a lot of barbadillo that 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.340
 I think that's pretty bad this before 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.690
 his vision above all before but 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.310
 Giant consulted is the king barbara 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.250
 directly validating the rage 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.050
 barbarians with skill level 7 a lot 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.770
 stronger than me then are some coffers 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.780
 to ensure victory and well that 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.270
 first wall the one people ends up with 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.880
 all the barbarians reach my rival you see 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.070
 face his entertaining while 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.420
 the mortar and mortar is giving them 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.800
 and if I'm not wrong, my king wins and 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.590
 well there goes the castle and a dragon 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.900
 what a great way and here is what 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.490
 I told you the giants come to the wall 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.440
 level 7 and they stay with while 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.970
 between my king valverde 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.650
 Drago and the archers who have stayed 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.240
 behind the wall they end up with all of them 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.430
 then I think a little bit to the 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.240
 desperate then loose the castle and I 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.520
 I think about 25 level 6 goalkeepers 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.080
 comes to the middle to broken the wall but if 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.810
 you notice then two mortars are left here 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.100
 pipe burying what was this here failed 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.060
 another key finally releases a healer from 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.980
 goblins to try I think it takes 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.530
 selic , I swear, we realize that 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.390
 that there were mines and collectors here 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.340
 and the goblins sir out and link 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.520
 kill the algae without any problem 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.950
 Finally, well, this dragon, I think 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.870
 who is trying to find good 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.600
 along with the minions trying to find 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.870
 50% yo before going up to the best for 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.330
 here or around here or I do not know or looking for these 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.220
 mines that the tower magicians does not arrive 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.959
 but hey everyone does it like you 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.000
 and even the reality so bad here I have 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.070
 two traps two red balloons I make them 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.310
 -2 the old one is giving you the 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.770
 dragon in short is an army if I do not 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.210
 I came to the mountains, pigs that did not 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.610
 he came to fix very well where he has 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.730
 thrown an army of choice I swear if 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.530
 between three pigs two henchmen a 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.900
 dragon that will only cost more than 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.120
 30,000 and all the rest of the army a 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.100
 army of several hundred thousand of 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.600
 total elixir looks at what has been 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.910
 I took 30 icsid I swear I had 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.060
 in the perforated that barely occurs covers 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.500
 a pig mountain for nine drinks then yes 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.570
 that it's true to do revenge and 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.010
 it had the village totally devastated but 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.020
 If you do not take a hole, then I'll 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.290
 has given me perfectly 20 against 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.110
 to mention 50% that's my way of uploading 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.650
 and well you see that the village defends 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.720
 very well against very superior enemies 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.090
 I really like the design that has 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.350
 and as you can well now what 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.560
 I'm doing directly upload 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.830
 wall to have it all the block of the 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.860
 medium to level 7 and good from there 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.690
 once you have the inner wall at level 7 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.300
 finish raising the defenses and then 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.310
 put your town hall while the 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.910
 the 8 or 10 days it takes I'm not 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.340
 safe 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.410
 I think there are 10 ends up as the 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.660
 outside wall because the traps are 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:41.420
 high level 3 3 4 in order this is the video 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.370
 today in the next I hope to make a 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.380
 new farming army if it does not pass 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.150
 Nothing I hope you liked and not 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.150
