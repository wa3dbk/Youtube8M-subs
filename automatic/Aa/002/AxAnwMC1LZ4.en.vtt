00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
the way its am aware you use an on

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.310 
the way its am aware you use an on
screen<00:00:35.700> recorder<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:38.960> for<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.020> actual<00:00:40.290> game

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
screen recorder and for the actual game

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.810 
screen recorder and for the actual game
you<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.710> use<00:00:40.860> obviously<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> game

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you just use obviously in the game

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.540 
you just use obviously in the game
capture<00:00:42.270> software<00:00:43.160> but<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.219> don't<00:00:44.340> actually

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
capture software but you don't actually

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.549 
capture software but you don't actually
use<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.390> game<00:00:45.539> capture<00:00:45.750> software<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.410> just

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
use the game capture software you just

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.940 
use the game capture software you just
use<00:00:46.680> your<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> screen<00:00:47.100> recorder<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> record

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
use your on screen recorder to record

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.650 
use your on screen recorder to record
basically<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> screen<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.480> should

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
basically the screen then you should

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.150 
basically the screen then you should
usually<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.110> focus<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:52.860> point

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
usually just focus on the one point

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.119 
usually just focus on the one point
where<00:00:54.289> well<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.559> window<00:00:55.890> what<00:00:56.039> you

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
where well the one window what you

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.139 
where well the one window what you
focused<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:58.100> and<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.399> video<00:00:59.699> we'll

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
focused on and this this video we'll

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.610 
focused on and this this video we'll
stick<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.449> will<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.750> because<00:01:00.870> someone<00:01:01.379> into

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
stick it will be because someone into

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.469 
stick it will be because someone into
softwares<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.219> once<00:01:03.769> but<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.820> main<00:01:05.970> reason<00:01:06.000> i

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
softwares at once but the main reason i

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.179 
softwares at once but the main reason i
am<00:01:06.600> doing<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.770> find<00:01:08.010> out<00:01:08.130> what

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
am doing this is to find out what

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.550 
am doing this is to find out what
settings<00:01:08.670> i<00:01:08.729> need<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.000> tweak<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> walk

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
settings i need to tweak and walk

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:22.120 
settings i need to tweak and walk
volume<00:01:12.490> levels<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.090> etc

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.069 

so<00:01:22.700> as<00:01:22.790> you<00:01:22.880> can<00:01:23.030> see<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:23.750> not<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.930> best

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:24.079 
so as you can see it's not the best

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.830 
so as you can see it's not the best
capture<00:01:24.619> card<00:01:24.829> over<00:01:25.100> but<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.640> am<00:01:26.570> planning<00:01:26.810> to

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
capture card over but I am planning to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.200 
capture card over but I am planning to
get<00:01:27.079> a<00:01:27.189> quite<00:01:28.189> a<00:01:28.219> good<00:01:28.399> one<00:01:28.520> eventually<00:01:28.759> but

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
get a quite a good one eventually but

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.279 
get a quite a good one eventually but
this<00:01:29.390> is<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.539> reason<00:01:29.689> why<00:01:29.869> I'm<00:01:29.930> doing<00:01:29.990> the

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
this is the reason why I'm doing the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.029 
this is the reason why I'm doing the
video<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.399> forget<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.729> settings<00:01:32.060> right

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
video so I forget the settings right

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:34.990 
video so I forget the settings right
know<00:01:34.039> that<00:01:34.220> I<00:01:34.250> can<00:01:34.399> actually<00:01:34.490> be<00:01:34.759> able<00:01:34.850> to

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
know that I can actually be able to

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.319 
know that I can actually be able to
record<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:35.600> without<00:01:35.840> any<00:01:36.829> problems<00:01:37.429> there

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
record it without any problems there

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.639 
record it without any problems there
will<00:01:38.450> probably<00:01:38.479> be<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.899> letterbox<00:01:39.200> you're<00:01:39.530> not

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
will probably be a letterbox you're not

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.969 
will probably be a letterbox you're not
window<00:01:39.950> boxing<00:01:40.399> or<00:01:40.490> whether<00:01:40.640> you<00:01:40.759> call<00:01:40.939> it

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
window boxing or whether you call it

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.529 
window boxing or whether you call it
what<00:01:42.979> usually<00:01:43.130> can<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.610> can<00:01:43.880> usually<00:01:44.000> tag<00:01:44.390> the

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
what usually can you can usually tag the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.380 
what usually can you can usually tag the
video<00:01:44.840> with<00:01:45.140> them<00:01:45.259> a<00:01:45.549> stretch<00:01:46.549> tag<00:01:46.880> which

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
video with them a stretch tag which

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.200 
video with them a stretch tag which
means<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.810> video<00:01:48.079> stretch<00:01:48.560> later<00:01:49.210> shouldn't

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
means the video stretch later shouldn't

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.819 
means the video stretch later shouldn't
be<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.509> much<00:01:50.720> window<00:01:51.200> box<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.560> look<00:01:51.619> might

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
be that much window box and look might

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.950 
be that much window box and look might
be<00:01:52.009> a<00:01:52.039> little<00:01:52.189> bit<00:01:52.399> but<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.299> reduces<00:01:53.840> the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
be a little bit but that reduces the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.240 
be a little bit but that reduces the
quality<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:56.750> plate<00:01:56.990> I'm<00:01:57.830> not<00:01:57.950> tip<00:01:58.130> about

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
quality so the plate I'm not tip about

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.740 
quality so the plate I'm not tip about
the<00:01:58.490> quality<00:01:58.849> though<00:01:58.939> because<00:01:59.060> its<00:01:59.240> many<00:01:59.479> for

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
the quality though because its many for

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.080 
the quality though because its many for
light<00:01:59.899> just<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:00.979> watch<00:02:01.130> back<00:02:01.429> at<00:02:01.640> light<00:02:01.819> and

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
light just to watch back at light and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.830 
light just to watch back at light and
laugh<00:02:02.810> at<00:02:02.959> the<00:02:03.049> good<00:02:03.229> memories<00:02:03.500> we<00:02:04.009> have

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
