a minute the two flags and finally his
sword<00:00:43.110> weapon<00:00:43.710> now<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> reason<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
sword weapon now the reason we have the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.660 
sword weapon now the reason we have the
two<00:00:45.300> guns<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.989> because<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> DJ<00:00:47.039> gun<00:00:47.250> in<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
two guns is because the DJ gun in the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.000 
two guns is because the DJ gun in the
show<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.180> normally<00:00:48.660> shot<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.170> fired<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.739> this

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
show is normally shot and fired in this

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.360 
show is normally shot and fired in this
form<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.910> his<00:00:51.660> trumpet<00:00:52.199> or<00:00:52.350> triumph<00:00:52.829> form

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
form it's his trumpet or triumph form

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.910 
form it's his trumpet or triumph form
then<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.510> also<00:00:54.750> combine<00:00:55.230> with<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.590> soar

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
then it can also combine with the soar

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.010 
then it can also combine with the soar
flipping<00:00:56.550> out<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.850> stock<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.510> then<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
flipping out the stock and then the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.099 
flipping out the stock and then the
sword<00:00:58.289> itself<00:00:58.680> can<00:00:59.100> slide<00:00:59.460> right<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.270> into<00:01:00.660> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
sword itself can slide right up into it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.860 
sword itself can slide right up into it

same well no I take that back the legs
are<00:02:09.810> slightly<00:02:10.709> different

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
are slightly different

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.980 
are slightly different
painted<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.120> different

shades<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.380> gold<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.790> back<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.120> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
shades of gold and the back of the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.640 
shades of gold and the back of the
figures<00:02:15.480> they're<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> same<00:02:16.410> they're

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
figures they're the same they're

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.220 
figures they're the same they're
basically<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.250> same<00:02:17.280> molds<00:02:17.910> just<00:02:18.900> some<00:02:19.020> minor

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
basically the same molds just some minor

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.710 
basically the same molds just some minor
differences<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:20.330> taking<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> look<00:02:21.480> at<00:02:21.630> the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
differences and taking a look at the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.530 
differences and taking a look at the
arms<00:02:22.080> themselves<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.830> can<00:02:22.950> see<00:02:23.160> they<00:02:23.340> are

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
arms themselves you can see they are

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.670 
arms themselves you can see they are
completely<00:02:24.540> not<00:02:24.720> really<00:02:25.020> different<00:02:25.440> and

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
completely not really different and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.620 
completely not really different and
that's<00:02:25.920> primarily<00:02:26.250> because<00:02:26.670> they<00:02:26.970> well<00:02:27.330> one

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
that's primarily because they well one

that's primarily because they well one

the kata Kochi the kaca doki arms is
much<00:02:30.090> larger<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.680> way<00:02:31.800> they<00:02:32.010> actually

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
much larger and to the way they actually

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.550 
much larger and to the way they actually
form<00:02:32.880> up<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.510> figures<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:34.080> completely

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
form up on the figures is completely

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.970 
form up on the figures is completely
different

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980

this<00:02:35.340> guy<00:02:35.490> just<00:02:35.550> drops<00:02:35.970> directly<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.690> head

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
this guy just drops directly on the head

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.460 
this guy just drops directly on the head
and<00:02:37.260> then<00:02:37.680> unfolds<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.700> one<00:02:38.970> unfolds<00:02:39.540> mm

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and then unfolds this one unfolds mm

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.860 
and then unfolds this one unfolds mm
pretty<00:02:40.800> much<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.400> way<00:02:41.520> first<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.240> then

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
pretty much all the way first and then

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.740 
pretty much all the way first and then
attach<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.800> this<00:02:44.370> one's<00:02:44.640> more<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:44.970> mango

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
attach it so this one's more like mango

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.440 
attach it so this one's more like mango
than<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.170> is<00:02:46.320> orange<00:02:46.740> now<00:02:47.730> I'll<00:02:47.940> be<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.240> first

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
than it is orange now I'll be the first

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.300 
than it is orange now I'll be the first
to<00:02:48.690> admit<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.200> transformation<00:02:50.040> for<00:02:50.250> this

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
to admit this transformation for this

to admit this transformation for this
arms<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.480> little<00:02:51.960> bit<00:02:52.080> nuts<00:02:52.380> we're<00:02:53.070> going<00:02:53.190> to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
arms is a little bit nuts we're going to

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.520 
arms is a little bit nuts we're going to
move<00:02:53.400> dime<00:02:53.910> off<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> side<00:02:54.750> here<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.320> then

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
move dime off to the side here and then

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.680 
move dime off to the side here and then
just<00:02:55.860> come<00:02:56.490> to<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.700> sides<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.210> orange<00:02:57.570> and

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
just come to the sides of the orange and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.130 
just come to the sides of the orange and
unpack<00:02:58.380> these<00:02:59.040> front<00:02:59.490> panels<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.840> then<00:03:00.990> you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
unpack these front panels and then you

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.050 
unpack these front panels and then you
can<00:03:01.290> open<00:03:01.530> up<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:01.950> top<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.490> orange<00:03:02.670> and

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
can open up the top of the orange and

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.020 
can open up the top of the orange and
just<00:03:03.720> start<00:03:04.020> folding<00:03:04.530> things<00:03:04.950> out<00:03:05.250> come<00:03:05.820> to

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
just start folding things out come to

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.370 
just start folding things out come to
the<00:03:06.120> bottom<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.570> orange<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.900> unpack

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
the bottom of the orange and unpack

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.740 
the bottom of the orange and unpack
these<00:03:07.620> two<00:03:07.890> pieces<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.240> will<00:03:09.450> allow<00:03:09.690> you

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
these two pieces and that will allow you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.500 
these two pieces and that will allow you
to<00:03:09.930> fold<00:03:10.230> everything<00:03:11.100> out<00:03:11.250> like<00:03:11.520> this<00:03:11.760> and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
to fold everything out like this and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.000 
to fold everything out like this and
then<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.350> going<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.560> be<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.770> front<00:03:13.920> of

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
then this is going to be the front of

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.550 
then this is going to be the front of
the<00:03:14.130> orange<00:03:14.430> here's<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.820> head<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:16.200> front<00:03:16.470> of

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
the orange here's the head the front of

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.520 
the orange here's the head the front of
the<00:03:16.680> orc<00:03:16.950> I'm<00:03:17.160> sorry<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.460> front<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.910> the

the orc I'm sorry the front of the the
arms<00:03:19.730> fold<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:21.000> up<00:03:21.210> and<00:03:21.420> around<00:03:22.340> unpick<00:03:23.340> the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
arms fold this up and around unpick the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.120 
arms fold this up and around unpick the
side<00:03:24.060> skirts<00:03:24.570> here<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.230> they<00:03:25.710> do<00:03:25.770> have<00:03:26.100> a

side skirts here and they do have a
tendency<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.610> pop<00:03:26.910> off<00:03:27.120> pretty<00:03:27.570> easily<00:03:27.870> but

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
tendency to pop off pretty easily but

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.740 
tendency to pop off pretty easily but
they<00:03:28.980> will<00:03:29.280> go<00:03:29.490> back<00:03:29.700> on<00:03:29.730> with<00:03:30.180> no<00:03:30.330> trouble

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
they will go back on with no trouble

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.620 
they will go back on with no trouble
then<00:03:31.740> take<00:03:32.010> these<00:03:32.160> shoulder<00:03:32.580> bits<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.090> flip

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
then take these shoulder bits and flip

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.680 
then take these shoulder bits and flip
them<00:03:33.840> around<00:03:34.910> then<00:03:35.910> we<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.210> put<00:03:36.390> them<00:03:36.510> on

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
them around then we can put them on

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.490 
them around then we can put them on
again<00:03:37.020> here<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:39.030> drop<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.570> down<00:03:39.840> onto<00:03:40.110> gaim

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
again here so drop that down onto gaim

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.930 
again here so drop that down onto gaim
and<00:03:41.930> just<00:03:42.930> work<00:03:43.230> everything<00:03:43.770> into<00:03:44.430> place<00:03:44.610> ah
