00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
says hey Ryan what do you think of

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.339 
says hey Ryan what do you think of
programs<00:02:07.850> like<00:02:08.209> five<00:02:08.450> by<00:02:08.629> five<00:02:08.780> strong<00:02:09.080> list

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
programs like five by five strong list

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.350 
programs like five by five strong list
and<00:02:09.560> jim<00:02:09.739> wendler<00:02:09.950> 531<00:02:10.759> are<00:02:10.879> they<00:02:10.970> worth<00:02:11.180> doing

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
and jim wendler 531 are they worth doing

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.390 
and jim wendler 531 are they worth doing
from<00:02:11.599> muscle<00:02:11.900> mass<00:02:12.049> or<00:02:12.290> just<00:02:12.620> pure<00:02:12.950> strength

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
from muscle mass or just pure strength

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.729 
from muscle mass or just pure strength
yeah<00:02:13.909> these<00:02:14.090> are<00:02:14.150> great<00:02:14.420> programs<00:02:14.659> for<00:02:15.590> both

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
yeah these are great programs for both

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.589 
yeah these are great programs for both
from<00:02:16.069> putting<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.400> mass<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.939> strength<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.510> if

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
from putting on mass and strength and if

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.880 
from putting on mass and strength and if
they're<00:02:17.780> also<00:02:17.959> great<00:02:18.230> because<00:02:18.319> they're<00:02:18.680> very

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
they're also great because they're very

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.369 
they're also great because they're very
simple<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.580> that's<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.150> whole<00:02:20.299> point<00:02:20.480> one<00:02:21.290> of

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
simple and that's the whole point one of

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.220 
simple and that's the whole point one of
the<00:02:21.470> big<00:02:21.680> challenges<00:02:21.950> when<00:02:22.909> it<00:02:22.939> comes

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
the big challenges when it comes

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.110 
the big challenges when it comes
working<00:02:23.590> out<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:23.800> everyone<00:02:24.700> wants<00:02:24.879> to<00:02:24.940> say

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
working out is everyone wants to say

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.970 
working out is everyone wants to say
there's<00:02:25.420> like<00:02:25.480> some<00:02:25.750> super<00:02:26.080> big<00:02:26.230> secret<00:02:26.650> or<00:02:26.680> we

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
there's like some super big secret or we

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.830 
there's like some super big secret or we
need<00:02:27.129> to<00:02:27.250> do<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.519> crazy<00:02:27.879> complex<00:02:28.360> routine

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
need to do this crazy complex routine

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.530 
need to do this crazy complex routine
and<00:02:29.140> that's<00:02:29.920> not<00:02:30.099> necessary<00:02:30.670> at<00:02:30.970> all<00:02:31.269> and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
and that's not necessary at all and

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.869 
and that's not necessary at all and
especially<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.530> you're<00:02:32.680> newer<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.549> can<00:02:33.730> do

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
especially if you're newer you can do

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.089 
especially if you're newer you can do
even<00:02:34.299> less<00:02:34.420> work<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:34.989> get<00:02:35.709> better<00:02:35.890> results

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
even less work and get better results

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.009 
even less work and get better results
just<00:02:36.489> because<00:02:36.700> your<00:02:36.849> body<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.299> not<00:02:37.629> used<00:02:37.870> to

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
just because your body is not used to

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.990 
just because your body is not used to
working<00:02:38.379> out<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:39.159> those<00:02:39.489> are<00:02:39.519> great<00:02:39.819> programs

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
working out so those are great programs

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.850 
working out so those are great programs
I<00:02:40.390> would<00:02:40.510> also<00:02:40.629> recommend<00:02:40.750> starting<00:02:41.440> strength

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
I would also recommend starting strength

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.680 
I would also recommend starting strength
that's<00:02:42.099> another<00:02:42.310> good<00:02:42.549> program<00:02:42.940> keeping<00:02:43.660> a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
that's another good program keeping a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.240 
that's another good program keeping a
nice<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.080> simple<00:02:44.260> getting<00:02:44.650> us<00:02:44.799> on<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> straight

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
nice and simple getting us on a straight

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.650 
nice and simple getting us on a straight
line<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.670> get<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:45.910> real<00:02:46.090> results<00:02:46.510> by<00:02:46.629> using
