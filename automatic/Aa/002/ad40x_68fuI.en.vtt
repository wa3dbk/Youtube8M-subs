hello<00:00:03.179> we<00:00:03.689> are<00:00:03.840> playing<00:00:04.170> Minecraft<00:00:05.160> so<00:00:05.940> in<00:00:06.029> the

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
hello we are playing Minecraft so in the

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.450 
hello we are playing Minecraft so in the
last<00:00:06.240> bit<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.540> video<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.990> saw<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:08.040> guy<00:00:08.220> saw<00:00:08.429> me

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
last bit of video you saw the guy saw me

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.900 
last bit of video you saw the guy saw me
build<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:09.380> 10-block<00:00:10.380> hi<00:00:10.620> clock<00:00:11.280> tower<00:00:11.610> that

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
build a 10-block hi clock tower that

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.480 
build a 10-block hi clock tower that
basically<00:00:12.269> dropped<00:00:12.540> one<00:00:12.840> piece<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.259> gravel

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
basically dropped one piece of gravel

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.590 
basically dropped one piece of gravel
each<00:00:14.490> second<00:00:15.179> now<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.070> mechanism<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.880> tower

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
each second now the mechanism that tower

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.380 
each second now the mechanism that tower
used<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.680> basically<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.490> giant<00:00:20.699> version<00:00:21.000> of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
used was basically a giant version of

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.700 
used was basically a giant version of
this<00:00:22.550> where<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.789> gravel<00:00:24.210> would<00:00:24.330> drop<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:24.779> once

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
this where a gravel would drop one once

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.950 
this where a gravel would drop one once
per<00:00:25.890> second<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.609> base<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.090> piston<00:00:27.869> will

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
per second on to the base a piston will

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.769 
per second on to the base a piston will
push<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.260> out<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> way<00:00:29.480> another<00:00:30.480> person

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
push it out of the way another person

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.299 
push it out of the way another person
will<00:00:30.900> push<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.170> up<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.590> out<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.830> way<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
will push it up and out of the way and

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.790 
will push it up and out of the way and
this<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:32.910> repeat<00:00:33.270> until<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.469> gravel

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
this would repeat until the gravel

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.459 
this would repeat until the gravel
reaches<00:00:35.160> 10<00:00:35.430> block<00:00:36.079> reaches<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.260> height<00:00:37.440> of

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
reaches 10 block reaches the height of

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.130 
reaches 10 block reaches the height of
10<00:00:37.770> blocks<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.280> where<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.420> will<00:00:39.570> drop<00:00:39.960> back

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
10 blocks and where it will drop back

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.270 
10 blocks and where it will drop back
down<00:00:40.670> now<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:43.850> if<00:00:45.200> we<00:00:46.280> repeat

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
down now as you can see if we repeat

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.740 
down now as you can see if we repeat
this<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.940> let's<00:00:48.719> see<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.640> that's<00:00:50.750> how

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
this for like let's see here that's how

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.310 
this for like let's see here that's how
high<00:00:51.930> does<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.199> push<00:00:53.660> now<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.899> multiply

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
high does it push now if we multiply

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.470 
high does it push now if we multiply
this<00:00:55.379> system<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:58.190> 10<00:00:59.190> times<00:00:59.520> up<00:01:00.000> into<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this system by like 10 times up into the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.170 
this system by like 10 times up into the
air<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.430> we're<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> have

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
air you can see that we're going to have

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.950 
air you can see that we're going to have
a<00:01:03.210> lot<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.480> redstone<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.140> piston<00:01:04.949> problems

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
a lot of redstone and piston problems

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.210 
a lot of redstone and piston problems
the<00:01:06.960> problem<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.590> saw<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:07.950> video

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the problem that you saw in the video

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.260 
the problem that you saw in the video
was<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.979> blocks<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.670> sometimes

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
was that the blocks with sometimes

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
was that the blocks with sometimes
disappear<00:01:14.990> because<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.470> pistons<00:01:17.100> were

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
disappear because the pistons were

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.780 
disappear because the pistons were
glitching<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:19.490> basically<00:01:20.490> there<00:01:20.729> was

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
glitching out and basically there was

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.550 
glitching out and basically there was
too<00:01:20.970> much<00:01:21.090> happening<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.600> once<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> game

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
too much happening at once and the game

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
too much happening at once and the game
couldn't<00:01:22.920> handle<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.900> now<00:01:25.460> someone<00:01:26.460> called<00:01:26.700> CS

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
couldn't handle it now someone called CS

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.030 
couldn't handle it now someone called CS
DD<00:01:27.600> commented<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.680> said<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.950> he

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
DD commented on that and said that he

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.210 
DD commented on that and said that he
could<00:01:29.220> build<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.460> simpler<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.950> used<00:01:31.950> less

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
could build a simpler one that used less

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.789 
could build a simpler one that used less
pistons<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:33.000> dress<00:01:33.600> red<00:01:33.869> stone<00:01:34.579> I<00:01:36.799> actually

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
pistons and I dress red stone I actually

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.910 
pistons and I dress red stone I actually
know<00:01:38.250> what<00:01:39.170> he's<00:01:40.170> actually<00:01:40.380> talking<00:01:40.680> about

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
know what he's actually talking about

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.550 
know what he's actually talking about
without<00:01:41.310> him<00:01:41.490> describing<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.320> think<00:01:43.320> he's

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
without him describing I think he's

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.480 
without him describing I think he's
talking<00:01:43.740> about<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.520> where<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.600> have

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
talking about this where you have

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.520 
talking about this where you have
these<00:01:47.210> two<00:01:47.450> pistons<00:01:48.729> pushing<00:01:49.780> so<00:01:50.780> a<00:01:51.140> block<00:01:51.380> of

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
these two pistons pushing so a block of

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.319 
these two pistons pushing so a block of
Bravo<00:01:51.799> drops<00:01:52.040> onto<00:01:52.189> this<00:01:52.280> piston<00:01:52.820> and<00:01:53.000> then

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
Bravo drops onto this piston and then

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:59.469 
Bravo drops onto this piston and then
this<00:01:54.049> piston<00:01:54.470> pushes<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:57.590> drop<00:01:57.979> gravel<00:01:58.549> enter

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
this piston pushes the drop gravel enter

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.120 
this piston pushes the drop gravel enter
this<00:01:59.630> empty<00:02:00.020> space<00:02:00.610> created<00:02:01.610> by<00:02:01.820> this<00:02:01.880> piston

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
this empty space created by this piston

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:13.930 
this empty space created by this piston
now<00:02:04.810> as<00:02:05.830> you<00:02:06.830> can<00:02:06.920> see<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:07.220> works<00:02:12.519> some<00:02:13.519> piston

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
now as you can see it works some piston

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.199 
now as you can see it works some piston
glitching<00:02:14.330> there<00:02:14.510> as<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.410> see<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.739> works

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
glitching there as you can see it works

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.430 
glitching there as you can see it works
now<00:02:17.209> actually<00:02:17.630> thought<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.900> this<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.380> I

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
now actually thought of this but I

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.830 
now actually thought of this but I
thought<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.459> wouldn't<00:02:19.760> work<00:02:20.000> because<00:02:20.600> I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
thought that it wouldn't work because I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.199 
thought that it wouldn't work because I
I<00:02:21.290> knew<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:21.860> gravel<00:02:22.430> was<00:02:22.580> affected<00:02:23.090> by

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
I knew that gravel was affected by

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.180 
I knew that gravel was affected by
gravity<00:02:23.680> now<00:02:24.680> gravity<00:02:25.540> means<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
gravity now gravity means that the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.080 
gravity now gravity means that the
object<00:02:28.910> has<00:02:29.660> constant<00:02:30.200> acceleration<00:02:31.090> which

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
object has constant acceleration which

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.270 
object has constant acceleration which
means<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.959> moment<00:02:33.440> that<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:33.799> piston

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
means that the moment that this piston

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.880 
means that the moment that this piston
lets<00:02:34.549> go<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.420> gravel<00:02:35.840> up<00:02:35.989> in<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.230> air<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
lets go of the gravel up in the air the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.330 
lets go of the gravel up in the air the
gravel<00:02:37.280> will<00:02:37.400> start<00:02:37.610> traveling<00:02:38.000> downward<00:02:38.450> and

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
gravel will start traveling downward and

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.370 
gravel will start traveling downward and
it<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.790> traveling<00:02:41.180> down<00:02:41.360> word<00:02:41.600> that<00:02:42.110> means

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
it is traveling down word that means

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.250 
it is traveling down word that means
that<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.890> piston<00:02:43.510> will<00:02:44.510> be<00:02:44.630> pushing<00:02:44.900> a

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
that this piston will be pushing a

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.740 
that this piston will be pushing a
gravel<00:02:45.860> into<00:02:46.069> another<00:02:46.700> rapper<00:02:46.970> block<00:02:47.269> which

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
gravel into another rapper block which

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.290 
gravel into another rapper block which
can't<00:02:48.110> happen

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.170 

it<00:02:53.300> would<00:02:53.420> be<00:02:53.540> basically<00:02:53.920> like<00:02:54.920> be<00:02:55.760> like<00:02:55.790> doing

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
it would be basically like be like doing

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:04.840 
it would be basically like be like doing
this<00:02:56.890> from<00:02:57.890> a<00:03:00.010> conceptual<00:03:01.390> view<00:03:02.390> now<00:03:03.350> I<00:03:03.850> just

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
this from a conceptual view now I just

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.180 
this from a conceptual view now I just
realized<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:05.660> minecraft<00:03:06.020> physics<00:03:06.950> isn't

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
realized that minecraft physics isn't

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.780 
realized that minecraft physics isn't
real<00:03:07.820> physics<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:09.650> blocks<00:03:09.890> actually<00:03:10.220> freeze

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
real physics the blocks actually freeze

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.820 
real physics the blocks actually freeze
in<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.150> air<00:03:11.330> if<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.540> let<00:03:11.690> go<00:03:11.870> of<00:03:11.960> them<00:03:13.600> as<00:03:14.830> you

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
in the air if you let go of them as you

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.300 
in the air if you let go of them as you
can<00:03:15.980> see<00:03:16.160> there's<00:03:16.430> little<00:03:17.200> moment<00:03:18.200> where<00:03:19.010> the

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
can see there's little moment where the

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.800 
can see there's little moment where the
block<00:03:19.550> just<00:03:19.730> freezes<00:03:20.240> in<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.360> air<00:03:20.480> and

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
block just freezes in the air and

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.890 
block just freezes in the air and
doesn't<00:03:21.140> start<00:03:21.830> falling<00:03:22.280> until<00:03:23.000> after<00:03:23.360> like<00:03:23.690> a

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
doesn't start falling until after like a

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.420 
doesn't start falling until after like a
while<00:03:26.530> now<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:27.710> is<00:03:27.830> only<00:03:28.010> something<00:03:28.280> that

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
while now this is only something that

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.950 
while now this is only something that
happens<00:03:28.850> in<00:03:28.970> Minecraft<00:03:29.420> are<00:03:29.570> not<00:03:29.690> in<00:03:29.810> real

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
happens in Minecraft are not in real

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.140 
happens in Minecraft are not in real
life<00:03:29.990> I<00:03:30.500> thought<00:03:31.100> minecraft<00:03:31.610> has<00:03:31.730> real<00:03:31.940> life

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
life I thought minecraft has real life

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.840 
life I thought minecraft has real life
for<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.600> bit<00:03:32.870> there<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:34.130> I<00:03:34.520> thought<00:03:34.700> it

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
for a bit there and I thought it

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.950 
for a bit there and I thought it
wouldn't<00:03:35.150> work<00:03:35.480> so<00:03:36.850> now<00:03:37.850> I<00:03:37.880> have<00:03:38.210> built<00:03:38.750> a

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
wouldn't work so now I have built a

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.650 
wouldn't work so now I have built a
revised<00:03:39.950> version<00:03:41.200> that's<00:03:42.200> better<00:03:42.740> and<00:03:43.660> that

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
revised version that's better and that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.990 
revised version that's better and that
uses<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.200> system<00:03:45.380> over<00:03:45.890> here<00:03:48.520> as<00:03:49.520> you<00:03:49.970> can

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
uses this system over here as you can

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.440 
uses this system over here as you can
see<00:03:50.120> blocks<00:03:50.870> drop<00:03:51.140> it<00:03:51.320> 10<00:03:51.860> blocks<00:03:52.270> once<00:03:53.270> per

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
see blocks drop it 10 blocks once per

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.160 
see blocks drop it 10 blocks once per
second<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.950> if<00:03:55.730> we<00:03:55.760> come<00:03:56.120> back<00:03:56.300> here<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:56.690> can

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
second and if we come back here you can

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.310 
second and if we come back here you can
see<00:03:57.709> that<00:03:58.300> it<00:03:59.300> uses<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.690> same<00:03:59.780> system<00:04:00.290> that

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
see that it uses the same system that

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.800 
see that it uses the same system that
you<00:04:00.530> see<00:04:00.709> over<00:04:00.740> there<00:04:01.959> for<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.320> used<00:04:03.790> a

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
you see over there for this I used a

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.350 
you see over there for this I used a
piston<00:04:05.810> clock<00:04:06.280> because<00:04:07.280> it's<00:04:07.459> more<00:04:08.150> stable

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
piston clock because it's more stable

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.330 
piston clock because it's more stable
you<00:04:08.930> can<00:04:08.959> stop<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:09.530> whenever<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:09.830> want<00:04:09.920> and

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
you can stop it whenever you want and

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.460 
you can stop it whenever you want and
keep<00:04:10.940> going<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:13.480> this<00:04:14.480> is<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:15.050> piston<00:04:15.440> that

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
keep going and this is the piston that

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.550 
keep going and this is the piston that
pushes<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:16.100> books<00:04:16.340> off<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:16.970> column

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.870 

and<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.750> yeah<00:04:23.169> we<00:04:23.560> now<00:04:23.740> have<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.040> simpler<00:04:24.610> more

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
and so yeah we now have a simpler more

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.640 
and so yeah we now have a simpler more
efficient<00:04:25.870> clock<00:04:26.380> tower<00:04:26.710> as<00:04:27.010> CS<00:04:27.760> DD<00:04:28.150> suggested

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.409 

thanks<00:04:32.650> for<00:04:32.770> letting<00:04:33.040> me<00:04:33.190> know<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.940> can

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
thanks for letting me know that I can

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.540 
thanks for letting me know that I can
actually<00:04:34.900> do<00:04:35.080> this<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.160> minecraft

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
actually do this and that minecraft

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:44.090 
actually do this and that minecraft
physics<00:04:37.180> is<00:04:37.330> in<00:04:37.480> real<00:04:37.990> life<00:04:38.230> physics<00:04:41.970> so<00:04:42.970> yeah

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
physics is in real life physics so yeah

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.620 
physics is in real life physics so yeah
