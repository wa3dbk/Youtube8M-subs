no it's the coconuts that fall from the

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.359 
no it's the coconuts that fall from the
trees<00:00:16.330> pineapples<00:00:17.230> actually<00:00:17.650> grow<00:00:17.890> from<00:00:18.250> the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
trees pineapples actually grow from the

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.279 
trees pineapples actually grow from the
ground<00:00:18.400> and<00:00:18.849> your<00:00:19.240> pineapple<00:00:19.929> should<00:00:20.140> be

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
ground and your pineapple should be

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.650 
ground and your pineapple should be
relatively<00:00:20.740> green<00:00:21.250> when<00:00:21.670> you<00:00:21.789> buy<00:00:22.000> it<00:00:22.029> it<00:00:22.359> will

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
relatively green when you buy it it will

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.529 
relatively green when you buy it it will
get<00:00:22.869> more<00:00:23.170> yellow<00:00:23.710> as<00:00:23.920> it<00:00:24.160> ripens<00:00:24.400> we<00:00:25.119> can<00:00:25.300> tell

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
get more yellow as it ripens we can tell

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.689 
get more yellow as it ripens we can tell
because<00:00:25.750> it<00:00:26.019> ripens<00:00:26.439> from<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.830> root<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.310> the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
because it ripens from the root and the

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.089 
because it ripens from the root and the
bottom<00:00:28.089> through<00:00:28.750> the<00:00:28.990> top<00:00:29.230> so<00:00:29.589> if<00:00:29.800> you<00:00:29.890> get<00:00:30.039> a

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
but this route in the middle of it is

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.039 
but this route in the middle of it is
very<00:01:23.500> chalky<00:01:23.920> a<00:01:24.130> very<00:01:24.670> stocky<00:01:25.060> very<00:01:25.509> difficult

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
very chalky a very stocky very difficult

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.569 
very chalky a very stocky very difficult
so<00:01:26.439> the<00:01:26.560> first<00:01:26.799> thing<00:01:26.890> I'm<00:01:27.070> going<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.220> do<00:01:27.369> is

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.780 
so the first thing I'm going to do is
just<00:01:27.759> cut<00:01:28.060> across<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.869> apex<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.790> that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
just cut across the apex of that

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.910 
just cut across the apex of that
pineapple<00:01:31.090> there<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:31.689> get<00:01:31.869> rid<00:01:32.079> of<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.350> that

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
pineapple there and get rid of that that

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.249 
pineapple there and get rid of that that
root<00:01:33.220> end<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:34.149> now<00:01:34.360> I've<00:01:34.659> got<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:34.990> really

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
root end so now I've got this really

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.670 
root end so now I've got this really
nice<00:01:35.619> flavorful<00:01:36.579> fruit<00:01:37.119> here<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.689> the<00:01:38.229> skin

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
nice flavorful fruit here and the skin

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.950 
nice flavorful fruit here and the skin
is<00:01:38.710> where<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.369> eyes<00:01:39.549> are<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:40.030> tough<00:01:40.509> chewy

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
is where the eyes are the tough chewy

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.350 
is where the eyes are the tough chewy
eyes<00:01:41.350> so<00:01:42.009> I'm<00:01:42.100> going<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.280> make<00:01:42.490> one<00:01:42.520> slit

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360
