00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
away cuz it sounded like a cool concept

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.850

like<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.390> was<00:00:42.480> an<00:00:42.570> ok<00:00:42.870> concept<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.620> seemed

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
like it was an ok concept but it seemed

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.440 
like it was an ok concept but it seemed
like<00:00:44.070> when<00:00:44.460> everyone<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:44.910> actually<00:00:45.239> trying

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
like when everyone was actually trying

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.209 
like when everyone was actually trying
it<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.750> trying<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.289> break<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.860> game<00:00:47.039> by

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
it and trying to like break the game by

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.069 
it and trying to like break the game by
putting<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.610> really<00:00:47.879> weird<00:00:48.090> words<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.899> still

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
putting in really weird words it's still

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.020 
putting in really weird words it's still
work<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.010> strength<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.789> title

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
work that is the strength of this title

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.389 
work that is the strength of this title
basically<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.809> split<00:00:52.620> into<00:00:52.649> two<00:00:52.980> parts<00:00:53.309> or

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
basically it's split into two parts or

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.760 
basically it's split into two parts or
adventure<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.140> action<00:00:55.140> i<00:00:55.469> think<00:00:55.649> they're

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
adventure and action i think they're

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.279 
adventure and action i think they're
called<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.910> essentially<00:00:57.750> need<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.109> do

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
called and you essentially need to do

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.840 
called and you essentially need to do
one<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.500> two<00:00:58.590> things<00:00:58.739> either<00:00:59.039> collect<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.550> star

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
one of two things either collect a star

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
one of two things either collect a star
right<00:01:00.059> which<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.899> bit<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.170> crayon

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
right which is a little bit like crayon

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.700 
right which is a little bit like crayon

you need to get to the objective in the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.520 
you need to get to the objective in the
example<00:01:09.150> i<00:01:09.240> saw<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.960> stark<00:01:10.290> or

example i saw it was a stark or

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.260 
example i saw it was a stark or
territory<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.460> need<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.939> put<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.240> words

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270

to<00:01:12.869> be<00:01:12.960> able<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.200> create<00:01:13.950> objects<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.760> game

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
to be able to create objects in game

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520 
to be able to create objects in game
using<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> in-game<00:01:15.540> library<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.320> able<00:01:16.409> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
using the in-game library to be able to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.050 
using the in-game library to be able to
get<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.830> Star<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:17.670> you're<00:01:17.759> basically

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
get that Star I think you're basically

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
get that Star I think you're basically
typing<00:01:18.420> any<00:01:18.720> word<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.320> long<00:01:19.439> as<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.890> a

trademark<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.729> anything<00:01:21.030> no

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
trademark it can be anything no

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.149 
trademark it can be anything no
trademarks<00:01:22.049> no<00:01:22.170> offensive<00:01:22.500> words<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
trademarks no offensive words so the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.620

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
first thing i tried to do with the star

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.240 
first thing i tried to do with the star
and<00:01:24.990> there<00:01:25.290> was<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> cat<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.830> well<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> was

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
and there was a cat as well that was

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
and there was a cat as well that was
caught<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> tree<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:27.659> used<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.960> frisbee<00:01:28.170> but

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
caught in a tree was used a frisbee but

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.719

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
down the tree for you some people want

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.440

pterodactyl and fly up to the star so

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.770 
pterodactyl and fly up to the star so
those<00:03:19.580> are<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.730> two<00:03:19.790> different<00:03:20.180> types<00:03:20.420> of

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
those are the two different types of

those are the two different types of
levels<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.650> we<00:03:21.769> have<00:03:21.950> so<00:03:22.580> any<00:03:22.850> object<00:03:23.209> you

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
levels that we have so any object you

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.440 
levels that we have so any object you
created<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:24.410> weapons<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.070> cars<00:03:25.450> they're

created like weapons and cars they're

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.199 
created like weapons and cars they're
all<00:03:26.570> tat<00:03:26.930> face<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.890> can<00:03:28.070> pick<00:03:28.760> up<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:29.000> sword

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
all tat face so you can pick up a sword

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.660 
all tat face so you can pick up a sword
and<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:29.600> tap<00:03:29.900> things<00:03:30.260> you<00:03:31.070> can<00:03:31.190> tap<00:03:31.400> like<00:03:31.640> a

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.190 
and you tap things you can tap like a
ladder<00:03:31.970> but<00:03:32.390> there's<00:03:32.600> two<00:03:32.750> different<00:03:32.959> things

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
ladder but there's two different things

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.090 
ladder but there's two different things
you<00:03:33.290> can<00:03:33.380> do<00:03:33.500> with<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.680> ladder<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:33.980> can

you can do with the ladder you can
either<00:03:34.190> climb<00:03:34.670> a<00:03:34.940> ladder<00:03:35.209> or<00:03:35.540> you<00:03:36.230> know<00:03:36.350> you

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
either climb a ladder or you know you

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.380 
either climb a ladder or you know you
know<00:03:36.950> hurt<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.370> ladder<00:03:37.549> with<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.880> sword<00:03:38.180> so

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
know hurt the ladder with the sword so

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.270

ultimate sandbox it's a it's a very
different<00:04:38.710> game<00:04:38.979> then<00:04:39.580> drawn<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:40.030> life

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
different game then drawn to life

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.550 
different game then drawn to life
because<00:04:40.389> drawn<00:04:40.599> to<00:04:40.720> life<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.990> definitely<00:04:41.169> more

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
because drawn to life is definitely more

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.129 
because drawn to life is definitely more
of<00:04:41.860> an<00:04:42.630> action-platformer<00:04:43.630> it's<00:04:43.840> very

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
of an action-platformer it's very

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.379 
of an action-platformer it's very
straightforward<00:04:44.440> in<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:44.919> sense<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:46.120> that's

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
straightforward in that sense and that's

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:47.939 
straightforward in that sense and that's
actually<00:04:46.599> drawing<00:04:47.110> where<00:04:47.380> this<00:04:47.560> is<00:04:47.770> you're

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
actually drawing where this is you're

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.170 
actually drawing where this is you're
just<00:04:47.979> summoning<00:04:48.550> something<00:04:48.849> in<00:04:48.940> your<00:04:49.030> head

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
just summoning something in your head

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.480 
just summoning something in your head
it's<00:04:49.330> actually<00:04:49.690> words<00:04:49.960> but<00:04:50.740> we've<00:04:51.009> worked

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
it's actually words but we've worked

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.409 
it's actually words but we've worked
with<00:04:51.759> our<00:04:52.419> technology<00:04:53.699> for<00:04:54.699> several<00:04:55.120> years<00:04:55.300> so

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
with our technology for several years so

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.480 
with our technology for several years so
we're<00:04:55.570> very<00:04:55.599> used<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.259> DSO<00:04:56.800> I<00:04:57.009> mean<00:04:57.340> there

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
we're very used to the DSO I mean there

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.770 
we're very used to the DSO I mean there
are<00:04:57.550> several<00:04:57.759> little<00:04:58.000> technical<00:04:58.479> lessons

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
are several little technical lessons

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.180 
are several little technical lessons
we've<00:04:58.900> learned<00:04:58.930> but<00:04:59.259> now<00:04:59.320> we've<00:04:59.560> refined<00:05:00.009> it

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
we've learned but now we've refined it

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.370 
we've learned but now we've refined it
to<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.310> point<00:05:00.550> where<00:05:00.610> we<00:05:00.820> can<00:05:01.000> do<00:05:01.270> a<00:05:01.300> game<00:05:01.630> like

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
to a point where we can do a game like

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.680 
to a point where we can do a game like
scuba<00:05:02.740> not<00:05:02.889> set<00:05:03.099> it's<00:05:03.250> just<00:05:03.460> so<00:05:03.610> vast<00:05:03.880> we<00:05:04.509> have

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
scuba not set it's just so vast we have

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.689 
scuba not set it's just so vast we have
a<00:05:04.720> system<00:05:05.020> for<00:05:05.770> scribblenauts<00:05:06.220> called<00:05:06.430> object

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
a system for scribblenauts called object

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.629 
a system for scribblenauts called object
not<00:05:07.120> so<00:05:07.720> all<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.139> these<00:05:08.380> tens<00:05:08.680> of<00:05:08.830> thousands<00:05:09.580> of

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
not so all of these tens of thousands of

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.939 
not so all of these tens of thousands of
objects<00:05:10.030> that<00:05:10.330> in<00:05:11.020> our<00:05:11.199> game<00:05:11.409> get<00:05:11.620> funneled

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
objects that in our game get funneled

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.770 
objects that in our game get funneled
through<00:05:12.610> this<00:05:12.789> system<00:05:13.030> called<00:05:13.360> object<00:05:13.479> not

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
through this system called object not

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.020 
through this system called object not
and<00:05:14.020> depending<00:05:14.889> on<00:05:15.009> what<00:05:15.130> category<00:05:15.610> it's<00:05:15.880> in

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
and depending on what category it's in

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.899 
and depending on what category it's in
will<00:05:16.930> tell<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:17.710> what<00:05:17.949> sort<00:05:18.159> of<00:05:18.250> properties<00:05:18.759> to

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
will tell it what sort of properties to

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:22.320 
will tell it what sort of properties to
give<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.180> so<00:05:19.740> like<00:05:20.740> a<00:05:21.039> piece<00:05:21.370> of<00:05:21.400> wood<00:05:21.759> will<00:05:22.150> go

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
give it so like a piece of wood will go

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.300 
give it so like a piece of wood will go
under<00:05:22.569> a<00:05:22.599> material<00:05:23.139> would<00:05:23.349> and<00:05:23.740> it'll<00:05:23.949> tell<00:05:24.130> it

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
under a material would and it'll tell it

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.770 
under a material would and it'll tell it
that<00:05:24.340> it's<00:05:24.580> flammable<00:05:24.880> so<00:05:25.300> anything<00:05:25.750> that

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
that it's flammable so anything that

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.969 
that it's flammable so anything that
goes<00:05:26.080> into<00:05:26.289> that<00:05:26.380> category<00:05:26.650> will

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
goes into that category will

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.680 
goes into that category will
automatically<00:05:27.550> have<00:05:27.580> this<00:05:27.880> stuff<00:05:28.090> so<00:05:28.300> we

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690 
automatically have this stuff so we

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.960 
automatically have this stuff so we
don't<00:05:28.870> have<00:05:28.960> to<00:05:29.080> hand<00:05:29.320> code<00:05:29.620> everything<00:05:30.190> but

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
don't have to hand code everything but

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.180 
don't have to hand code everything but
for<00:05:31.330> something<00:05:31.539> like<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.780> bear<00:05:32.110> who<00:05:32.770> is

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
for something like a bear who is

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.279 
for something like a bear who is
obviously<00:05:33.400> interested<00:05:34.090> in<00:05:34.479> like<00:05:34.690> honey<00:05:34.990> let's

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
obviously interested in like honey let's

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.959 
obviously interested in like honey let's
say<00:05:35.500> not<00:05:35.770> all<00:05:35.979> animals<00:05:36.340> are<00:05:36.520> interested<00:05:36.909> in

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
say not all animals are interested in

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.379 
say not all animals are interested in
honey<00:05:37.120> so<00:05:37.419> the<00:05:38.080> designers<00:05:38.620> have<00:05:38.919> tools<00:05:39.389> the

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
honey so the designers have tools the

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:41.969 
honey so the designers have tools the
object<00:05:40.750> I'll<00:05:40.840> tool<00:05:41.020> where<00:05:41.199> we<00:05:41.320> can<00:05:41.469> go<00:05:41.620> in<00:05:41.770> and

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
object I'll tool where we can go in and

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.120 
object I'll tool where we can go in and
just<00:05:42.159> say<00:05:42.370> bears<00:05:42.759> want<00:05:43.389> to<00:05:43.599> be<00:05:44.560> attracted<00:05:45.039> to

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
just say bears want to be attracted to

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.850 
just say bears want to be attracted to
honey<00:05:45.280> and<00:05:45.520> consume<00:05:46.000> honey<00:05:46.630> so<00:05:47.259> there's<00:05:47.620> lots

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
honey and consume honey so there's lots

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.589 
honey and consume honey so there's lots
of<00:05:48.039> tools<00:05:48.219> at<00:05:48.340> our<00:05:48.370> disposal<00:05:48.460> but<00:05:49.330> we<00:05:49.419> don't

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
of tools at our disposal but we don't

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.600 
of tools at our disposal but we don't
have<00:05:49.750> to<00:05:49.900> hand<00:05:50.080> code<00:05:50.229> everything<00:05:50.650> hi<00:05:51.250> i'm<00:05:51.400> matt
