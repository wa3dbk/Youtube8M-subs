00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
there but palutena has what seems to be

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.980 
there but palutena has what seems to be
like<00:02:03.090> 9<00:02:04.090> specials<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.460> I'm<00:02:07.030> assuming<00:02:07.420> some<00:02:07.899> of

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
like 9 specials and I'm assuming some of

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.469 
like 9 specials and I'm assuming some of
them<00:02:08.140> are<00:02:08.289> smashes<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.789> one<00:02:10.090> of<00:02:10.209> them<00:02:10.299> might

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
them are smashes and one of them might

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.940 
them are smashes and one of them might
be<00:02:10.509> like<00:02:10.720> up<00:02:10.989> tilt<00:02:11.290> might<00:02:11.530> have<00:02:11.650> been<00:02:11.799> that

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
be like up tilt might have been that

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.910 
be like up tilt might have been that
little<00:02:12.070> like<00:02:12.400> light<00:02:12.910> going<00:02:13.209> straight<00:02:13.570> up<00:02:13.920> but

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
little like light going straight up but

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.150 
little like light going straight up but
just<00:02:15.100> look<00:02:15.250> at<00:02:15.340> all<00:02:15.459> these<00:02:15.700> attacks<00:02:16.000> now<00:02:17.160> I'm

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
just look at all these attacks now I'm

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.890 
just look at all these attacks now I'm
assuming<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.820> of<00:02:18.940> those<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.299> up<00:02:19.450> be<00:02:19.630> one<00:02:19.810> of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
assuming one of those is up be one of

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.449 
assuming one of those is up be one of
those<00:02:19.989> aside<00:02:20.350> being<00:02:20.620> one<00:02:20.859> of<00:02:20.890> those<00:02:21.040> is<00:02:21.250> down

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
those aside being one of those is down

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.780 
those aside being one of those is down
be<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:22.570> here's<00:02:22.989> here's<00:02:23.380> my<00:02:23.440> question<00:02:23.769> how<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
be but here's here's my question how the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.880 
be but here's here's my question how the
hell<00:02:25.329> do<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.630> manage<00:02:25.870> all<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.230> those<00:02:26.500> without

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
hell do you manage all of those without

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.420 
hell do you manage all of those without
using<00:02:27.579> extra<00:02:28.540> buttons<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.950> almost<00:02:30.250> as

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
using extra buttons it's almost as

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.009 
using extra buttons it's almost as
though<00:02:30.459> she<00:02:30.609> has<00:02:30.910> extra<00:02:31.390> special<00:02:31.420> moves

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
though she has extra special moves

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.470 
though she has extra special moves
unless<00:02:32.350> she<00:02:32.769> has<00:02:32.920> modes<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.730> she<00:02:33.880> can<00:02:34.060> cycle

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
unless she has modes that she can cycle

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.020 
unless she has modes that she can cycle
through<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.989> have<00:02:35.980> no<00:02:36.190> idea<00:02:36.609> how<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.850> can<00:02:36.970> do

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
what's not cool I am happy that they

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.350 
what's not cool I am happy that they
brought<00:02:47.460> her<00:02:47.580> in<00:02:47.640> as<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.850> character<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.210> she

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
brought her in as a character but she

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.120 
brought her in as a character but she
seems<00:02:48.570> a<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:48.720> bit<00:02:48.900> too<00:02:49.020> powerful<00:02:49.560> then

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
seems a little bit too powerful then

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.460 
seems a little bit too powerful then
again<00:02:50.370> we<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.030> no<00:02:51.300> idea<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:52.050> game<00:02:52.200> isn't
