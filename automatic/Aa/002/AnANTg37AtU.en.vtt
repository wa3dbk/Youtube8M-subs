people<00:00:53.640> rate<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.480> quite<00:00:54.870> half<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
people rate it this is a quite half a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.990 
people rate it this is a quite half a
cup<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.920> salt<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.250> may<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.610> little<00:00:56.789> bit

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
cup of salt this may be a little bit

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.510 
cup of salt this may be a little bit
less<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.620> maybe<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:58.859> 1/3<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.280> cup<00:00:59.309> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
less so you know maybe like 1/3 a cup of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.510 
less so you know maybe like 1/3 a cup of
salt<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.300> black<00:01:01.170> pepper<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.890> 1/3<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.280> cup<00:01:02.309> of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
salt and black pepper about 1/3 a cup of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.140 
salt and black pepper about 1/3 a cup of
black<00:01:02.699> pepper<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.850> this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.000> my

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
black pepper and then this is this is my

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.719 
black pepper and then this is this is my
own<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.390> tweak<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.960> what<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> basic<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.950> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
own little tweak on what the basic is a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.630 
own little tweak on what the basic is a
tablespoon<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.659> cayenne<00:01:10.010> maybe<00:01:11.010> like<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> tan<00:01:11.400> I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
tablespoon of cayenne maybe like a tan I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.130 
tablespoon of cayenne maybe like a tan I
think<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.240> than<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.360> tablespoon<00:01:12.900> of

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
think it's more than the tablespoon of

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.830 
think it's more than the tablespoon of
onion<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.650> garlic<00:01:14.100> powder<00:01:14.479> but<00:01:15.479> that's<00:01:15.659> it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
onion and garlic powder but that's it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.880 
onion and garlic powder but that's it
because<00:01:16.020> I've<00:01:16.110> seen<00:01:16.259> others<00:01:16.500> where<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.710> can

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
because I've seen others where you can

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.020 
because I've seen others where you can
tweak<00:01:17.070> getting<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.580> bit<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.820> kind

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
tweak getting out a little bit of kind

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.520 
tweak getting out a little bit of kind
of<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.299> want<00:01:18.509> didn't<00:01:19.049> want<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> add<00:01:19.320> some

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
of what you want didn't want to add some

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.710 
of what you want didn't want to add some
cayenne<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.280> everyone<00:01:20.640> likes<00:01:20.820> tons<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
cayenne is not everyone likes tons of

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.490 
cayenne is not everyone likes tons of
heat<00:01:21.930> but<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.150> pretty<00:01:24.420> much<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
heat but this is pretty much what the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.940 
heat but this is pretty much what the
spice<00:01:26.009> rub<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:27.140> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.619> we'll<00:01:28.710> see

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
spice rub is going to be so we'll see

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.920 
spice rub is going to be so we'll see
this<00:01:29.130> looks<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> actually<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.720> what

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
this looks like I actually just was what

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690 
this looks like I actually just was what
the<00:01:31.020> recipe<00:01:31.350> called<00:01:31.560> for<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.189> thinking

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the recipe called for so I'm thinking

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.600 
the recipe called for so I'm thinking
this<00:01:32.820> will<00:01:33.000> actually<00:01:33.150> cover<00:01:33.630> both<00:01:34.610> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
this will actually cover both the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.810 
this will actually cover both the
brisket<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> pork<00:01:38.430> shoulder<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
brisket and the and the pork shoulder I

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.210 
brisket and the and the pork shoulder I
wasn't<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> hundred<00:01:39.299> percent<00:01:39.360> certain<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
wasn't a hundred percent certain that it

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.710 
wasn't a hundred percent certain that it
was<00:01:41.310> gonna<00:01:41.400> work<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:41.790> both<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.090> I'm<00:01:42.210> just

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
was gonna work for both but I'm just

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.450 
was gonna work for both but I'm just
guessing<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.420> am

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
guessing that that it will so I am

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.649 
guessing that that it will so I am
pretty<00:01:47.460> much<00:01:47.579> done<00:01:47.820> mixing<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> cut

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
pretty much done mixing this on the cut

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.420 
pretty much done mixing this on the cut
and<00:01:48.869> when<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.140> come<00:01:49.320> back<00:01:49.439> I'll<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.250> meat

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and when I come back I'll have the meat

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.760 
and when I come back I'll have the meat
out<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.079> we'll<00:01:52.079> give<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.380> rubdown

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
out and we'll give it a rubdown

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.940 
out and we'll give it a rubdown
all<00:01:53.520> right<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.060> have<00:01:54.270> I'm<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.170> gonna<00:01:55.320> rub

rather you can just put the rub on and
let<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:14.520> know<00:02:14.550> sit<00:02:14.790> for<00:02:14.910> an<00:02:15.000> hour<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.269> it

better<00:02:16.379> if<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.500> do<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.650> overnight<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.220> wrap

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
better if you do it overnight and wrap

better if you do it overnight and wrap
it<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.209> saran<00:02:18.629> wrap<00:02:18.959> which<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.230> what<00:02:19.379> I'm<00:02:19.470> going

each<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.060> obviously<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.019> be<00:03:31.380> about<00:03:31.500> nine

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
each so obviously the be about nine

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.009 
each so obviously the be about nine
hours<00:03:32.519> about<00:03:32.760> four<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.120> half<00:03:33.150> hours<00:03:33.660> so

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
hours about four and a half hours so

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.170 
hours about four and a half hours so
that's<00:03:34.560> pretty<00:03:34.829> much<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.579> average<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:35.970> saw

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
that's pretty much the average I saw

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.879 
that's pretty much the average I saw
some<00:03:36.420> said<00:03:36.630> about<00:03:36.780> an<00:03:36.930> hour<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.200> a<00:03:37.230> half<00:03:37.440> but

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
some said about an hour and a half but

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.080 
some said about an hour and a half but
mostly<00:03:38.160> has<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.340> do<00:03:38.459> with<00:03:38.579> like<00:03:38.700> internal

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
mostly has to do with like internal

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.460 
mostly has to do with like internal
temperatures<00:03:39.540> getting<00:03:39.750> them<00:03:39.959> both<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.290> about

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
temperatures getting them both to about

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.840 
temperatures getting them both to about
a<00:03:40.500> hundred<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.920> eighty<00:03:41.069> degrees<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.489> so<00:03:41.819> I

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
a hundred and eighty degrees and so I

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.729 
a hundred and eighty degrees and so I
got<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.120> thermometer<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.690> can<00:03:42.840> check<00:03:43.049> check<00:03:43.620> with

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
got a thermometer I can check check with

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.229 
got a thermometer I can check check with
that<00:03:43.859> so<00:03:44.010> probably<00:03:44.310> start<00:03:44.459> smoking<00:03:44.880> tomorrow

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
that so probably start smoking tomorrow

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.990 
that so probably start smoking tomorrow
