believe<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.830> Bao<00:00:16.980> G<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.880> biggest<00:00:18.119> source

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
believe that Bao G is the biggest source

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.929 
believe that Bao G is the biggest source
of<00:00:18.359> ideas<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.900> biggest<00:00:19.199> source<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.410> invention

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
of ideas the biggest source of invention

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.340 
of ideas the biggest source of invention
in<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> nobody<00:00:21.330> can<00:00:21.480> invent<00:00:21.750> better<00:00:22.140> than

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
in the nobody can invent better than

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.710 
in the nobody can invent better than
nature<00:00:22.609> and<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.820> if<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.150> nature's<00:00:24.570> my

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
nature and so if you like nature's my

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.080 
nature and so if you like nature's my
biggest<00:00:24.960> source<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.320> inspiration<00:00:26.090> my

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
biggest source of inspiration my

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.080 
biggest source of inspiration my
contention<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.930> 80%<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.550> impact<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
contention is that 80% of the impact of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.990 
contention is that 80% of the impact of
building<00:00:30.380> this<00:00:31.380> cause<00:00:31.710> by<00:00:31.980> its<00:00:32.099> design<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
building this cause by its design you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510 
building this cause by its design you
can<00:00:33.239> anticipate<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.350> impact<00:00:34.800> at<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.250> design

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
can anticipate the impact at the design

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.180 
can anticipate the impact at the design
stage<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.719> reduce<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> impact

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
stage but it can reduce the the impact

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.549 
stage but it can reduce the the impact
from<00:00:38.399> 80%<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.510> if<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.960> cared<00:00:40.200> minimum

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
from 80% to you know if we cared minimum

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.920 
from 80% to you know if we cared minimum
I<00:00:40.800> think<00:00:41.640> there's<00:00:41.790> some<00:00:41.940> single<00:00:42.540> most

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
I think there's some single most

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.110 
I think there's some single most
pressing<00:00:43.440> issue<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.250> all<00:00:44.489> designers<00:00:44.879> must

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
pressing issue that all designers must

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.510 
pressing issue that all designers must
address<00:00:45.539> today<00:00:45.829> otherwise<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.070> millennium

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
address today otherwise this millennium

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.119 
address today otherwise this millennium
will<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.760> our<00:00:47.879> last

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.950 

the<00:00:50.670> ecologist<00:00:51.149> has<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.539> much<00:00:51.690> more

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
the ecologist has a much more

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.810 
the ecologist has a much more

we should imitate is that in nature the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.490 
we should imitate is that in nature the
only<00:01:16.920> source<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.520> energy<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.210> Sun

only source of energy is on the Sun

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.359 
only source of energy is on the Sun
everything<00:01:19.500> comes<00:01:19.740> from<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> Sun<00:01:20.190> through

everything comes from the Sun through

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
everything comes from the Sun through
the<00:01:20.490> process<00:01:20.789> of<00:01:20.820> photosynthesis<00:01:21.600> where<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the process of photosynthesis where is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.499 
the process of photosynthesis where is
now<00:01:22.830> our<00:01:23.220> social<00:01:23.610> energies<00:01:23.940> from<00:01:24.090> fossil

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
now our social energies from fossil

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.320 
now our social energies from fossil
fuels<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.350> until<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.069> able<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.610> operate

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330

and<00:01:27.869> run<00:01:28.170> by<00:01:28.560> imitating<00:01:29.630> photosynthesis

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
and run by imitating photosynthesis

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.359 
and run by imitating photosynthesis
it'll<00:01:31.050> be<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.200> long<00:01:31.380> while<00:01:31.590> before<00:01:31.649> we<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.250> ever

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
it'll be a long while before we can ever

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.020 
it'll be a long while before we can ever
truly<00:01:32.670> ecological<00:01:33.450> system

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.030 

and<00:01:37.570> it's<00:01:37.930> how<00:01:38.110> what<00:01:38.350> we're<00:01:38.530> trying<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.800> do<00:01:38.920> is

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
and it's how what we're trying to do is

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.620 
and it's how what we're trying to do is
to<00:01:39.250> interpret<00:01:39.610> as<00:01:39.880> many<00:01:40.180> of<00:01:40.330> our<00:01:40.450> ecological

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
to interpret as many of our ecological

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.080 
to interpret as many of our ecological
ideas<00:01:41.230> as<00:01:41.410> possible<00:01:41.580> into<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.700> single

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
ideas as possible into the single

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.000 
ideas as possible into the single
building<00:01:43.360> project<00:01:43.810> first<00:01:44.500> thing<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:44.680> did<00:01:44.860> was

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
building project first thing I did was

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.340 
building project first thing I did was
to<00:01:45.280> try<00:01:45.460> to<00:01:45.520> balance<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:46.120> inorganic<00:01:46.540> mass<00:01:46.930> off

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
to try to balance the inorganic mass off

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.770 
to try to balance the inorganic mass off
the<00:01:47.560> tower<00:01:47.830> with<00:01:48.670> more<00:01:48.880> organic<00:01:49.240> mass<00:01:49.450> that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
the tower with more organic mass that

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.180 
the tower with more organic mass that
which<00:01:49.960> means<00:01:50.170> bring<00:01:50.380> vegetation<00:01:51.040> and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
which means bring vegetation and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.600 
which means bring vegetation and
landscaping<00:01:51.670> into<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.690> building<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:54.220> wanted

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
landscaping into the building we wanted

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.700 
landscaping into the building we wanted
it<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.820> be<00:01:55.090> flow<00:01:55.420> energy<00:01:55.570> so<00:01:56.410> we<00:01:56.560> had

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
it to be flow energy so we had

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.650 
it to be flow energy so we had
photovoltaic<00:01:57.010> furnace<00:01:57.640> facades<00:01:58.090> but<00:01:58.540> it

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
photovoltaic furnace facades but it

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.910 
photovoltaic furnace facades but it
could<00:01:58.750> be<00:01:58.810> facing<00:01:59.020> the<00:01:59.170> east<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.500> west<00:01:59.619> side

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
could be facing the east and west side

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.460 
could be facing the east and west side
and<00:02:00.490> on<00:02:00.670> this<00:02:00.760> roof<00:02:01.030> so<00:02:01.510> in<00:02:01.660> this<00:02:01.810> way<00:02:02.140> you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
and on this roof so in this way you

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.050 
and on this roof so in this way you
would<00:02:02.710> have<00:02:02.890> his<00:02:03.010> own<00:02:03.130> energy<00:02:03.310> source<00:02:03.790> so

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
would have his own energy source so

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.780 
would have his own energy source so
we've<00:02:04.780> had<00:02:04.930> sun<00:02:05.530> shades<00:02:05.860> which<00:02:06.040> was<00:02:06.280> scallop

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
we've had sun shades which was scallop

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.249 
we've had sun shades which was scallop
shaped<00:02:07.030> so<00:02:07.720> that<00:02:07.750> we<00:02:07.930> could<00:02:08.080> collect

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
shaped so that we could collect

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.530 
shaped so that we could collect
rainwater<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.130> then<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.729> building<00:02:10.030> house<00:02:10.239> is

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
rainwater and then the building house is

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.479 
rainwater and then the building house is
also<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.929> water<00:02:11.230> filtration<00:02:11.530> system<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:12.430> the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
also a water filtration system so the

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.580 
also a water filtration system so the
water<00:02:12.790> is<00:02:13.180> recycled<00:02:13.630> with<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.080> building<00:02:14.440> and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
water is recycled with the building and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.190 
water is recycled with the building and
then<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.190> sewage<00:02:15.550> are<00:02:15.730> recycled<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:16.989> in

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
then the sewage are recycled and so in

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.390 
then the sewage are recycled and so in
many<00:02:17.320> ways<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:17.980> if<00:02:18.459> you<00:02:18.550> like<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.970> human-made

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
many ways it is if you like a human-made

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.270 
many ways it is if you like a human-made
ecosystem<00:02:21.400> but<00:02:21.910> in<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.209> tower<00:02:22.420> fall<00:02:23.280> within

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
ecosystem but in that tower fall within

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.430 
ecosystem but in that tower fall within
the<00:02:24.459> next<00:02:24.610> five<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.209> ten<00:02:25.420> years<00:02:25.450> we<00:02:25.959> see<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> lot

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
the next five to ten years we see a lot

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.650 
the next five to ten years we see a lot
more<00:02:26.620> green<00:02:26.770> building<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.510> not<00:02:28.510> just

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
more green building and of not just

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.540 
more green building and of not just
buildings<00:02:28.989> but<00:02:29.140> green<00:02:29.380> cities<00:02:30.040> green

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
buildings but green cities green

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.000

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
cities and so planners all of the world

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.360 
cities and so planners all of the world
are<00:02:43.690> aware<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.019> this<00:02:44.290> but<00:02:44.650> some<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.130> best

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
are aware of this but some in the best

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.390 
are aware of this but some in the best
position<00:02:45.790> implemented<00:02:46.330> than<00:02:46.510> others<00:02:46.810> I

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
position implemented than others I

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.280 
position implemented than others I
believe<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.700> if<00:02:48.940> we<00:02:49.120> are<00:02:49.420> committed<00:02:49.780> towards

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
believe that if we are committed towards

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.810 
believe that if we are committed towards
it<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:51.160> we<00:02:51.250> continue<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.760> educate

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
it and that we continue to educate

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.060 
it and that we continue to educate
people<00:02:52.269> get<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.989> world<00:02:53.500> community<00:02:54.040> to

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
people get a world community to

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.759 
people get a world community to
implement<00:02:54.580> green<00:02:54.940> features<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.959> aspects<00:02:56.560> not

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
implement green features and aspects not

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.680 
implement green features and aspects not
just<00:02:56.830> in<00:02:57.220> their<00:02:57.370> lifestyles<00:02:58.030> but<00:02:58.299> in<00:02:58.510> their

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
just in their lifestyles but in their

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.680 
just in their lifestyles but in their

heading<00:03:01.930> towards<00:03:02.200> green<00:03:02.440> future<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:03.670> my<00:03:03.850> dream

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
heading towards green future so my dream

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.470 
heading towards green future so my dream
in<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.600> futures<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.860> a<00:03:05.920> green<00:03:06.220> tree<00:03:06.480> but

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
in the futures that is a green tree but

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.539 
in the futures that is a green tree but
as<00:03:07.780> I've<00:03:08.350> committed<00:03:08.769> frog<00:03:08.950> says<00:03:09.190> it's<00:03:09.430> not

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
as I've committed frog says it's not

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.460 
as I've committed frog says it's not
easy<00:03:09.730> being<00:03:10.000> green<00:03:10.030> but<00:03:10.420> we<00:03:11.049> should<00:03:11.230> try<00:03:11.320> and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
easy being green but we should try and

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.800 
easy being green but we should try and
make<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.650> as<00:03:11.709> clean<00:03:11.890> as<00:03:11.920> possible<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:12.810> I'm

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
make it as clean as possible and I'm

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.110 
make it as clean as possible and I'm
very<00:03:14.019> optimistic
