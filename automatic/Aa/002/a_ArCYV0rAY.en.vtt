00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.800
 very good 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.280
 evidently I told him he was past and 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.550
 now you have something first that you do not 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.550
 has a name 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.680
 but at the same time I also say and this is 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.200
 important that you also say it to happen 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:35.950
 that the accusation that he says is false 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:38.739
 that does not make any sense 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.630
 old teams dragon boys 11 and 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.290
 steam left and it was absurd and the 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.170
 right was the 7 played what I'm 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.060
 talking is a move from the center 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:56.440
 let's say in the center of the court there 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:01:01.210
 I'm leaning but I was going to kick 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.840
 long distance and it was expensive because there 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.840
 what to name things 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.750
 at the philosophical level you have to be clear in 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.180
 the other reports I did not want to be like that 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.580
 very definitive 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.380
 for shame or for whatever it is but already 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.510
 with the answer that I just saw 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.070
 I'm really saying it 's sebastian de caro 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.070
 it's okay 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.869
 who went to the floor to work a match 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.409
 that was from actors that at night 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.960
 we had it working and he took it as if 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.509
 outside the final of the liberators cup 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.490
 because there was a big rivalry 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.560
 because we give the success of television 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.929
 they more than teenagers us more 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.259
 on schedule and well and I think there was a 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.580
 predisposition to injure me and I do not know 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.920
 is perhaps taking over by time 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.179
 I trust what he says is I think that 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.030
 says convinced as the ningunea yes 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:11.440
 because he says as much not as any 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:15.190
 going up being more indec which 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.190
 it does not stop being let's say a TV does not say 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.540
 then creep 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:25.460
 the complaint was injured someone injured 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.460
 your ar the meadow 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.350
 I will not allow ourselves to be presented 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.280
 the knee bill and I'm going to send you 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.700
 biodegradable screw bill 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:56.620
 what are they going to put me 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.620
 are those normal screws 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:10.129
 I stopped paying this is going to bring who was 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.689
 the one that broke but I want to give you the 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:21.760
 expensive opportunity 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:21.760
 I say it was not me it was good because no 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:31.669
 his team was martÃ­n already came with the 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.989
 knee shattered but I had all the 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:38.349
 season making the rengo cake 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.349
 a disaster 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:48.970
 maybe even do not give opportunities to 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:51.060
 my opinion we can advance that 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.420
 you will have to pay for the screws and 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.200
 documents and has been resolved the 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.840
 contest let's go to a break 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.430
 and attention from the break we have a 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.000
 small tribute for Mother's Day 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.000
 we are here 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.359
 a nonsense 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.870
 a 14 by 9 and much more television 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.870
 register
