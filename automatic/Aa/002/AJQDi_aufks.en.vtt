00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:07.220
 hello again let's see 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.900
 a problem I had with the hand brake 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.830
 I'm left with no way to stop with the 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.059
 hand brake 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.680
 of my classic mercedes car from 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:22.200
 84 Mercedes 190 and what has been the 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.500
 very simple problem this is not 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.930
 Exhausted 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.320
 this was practically new because 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 looked at those that sell new and more or 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.100
 less 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.840
 has the same height has something of hero 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.030
 that is normal but has the same 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.810
 height that the problem and I looked at the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.030
 Tensioner under the car and the tensioner 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.500
 it's stretched to the top so I can not 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.030
 think what else I think so the brake 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.730
 human I fall so high and it catches well 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.730
 that hits and that this other tensioner there 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.930
 here is of extension that this goes with 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.420
 a screwdriver turns the wheel well 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.079
 you put the screwdriver here and salt 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.659
 white up or down 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.689
 is going to hand the moderns carry this 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.479
 most hidden automatic tensioner carries 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:16.930
 a little eyelash and as it goes by going 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.930
 giving a tooth and always slow to 1 or 2 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.710
 of the handbrake insurance this is no longer 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.620
 I have more travel left I have two left 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.360
 teeth of travel I fall very high very 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.880
 bad to work 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.430
 well this does not lead to any screw 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.490
 to take out like in the opel astra 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.860
 takes this point of reference and you have to 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.620
 take out the caliper the same wheel wrench 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.890
 the same number is for the bone clamp 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.570
 that uses a 17 then with a 17 of 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.270
 star has pulled out the brake caliper that 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.580
 I have it collected there without releasing it pigem 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.110
 and nothing threw back the pistons with 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.060
 your own brake pads 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.890
 nothing else you have to think about here 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.570
 until I get in the way to put the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.240
 drum when I get in the way 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.130
 the drum I'll think a little more and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.780
 let go of the tensioner that is under the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.200
 car on top of the transmission bar 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.000
 you have to take out the other wheel also the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.400
 another drum the other clamp there is 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.780
 do everything to Paris when here 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.020
 let's give us an idea 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.730
 when we give you five laps here 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.960
 there will be to give in the other wheel 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.520
 four or five slopes 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.020
 because I had to give it one more point 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.730
 of braking to stop this wheel that 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.340
 it does not brake it goes well that means that 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.350
 This tensor is not regulated as the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.350
 another one will cost us but we will do it 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.240
 when they get in my way to put the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.840
 tensioners 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.680
 is tightening the handbrake 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.680
 and we will talk 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:53.580
 for the moment I'm going to let go and start 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.300
 to think of here until they get in my way 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.950
 come on 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.610
 that you can not do two things at once 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.590
 record and do the work 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.860
 then I show you more or less how the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.370
 theme the theme is this loosen this 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.260
 open up stop this 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.890
 this has to be unscrewed towards 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.890
 outside and in 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.280
 to spencer the handbrake and think about it 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.209
 from here 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.209
 and it's done upside down
