00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.139
 Hello 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.510
 many like to use this tatonka 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.060
 caprice jakab and of course a lot 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.910
 handy if you are there for example 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.210
 Over a volume of 3 100 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:30.070
 milliliters around 375 to be precise 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:34.390
 It is a mark of the picture commits 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.890
 then about until then to about 400 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.720
 I'll guess meters will fit 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:44.470
 to boil water is the right one 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.510
 practically because it is made of stainless steel and 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.200
 many carry the like with a drinking vessel 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.980
 or as a small vessel to dine 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.320
 heat 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.620
 and of course it makes sense if you 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.500
 these circumstances can be together 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.140
 that works very well with the marine 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.010
 with the noble starck class 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.310
 Of course , worries worked 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.060
 because all those plastic bottles with each 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.990
 1 liter and also works with the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.010
 clean cantine 12 100 milliliters version 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.010
 and is problematic 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.300
 should be a bit vacuum measure, he 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.550
 fits exactly what I wanted simply 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.420
 demonstrate again for those who 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.860
 like drinking bottle on to a space 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.360
 Guess that's from the silhouette 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.440
 Year quite narrow and there is no place 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.479
 Of course one wastes in 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.330
 this vessel of other things still with 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.130
 pack in so that the place becomes 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.880
 it completely disappears me now 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.979
 The towels are many like to take 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.930
 because they are transpiring or because they are 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.520
 water want to be fulfilled or out 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.549
 what we like to survive out of that 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.110
 take away and dine bag soups t 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.240
 I do not know what you mean for that 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.040
 place things development to many 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.869
 but her gas cartridges are the well 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.700
 I also had to adjust that myself 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.550
 but not yet tried 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.910
 I am to most alcohol store of 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.670
 tran gia so I had to do that now 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.620
 do not test 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.019
 that 's all it's all about 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.920
 show how nice that will be occasionally 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.920
 year together
