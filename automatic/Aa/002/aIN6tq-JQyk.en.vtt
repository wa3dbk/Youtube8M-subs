00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
slow down the healing process um I think

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.870 
slow down the healing process um I think
that<00:04:47.960> was<00:04:48.110> it<00:04:48.460> also<00:04:49.460> when<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:49.729> get<00:04:49.849> your

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
a lot of crushed ice the ice will help

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.189 
a lot of crushed ice the ice will help

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:23.649 
to be careful about that and like I said
it's<00:05:22.310> doing<00:05:22.520> really<00:05:22.550> well<00:05:22.909> now<00:05:23.120> it's<00:05:23.449> been<00:05:23.630> a

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
it's doing really well now it's been a

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:24.969 
it's doing really well now it's been a
week<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.990> half<00:05:24.020> since<00:05:24.259> I<00:05:24.409> got<00:05:24.560> mine<00:05:24.740> pierced

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
week and a half since I got mine pierced

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.249 
week and a half since I got mine pierced
and<00:05:25.900> these<00:05:26.900> were<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.289> questions<00:05:27.650> that<00:05:27.740> I<00:05:27.860> had

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
and these were the questions that I had

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.450 
and these were the questions that I had
also<00:05:30.259> my<00:05:30.469> other<00:05:30.620> video<00:05:30.889> I<00:05:30.979> mentioned<00:05:31.039> that

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
also my other video I mentioned that

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.529 
also my other video I mentioned that
you'll<00:05:31.699> want<00:05:31.789> to<00:05:31.909> tighten<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.330> balls

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:32.539 
you'll want to tighten the balls

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.089 
you'll want to tighten the balls
probably<00:05:33.020> before<00:05:33.139> you<00:05:33.320> go<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.560> sleep<00:05:33.650> and

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
probably before you go to sleep and

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.010 
probably before you go to sleep and
after<00:05:34.550> every<00:05:34.880> pretty<00:05:35.360> big<00:05:35.570> meal<00:05:35.780> because

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
after every pretty big meal because

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.689 
after every pretty big meal because
moving<00:05:36.710> around<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:37.070> lot<00:05:37.190> in<00:05:37.310> your<00:05:37.370> mouth<00:05:37.520> when

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
moving around a lot in your mouth when

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.060 
moving around a lot in your mouth when
you're<00:05:37.820> eating<00:05:38.000> and<00:05:38.300> those<00:05:39.139> balls<00:05:39.409> can<00:05:39.680> come

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
you're eating and those balls can come

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.820 
you're eating and those balls can come
off<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:40.840> sometimes<00:05:41.840> if<00:05:42.080> it's<00:05:42.259> a<00:05:42.469> new<00:05:42.590> piercing

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
off and sometimes if it's a new piercing

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.080 
off and sometimes if it's a new piercing
you<00:05:43.070> might<00:05:43.219> not<00:05:43.340> know<00:05:43.490> how<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:43.639> put<00:05:43.849> it<00:05:43.880> back<00:05:44.030> on

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
you might not know how to put it back on

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.070 
you might not know how to put it back on
but<00:05:45.580> yeah<00:05:46.580> I<00:05:46.849> think<00:05:47.599> those<00:05:47.750> are<00:05:47.780> all<00:05:47.990> the
