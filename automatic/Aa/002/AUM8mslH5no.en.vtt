00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
cacti in the background so they're

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.990

wielding his handgun and the first thing

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.820 
wielding his handgun and the first thing
I<00:02:22.850> noticed<00:02:23.210> is<00:02:23.390> guys<00:02:23.720> look<00:02:24.140> at<00:02:24.230> his<00:02:24.380> chin<00:02:24.620> he

I noticed is guys look at his chin he

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.440 
I noticed is guys look at his chin he
has<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.100> goatee<00:02:25.310> so<00:02:25.970> this<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.420> course

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
has a goatee so this is of course

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.390 
has a goatee so this is of course
confirmation<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:27.530> we<00:02:27.560> can<00:02:27.830> customize

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
confirmation that we can customize

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.730 
confirmation that we can customize
things<00:02:28.670> like<00:02:28.970> hair<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.390> whatnot<00:02:29.740> obviously

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
things like hair and whatnot obviously

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.500 
things like hair and whatnot obviously
he<00:02:30.860> didn't<00:02:31.010> have<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.160> goatee<00:02:31.430> before<00:02:31.760> but<00:02:32.240> I<00:02:32.270> got

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
he didn't have a goatee before but I got

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.940 
he didn't have a goatee before but I got
to<00:02:32.540> say<00:02:32.630> he<00:02:32.840> looks<00:02:32.959> pretty<00:02:33.110> good<00:02:33.350> with<00:02:33.560> one<00:02:33.740> um

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
to say he looks pretty good with one um

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.250 
to say he looks pretty good with one um
so<00:02:34.880> obviously<00:02:35.360> he's<00:02:35.540> probably<00:02:35.720> shooting<00:02:36.050> at

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
so obviously he's probably shooting at

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.449 
so obviously he's probably shooting at
some<00:02:36.380> cops<00:02:36.590> here<00:02:36.800> because<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.070> see<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.310> cop

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
screenshot it gives us a great view as

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.670 
screenshot it gives us a great view as
you<00:03:05.180> can<00:03:05.330> see<00:03:05.450> there's<00:03:05.630> a<00:03:05.720> body<00:03:05.989> of<00:03:06.290> water

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
you can see there's a body of water

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.890 
you can see there's a body of water
right<00:03:07.220> there<00:03:07.280> under<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.880> plane<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.570> appears

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
right there under the plane it appears

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.720 
right there under the plane it appears
to<00:03:08.959> be<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.230> Alamo<00:03:09.590> see<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:10.100> could<00:03:10.370> be<00:03:10.489> wrong<00:03:10.520> but

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
to be the Alamo see I could be wrong but

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.820 
to be the Alamo see I could be wrong but
that's<00:03:11.180> what<00:03:11.360> I'm<00:03:11.450> assuming<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.110> this<00:03:12.650> is

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
that's what I'm assuming and this is

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.550 
that's what I'm assuming and this is
clearly<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.310> dry<00:03:13.790> desert<00:03:14.270> area<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:15.020> this<00:03:15.440> is

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
clearly a dry desert area so this is

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.110 
clearly a dry desert area so this is
probably<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.920> Blaine<00:03:16.160> County<00:03:16.400> area<00:03:16.880> and

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
probably the Blaine County area and

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.030 
probably the Blaine County area and
there<00:03:17.660> are<00:03:17.720> just<00:03:17.900> a<00:03:18.019> lot<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.290> winding<00:03:18.769> roads

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
there are just a lot of winding roads

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.560 
there are just a lot of winding roads
pretty<00:03:19.250> much<00:03:19.459> going<00:03:19.730> everywhere<00:03:20.060> near<00:03:20.420> the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
pretty much going everywhere near the

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.850 
pretty much going everywhere near the
bottom<00:03:20.720> of<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.080> screen<00:03:21.230> shot<00:03:21.530> you<00:03:21.680> can<00:03:21.799> see

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
bottom of the screen shot you can see

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.229 
bottom of the screen shot you can see
that<00:03:22.220> they're<00:03:22.370> just<00:03:22.549> kind<00:03:22.700> of<00:03:22.730> going<00:03:22.880> over

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
that they're just kind of going over

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.509 
that they're just kind of going over
Hills<00:03:23.480> just<00:03:23.900> kind<00:03:24.080> of<00:03:24.110> randomly<00:03:24.470> but<00:03:25.160> as<00:03:25.310> you

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
Hills just kind of randomly but as you

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.729 
Hills just kind of randomly but as you
proceed<00:03:25.910> farther<00:03:26.450> back<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:27.350> can<00:03:27.470> see<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
proceed farther back you can see the

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.350 
proceed farther back you can see the
roads<00:03:27.980> kind<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.370> go<00:03:28.549> up<00:03:28.700> into<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.000> mountain

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
roads kind of go up into the mountain

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.720 
roads kind of go up into the mountain
and<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:30.260> don't<00:03:30.739> know<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:31.010> this<00:03:31.190> one<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:31.430> just

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
and I don't know that this one is just

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.000 
and I don't know that this one is just
really<00:03:32.180> really<00:03:32.600> cool<00:03:32.930> i<00:03:33.140> like<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.799> plane

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
really really cool i like that the plane

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.830 
really really cool i like that the plane
really<00:03:34.430> looks<00:03:34.640> vintage<00:03:34.970> they<00:03:35.390> get<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.660> point

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
really looks vintage they get the point

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.050 
really looks vintage they get the point
across<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.200> this<00:03:36.620> plane<00:03:36.890> isn't<00:03:37.100> very<00:03:37.400> new<00:03:37.580> it

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
across that this plane isn't very new it

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.090 
across that this plane isn't very new it
is<00:03:38.299> old<00:03:38.510> it's<00:03:38.780> been<00:03:39.019> around<00:03:39.290> i<00:03:39.709> think<00:03:39.950> that's

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
is old it's been around i think that's

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.830 
is old it's been around i think that's
really<00:03:40.280> cool<00:03:40.610> because<00:03:40.910> if<00:03:41.180> you<00:03:41.299> noticed<00:03:41.660> in

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
really cool because if you noticed in

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.420 
really cool because if you noticed in

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
vehicles so far or at least on planes up

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.210 
vehicles so far or at least on planes up
next<00:03:57.049> you've<00:03:57.200> got<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.410> picture<00:03:57.620> of<00:03:57.739> Trevor<00:03:58.100> of

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
of the sort that just exploded behind

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.530 
of the sort that just exploded behind
him<00:04:04.130> and<00:04:04.190> he's<00:04:04.340> walking<00:04:04.640> away<00:04:04.910> holding<00:04:05.269> his

him and he's walking away holding his
fully<00:04:05.810> automatic<00:04:06.320> rifle<00:04:06.829> one<00:04:07.430> thing<00:04:07.610> I

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
fully automatic rifle one thing I

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.430 
fully automatic rifle one thing I
noticed<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.209> if<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.540> look<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.840> the<00:04:08.900> left<00:04:09.260> of

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
noticed is if you look to the left of

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.229 
noticed is if you look to the left of
the<00:04:09.560> explosion<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:10.400> can<00:04:10.549> see<00:04:10.670> a<00:04:10.700> little<00:04:10.970> thing

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
the explosion you can see a little thing

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.550 
the explosion you can see a little thing
flying<00:04:11.510> through<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.870> air<00:04:11.900> they're<00:04:12.260> not

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
flying through the air they're not

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.750 
flying through the air they're not
really<00:04:12.739> sure<00:04:12.890> what<00:04:13.040> that<00:04:13.070> is<00:04:13.220> I'm<00:04:13.610> just

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
really sure what that is I'm just

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.310 
really sure what that is I'm just
assuming<00:04:14.030> that's<00:04:14.450> some<00:04:14.630> debris<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.260> was

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
assuming that's some debris that was

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.349 
assuming that's some debris that was
launched<00:04:16.070> off<00:04:16.250> when<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.850> explosion<00:04:17.329> happened

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
launched off when the explosion happened

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.420 
launched off when the explosion happened
but<00:04:18.229> um<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:18.680> don't<00:04:18.829> know<00:04:18.950> I'm<00:04:19.040> not<00:04:19.190> really<00:04:19.250> sure

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430

the lighting being cast here is us
as<00:04:27.599> you<00:04:27.780> can<00:04:27.870> see<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.349> the<00:04:28.680> Blues<00:04:28.949> are<00:04:29.310> really

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
as you can see the the Blues are really

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.610 
as you can see the the Blues are really
they<00:04:30.240> really<00:04:30.270> very<00:04:30.810> well<00:04:31.169> you<00:04:31.259> know<00:04:31.379> where<00:04:31.530> the

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
they really very well you know where the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.990 
they really very well you know where the
lights<00:04:31.800> shining<00:04:32.039> the<00:04:32.220> brightest<00:04:32.669> it's<00:04:32.819> kind

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
lights shining the brightest it's kind

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.670 
lights shining the brightest it's kind
of<00:04:33.030> lighter<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:33.509> it<00:04:33.629> darkens<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:34.410> then<00:04:34.500> in<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
of lighter is it darkens and then in the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.980 
of lighter is it darkens and then in the
shadows<00:04:35.129> it<00:04:35.340> just<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:36.000> really<00:04:36.150> looks<00:04:36.599> um<00:04:36.780> being

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
shadows it just it really looks um being

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.170 
shadows it just it really looks um being
it<00:04:37.169> looks<00:04:37.349> great<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.830> looks<00:04:38.039> realistic<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.940> I

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
it looks great it looks realistic and I

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.730 
it looks great it looks realistic and I
don't<00:04:39.509> know<00:04:39.569> I<00:04:39.599> just<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:40.020> think<00:04:40.080> it's<00:04:40.319> so<00:04:40.560> cool

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
don't know I just I think it's so cool

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:51.539 
police in this game as you can see

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.029 
police in this game as you can see
looking<00:04:51.780> at<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.110> back<00:04:52.289> tires<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.860> car

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
looking at the back tires of the car

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.469 
looking at the back tires of the car
we've<00:04:53.220> got<00:04:53.430> some<00:04:53.580> nice<00:04:53.729> effects<00:04:54.060> going<00:04:54.300> on

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
we've got some nice effects going on

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.149 
we've got some nice effects going on
here<00:04:54.720> you<00:04:54.840> can<00:04:54.990> see<00:04:55.139> some<00:04:55.169> exhaust<00:04:55.770> fumes

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
here you can see some exhaust fumes

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.710 
here you can see some exhaust fumes
maybe<00:04:56.550> some<00:04:56.819> of<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.270> smoke<00:04:57.509> from<00:04:57.629> the

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
maybe some of the the smoke from the

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.170 
maybe some of the the smoke from the
squealing<00:04:58.229> tires<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:59.009> looking<00:04:59.669> at<00:04:59.759> the<00:04:59.880> front

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
squealing tires and looking at the front

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.790 
squealing tires and looking at the front
right<00:05:00.360> tire<00:05:00.599> of<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.930> police<00:05:01.139> car<00:05:01.319> to<00:05:01.500> the<00:05:01.590> left

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
right tire of the police car to the left

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.499 
right tire of the police car to the left
it<00:05:02.039> looks<00:05:02.430> like<00:05:02.699> it<00:05:02.819> could<00:05:03.000> have<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.210> flat<00:05:03.479> tire

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
it looks like it could have a flat tire

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.719 
it looks like it could have a flat tire
but<00:05:03.750> I'm<00:05:04.139> not<00:05:04.319> really<00:05:04.680> sure<00:05:04.830> and<00:05:05.400> then<00:05:05.520> one

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
but I'm not really sure and then one

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.430 
but I'm not really sure and then one
other<00:05:05.849> thing<00:05:06.120> i<00:05:06.240> noticed<00:05:06.599> guys<00:05:06.900> look<00:05:07.199> at<00:05:07.319> the

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
other thing i noticed guys look at the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.589 
other thing i noticed guys look at the
mirror<00:05:07.949> on<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.250> nice<00:05:08.880> car<00:05:09.180> in<00:05:09.449> the<00:05:09.509> middle

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
mirror on the nice car in the middle

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.080 
mirror on the nice car in the middle
there<00:05:09.900> you<00:05:10.380> can<00:05:10.530> see<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.770> reflection<00:05:11.099> of<00:05:11.729> some

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
there you can see a reflection of some

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.249 
there you can see a reflection of some
of<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.210> car<00:05:12.449> on<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:12.780> bottom<00:05:13.110> of<00:05:13.199> the

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
of the car on the bottom of the

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.020 
of the car on the bottom of the
reflection<00:05:13.680> and<00:05:13.830> then<00:05:14.220> like<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.550> sky<00:05:14.789> above

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
reflection and then like the sky above

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.520 
reflection and then like the sky above
it<00:05:15.210> but<00:05:15.569> then<00:05:15.720> look<00:05:15.870> in<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.050> mirror<00:05:16.289> on<00:05:16.500> the

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
it but then look in the mirror on the

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.709 
it but then look in the mirror on the
police<00:05:17.130> car<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.639> left<00:05:17.819> there<00:05:18.030> as<00:05:18.479> you<00:05:18.630> can

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
police car to the left there as you can

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:20.839 
police car to the left there as you can
see<00:05:18.900> there<00:05:19.199> isn't<00:05:19.500> really<00:05:19.620> a<00:05:19.770> reflection<00:05:20.039> it's

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
see there isn't really a reflection it's

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.939 
see there isn't really a reflection it's
totally<00:05:21.419> white<00:05:21.960> at<00:05:22.289> first<00:05:22.349> I<00:05:22.650> thought<00:05:22.800> that

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:22.949 
totally white at first I thought that

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:24.439 
totally white at first I thought that
maybe<00:05:23.069> it<00:05:23.280> was<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.639> reflection<00:05:24.210> from<00:05:24.330> the

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
maybe it was the reflection from the

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.330 
maybe it was the reflection from the
side<00:05:24.719> of<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.900> police<00:05:25.110> car<00:05:25.349> but<00:05:25.710> that<00:05:25.949> doesn't

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
side of the police car but that doesn't

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.680 
side of the police car but that doesn't
totally<00:05:26.460> make<00:05:26.729> sense<00:05:27.000> because<00:05:27.150> if<00:05:27.539> you<00:05:27.659> take

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
totally make sense because if you take

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.869 
totally make sense because if you take
our<00:05:27.960> viewing<00:05:28.289> angle<00:05:28.680> we<00:05:29.129> are<00:05:29.310> down<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.610> little

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:29.879 
our viewing angle we are down a little

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.790 
our viewing angle we are down a little
bit<00:05:30.060> below<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.389> mirror<00:05:30.750> so<00:05:31.139> if<00:05:31.169> anything<00:05:31.680> the

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
bit below the mirror so if anything the

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.010 
bit below the mirror so if anything the
reflection<00:05:32.370> should<00:05:32.550> be<00:05:32.699> of<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.180> windows<00:05:33.659> on

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
reflection should be of the windows on

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.350 
reflection should be of the windows on
the<00:05:34.050> cop<00:05:34.259> car<00:05:34.500> that's<00:05:35.490> not<00:05:35.669> really<00:05:35.909> important

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
the cop car that's not really important

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.879 
the cop car that's not really important
i'm<00:05:36.509> just<00:05:36.539> nitpicking<00:05:37.229> here<00:05:37.500> at<00:05:37.560> this<00:05:37.650> point

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:37.889 
i'm just nitpicking here at this point

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.620 
i'm just nitpicking here at this point
because<00:05:38.039> these<00:05:38.729> screenshots<00:05:39.120> are<00:05:39.449> so

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
because these screenshots are so

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.089 
because these screenshots are so
wonderful<00:05:40.139> that<00:05:40.409> you<00:05:40.530> almost<00:05:40.560> have<00:05:41.069> to

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
wonderful that you almost have to

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.769 
wonderful that you almost have to
