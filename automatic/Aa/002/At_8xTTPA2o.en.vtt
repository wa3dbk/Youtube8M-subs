00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.070
 I remember not so that I will use my 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:24.210
 favorite little feet everyone hi i just 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.510
 returned . 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.619
 and I received a parcel with alpha and I 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.090
 I think most likely because 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.590
 that it came from sweden 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.329
 every time I get a package 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.579
 say for any 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.989
 i.e. germany food from france that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.000
 sweden that never know well let's 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.090
 let's see what's inside my purchases 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.960
 made solely because I saw 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.660
 u mysql marazzi video as she did 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.550
 some kind of cocktail with mango and i just 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.690
 bought absolutely the same ingredients too 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.239
 coconut water 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.940
 the same proshkin also cocktails come in here 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.850
 manga spinach but these things i can just 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.729
 buy som local store so here 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 these I definitely could not find us anywhere 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.920
 so I decided to buy and this is like nantes 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.130
 never tried coconut at all 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.610
 water I often see coconut oil 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.060
 but she is very fat that is, it seems to me 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.689
 this is some other kind of concept as i am 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.340
 took the powder from running 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:33.590
 protein mix tastes shock and club 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.520
 cycle it too 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.020
 semolina orange and it was also for 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.649
 collaboration recipes 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.950
 and the last thing she mentioned is the highway 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.130
 and i'm on what it is but i also 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.180
 heard miranda feeds use 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.360
 their smoothie smoothie cocktails with some 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.880
 super food have no idea 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.070
 what he is and why it is needed but also 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.940
 will use also took a few 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:08.030
 ponder and things I usually choose 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.120
 just by typing or looking for someone 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.580
 they are bestsellers and I ran out of cream 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.590
 for the eyes I have a little left of 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.030
 benefit, I wanted to try something 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.530
 other more natural and 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.930
 and they have then any soler them either in the best 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.930
 better rated output this roll 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.530
 plastic looks so easy packaging 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.350
 and he has a very nice gel texture 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.840
 and my general favorite cream was from 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.030
 clinics in my opinion and do not remember was called my 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.640
 he goes in all probes and he is 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.980
 gel texture he would have it for dry 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.010
 skin also not over my left 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:50.450
 briar who loved very much but she 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.880
 damn it smelled like fish oil so decided 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.300
 try new oil I saw them have it 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.030
 with a rose a rose in general, in principle, my most 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.160
 favorite smell and i love pink 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.000
 tea is generally we are the most favorite pink 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.200
 its spirit 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.110
 my outta my favorit 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:14.780
 so I decided to take rose oil from 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:16.489
 baker brand I do not know I'll leave you all 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.470

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:25.040
 danube ostrich you are flamingo axel he 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.400
 he wrote in and in his packing 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:33.170
 oh my god if you were still pink 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.170
 yellow matter married it in oil i 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.180
 some probably feel a daisy 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.390
 even more than I would like but 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.190
 no less i will definitely tell you 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.100
 hope you see it in mine 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:51.680
 month favorites last isla is 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.570
 tonic with rose petals i just remember i 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.049
 never used tonic 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.750
 but for some reason I miss some 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.990
 some kind of pickaxe this pedometer 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.050
 my scrub my cleansing 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.370
 I use every evening and someone 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.610
 moisturizer 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.550
 This option came try tonic and also 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.310
 let's say that I think about him and this is very 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.220
 big pack probably like bioderma 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.340
 these are all my purchases of sugar I generally 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:25.730
 originally ordered a lot more from 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.740
 I was there for about 4 thousand there 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:32.140
 there was just a lot of food and I decided 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:35.510
 from all this misfortune to refuse because 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:40.450
 she's quite expensive coming out well 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:44.750
 I'm going to buy it here, but 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:47.150
 we came with her mother on to that, I do not 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.680
 considering it is not ordered but I need it 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.910
 so use four boxes of 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.100
 Bishkek 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.240
 interesting facts most family of Bishkek 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.000
 for us this is doubly more pleasant it is from 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.350
 brand bionic and i think it is very 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.140
 popular now getting there is 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.990
 grocery stores I saw the type of cap 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.860
 and in pharmacies and in often see it dried 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.840
 fruits 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:23.360
 I love this strawberry very much 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:26.300
 love apples and it's just the perfect thing 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.370
 especially for me and mom because I 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.280
 Here at the university I have a very 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.350
 long breaks or am i still not 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.720
 I can get used to the fact that you need a half 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.479
 hours just sit and listen to something and 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.290
 to do something I just chew on the threshold 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:46.790
 it is but a mother she works very long 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.500
 It happens from 11 to eight in the evening and she 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.990
 if at all why she is so thin 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.900
 because she doesn't eat anything here 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.729
 the secret so on her here are 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:06:00.240
 salvation that the car can breathe 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:03.509
 little at work keep and refuel 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.819
 when there is a minute and even today bought 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.009
 just your store and saw them 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:09.690
 appeared 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:13.710
 fruit chips it with banana they also 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.449
 eat peach with apple from strawberry but 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:20.300
 they didn't want to divide when enough 

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:24.710
 simple and i wanted to try now 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.710
 smells like a doctor's office 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.850
 I do not know what to say I do 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.430
 originally wanted to take you off a small 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.830
 block tell what's in my life 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:08.250
 happens but suddenly I received a parcel 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:11.060
 and it was helpful and see you very much 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.060
