00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.200
 in this class we will know the basic concepts for patrik the action had 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 Marquis numbering 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:11.160
 open the file 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.519
 textile appointment marques in the course folder 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:21.849
 When we open the file the frames provide the light system for the 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.169
 scene 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.569
 this appointment is the call of global illumination 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.160
 with it we can detect the zones of brightness that is the moment in the objects 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.660
 we realize in this scene that we are not producing shadows 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.660
 as we observed in the boxes of the scene 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.110
 we'll be growing each a palmini light on the scene 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.230
 this kind of light we spread to all directions 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.520
 not me now 'customer 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.910
 a light this year is that klein t 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.830
 we activate the paulin command and click anywhere on the list ahead 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.280
 hit touba and that ike on your site in nono 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.350
 and see that the nominate position changes as we position the light 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.620
 peace created light to unitau marques shuts off both global 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.980
 in this way the lusa with the clay does not interfere with the light that we created 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.729
 attention 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.450
 even if the light that was created is turned off the overall light will remain 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.690
 off 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.170
 note that the lights that were created 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 do not cast shadows on objects 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.049
 since the same rendering the scene 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.049
 we do not have just one day 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.079
 to view shadow projection 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.420
 we need to shoot only with one light parameter 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.040
 watch 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.900
 in command has nothing change fight 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.900
 michalis arinos brazil settings 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:17.309
 in the section we arrived note that the option ong is not marked 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.519
 we have option paulo we do not have any works of handel part 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.800
 however addressing the scene through the key is fine v 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.800
 we see indemnified lesker lawsuit 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.779
 until the 2009 version of the marques it is not possible to visualize that they are mere 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.779
 ship party 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:48.029
 in 2010 version we activated feature there they are god 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.029
 is this possible 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:56.219
 since this feature allows you to define faster halls of the scene 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.080
 changing the light parameters 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.080
 we have in real field the result 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:09.989
 let us now intend to intensify the Dutch to the Italian 

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:16.859
 the multiple reactor field responsible for the intensity of light emitted 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:23.049
 when to 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.999
 next to the multiplan it can cooperate the color of light 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.799
 this field calls if swat glue 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.099
 through the color configuration we can define the type of lamp 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.099
 when lighting indoor environments for example 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:49.049
 or we can determine how the environment gets cold 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.259
 the hot 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:59.899
 in the box we can add as many lights as necessary for a given 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:01.099
 scene 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.099
 and set up in debt increase its parameters 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.239
 there are numerous configuration options 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.840
 along with these parameters allied to materials and income they action 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:23.139
 can have as the final result a very close picture of a scene in the 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.439
 real world 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:30.110
 in this class we had with a brief introduction to the use of lights in 3d 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.199
 estimates 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.100
 we only approach the Portuguese the link and how to understand the interference 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.099
 of a light inside the box 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.969
 In future courses we will cover each type of existing light and its many 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:51.800
 parameters as a way to translate great images
