00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.659
 hello world welcome to reading conan and 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.659
 I am me and then my channel 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.560
 good in this new video I want to do 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.390
 the book preview of a book I read makes 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.980
 a long time with some fellow 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.540
 the office but it seems very cool 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.110
 to do the item and I saw a number one 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.110
 of my channel 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.939
 talking about my classmates I hope that 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.130
 they are watching this video a 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.770
 I hope for all I hope that they are the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.930
 first to share this video on 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.520
 The book you are going to talk about is each 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.520
 day is joel osteen's friday 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.000
 this book the general concept of this 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.220
 book is based on a study that was done 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.800
 that dictates that the happiness of 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.480
 people go up 10% on Fridays and 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.519
 that's because people are super 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.290
 excited and looking forward to the 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.690
 weekend and from there comes the title 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.790
 every day is friday they already do it 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.800
 the author assures that we all have what 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.360
 what it takes to be happy always 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.060
 and when we put our thoughts 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.240
 our perspective and another thing that 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.240
 never 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.759
 joel osteen is sure that all the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.560
 people of the world have what they 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.970
 you need to be happy always and 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.369
 when we put our thoughts 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.080
 our perspective and our attitude in 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.330
 the right place I think this book 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.149
 it is aimed at everyone because 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.820
 finally we all need that dose 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.110
 that pushes us that inspires us to 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.630
 be able to face the frustrations 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.369
 daily to be able to face the routine 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.229
 to be able to face all those things to 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.420
 what all of us somehow 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.429
 we face what the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.429
 author is joel you need personal 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.720
 who wrote this book is how they 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.940
 I was saying yesterday and the kings he is 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.920
 the pastor of the lakewood church that 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.140
 they are houston texas that he has already 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.420
 written another 5 new york times' of 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.399
 servers because he loves this book good them 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.290
 I'm telling you that it's free super easy to 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.149
 read because each chapter is divided 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.610
 in mini sections in small sections 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.340
 which I love because I still do not 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.020
 It makes it easier to absorb the concept that 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.330
 the writer is trying to place 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.250
 besides that prevents that from so many and 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.780
 so many laps in a single point too 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.670
 it seems super char this chubby has 370 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.100
 pages but believe me I really do not know 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.660
 it feels like it looks like a big book but 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.580
 they do not feel because the language with the 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.800
 I he writes is a super language 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.959
 simple then you do not use and words 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.450
 sophisticated that force us to reread 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.459
 the paragraphs but we went from one to 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.170
 each chapter and we understand what he 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.420
 you want to say then that's super easy 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.640
 you can read it fast and there's no 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.050
 need to go back and come back to try 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.790
 to understand what you're trying to 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.440
 say another thing that I thought super 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.450
 cool of this book is that joel 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.760
 uses many stories to be able 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.580
 illustrate your theory is not only how 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.440
 happy smile but really you 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.530
 shows as in everyday situations 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.980
 you can apply the theory of being able to live 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.080
 with contentment 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.500
 this book another thing that I thought was not 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.130
 have on facebook could classify this 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.019
 video this video could categorize this 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.330
 book as an inspirational book of 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.030
 those that push you that motivate you 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.739
 they tell you if you can I know that many 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.780
 people do not like this kind of 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.730
 books I thought that I did not even 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.769
 I read this book I actually 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.599
 he liked it very much because it is very easy to fall 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.900
 in the Monday routine on the 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.599
 complain laziness in boredom 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.700
 in that of how I do not like anything 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.739
 we are from life so 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.750
 definitely I highly recommend this 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.790
 book so that they read it slowly I know 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.260
 that I told you earlier that as 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.239
 it's so easy to read you can read it 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.220
 fast but it worked for me 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.290
 much better to read it slowly is 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.900
 say it would be very cool if you can read 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.430
 one of the mini sections in the morning 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.870
 after they eat breakfast 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.269
 of having lunch and resting 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.670
 comidita or before sleeping read one 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.680
 small mini section meditate about it 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.810
 and be able to put it into practice well and 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.879
 to finish on who you would give this 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.409
 book would give him this book of 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.659
 soon someone who is serving years 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.519
 I had not told you before this 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.650
 book is for all kinds of people to 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.630
 men for women for big for 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.250
 chiquis then I find an excellent 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.110
 birthday gift soon what 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.240

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.080
 I wish you to be very happy in this 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.539
 new year that you are also fulfilling 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.520
 I would give it to a person in a year 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.740
 new or something like that to tell you look 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.509
 start the year with enthusiasm and so that you 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.120
 like to read also because there are people who 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.160
 with a chubby of this is also scared 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.990
 If I were a boss, I would give it to him 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.419
 my employees because he talks a lot about 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.310
 how to maintain a good attitude during 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:51.110
 sometimes daily tasks is very 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.970
 difficult when someone has a job 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.560
 which is repetitive then it seems like a 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.090
 cool book for an employee because if 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.940

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.680
