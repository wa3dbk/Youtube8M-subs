well because he never actually existed
there's<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> reason<00:01:10.560> why<00:01:10.710> his<00:01:10.950> whole<00:01:11.220> black<00:01:11.610> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
there's a reason why his whole black is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.550 
there's a reason why his whole black is
put<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.450> first<00:01:12.689> place<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.380> that's

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
put here in the first place and that's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.640 
put here in the first place and that's
because<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.760> commemorates<00:01:15.509> how<00:01:16.080> good

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
because it more so commemorates how good

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.450 
because it more so commemorates how good
