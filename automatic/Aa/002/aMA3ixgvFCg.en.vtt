00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.089 
actually did that the first time it does
not<00:02:23.840> look<00:02:24.050> good<00:02:24.519> um<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:26.000> doesn't<00:02:26.209> look<00:02:26.420> like

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
not look good um it doesn't look like

the way hasbro does it and that's the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.250 
the way hasbro does it and that's the
goal<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.489> look<00:02:31.640> as<00:02:32.330> close<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.140> way

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
goal of this to look as close to the way

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.770 
goal of this to look as close to the way
hospital<00:02:33.530> as<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.220> can<00:02:34.450> then<00:02:35.450> you're<00:02:35.599> going<00:02:35.720> to

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.110 

okay<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.800> was<00:02:51.830> in<00:02:52.130> trim<00:02:52.790> off<00:02:52.940> your

okay so like I was in trim off your
excess<00:02:53.600> but<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.020> would<00:02:54.170> probably<00:02:54.350> use<00:02:54.560> fabric

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
excess but I would probably use fabric

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.490 
excess but I would probably use fabric
scissors<00:02:55.310> because<00:02:55.670> my<00:02:56.060> scissors<00:02:56.600> or<00:02:56.810> not

scissors because my scissors or not

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.250 
scissors because my scissors or not
working<00:02:58.570> probably<00:02:59.570> because<00:02:59.930> they're<00:03:00.110> not
