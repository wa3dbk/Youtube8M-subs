00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.860 
like a gold overlay to it's really
really<00:04:17.470> pretty<00:04:17.500> and<00:04:17.949> then<00:04:18.609> finally<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.690> color

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
really pretty and then finally the color

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.539

of<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.350> month<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.590> I've<00:04:20.799> just<00:04:21.070> didn't

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
of the month that I've just didn't

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.040 
of the month that I've just didn't
really<00:04:21.759> like<00:04:21.940> I<00:04:22.270> won't<00:04:22.539> say<00:04:22.690> of<00:04:22.810> the<00:04:22.900> month

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
really like I won't say of the month

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.620 
really like I won't say of the month
I'll<00:04:23.229> say<00:04:23.490> lately<00:04:24.490> I've<00:04:24.970> reward<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.389> couple

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
I'll say lately I've reward a couple

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.360 
I'll say lately I've reward a couple
times<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:26.020> just<00:04:26.169> have<00:04:26.919> come<00:04:27.190> to<00:04:27.280> the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
times and I just have come to the

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.860 
times and I just have come to the
conclusion<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.940> I<00:04:28.120> just<00:04:28.419> don't<00:04:28.630> really<00:04:28.720> like

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
conclusion that I just don't really like

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.249 
conclusion that I just don't really like
it<00:04:29.320> so<00:04:30.100> yeah<00:04:30.310> it's<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.669> early<00:04:31.150> rock<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.229> world

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
it so yeah it's the early rock the world

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.890 
it so yeah it's the early rock the world
I<00:04:32.770> just<00:04:33.520> don't<00:04:33.610> like<00:04:33.759> it<00:04:34.000> it's<00:04:34.150> too<00:04:34.270> grainy<00:04:34.570> for

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
I just don't like it it's too grainy for

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.529 
I just don't like it it's too grainy for
me<00:04:34.990> or<00:04:35.169> something<00:04:35.560> I<00:04:35.710> don't<00:04:35.860> know<00:04:36.180> maybe<00:04:37.180> if<00:04:37.449> I

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
me or something I don't know maybe if I

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.029 
me or something I don't know maybe if I
put<00:04:37.570> that<00:04:37.900> over<00:04:37.990> top<00:04:38.229> of<00:04:38.259> it<00:04:38.530> maybe<00:04:38.710> I'd<00:04:38.889> like

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
put that over top of it maybe I'd like

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.029 
put that over top of it maybe I'd like
it<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.490> just<00:04:39.820> doesn't<00:04:40.630> do<00:04:41.289> what<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:41.560> really<00:04:41.800> want
