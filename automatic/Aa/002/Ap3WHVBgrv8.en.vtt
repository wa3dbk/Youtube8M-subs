and<00:00:49.640> yeah<00:00:50.640> that's<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.780> happened<00:00:52.170> we

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and yeah that's what happened we

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.209 
and yeah that's what happened we
predicted<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.070> correctly<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.910> now<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
predicted it correctly and now it we I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
predicted it correctly and now it we I
did<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.090> there<00:00:57.270> would<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.600> knockout<00:00:57.989> to

did think there would be a knockout to
ya<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:59.100> whether<00:00:59.579> around<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:01.020> didn't

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
ya know whether around I really didn't

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.810 
ya know whether around I really didn't
think<00:01:01.379> there'd<00:01:01.710> be<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> knockout<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.609> like

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
I'm on Mayweather dead injured his hand

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.250 
I'm on Mayweather dead injured his hand
in<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> sixth<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.030> seventh-round<00:01:09.600> Lee<00:01:09.960> said

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
in the sixth or seventh-round Lee said

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.050 
in the sixth or seventh-round Lee said
so<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.950> could<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.250> had<00:01:11.400> something<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.880> do

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
so that could have had something to do

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
so that could have had something to do
with<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.570> didn't<00:01:12.869> look<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.049> he<00:01:13.380> was<00:01:13.409> going

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
with it it didn't look like he was going

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
with it it didn't look like he was going
to<00:01:13.740> really<00:01:14.070> knock<00:01:14.250> him<00:01:14.430> out<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.610> really<00:01:15.150> didn't

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
to really knock him out I really didn't

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.539 
to really knock him out I really didn't
see<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:15.900> he<00:01:16.049> hurt<00:01:16.290> his<00:01:16.409> hand<00:01:16.590> from<00:01:16.890> exactly

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
see what he hurt his hand from exactly

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
see what he hurt his hand from exactly
because<00:01:17.790> he<00:01:18.030> never<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.330> seemed<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> sit

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
because he never really seemed to sit

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
because he never really seemed to sit
down<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.680> his<00:01:19.799> punches<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.520> much<00:01:20.820> during<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
down on his punches that much during the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
down on his punches that much during the
mic<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.810> whatever<00:01:22.259> just<00:01:22.680> aggravating<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
mic but whatever just aggravating the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.580 
mic but whatever just aggravating the
old<00:01:23.700> injury<00:01:24.090> probably<00:01:24.659> as<00:01:24.840> he<00:01:25.140> did<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
old injury probably as he did in the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.999 
old injury probably as he did in the
Judith<00:01:25.950> I'd<00:01:26.130> also<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.810> best<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.439> question

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
Judith I'd also so it's best I question

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.649 
Judith I'd also so it's best I question
that<00:01:29.040> truthfully<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.729> wonder<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.270> good<00:01:30.509> his

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that truthfully I wonder how good his

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.350 
that truthfully I wonder how good his
power<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.049> at<00:01:31.560> 147<00:01:32.189> even<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:32.850> he<00:01:32.970> didn't<00:01:33.240> hurt

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
power is at 147 even if he didn't hurt

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.399 
power is at 147 even if he didn't hurt
his<00:01:33.509> hand<00:01:33.720> what

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
his hand what

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.959 
his hand what
the<00:01:34.499> mount<00:01:34.679> I<00:01:34.799> don't<00:01:35.009> know<00:01:35.130> he<00:01:35.490> sure<00:01:35.729> didn't

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
the mount I don't know he sure didn't

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.669 
the mount I don't know he sure didn't
look<00:01:35.999> very<00:01:36.479> determined<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.229> knock<00:01:37.409> him<00:01:37.590> out

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
look very determined to knock him out

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.859 
look very determined to knock him out
even<00:01:37.859> in<00:01:38.069> the<00:01:38.159> first<00:01:38.369> few<00:01:38.999> rounds<00:01:39.210> leading<00:01:39.719> up

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
even in the first few rounds leading up

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.569 
even in the first few rounds leading up
to<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.079> round<00:01:40.469> and<00:01:41.399> but<00:01:42.090> anyhow<00:01:42.509> he<00:01:42.569> clearly

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
to that round and but anyhow he clearly

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.609 
to that round and but anyhow he clearly
outboxed<00:01:44.579> his<00:01:44.759> man<00:01:45.000> easily<00:01:45.350> not<00:01:46.350> even<00:01:46.469> close

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
outboxed his man easily not even close

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.880 
outboxed his man easily not even close
