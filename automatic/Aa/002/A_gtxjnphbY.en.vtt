flash<00:00:57.660> video<00:01:00.289> I'm<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.500> sure<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:01.770> these<00:01:01.859> are

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
flash video I'm not sure if these are

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.119 
flash video I'm not sure if these are
just<00:01:02.219> bugs<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> websites<00:01:03.300> or<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.979> app

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
just bugs with the websites or the app

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.820 
just bugs with the websites or the app
but<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.210> some<00:01:06.390> reason<00:01:06.689> when<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.260> use<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.680> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
but for some reason when I use it it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.600 
but for some reason when I use it it
doesn't<00:01:07.860> play<00:01:09.619> volume<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.830> shows<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.369> video

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
doesn't play volume it shows the video

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.789 
doesn't play volume it shows the video
so<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:12.780> you're<00:01:12.960> just<00:01:13.140> using<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> access

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
so if I'm you're just using it to access

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.490 
so if I'm you're just using it to access
flash<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.610> will<00:01:14.729> Weds<00:01:14.939> websites<00:01:15.570> um<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
flash and it will Weds websites um and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.130 
flash and it will Weds websites um and
not<00:01:17.250> actual<00:01:18.090> video<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.990> probably

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
not actual video then this is probably

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.630 
not actual video then this is probably
good<00:01:19.439> right<00:01:19.470> now<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:20.009> definitely<00:01:20.430> check<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
good right now but definitely check it

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
good right now but definitely check it
out<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.590> updated<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.770> apps<00:01:22.950> I

almost<00:03:29.740> like<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.130> computer<00:03:31.620> so<00:03:35.520> this<00:03:36.520> looks<00:03:36.820> a

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
almost like a computer so this looks a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.610 
almost like a computer so this looks a
little<00:03:37.240> bit<00:03:37.510> laggy<00:03:37.930> er<00:03:39.960> and<00:03:40.960> not<00:03:41.200> as<00:03:41.350> polished

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
little bit laggy er and not as polished

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.370 
little bit laggy er and not as polished
as<00:03:42.010> view<00:03:42.220> brows<00:03:42.460> um<00:03:42.940> I'm<00:03:43.660> gonna<00:03:43.810> be<00:03:43.900> honest<00:03:44.230> I

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
as view brows um I'm gonna be honest I

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:54.260 
as view brows um I'm gonna be honest I
think<00:03:45.000> that's<00:03:49.350> puffin<00:03:50.350> is<00:03:51.870> paying<00:03:52.870> people<00:03:53.080> to

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
think that's puffin is paying people to

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.580 
think that's puffin is paying people to
add<00:03:55.270> reviews<00:03:56.260> great<00:03:56.680> reviews<00:03:57.130> because<00:03:57.370> it

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
add reviews great reviews because it

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.470 
add reviews great reviews because it
almost<00:03:59.590> seems<00:03:59.830> quite<00:04:00.460> odd<00:04:00.700> how<00:04:00.970> many<00:04:01.150> people

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
almost seems quite odd how many people

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.430 
almost seems quite odd how many people
are<00:04:01.570> giving<00:04:01.840> out<00:04:01.960> free<00:04:01.990> codes<00:04:02.800> on<00:04:03.220> their

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.040 
are giving out free codes on their
reviews<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:06.000> maybe<00:04:07.000> I'm<00:04:07.180> just<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.690> little<00:04:07.810> bit

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
reviews and maybe I'm just a little bit

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.630 
reviews and maybe I'm just a little bit
cautious<00:04:08.290> or<00:04:08.739> something<00:04:09.070> like<00:04:09.160> that<00:04:09.220> but

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
cautious or something like that but

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.300 
cautious or something like that but
that's<00:04:10.180> just<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.570> way<00:04:10.600> it<00:04:10.810> seems<00:04:11.050> to<00:04:11.140> me<00:04:11.350> so

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310
