always a little bit hesitant because I

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.320 
always a little bit hesitant because I

products<00:00:19.910> constantly<00:00:20.570> because<00:00:20.960> I<00:00:21.199> feel<00:00:21.710> like

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
products constantly because I feel like

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.330 
products constantly because I feel like
I<00:00:21.980> can<00:00:22.160> never<00:00:22.189> find<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.420> perfect<00:00:23.920> one<00:00:24.920> for<00:00:24.949> my

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
so sometimes shampoos can be a little

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.020 
so sometimes shampoos can be a little

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.439 
this is their Moroccan argan oil shampoo
and<00:00:49.039> conditioner<00:00:49.460> this<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:49.820> for<00:00:50.090> normal<00:00:50.420> to

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449

and conditioner this is for normal to
dry<00:00:50.840> damaged<00:00:51.710> or<00:00:51.980> curly<00:00:52.879> hair<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:53.870> very

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
dry damaged or curly hair so it's very

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.160 
dry damaged or curly hair so it's very
very<00:00:54.859> hydrating<00:00:55.609> which<00:00:55.789> is<00:00:56.000> wonderful<00:00:56.480> but<00:00:57.050> it

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
very hydrating which is wonderful but it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.220 
very hydrating which is wonderful but it
also<00:00:57.320> can<00:00:57.739> be<00:00:57.769> a<00:00:58.129> little<00:00:58.730> bit<00:00:58.879> heavy<00:00:59.180> for<00:00:59.570> me<00:00:59.719> so

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
also can be a little bit heavy for me so

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.319 
also can be a little bit heavy for me so
I<00:01:00.260> have<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:00.769> be<00:01:00.890> careful<00:01:01.070> one<00:01:01.969> thing<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:02.269> I

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
I have to be careful one thing that I

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.420 
I have to be careful one thing that I
like<00:01:02.510> about<00:01:02.539> these<00:01:02.960> is<00:01:03.199> that<00:01:03.440> they<00:01:03.710> are<00:01:03.739> gluten

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
like about these is that they are gluten

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.700 
like about these is that they are gluten
free<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:05.000> most<00:01:05.690> of<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:05.900> know<00:01:06.050> I<00:01:06.080> have<00:01:06.320> celiac

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
products that are gluten free that could

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.179
