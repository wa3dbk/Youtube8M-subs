00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.250
 dear Mrs. Springer 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.680
 dear Mr. Schächter 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.009
 dear laureate of the golden camera 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.469
 Dear friend 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.469
 and guests Dr 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.039
 I'm Dan rek 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.009
 he says in late 2008 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.739
 the golden camera 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.849
 along with all the other big Axel Springer celebrate for a year 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.809
 and disappeared in the truest sense of the word from the scene 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.770
 and the big stage 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.260
 Now we are rested again 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.830
 but here and there the core changes quite the same 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.940
 Separation makes you want to see us again 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.120
 we celebrate with them for the first time 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120
 together on a Saturday night 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.120
 judging by the promise of Khota 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.950
 the highest in the history of the golden camera 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.950
 they like that very much 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.970
 like 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.580
 does ours 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.040
 four and a half million readers of the Hörzu 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.440
 the only one that has been in existence for a year from our new chief editor Cristiane 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.620
 Hellmann is produced 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.810
 since Christian Hellmann makes the Hörzu 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.890
 increase market shares 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.860
 and partly even edition he hears congratulations Herr Herrmann 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.930
 I'm off 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.930
 But that was not just the golden camera No 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.140
 This also seemed like the Light Me Do Thi 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.700
 of the past year for quality television and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.200
 To have been quality journalism 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.729
 in any case, according to the fire at home 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.660
 private tv stations without news and own productions 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.360
 Internationalism without journalists Magazines without circulation 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.170
 commercials 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.140
 without advertisement 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.240
 the glass 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.780
 was in 2000 and 9 for most 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.989
 definitely 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.069
 half empty 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.640
 I'll be there 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.919
 but said proudly 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.349
 the biggest media revolution we have seen since the invention of television 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 maybe even since Gutenberg experience 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.869
 creative and wheeler Kerner lists and merchants 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:34.269
 Living in the middle of the digital revolution 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.419
 the classic television evening 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.319
 just as changed as the crackling newspaper picture new 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:47.589
 we have the incredible luck to create this future with our own 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:48.889
 to design 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.489
 something more exciting 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.819
 I can not imagine 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.569
 how does it look like, for example, the first moving image production 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.779
 for the iPad 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.229
 the new miracle thing from Apple 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.869
 I had the luck on Wednesday in San Francisco to own the thing in my own hands 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:04.729
 to have 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:11.049
 and I'm sure it will change television and reading a bit further 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.049
 and how will they be the new narrative form Arte for mobile 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.599
 and internet 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.959
 and what role do we play the TV channels 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.309
 and the publishers in ten years the future is open 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.409
 it lies 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.319
 it is in our hands to shape it 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.439
 let us be just as much fun as tonight 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.069
 because one thing is certain 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.029
 the joy of celebrating the clock human need to be together 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.590
 it will never be digital but always 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.919
 stay the same 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.129
 and therefore 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.069
 We had them with the golden camera from Hörzu 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.050
 continue a prize gala 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.989
 at the highest level 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.139
 to honor the best of them every year 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.089
 I'm off 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:09.659
 that said too 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.649
 Of course Kerkeling have 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:14.560
 Germany's biggest all-rounder 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.650
 Comedian book author singer parodist 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.469
 Actor cabaret queen 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.599

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:24.849

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:25.740
 FASZ 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.789
 Loriot Actor Year 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.979
 his big career started with a little for 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.100
 When twelve year old wanted to have necessarily the role relations Tiki in 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.120
 with Loriot's sketch Christmas 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.529
 at Hoppenstedt's game 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.930
 was taken on his place a girl 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.639
 instead of overnight success 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.389
 Our moderator worked with that are the and diligence very much 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.210
 has been standing today 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.650
 we are very proud 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.780
 and look forward to giving the 45th golden camera from Hörzu 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.840
 to be allowed to celebrate 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.830
 welcome with us our new presenter Ape Kerkeling 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.009
 Yes 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.589
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:33.259
 that's crazy love but it's not the show yet so short you 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:34.010
 not 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.540
 I'll come out again soon 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.029
 I welcome you very warmly 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:44.539
 Ward have called Orna of the Course it as a verb and tonight I believe 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.059
 as far as I can remember in the last 20 years 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.809
 It has only happened once that the golden camera was broadcast live 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:54.610
 Tonight is a live broadcast that has advantages 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.650
 and that also has disadvantages 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.189
 the advantage of having a live broadcast is you can not cut anything out 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.229
 the disadvantage is 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.379
 yes one can not be enough so we stay with the same topic around it 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:13.930
 inasmuch as it's easy as that of course the picture you buy goes to the satellite 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.409
 to the ZDF satellite hovering just above Greenland 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.939
 then he comes at some point a tenth of a second delay in the audience 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:27.379
 Something unexpected should happen to them to possess, including God's will 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.479
 Did he say what does she look like? 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.859
 Tenth of a second time to reorganize their facial features 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:39.949
 the hall will be bigger than he really is on TV 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:45.520
 Christian he is very small that means for you you are almost always in the past 

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:46.199
 Yes 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.199
 they are actually always seen in close-up 

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:55.329
 Television makes DK that's what I say to the Finn at first 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.270
 Dennis Plagegeist comes up 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.189
 do me the favor 

00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:07.439
 Just revenge yourself as if you have not seen me the one or the other 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.440
 other Desire maybe quite as simple 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.119
 Taylor is very slim something like that 

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:14.940
 It's show business, we're not kidding 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.820
 We are especially honored by the international guests 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.810
 once election campaign now suggested admonished before the evening of the birth show on 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.900
 Main gate and we'll see each other ladies and gentlemen, we press ourselves 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.700
 Fingers crossed and they think the live live live the same all the time 

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.760
 Pleasure in the broadcast
