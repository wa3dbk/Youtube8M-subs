00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.769
 hello today talk to you about 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.389
 company southern cross written on 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.349
 box guaranteed quality and 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.780
 handwork 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.609
 I personally believed that their quality 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.390
 really very high and that 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.930
 work with them 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.570
 hand sign I'm here with the second model from 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.789
 companies southern cross and both knives are very and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.060
 I was very pleased pleased 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.260
 in terms of quality, this is the form given 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.380
 the knife comes that concerning the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.600
 say you need something you need are made of leather in 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.320
 skin and smell there is some kind of suspension 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.489
 the possibility of two options for wearing well I 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 I would not say that this is something beyond 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.190
 especially just quite decent needed 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.809
 But with such a deep landing 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.520
 would not hurt here in my opinion 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.289
 countryman for this to be comfortable with him 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.719
 take on the principle and so the knife is convenient 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.910
 removed and conveniently immediately placed in 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.859
 the hand that is to no 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.979
 complaints and absolutely no complaints 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.020
 means about the knife 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.479
 In this case, this model is boron m to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.869
 this shows a model you can in 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.030
 Generally the difference is a little bit but 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.700
 more worth paying attention to what 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.590
 Do you prefer what you like more ? 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.170
 only externally that is the most 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.720
 The main thing is the quality I like here 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.830
 noticed any major differences 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.939
 here as we see 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.030
 brass apparently means goes further 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.140
 Karelian birch and Karelian birch 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.409
 Birch tree 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.409
 here stabilized how to say 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.240
 in my opinion on the models and you can 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.119
 who was with me she was a little bit 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.840
 simpler anyway 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.720
 Karelian birch well behaved 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.119
 proven material and he to me 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.159
 orbit our Russian knives especially 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.939
 like a lanyard hole 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.140
 a lot done very seriously 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.750
 regarding the ergonomics of the handle 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.259
 which is very important for a knife with a fixed 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.299
 blade 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.960
 ergonomics are great here i mean this 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.509
 classic forms perfectly fill 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.630
 why palm is nothing mine is not us on it 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.030
 nothing prevents and any knife grip 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.400
 fits perfectly in the hand that is absolutely 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.650
 I have no complaints about this but 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.590
 it's like a classic something actually 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.709
 should have expected the blade themselves 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.480
 a little bit with concave descents you 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.530
 can also be seen on video 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.390
 some such a concavity at the descent 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.480
 in the blade the steel here is the same 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.530
 440c used 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.940
 made in Russia you need to understand what it is 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.580
 American is initially corrosive 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.739
 resistant, except for 100 bearing steel 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.480
 she is known for being very high on 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.709
 its corrosion resistance 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.459
 and despite the fact that it is very high 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.489
 corrosion resistant it is still very 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.890
 wear resistant durable solid second 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.840
 half of the 60s it is steel 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.930
 used for making blades 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.010
 and for a long time this steel remained 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.560
 best for knives 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.350
 that is, personally top knives such steel 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.230
 put and how would she really 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.390
 for many years it was the best then of course 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.430
 it was replaced by new ones more 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.360
 more expensive and more high-tech 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.299
 alloys 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.320
 powder steel but still 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.450
 it became very popular worthy 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.989
 attention and worthy overall on a lively 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.660
 material 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.610
 That is, from such here not powder steel 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.680
 stainless steel is steel at the very 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.530
 business is very good just to be very 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.299
 correctly and well thermo processed in 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.010
 heat treatment claims to the south 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.560
 cross I could not have experience 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.600
 use a small but that knife 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.480
 which was from steel d2 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.390
 you can he showed himself very well in 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.239
 cutting edge retention plan 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.459
 overall cut here but what's great 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.560
 cuts ie in this case information 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.420
 knife in 0 3 millimeters sometimes me even 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.390
 it seemed when measuring how not to 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.650
 less by 0 3 millimeters here after all 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.810
 knife reduction again concave descents 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.489
 and the cut here is really good 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.430
 aggressive ie knife fails then 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.370
 there is everything done competently on the butt here 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.799
 honest 4 millimeter so the knife 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.489
 turns out very versatile so it 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.519
 you can use the combination 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.109
 in their work and for work on some 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.849
 even a product that is principle knife 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:30.150
 allows you to cut comfortably and 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:37.849
 really well then let 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:45.919
 weigh the weight of this knife 158 grams weight 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:45.919
 157 grams weight with scabbard 235 grams 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.800
 for these I am very pleased that our 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.020
 Russian manufacturers do now 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.349
 very high-quality knives and even ask for 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.069
 not in principle reasonable money 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:04.139
 carry 46 millimeters and see the total length 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.789
 120 somewhere 7 millimeters maybe 8 not 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.830
 I see the length of the blade 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.620
 Well, the length of the cutting edge of the guitar is not 120 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.050
 millimeters here it turns out but quite 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.520
 such a working yourself a knife up to maybe 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.349
 wanted for great brutality and 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.150
 Charisma is more serious there stop need 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.729
 understand that our immediately would be cold 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.389
 weapon case he is not 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.969
 you can eat it 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.620
 allowed to wear free to use and 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:30.300
 it is also very well in its own way means 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.880
 bolster brass it in general then he 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.340
 spoke actually nizhny Novgorod 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.349
 guys make quality knives and 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.360
 choosing from Russian manufacturers 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:41.669
 now there really are 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.530
 choose that is here's the southern cross one of 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.150
 those who make really good 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.550
 knives that can be taken in my opinion 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.110
 feel free to thank the company to cut him for 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.690
 the provision of this knife for review 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.690
 Thanks to the subscribers for watching bye
