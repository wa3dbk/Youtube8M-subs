00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.950
 or the world today itself for I have 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.530
 a new video this time with the 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.830
 translation of motown craft 4 as ya 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.230
 I promised have been more than 1800 or about 1800 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.029
 lines of code to translate the truth 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.829
 a very important job but 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.359
 well he's finally here so what 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.640
 I will do is going to be explain how 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.140
 you have to install this translation the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.150
 you have to install for now because 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.310
 have not yet updated the mod with the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.630
 translation but for you to believe it 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.730
 I have here this is the official website 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.370
 You see dancing peralta a craft is that of 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.980
 aza nor and here I have all the lines of 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.600
 code that translated is worth then 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.880
 you know there are so many now I'm 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.580
 happening here very fast but you see that 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.500
 there is a lot of text worth to go 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.480
 translating as I tell you the last 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.570
 version 4.3 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.790
 and nothing like you see, it does exactly 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.610
 18 minutes I have uploaded this update 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.159
 we will have to wait for the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.840
 validate and surely validate it for 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.270
 the next version of town that now 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.400
 same are in the we are in the 4.2 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.970
 point 3.3 so we'll have to wait 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.759
 some time and while we wait for that 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.380
 time to be officially validated and 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.360
 we can download what I'm going to do 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.280
 is to leave them in the description of the video 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.800

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.509

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.340
 is the translation that I just made 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.920
 ok I'm going to open it with this editor 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.020
 text and as you see translation by dancing 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.369
 pear tree and here you have everything again like that 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.380
 that what I'm going to do now is going to be 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.869
 that explain how to install 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.399

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.020
 we'll run minecraft to see what 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.520
 it works okay so saying that we 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.259
 we will download the latest version of minecraft 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.479
 on this page that is the official website 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.039
 I'm going to leave it in the video and you 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.780
 You will also have to download this 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.580
 small file description of the 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.679
 video that is the translation so I've 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.850
 saying this we're going to install them what 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.130
 first though 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.890
 for minecraft 1.7 point 10 we give to 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.710
 start and let's write app percentage 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.869
 data percentage we're going to go to the 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.510
 point folder minecraft and here opens a 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.060

 we have the installed mode as you see 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.040
 we still do not have it in Spanish I'm going to 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.040

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.110
 let's run minecraft very well already 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.880

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.140
 town craft 4 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.300

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.340
 achievement of the inventory we are going to go to the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.080
 right and as you can see I have here the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.850
 telegraph installed apart from the two 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.800
 better ways but good we're going to 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.230
 focus on the town craft as you see us 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.150
 all objects appear here and now 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.100
 same all the objects of the new 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.470
 version as you see we have these flags 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.590
 we also have absolutely everything 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.930
 all the clothes of the point meats and of the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.130
 crim are lime so as you see is in 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.170
 English what are we going to do 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.959
 let's give options and here the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.940
 language let's select Spanish from 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.980
 Spain 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.210
 we will give done now when 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.190
 place done 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.030
 we are going to give it again to detract and as 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.920
 You see there are parts in Spanish that 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.900
 it was from my previous translation but there's 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.760
 things that would still be 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.470
 translated you see how this is here 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.140
 in English and to have it what 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.780
 let's finish seeing we're going to come here with 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.670
 I'm not going to open the chamo 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.200
 and apart from the noise this is not going to 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.850
 say you see there are new things 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.130
 they are in English because they are in 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.580
 English because we have not yet installed 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.470
 that we have installed the file 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.510
 text is worth it so now we're going to 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.700
 leave and what we are going to do is open 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.920
 this folder called mods and here we have 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.850

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.790
 right to open with and winrar very 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.880
 ok we appear this folder we go 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.640
 to go to the assets folder here until a 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.470
 craft and here in the pnc what we are going to 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.709
 have to do is copy this file 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.750
 de espaÃ±a 'so we give ok 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.600
 is going to overwrite them and now if 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.040
 we can run minecraft again and 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.500
 now we will have everything absolutely 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.020
 all translated 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.660
 we are here again minecraft 1.7 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.090
 motorbike 10 or a player we give th 4 already 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.370
 we had created it a moment ago and 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.320
 we return to our world as you see is the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.960
 that we had created we are going to give to 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.670
 I'm not with me and as you see again 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.070
 we have all this in this case already 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.810
 would be in Spanish and even what already 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.300
 we had before that I was in 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.580
 English you see the crimson cult right now 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.290
 we have it already translated again great 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.990
 part of this book is written with a 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.790
 thin and unintelligible handwriting worth 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.100
 if you go looking at everything else eldridge 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.500
 all this is the new beige for the 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.120

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.700
 all epiphany eldridge as you see all 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.070
 is in Spanish so nothing is just going to 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.440
 well nothing to have to enjoy it core 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.419
 in butcher all the new things that 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.570
 had for this version are translated 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.669

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.500
 is to enjoy a little in this way the 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.969
 truth that has many things I suppose 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.369
