the<00:02:44.130> easiest<00:02:44.430> way<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.610> probably<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.270> put

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
the easiest way is probably just to put

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.830 
the easiest way is probably just to put
NFC<00:02:46.050> here<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.670> easiest<00:02:48.270> way<00:02:48.360> with<00:02:48.570> Android

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
NFC here so the easiest way with Android

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.960 
NFC here so the easiest way with Android
usually<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.230> then<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.410> can<00:02:49.530> really<00:02:49.710> just

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
usually and then you can really just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.210 
usually and then you can really just
connect<00:02:50.970> here<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:55.290> we<00:02:55.380> can<00:02:55.560> play<00:02:55.710> again<00:02:56.100> with
