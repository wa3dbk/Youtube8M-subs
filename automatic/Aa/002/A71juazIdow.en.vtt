works in free for all because of how

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.540 
works in free for all because of how
hectic<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:40.900> because<00:02:41.800> obviously<00:02:41.980> have<00:02:42.340> 10

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
hectic it is because obviously have 10

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.650 
hectic it is because obviously have 10
people<00:02:42.700> running<00:02:43.120> around<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.330> map<00:02:43.510> and

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
people running around the map and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.949 
people running around the map and
everyone<00:02:44.020> uses<00:02:44.410> mainly<00:02:44.950> Nash's<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.840> can

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
everyone uses mainly Nash's and you can

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.570 
everyone uses mainly Nash's and you can
just<00:02:47.110> tell<00:02:47.290> from<00:02:47.320> this<00:02:47.500> gameplay<00:02:47.800> how<00:02:48.220> crazy

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
just tell from this gameplay how crazy

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.490 
just tell from this gameplay how crazy
free<00:02:48.970> for<00:02:49.180> always<00:02:49.300> alright<00:02:50.020> so<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.290> definitely

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
free for always alright so I definitely

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.199 
free for always alright so I definitely
feel<00:02:50.830> like<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.100> single<00:02:51.370> weapon<00:02:51.700> loadout

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
feel like the single weapon loadout

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.710 
feel like the single weapon loadout
system<00:02:52.540> works<00:02:52.810> in<00:02:53.080> judge<00:02:53.410> in<00:02:53.800> free<00:02:54.040> throw<00:02:54.720> but

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
system works in judge in free throw but

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.620 
system works in judge in free throw but
the<00:02:55.870> classic<00:02:56.350> loadout<00:02:56.739> system<00:02:57.160> if<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.270> were<00:02:58.420> to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
the classic loadout system if it were to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.990 
the classic loadout system if it were to
return<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.350> would<00:02:59.860> probably<00:03:00.100> will<00:03:00.459> work<00:03:00.700> in

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
return it would probably will work in

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.060 
return it would probably will work in
team<00:03:01.330> deathmatch<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:02.080> domination<00:03:02.620> from

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
team deathmatch and domination from

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.070 
team deathmatch and domination from
playing<00:03:03.459> domination<00:03:04.150> there's<00:03:04.660> been<00:03:04.870> many

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
playing domination there's been many

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.170 
playing domination there's been many
examples<00:03:05.650> like<00:03:06.100> for<00:03:06.340> instance<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.940> first

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
examples like for instance the first

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.930 
examples like for instance the first
thing<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.360> pops<00:03:07.630> into<00:03:07.810> my<00:03:07.989> head<00:03:08.020> is<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:09.070> when

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
thing that pops into my head is the when

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.280 
thing that pops into my head is the when
you're<00:03:10.030> playing<00:03:10.209> domination<00:03:10.959> on<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.140> map

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
you're playing domination on the map

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.650 
you're playing domination on the map
gondola<00:03:11.800> which<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.610> kind<00:03:13.239> of<00:03:13.300> like<00:03:13.420> the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
gondola which is kind of like the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.140 
gondola which is kind of like the
judgment<00:03:14.140> new<00:03:14.320> escalation<00:03:15.070> obviously<00:03:15.610> being

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
judgment new escalation obviously being

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.310 
judgment new escalation obviously being
up<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.750> down<00:03:16.959> map<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:18.390> had<00:03:19.390> be<00:03:19.630> captured<00:03:20.170> and

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
up and down map you had be captured and

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.560 
up and down map you had be captured and
you're<00:03:20.709> at<00:03:20.950> digger<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:22.269> have<00:03:22.420> that

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
you're at digger and you have that

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.060 
you're at digger and you have that
situation<00:03:22.840> where<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.350> can<00:03:23.470> drop<00:03:23.650> down<00:03:23.860> into

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
situation where you can drop down into

sea to stop the other enemy team capping
it<00:03:27.160> but<00:03:27.760> imagine<00:03:28.090> if<00:03:28.209> you<00:03:28.299> have<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.510> shotgun

it but imagine if you have the shotgun

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.120 
it but imagine if you have the shotgun
and<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.230> don't<00:03:29.440> want<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.620> do<00:03:29.769> that<00:03:29.799> because

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
and you don't want to do that because

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.979 
and you don't want to do that because
you'll<00:03:30.400> say<00:03:30.580> there's<00:03:31.420> like<00:03:31.480> four<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.900> them

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
you'll say there's like four of them

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.470 
you'll say there's like four of them
down<00:03:32.170> there<00:03:32.380> if<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:33.130> had<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.489> rifle<00:03:34.000> back<00:03:34.180> if

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
down there if you had that rifle back if

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.030 
down there if you had that rifle back if
you<00:03:34.630> had<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:34.930> classical<00:03:35.380> loadout<00:03:35.680> system

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
you had that classical loadout system

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.680 
you had that classical loadout system
you<00:03:36.580> would<00:03:36.760> be<00:03:36.850> able<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.060> do<00:03:37.180> something<00:03:37.480> to

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
you would be able to do something to

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.880
