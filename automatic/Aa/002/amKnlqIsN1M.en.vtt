eventually of wear and tear continuously
having<00:01:35.100> depress<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.970> feels<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.540> little

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
having depress that it feels a little

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.060 
having depress that it feels a little
bit<00:01:36.840> fragile<00:01:37.110> at<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.619> button<00:01:38.810> but<00:01:39.810> anyway<00:01:40.350> as

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
bit fragile at that button but anyway as

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.190 
bit fragile at that button but anyway as
for<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.430> actual<00:01:41.850> five<00:01:42.329> finger<00:01:42.689> swipe<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.110> go

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
for the actual five finger swipe to go

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560 
for the actual five finger swipe to go
back<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.979> home<00:01:44.369> screen<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.939> think<00:01:45.420> that's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
back to the home screen I think that's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690 
back to the home screen I think that's
fantastic<00:01:46.170> idea<00:01:46.439> as<00:01:46.530> well<00:01:46.560> finally<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> mean

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
fantastic idea as well finally I mean

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.760 
fantastic idea as well finally I mean
this<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.000> really<00:01:48.329> really<00:01:48.689> smart<00:01:49.259> thinking<00:01:49.649> on

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
this is really really smart thinking on

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.550 
this is really really smart thinking on
Apple's<00:01:50.070> behalf<00:01:50.600> now<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> moment<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> home

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
Apple's behalf now the moment the home

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.749 
Apple's behalf now the moment the home
button<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.460> point<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
button is a kind of a point of

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.880 
button is a kind of a point of
contention<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.450> among<00:01:55.079> these<00:01:55.229> rumors<00:01:55.710> is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
contention because among these rumors is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.620 
contention because among these rumors is
that<00:01:56.040> Apple<00:01:56.310> may<00:01:56.460> actually<00:01:56.670> get<00:01:57.000> rid<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.329> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
that Apple may actually get rid of the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.780 
that Apple may actually get rid of the
home<00:01:57.810> button<00:01:58.049> all<00:01:58.229> together<00:01:58.439> now<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.520> terms<00:01:59.549> of

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
home button all together now in terms of

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.090 
home button all together now in terms of
the<00:01:59.880> home<00:02:00.030> button<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.450> iPad<00:02:00.920> well<00:02:01.920> they

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the home button on the iPad well they

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.920 
the home button on the iPad well they
could<00:02:02.280> do<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.490> changing<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.180> either<00:02:03.329> making<00:02:03.780> it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
could do it changing in either making it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.929 
could do it changing in either making it
larger<00:02:04.110> or<00:02:04.469> making<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.430> kind<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.790> a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
larger or making it a kind of a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.380 
larger or making it a kind of a
multi-touch<00:02:07.069> kind<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.160> all<00:02:08.340> glass<00:02:08.819> button

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
multi-touch kind of all glass button

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.180 
multi-touch kind of all glass button
basically<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.140> would<00:02:10.349> be<00:02:10.530> flush<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
basically that would be flush with the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.369 
basically that would be flush with the
device<00:02:11.660> unfortunately<00:02:12.660> those<00:02:12.870> buttons<00:02:13.230> will

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
device unfortunately those buttons will

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.880 
device unfortunately those buttons will
only<00:02:13.500> work

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
only work

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.580 
only work
when<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.160> device<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.430> operating<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
when the device is operating so you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.020 
when the device is operating so you
won't<00:02:16.800> be<00:02:16.950> able<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.220> actually<00:02:17.370> do<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> hardware

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
won't be able to actually do a hardware

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.550 
won't be able to actually do a hardware
reset<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.780> can't<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.140> moment<00:02:19.470> if<00:02:19.530> you

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
reset like you can't the moment if you

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.350

need to do every set on the rice by

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.059 
need to do every set on the rice by
holding<00:02:21.660> down<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.230> power<00:02:22.260> button<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.980> the

holding down the power button and the
home<00:02:23.430> button<00:02:23.819> at<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.090> same<00:02:24.150> time<00:02:24.540> when<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
home button at the same time when the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.770 
home button at the same time when the
device<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.110> off<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:26.280> from<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:27.000> returning<00:02:27.750> to

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
device is off so from a returning to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.180 
device is off so from a returning to
factory<00:02:28.230> settings<00:02:28.650> point<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.040> view<00:02:29.160> that

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
factory settings point of view that

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.760 
factory settings point of view that
could<00:02:29.610> be<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> problem<00:02:29.940> but<00:02:30.870> i<00:02:30.930> think<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
could be a problem but i think that the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.320 
could be a problem but i think that the
ipad<00:02:31.920> button<00:02:32.580> is<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> little<00:02:32.940> bit<00:02:33.060> too<00:02:33.180> small

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
ipad button is a little bit too small

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.850 
ipad button is a little bit too small
it's<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.720> same<00:02:33.930> size<00:02:34.170> as<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> one<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
it's the same size as the one on the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.830 
it's the same size as the one on the
iphone<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.730> some<00:02:36.300> people<00:02:36.540> have<00:02:36.630> said<00:02:36.810> that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
iphone so and some people have said that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.420 
iphone so and some people have said that
it's<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> wrong<00:02:37.410> place<00:02:37.770> they<00:02:38.010> prefer<00:02:38.280> it

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
it's in the wrong place they prefer it

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.560 
it's in the wrong place they prefer it
in<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.610> different<00:02:38.790> location<00:02:38.970> when<00:02:39.450> they're

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
in a different location when they're

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.560 
in a different location when they're
holding<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:41.370> real<00:02:41.640> issue<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:42.000> think<00:02:42.120> if

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
holding it the real issue I think if

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.300 
holding it the real issue I think if
they<00:02:42.690> do<00:02:42.750> get<00:02:43.200> rid<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.500> incidentally<00:02:44.040> here's<00:02:44.250> a

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
they do get rid of incidentally here's a

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.130 
they do get rid of incidentally here's a
picture<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.910> what<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.569> ipad<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.050> iphone

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
picture of what the ipad and iphone

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.570 
picture of what the ipad and iphone
would<00:02:46.440> look<00:02:46.560> like<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.890> digger<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.430> home

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
would look like in a digger the home

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.690 
would look like in a digger the home
screen<00:02:47.910> if<00:02:48.660> they<00:02:48.989> get<00:02:49.140> got<00:02:49.500> rid<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.709> them<00:02:49.950> i

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
screen if they get got rid of them i

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.120 
screen if they get got rid of them i
think<00:02:51.090> will<00:02:51.209> be<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.360> problem<00:02:52.080> for<00:02:52.440> new<00:02:52.890> users

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
think will be a problem for new users

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.970 
think will be a problem for new users
because<00:02:53.700> right<00:02:53.970> now<00:02:54.200> when<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.470> pick<00:02:55.739> up<00:02:55.890> the

with these devices and the operating

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.000
