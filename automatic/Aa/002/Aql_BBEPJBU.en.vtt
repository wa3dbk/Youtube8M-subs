 to have to experience 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.070
 Kamer 2 2 is because of which the questions answer 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.790
 Can I ever switch to my hardware with my soft 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.470
 and how do you get at the data 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.790
 on the new Windows 7 systems 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.550
 In addition, the zoo I have so much aged Indus XP Calculator 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.360
 taken and SCK 8 years old 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.870

 does Clemens Dold mean I should have a bit more RAM 2 percent too 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.870
 to clarify the hard drive also and the graphics card's not synonymous 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.340
 withstand 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.650
 This means that exactly this system is needed for the industry 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.820
 I should go here 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 probably even buy a new system 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.670
 is very popular and a more recent Windows Vista calculator note too 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.670
 You are counting this now four years old

 Some programs need to be replaced by new ones 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.970
 be2 ​​device drivers I pulled findes image still running 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.850
 two programs RW I eat it not compatible 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.140
 no problem 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.670
 The direct link leads to an offer rejected where it is already compatible 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.560
 softer there 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.849
 take now again the XP calculator and would like my existing ones here 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.429
 Data does not create his disfigurement personal information 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:18.069
 that is transferred to the new computer, I use Win the 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.409
 Seas the trends for 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.509
 the checked computer takes all user accounts 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:27.829
 of course I still can customize files or folders is more real 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.339
 if you want or possibly want to exclude 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.810
 and last on USB disk 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.909
 saved 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.919
 on the target computer, the created file is double-clicked 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.399
 and the previously backed up files 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.809
 will be transferred to the new system 

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:48.549
 subsequently 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.709
 let them still show what was transferred pc-user his list of programs 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.909
 the warmth still 90 missing and I may still staged after 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.499
 would like to 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:00.249
 just everything again 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.519
 Schulz quoted as before 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.519
 in a transfer Brig I can still let me ads 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:08.369
 Which 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.089
 Element which was consequently transferred 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.089
 Intersil filter program emergence 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.290
 So do not be afraid of migration, a switch from XP to Windows 7 »succeeds 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.139
 fast and easy
