00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
had something called a hey box they did

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.280 
had something called a hey box they did
the<00:00:32.790> same<00:00:32.820> thing<00:00:33.030> they<00:00:33.360> had<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> box<00:00:33.809> they<00:00:34.079> put

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the same thing they had a box they put

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.810 
the same thing they had a box they put
hey<00:00:34.500> around<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.130> they<00:00:35.280> put<00:00:35.489> their<00:00:35.640> foot

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
hey around it then they put their foot

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.970 
hey around it then they put their foot
in<00:00:35.969> food<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.750> was<00:00:36.870> hot<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.350> cook

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
in food in there that was hot and cook

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.500 
in food in there that was hot and cook
it<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.280> they<00:00:38.489> went<00:00:38.700> throughout<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.329> day<00:00:39.480> so

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it as they went throughout the day so

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.670 
it as they went throughout the day so
it's<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.710> new<00:00:41.550> theory<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.989> we've<00:00:43.200> improved

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
it's not a new theory but we've improved

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.549 
it's not a new theory but we've improved
on<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:43.950> greatly<00:00:44.450> so<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.780> do<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.289> boil

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
on it greatly so what you do is you boil

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.340 
on it greatly so what you do is you boil
your<00:00:46.950> your<00:00:47.700> food<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.360> few<00:00:48.690> minutes<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.289> then

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
your your food or a few minutes and then

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.459 
your your food or a few minutes and then
you<00:00:50.309> put<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.360> holds<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
you put it in here and it holds it it

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.910 
you put it in here and it holds it it
will<00:00:52.649> keep<00:00:52.829> hot<00:00:53.309> things<00:00:53.670> hot<00:00:53.789> fat<00:00:54.780> opposite<00:00:55.739> it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
will keep hot things hot fat opposite it

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.279 
will keep hot things hot fat opposite it
will<00:00:56.070> also<00:00:56.250> keep<00:00:56.640> cold<00:00:57.360> things<00:00:57.660> cold<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.170> if

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
will also keep cold things cold so if

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.990 
will also keep cold things cold so if
you<00:00:58.410> want<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> take<00:00:58.829> ice<00:00:59.039> cream<00:00:59.489> or<00:00:59.670> popsicles

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.730 
to a boil not just to hold America not
refresh<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.430> way<00:02:26.730> is<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.940> will<00:02:27.030> not<00:02:27.150> run<00:02:27.300> I

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
refresh that way is it will not run I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.250 
refresh that way is it will not run I
think<00:02:28.740> that's<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.370> now<00:02:30.180> we're<00:02:31.080> going<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
think that's it so now we're going to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.360 
think that's it so now we're going to
make<00:02:31.380> some<00:02:31.550> close<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.790> five<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:34.350> there<00:02:35.340> are

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
make some close to five and so there are

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.130 
make some close to five and so there are
things<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.730> everything<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.270> done<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:37.080> we

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
things that everything is done and we

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.650 
things that everything is done and we
must<00:02:37.410> be<00:02:37.590> working<00:02:37.860> around<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.130> yard<00:02:38.310> so

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
must be working around the yard so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.630 
must be working around the yard so
there's<00:02:39.660> no<00:02:39.900> worry<00:02:40.290> if<00:02:40.620> some<00:02:40.650> only<00:02:41.190> takes<00:02:41.430> two

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640
