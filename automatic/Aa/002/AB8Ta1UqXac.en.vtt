 this number the cables 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.510
 positive current and in the other 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.850
 to the micro 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.760
 what follows is to connect the positive red wire 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.080
 to what was the driver was headquarters 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.100
 and this time white the negative to the earth that will connect it to the entrance of
