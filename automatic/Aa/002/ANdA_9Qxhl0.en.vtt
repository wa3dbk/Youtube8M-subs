00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
how the how it wasn't a movie it doesn't

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.370 
how the how it wasn't a movie it doesn't
have<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.830> good<00:02:34.130> sized<00:02:35.020> piece<00:02:36.020> right<00:02:36.319> here

for<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.040> ABS<00:02:38.200> it's<00:02:39.200> pretty<00:02:39.500> small<00:02:39.830> he<00:02:40.160> does

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310

not have any extra height besides his
feet<00:02:43.540> which<00:02:44.540> I<00:02:44.690> thought<00:02:44.840> was<00:02:44.959> kind<00:02:45.140> of<00:02:45.260> sad<00:02:45.500> and

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
feet which I thought was kind of sad and

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.910 
feet which I thought was kind of sad and
they<00:02:46.100> don't<00:02:46.280> really<00:02:46.459> give<00:02:46.700> any<00:02:47.620> it's<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:48.800> a

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
they don't really give any it's just a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.690 
they don't really give any it's just a
normal<00:02:49.280> green<00:02:49.580> body

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
normal green body

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.460 
normal green body
so<00:02:52.700> yeah<00:02:52.819> this<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.360> just<00:02:53.600> goes<00:02:53.810> on<00:02:54.019> there's<00:02:54.260> no

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
so yeah this it just goes on there's no

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.890 
so yeah this it just goes on there's no
height<00:02:55.250> thing<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:55.880> like<00:02:56.060> Thor<00:02:56.450> or<00:02:56.480> the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
height thing to it like Thor or the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.490 
height thing to it like Thor or the
thing<00:02:58.209> or<00:02:59.209> even<00:02:59.239> ultimate<00:02:59.930> Hulk<00:03:00.140> which<00:03:00.350> I'll

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
thing or even ultimate Hulk which I'll

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.990 
thing or even ultimate Hulk which I'll
be<00:03:00.620> doing<00:03:00.650> next<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:04.010> that's<00:03:04.430> kind<00:03:04.760> that<00:03:04.880> was

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
be doing next so that's kind that was

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.220 
be doing next so that's kind that was
kind<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.299> set<00:03:05.510> down<00:03:06.250> but<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:08.630> looks<00:03:08.930> pretty

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
kind of a set down but it looks pretty

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.770 
kind of a set down but it looks pretty
cool<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:10.489> hair<00:03:10.640> is<00:03:10.760> nice<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.239> face<00:03:11.450> very

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
cool the hair is nice the face very

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.870 
cool the hair is nice the face very
classic<00:03:12.230> Hulk<00:03:12.440> green<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.430> shade<00:03:13.610> of<00:03:13.730> green

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
classic Hulk green the shade of green

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.430 
classic Hulk green the shade of green
the<00:03:14.030> use<00:03:14.150> for<00:03:14.299> this<00:03:14.420> is<00:03:14.630> not<00:03:14.750> my<00:03:14.959> favorite<00:03:15.380> but

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
the use for this is not my favorite but

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.680 
the use for this is not my favorite but
it<00:03:15.620> works<00:03:15.859> it's<00:03:16.190> kind<00:03:16.430> of<00:03:16.459> reminiscent<00:03:17.359> of<00:03:17.570> the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
it works it's kind of reminiscent of the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.080 
it works it's kind of reminiscent of the
movie<00:03:17.959> I<00:03:18.170> guess<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:19.070> didn't<00:03:19.519> really<00:03:19.609> pay<00:03:19.880> much

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
movie I guess I didn't really pay much

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.569 
movie I guess I didn't really pay much
attention<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.840> shade<00:03:21.170> of<00:03:21.320> green<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.400> Hulk

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
attention to the shade of green the Hulk

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.280 
attention to the shade of green the Hulk
but<00:03:22.820> I<00:03:22.880> thought<00:03:23.090> the<00:03:23.720> shade<00:03:23.930> on<00:03:24.109> this

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
but I thought the shade on this

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.020 
but I thought the shade on this
particular<00:03:24.890> mini<00:03:25.130> mate<00:03:25.340> could<00:03:25.760> have<00:03:25.880> been<00:03:26.000> a

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
particular mini mate could have been a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.410 
particular mini mate could have been a
little<00:03:26.209> more<00:03:26.420> green<00:03:26.690> it's<00:03:26.959> kind<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.350> dark

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
little more green it's kind of a dark

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.330 
little more green it's kind of a dark
bland<00:03:29.420> green<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.910> pants<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:33.350> jagged<00:03:33.980> pants

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
bland green the pants the jagged pants

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.449 
bland green the pants the jagged pants
here<00:03:34.579> on<00:03:34.730> the<00:03:34.850> bottom<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:36.530> can't<00:03:36.799> really<00:03:37.010> see

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
here on the bottom you can't really see

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.330 
here on the bottom you can't really see

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
that well unless you really look at it

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.949 
that well unless you really look at it

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
the legs pistol back here it's a little

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.520 
the legs pistol back here it's a little
bit<00:03:45.049> hard<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.380> tell<00:03:46.840> he<00:03:47.840> does<00:03:48.079> have<00:03:48.380> this

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
bit hard to tell he does have this

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.050 
bit hard to tell he does have this
little<00:03:48.859> extra<00:03:49.579> belt<00:03:50.480> piece<00:03:50.900> or<00:03:51.880> which<00:03:52.880> is<00:03:52.910> not

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
little extra belt piece or which is not

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.410 
little extra belt piece or which is not
the<00:03:53.359> same<00:03:53.590> color<00:03:54.590> as<00:03:54.950> Bruce<00:03:55.370> Banner<00:03:55.670> at<00:03:55.940> all<00:03:56.150> I

the same color as Bruce Banner at all I

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.660 
the same color as Bruce Banner at all I
don't<00:03:56.540> think<00:03:56.750> that's<00:03:57.109> like<00:03:57.400> directly<00:03:58.400> from

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
don't think that's like directly from

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.059 
don't think that's like directly from
when<00:03:58.880> he<00:03:58.970> changes<00:03:59.450> Bruce<00:04:00.230> Banner<00:04:00.530> to<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:00.890> Hulk

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
when he changes Bruce Banner to the Hulk

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.940 
when he changes Bruce Banner to the Hulk
which<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:01.910> it's<00:04:02.480> fine<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:02.989> I<00:04:03.049> mean<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:03.829> would

use<00:04:26.080> anyways<00:04:26.410> because<00:04:26.560> he's<00:04:26.740> already<00:04:26.890> too

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280

they<00:04:29.860> have<00:04:30.010> that<00:04:30.160> option

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790
