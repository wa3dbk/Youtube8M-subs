00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
piece you're using which if you know you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.549 
piece you're using which if you know you
would<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:45.930> highlights<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.379> things

like<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.710> which<00:00:46.950> i<00:00:47.070> think<00:00:47.129> looks<00:00:47.280> more

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
like that which i think looks more

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.840 
like that which i think looks more
natural<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.420> good<00:00:48.660> way<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> do<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.050> also<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
natural is a good way to do it also the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.279 
natural is a good way to do it also the
color<00:00:51.030> has<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.329> exact<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.870> textures

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
color has to be exact with the textures

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.569 
color has to be exact with the textures
to<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.440> exact<00:00:52.770> -<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.070> since<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.399> is

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
to be exact - and since this is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.459 
to be exact - and since this is
synthetic<00:00:53.910> hair<00:00:54.300> sometimes<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> little

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
synthetic hair sometimes it's a little

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.799 
synthetic hair sometimes it's a little
bit<00:00:55.620> too<00:00:55.770> perfect<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.570> beat

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
bit too perfect so I just kind of beat

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.209 
bit too perfect so I just kind of beat
it<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> little<00:00:58.140> bit<00:00:58.379> by<00:00:58.829> little<00:00:58.859> back

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
it up a little bit by little back

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.130 
it up a little bit by little back
combing<00:00:59.489> like<00:00:59.670> that<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.750> want<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
combing like that and you want the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.900 
combing like that and you want the
texture<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.160> wavy<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.579> hair

if my hair were longer I would take it
and<00:01:27.180> take<00:01:27.840> these<00:01:28.290> longer<00:01:28.590> pieces<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.040> then

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and take these longer pieces and then

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.460 
and take these longer pieces and then
pin<00:01:29.400> them<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.700> kind<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.360> stick<00:01:30.750> them<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
pin them in kind of stick them in and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.899 
pin them in kind of stick them in and
pin<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.070> different<00:01:32.430> sides<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
pin them in on different sides like that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.630 
pin them in on different sides like that
and<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.720> helps<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.290> blend<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.369> can<00:01:35.400> do

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and that helps it to blend you can do

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.950 
and that helps it to blend you can do
the<00:01:35.729> same<00:01:35.939> thing<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.630> some<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.869> these

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the same thing with with some of these

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.270 
the same thing with with some of these
bits<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:37.650> take<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.130> was

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
bits like you would take if this was

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.710 
bits like you would take if this was
longer<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.670> would<00:01:38.790> take<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.329> kind<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.540> pin

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
longer I would take that and kind of pin

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.109 
longer I would take that and kind of pin
it<00:01:39.869> sort<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.070> then<00:01:41.670> maybe<00:01:41.820> pull

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
it sort of like that and then maybe pull

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.660 
it sort of like that and then maybe pull
bits<00:01:42.360> over<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.710> blends<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.430> bring

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
bits over so it just blends then bring

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
bits over so it just blends then bring
bring<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> slap<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.930> hair<00:01:46.140> forward<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.680> little

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
bring the slap on hair forward a little

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.679 
bring the slap on hair forward a little
bit<00:01:46.920> just<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.820> idea<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.479> don't<00:01:48.509> I

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
bit just the idea is just you don't I

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.730 
bit just the idea is just you don't I
