and<00:01:39.930> when<00:01:40.050> you<00:01:40.110> get<00:01:40.230> to<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.440> end<00:01:40.620> and<00:01:40.740> you

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
and when you get to the end and you

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.350 
and when you get to the end and you
actually<00:01:40.980> test<00:01:41.400> fit<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.850> should<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.120> fairly

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
actually test fit it should be fairly

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
actually test fit it should be fairly
close<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.960> where<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.260> want<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.680> leave<00:01:43.890> your
