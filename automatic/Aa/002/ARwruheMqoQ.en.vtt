00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
had written in some pretty interesting

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.540 
had written in some pretty interesting
visuals<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:43.079> butts<00:00:43.710> crocheting<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
visuals like butts crocheting and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.910 
visuals like butts crocheting and
pterodactyls<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.289> good<00:00:46.440> artists<00:00:46.770> will

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
pterodactyls and the good artists will

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
pterodactyls and the good artists will
take<00:00:47.129> advantage<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.730> those<00:00:47.879> visual<00:00:48.239> cues<00:00:48.270> so

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
take advantage of those visual cues so

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
take advantage of those visual cues so
after<00:00:49.350> tossing<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.829> song<00:00:50.010> around<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:50.489> head

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
after tossing the song around in my head

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
after tossing the song around in my head
for<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.940> while<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.180> began<00:00:51.539> drawing<00:00:51.750> out<00:00:52.020> story

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
for a while I began drawing out story

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.200 
for a while I began drawing out story
thumbnails<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.579> these<00:00:53.760> do<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.059> they

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
thumbnails and what these do is they

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.939 
thumbnails and what these do is they
basically<00:00:54.480> act<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> blueprint<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
basically act like the blueprint to the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.520 
basically act like the blueprint to the
entire<00:00:56.219> film<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.180> figure<00:00:57.329> out

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
entire film I can figure out

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.229 
entire film I can figure out
cinematography<00:00:58.530> visual<00:00:59.070> gags<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.730> pacing

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
cinematography visual gags the pacing

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.270 
cinematography visual gags the pacing
and<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> ideas<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:01.859> my<00:01:01.949> head<00:01:01.980> are

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and just see if the ideas in my head are

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.579 
and just see if the ideas in my head are
working<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.699> paper<00:01:02.960> while<00:01:03.960> working<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
working on paper while working on the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.260 
working on paper while working on the
thumbnails<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.489> also<00:01:05.909> thinking<00:01:05.939> about

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
thumbnails I was also thinking about

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.960 
thumbnails I was also thinking about
character<00:01:07.049> design<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.650> had<00:01:08.100> drawn<00:01:08.369> Dane<00:01:08.610> many

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
character design I had drawn Dane many

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
character design I had drawn Dane many
times<00:01:09.270> before<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.869> had<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> pretty<00:01:10.350> good

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
times before and I had a pretty good

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.050 
times before and I had a pretty good
idea<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> wanted<00:01:11.430> him<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.610> look<00:01:11.850> like

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
idea of what I wanted him to look like

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.179 
idea of what I wanted him to look like
also<00:01:12.659> Dane<00:01:12.930> really<00:01:13.380> liked<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> way<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> drew

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
also Dane really liked the way I drew

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
also Dane really liked the way I drew
him<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.640> he<00:01:14.790> specifically<00:01:15.240> requested<00:01:15.840> my

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
him so he specifically requested my

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.630 
him so he specifically requested my
normal<00:01:16.259> style<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> challenge<00:01:17.520> was

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
normal style so the challenge was

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.950 
normal style so the challenge was
creating<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> costar<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.780> looked<00:01:18.900> very

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
creating a costar that looked very

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
creating a costar that looked very
different<00:01:19.380> from<00:01:19.619> Dame<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.220> still<00:01:20.490> looked

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
different from Dame but still looked

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.880 
different from Dame but still looked
like<00:01:20.909> he<00:01:21.150> fit<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> same<00:01:21.780> world<00:01:22.110> after<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
like he fit in the same world after a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.590 
like he fit in the same world after a
little<00:01:23.100> experimenting<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.880> finally<00:01:24.360> settled

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
little experimenting I finally settled

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.149 
little experimenting I finally settled
on<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> character<00:01:25.140> design<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.710> had<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> much

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
on a character design that had a much

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.850 
on a character design that had a much
edgier<00:01:26.700> sharper<00:01:27.360> look<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.900> less<00:01:28.380> saturated

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
edgier sharper look a less saturated

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.319 
edgier sharper look a less saturated
color<00:01:29.159> scheme<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> different<00:01:30.150> way<00:01:30.299> of

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
color scheme in a different way of

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.660 
color scheme in a different way of
moving<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.590> can<00:01:31.770> tell<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.009> used<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.430> slightly

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
moving if you can tell I used a slightly

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.760 
moving if you can tell I used a slightly
more<00:01:32.970> exaggerated<00:01:33.810> style<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.229> animation<00:01:34.740> for

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
more exaggerated style of animation for

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
simple way of doing that is with color

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.469 
simple way of doing that is with color
the<00:01:46.530> main<00:01:47.130> color<00:01:47.399> scheme<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> stage<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
many different shades of blue and if you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
many different shades of blue and if you
notice<00:01:53.399> Dane<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.149> wearing<00:01:54.390> an<00:01:54.509> orange<00:01:54.750> shirt

this is all done in flash I forgot to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.560 
this is all done in flash I forgot to
mention<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.280> say<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.820> because<00:03:21.000> part<00:03:21.540> of

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
mention and I say that because part of

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.780 
mention and I say that because part of
finalization<00:03:22.380> is<00:03:22.680> putting<00:03:23.130> in<00:03:23.220> backgrounds

and I make all of mine in Photoshop
what's<00:03:26.580> also<00:03:26.820> interesting<00:03:26.970> is<00:03:27.510> sometimes<00:03:28.020> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
what's also interesting is sometimes the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.570 
what's also interesting is sometimes the
perspective<00:03:28.710> in<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:28.860> background<00:03:29.340> was<00:03:29.550> a

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
perspective in the background was a

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.280 
perspective in the background was a
little<00:03:30.000> too<00:03:30.180> difficult<00:03:30.660> for<00:03:30.690> me<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.990> figure

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
little too difficult for me to figure

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.370 
little too difficult for me to figure
out<00:03:31.440> on<00:03:31.560> my<00:03:31.680> own<00:03:31.850> but<00:03:32.850> luckily<00:03:33.660> for<00:03:33.810> me<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.140> had<00:03:34.350> a

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
out on my own but luckily for me I had a

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.100 
out on my own but luckily for me I had a

couldn't figure out a perspective I

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.410 
couldn't figure out a perspective I
would<00:03:43.980> just<00:03:44.220> open<00:03:44.520> up<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.790> model<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.209> Maya
