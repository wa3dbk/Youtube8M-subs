00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.880 

if<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.810> were<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:39.020> pick<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.350> thumb<00:01:39.590> on<00:01:39.800> the

second fingers to play string 4 and

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.890 
second fingers to play string 4 and
three<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.870> you<00:01:45.530> got<00:01:45.680> those<00:01:45.890> two<00:01:46.190> like<00:01:46.460> that<00:01:49.900> and

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
three so you got those two like that and

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.810 
three so you got those two like that and
what<00:01:51.050> I<00:01:51.080> did<00:01:51.320> there<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:51.620> I<00:01:51.890> moved<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.640> the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
what I did there is I moved to the

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.310 
what I did there is I moved to the
fourth<00:01:53.090> fret<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:53.870> squeezing<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.230> little

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
fourth fret and I squeezing a little

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.760 
fourth fret and I squeezing a little
finger<00:01:54.650> on<00:01:54.680> the<00:01:54.770> fifth<00:01:55.010> fret<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.770> that's

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
finger on the fifth fret and that's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.230 
finger on the fifth fret and that's
another<00:01:58.130> third<00:01:58.430> so<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.820> would<00:01:58.940> be<00:01:59.000> sort<00:01:59.120> of

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
another third so that would be sort of

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.100 
another third so that would be sort of
like<00:01:59.300> a<00:01:59.390> G<00:01:59.570> chord<00:01:59.600> now<00:02:03.490> one<00:02:04.490> two<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.390> three<00:02:05.870> and

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
like a G chord now one two and three and

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.650 
like a G chord now one two and three and
four<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.760> so<00:02:07.760> that's<00:02:07.910> kind<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.270> rhythm<00:02:08.540> of

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
four and so that's kind of the rhythm of

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.610 
four and so that's kind of the rhythm of
it<00:02:08.690> one<00:02:09.110> two<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.160> three<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.940> four<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.500> that

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
it one two and three and four and that

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.220 
it one two and three and four and that
last<00:02:15.890> one<00:02:16.130> there<00:02:16.310> was<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.000> open<00:02:17.420> fourth<00:02:17.990> and

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
last one there was the open fourth and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:27.460 
last one there was the open fourth and
third<00:02:18.709> string<00:02:25.209> then<00:02:26.209> then<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.720> changes<00:02:27.050> chords

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
third string then then it changes chords

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.710 
third string then then it changes chords
it's<00:02:28.040> going<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.280> use<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.459> e<00:02:28.640> minor<00:02:29.030> chord<00:02:29.420> so

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
it's going to use the e minor chord so

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.230 
it's going to use the e minor chord so
you'll<00:02:29.870> hit<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.650> minor<00:02:30.890> note<00:02:31.130> or<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.820> six

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
you'll hit that a minor note or the six

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.449 
you'll hit that a minor note or the six
string<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.140> do<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.380> same<00:02:33.590> thing<00:02:33.980> up<00:02:34.190> here

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
string and do the same thing up here

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.380 
string and do the same thing up here
with<00:02:34.550> these<00:02:34.670> intervals<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.660> thirds<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:41.090> back

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
with these intervals of thirds and back

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:52.430 
with these intervals of thirds and back
to<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.630> G

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.410 

later<00:02:53.440> on<00:02:53.710> that's<00:02:54.670> kind<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> main<00:02:55.210> theme

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
later on that's kind of the main theme

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.790 
later on that's kind of the main theme
but<00:02:55.570> later<00:02:55.750> on<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.080> going<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.230> go<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.590> C

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
but later on it's going to go to the C

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.930 
but later on it's going to go to the C
chord<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.160> it's<00:02:57.310> going<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.520> do<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.760> same

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
chord and it's going to do the same

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.270 
chord and it's going to do the same
thing<00:02:58.240> the<00:02:58.750> C<00:02:58.960> note<00:02:59.140> would<00:02:59.470> be<00:02:59.530> right<00:02:59.860> there

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
thing the C note would be right there

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.630 
thing the C note would be right there
fifth<00:03:00.820> string<00:03:01.150> third<00:03:01.570> fret<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.370> do<00:03:03.520> the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
fifth string third fret and you do the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.170 
fifth string third fret and you do the
same<00:03:03.790> deal<00:03:04.060> here<00:03:08.790> then<00:03:09.790> you're<00:03:09.880> going<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.090> hit

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
same deal here then you're going to hit

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.880 
same deal here then you're going to hit
the<00:03:10.270> a<00:03:10.390> note<00:03:10.720> open<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.080> fifth<00:03:11.260> string<00:03:11.470> open

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
the a note open the fifth string open

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.050 
the a note open the fifth string open
with<00:03:12.040> your<00:03:12.160> thumb<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:18.400> goes<00:03:18.550> back<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.940> the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
with your thumb and it goes back to the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.870 
with your thumb and it goes back to the
G<00:03:19.209> chord<00:03:19.420> now<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.320> chorus<00:03:20.770> later<00:03:21.040> on<00:03:21.310> when<00:03:21.790> you

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
G chord now the chorus later on when you

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.110 
G chord now the chorus later on when you
sing<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:22.270> and<00:03:22.510> me<00:03:22.630> together<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:24.220> lot<00:03:25.000> of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
sing and you and me together a lot of

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.580 
sing and you and me together a lot of
tabs<00:03:25.300> on<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.570> internet<00:03:25.870> have<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.110> wrong<00:03:26.290> but

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
tabs on the internet have it wrong but

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.740 
tabs on the internet have it wrong but
here's<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.250> way<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.400> figured<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.000> out<00:03:28.090> it's

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
here's the way I figured it out it's

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.110 
here's the way I figured it out it's
going<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:28.989> be<00:03:29.200> intervals<00:03:30.100> of<00:03:30.220> tenths<00:03:30.640> all<00:03:30.940> the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
going to be intervals of tenths all the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.760 
going to be intervals of tenths all the
way<00:03:31.209> up<00:03:31.300> here<00:03:31.330> at<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.750> tenth<00:03:31.989> fret<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.470> the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
way up here at the tenth fret and the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.340 
way up here at the tenth fret and the
11th<00:03:33.160> fret<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:34.270> your<00:03:34.480> first<00:03:34.720> finger<00:03:35.050> should<00:03:35.200> be

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
11th fret so your first finger should be

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.690 
11th fret so your first finger should be
on<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.800> tenth<00:03:36.010> fret<00:03:36.160> of<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.340> sixth<00:03:36.640> string

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
on the tenth fret of the sixth string

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.790 
on the tenth fret of the sixth string
and<00:03:37.120> your<00:03:37.840> third<00:03:37.870> finger<00:03:38.170> should<00:03:38.410> be<00:03:38.530> on<00:03:38.650> the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
and your third finger should be on the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.910 
and your third finger should be on the
11th<00:03:39.489> fret<00:03:39.700> of<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.090> third<00:03:40.390> string<00:03:40.420> and<00:03:41.410> the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
11th fret of the third string and the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.470 
11th fret of the third string and the
technique<00:03:42.310> here<00:03:42.580> is<00:03:42.610> you<00:03:42.970> want<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.180> hear<00:03:43.330> those

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
technique here is you want to hear those

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.250 
technique here is you want to hear those
two<00:03:43.690> notes<00:03:43.930> only<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.430> have<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:46.140> bend<00:03:47.140> your

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
two notes only so you have to bend your

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.680 
two notes only so you have to bend your
finger<00:03:47.590> over<00:03:47.739> just<00:03:48.040> enough<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.520> mute<00:03:48.700> those

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
finger over just enough to mute those

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.390 
finger over just enough to mute those
strings<00:03:50.050> right<00:03:50.230> there<00:03:50.410> string<00:03:50.709> five<00:03:51.010> and

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
strings right there string five and

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.759 
strings right there string five and
three<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.000> then<00:03:52.840> also<00:03:53.110> use<00:03:53.440> your<00:03:53.560> third

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
three and then also use your third

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.320 
three and then also use your third
finger<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.280> maybe<00:03:54.519> middle<00:03:54.820> finger<00:03:55.000> kind<00:03:55.239> of

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
finger and maybe middle finger kind of

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.640 
finger and maybe middle finger kind of
mute<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.600> first<00:03:55.810> two<00:03:56.019> strings<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.410> when<00:03:56.590> you

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
mute the first two strings so when you

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
mute the first two strings so when you
strum<00:03:56.920> you're<00:03:57.130> hearing

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
strum you're hearing

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.670 
strum you're hearing
sort<00:03:58.330> of<00:03:58.390> muted<00:03:58.720> strings<00:03:58.959> but<00:03:59.320> you're<00:03:59.530> only

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
sort of muted strings but you're only

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.380 
sort of muted strings but you're only
hearing<00:03:59.950> string<00:04:00.220> six<00:04:00.580> and<00:04:00.790> three

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.180 

and<00:04:04.390> that<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.380> would<00:04:05.500> be<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.620> D<00:04:05.830> major<00:04:06.010> chord

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
and that that would be a D major chord

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.890 
and that that would be a D major chord
and<00:04:06.670> then<00:04:06.880> you're<00:04:06.970> going<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.150> go<00:04:07.240> back<00:04:07.390> to<00:04:07.450> here

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
and then you're going to go back to here

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.810 
and then you're going to go back to here
that's<00:04:08.020> going<00:04:08.260> to<00:04:08.320> be<00:04:08.440> seven<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.580> sixth

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
that's going to be seven of the sixth

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.580 
that's going to be seven of the sixth
string<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.270> seven<00:04:10.960> of<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.200> third<00:04:11.380> string<00:04:11.530> and

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
string and seven of the third string and

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.810 
string and seven of the third string and
you're<00:04:11.740> going<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:11.890> apply<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.160> same<00:04:12.370> technique

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
you're going to apply the same technique

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.700 
you're going to apply the same technique
where<00:04:13.030> you're<00:04:13.120> muting<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:13.900> strings<00:04:13.960> it's

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
where you're muting the strings it's

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.020 
where you're muting the strings it's
kind<00:04:14.890> of<00:04:14.950> tricky<00:04:15.190> at<00:04:15.280> first<00:04:15.310> but<00:04:15.580> if<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:15.850> work

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
kind of tricky at first but if you work

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.190 
kind of tricky at first but if you work
at<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.390> can<00:04:16.630> get<00:04:16.750> it

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
at it you can get it

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.650 
at it you can get it
so<00:04:18.860> I'm<00:04:18.950> at<00:04:19.070> that<00:04:19.280> d-chord<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:23.360> that<00:04:23.510> one

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
so I'm at that d-chord and that one

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.470 
so I'm at that d-chord and that one
there<00:04:23.810> is<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.200> 12th<00:04:24.560> fret<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.390> 12th<00:04:26.390> fret

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
there is it the 12th fret and 12th fret

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.950 
there is it the 12th fret and 12th fret
of<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.600> third<00:04:26.810> string<00:04:28.450> and<00:04:29.450> that's<00:04:29.540> basically

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
of the third string and that's basically

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.740 
of the third string and that's basically
that<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:30.410> it's<00:04:30.530> four<00:04:31.010> counts<00:04:31.370> one<00:04:31.610> two<00:04:31.850> or<00:04:32.570> two

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
that so it's four counts one two or two

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.370 
that so it's four counts one two or two
counts<00:04:33.050> each<00:04:33.110> sorry<00:04:33.500> one<00:04:33.800> two<00:04:34.400> three<00:04:35.150> four<00:04:35.720> one

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
counts each sorry one two three four one

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.320 
counts each sorry one two three four one
two<00:04:36.650> three<00:04:37.220> four<00:04:37.910> one<00:04:38.840> two<00:04:39.110> three<00:04:39.710> four<00:04:40.340> one

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
two three four one two three four one

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.810 
two three four one two three four one
two<00:04:41.600> three<00:04:42.200> four<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.730> then<00:04:45.340> there's<00:04:46.340> a<00:04:46.460> middle

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
two three four and then there's a middle

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.960 
two three four and then there's a middle
section<00:04:47.000> in<00:04:47.360> there<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:49.520> next<00:04:49.550> part<00:04:49.940> that

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
section in there and the next part that

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.160 
section in there and the next part that
I<00:04:50.120> wanted<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:50.390> show<00:04:50.510> you<00:04:50.540> was<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.870> inning

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
I wanted to show you was the inning

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.840 
I wanted to show you was the inning
because<00:04:51.440> that's<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.920> part<00:04:52.280> of<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:52.430> song<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.640> I

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
because that's a part of the song that I

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.450 
because that's a part of the song that I
found<00:04:53.120> interesting<00:04:53.540> where<00:04:54.470> he<00:04:54.740> was<00:04:54.860> playing<00:04:55.100> a
