the Corvette got a redesign for 1968 and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.870 
the Corvette got a redesign for 1968 and
this<00:00:19.650> was<00:00:19.860> now<00:00:20.070> entering<00:00:20.340> its<00:00:20.759> third

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
this was now entering its third

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.630 
this was now entering its third
generation<00:00:21.230> which<00:00:22.230> today<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.770> call<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.160> c3

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
generation which today we call the c3

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.540 
generation which today we call the c3
cars<00:00:23.880> at<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:24.869> point<00:00:25.169> within<00:00:25.829> the<00:00:26.009> past<00:00:26.279> ten

cars at some point within the past ten
years<00:00:26.579> or<00:00:27.059> so<00:00:27.239> people<00:00:27.840> started<00:00:28.290> calling<00:00:28.829> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
years or so people started calling the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.999 
years or so people started calling the
cars<00:00:29.430> by<00:00:29.759> their<00:00:29.910> generation<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.869> 1<00:00:31.079> 2<00:00:31.349> 3<00:00:31.380> 4<00:00:31.829> 5

etc<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:33.090> course<00:00:33.329> now<00:00:33.510> around<00:00:33.719> c7<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.309> c3

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
etc of course now around c7 but the c3

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.900 
etc of course now around c7 but the c3
cars<00:00:36.559> were<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> pretty<00:00:38.160> dramatic<00:00:38.309> departure

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
cars were a pretty dramatic departure

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.560 
cars were a pretty dramatic departure
from<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> earlier<00:00:39.989> c2<00:00:40.770> design<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:42.149> fact

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
from the earlier c2 design in fact

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.239 
from the earlier c2 design in fact
they're<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> lot<00:00:43.320> longer<00:00:43.559> they're<00:00:44.039> a<00:00:44.070> little

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:44.249 
they're a lot longer they're a little

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:45.889 
they're a lot longer they're a little
lower<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.940> they're<00:00:45.390> one<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.719> most

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
lower and they're one of the most

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.389 
lower and they're one of the most
distinctive<00:00:46.350> cars<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.039> General<00:00:47.370> Motors

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
distinctive cars that General Motors

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.389 
distinctive cars that General Motors
have<00:00:47.789> ever<00:00:47.940> made<00:00:48.350> today<00:00:49.350> we're<00:00:49.890> looking<00:00:50.039> at<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
have ever made today we're looking at a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.500 
have ever made today we're looking at a
Daytona<00:00:50.879> yellow<00:00:52.100> 1969<00:00:53.100> version<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.819> of<00:00:54.359> those

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
Daytona yellow 1969 version and of those

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.889 
Daytona yellow 1969 version and of those
c3<00:00:55.170> cars<00:00:55.670> my<00:00:56.670> personal<00:00:57.179> favorites<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
c3 cars my personal favorites are the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.739 
c3 cars my personal favorites are the
earlier<00:00:58.230> ones<00:00:58.499> the<00:00:58.769> 68<00:00:59.219> nine<00:00:59.429> and<00:00:59.640> 70<00:01:00.120> because

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
earlier ones the 68 nine and 70 because

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:03.020 
earlier ones the 68 nine and 70 because
they<00:01:01.109> were<00:01:01.440> built<00:01:01.710> before<00:01:01.979> the<00:01:02.280> government

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
they were built before the government

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.719 
they were built before the government
mandated<00:01:03.839> five<00:01:04.140> mile<00:01:04.440> an<00:01:04.559> hour<00:01:04.650> crash<00:01:05.100> bumpers

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
mandated five mile an hour crash bumpers

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.360 
mandated five mile an hour crash bumpers
so<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.510> still<00:01:06.750> had<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> real<00:01:07.560> thin<00:01:07.920> chrome

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
so they still had a real thin chrome

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.750 
so they still had a real thin chrome
bumper<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.060> front<00:01:09.300> and<00:01:09.390> rear<00:01:09.630> which

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
bumper on the front and rear which

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.160 
bumper on the front and rear which
accented<00:01:11.760> nicely<00:01:12.240> against<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.659> body<00:01:12.870> color

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
accented nicely against the body color

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
accented nicely against the body color
and<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.920> didn't<00:01:14.189> look<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.670> entire<00:01:14.969> car

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and it didn't look like the entire car

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.260 
and it didn't look like the entire car
was<00:01:15.899> made<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.259> plastic<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:17.219> think<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.149> got

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
was made of plastic I think as we got

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.670 
was made of plastic I think as we got
into<00:01:18.509> some<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> mid<00:01:18.960> seventies<00:01:19.409> cars

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
into some of the mid seventies cars

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.530 
into some of the mid seventies cars
those<00:01:19.979> crash<00:01:20.280> bumpers<00:01:20.759> were<00:01:20.939> wrapped<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
those crash bumpers were wrapped in a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.289 
those crash bumpers were wrapped in a
flexible<00:01:22.259> plastic<00:01:22.500> material<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:24.090> body

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
flexible plastic material and the body

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.560 
flexible plastic material and the body
kind<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.689> lost<00:01:24.899> a<00:01:25.079> little<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.380> its<00:01:25.530> green

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
kind of lost a little of its green

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.929 
kind of lost a little of its green
chrome<00:01:27.570> bumpers<00:01:28.079> but<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.770> 69<00:01:29.310> car<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> really

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
chrome bumpers but the 69 car is really

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.060 
chrome bumpers but the 69 car is really
sharp<00:01:30.270> looking<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.750> my<00:01:30.869> opinion<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.920> there

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
sharp looking in my opinion and there

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.190 
sharp looking in my opinion and there
was<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> handful<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.880> differences<00:01:33.450> between<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
was a handful of differences between the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.069 
was a handful of differences between the
first<00:01:34.770> year<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.369> design<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.939> 1968<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
first year of this design in 1968 and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.459 
first year of this design in 1968 and
the<00:01:37.649> 1969<00:01:38.490> car<00:01:38.820> some<00:01:39.539> are<00:01:39.630> obvious<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> some

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
the 1969 car some are obvious and some

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.010 
the 1969 car some are obvious and some
are<00:01:40.590> kind<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.920> subtle<00:01:41.250> an<00:01:42.210> interesting<00:01:42.719> one<00:01:42.840> is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
are kind of subtle an interesting one is

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.590 
are kind of subtle an interesting one is
that<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.289> 69<00:01:43.829> steering<00:01:44.670> wheel<00:01:44.820> diameter<00:01:45.390> is

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that the 69 steering wheel diameter is

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.319 
that the 69 steering wheel diameter is
an<00:01:45.750> inch<00:01:45.960> smaller<00:01:46.170> than<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> 68<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.210> you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
an inch smaller than the 68 so that you

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.969 
an inch smaller than the 68 so that you
could<00:01:48.509> get<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> car<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> little<00:01:49.500> bit<00:01:49.590> easier

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
could get in the car a little bit easier

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.800 
could get in the car a little bit easier
because<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.969> know<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.329> don't<00:01:51.479> drive<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
because you know you don't drive a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.109 
because you know you don't drive a
Corvette<00:01:52.109> you<00:01:52.350> wear<00:01:52.679> one<00:01:52.950> basically<00:01:53.460> some

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
Corvette you wear one basically some

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.060 
Corvette you wear one basically some
other<00:01:54.240> little<00:01:54.539> details<00:01:54.929> like<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.500> reverse

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
other little details like the reverse

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.249 
other little details like the reverse

lights removed into the tail light in
the<00:01:58.380> back<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.280> fenders<00:01:59.729> didn't<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.240> quite

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the back the fenders didn't have quite

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.959 
the back the fenders didn't have quite
the<00:02:00.509> same<00:02:00.780> flare<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:02.310> interesting

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the same flare and one interesting

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.929 
the same flare and one interesting
element<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.780> came<00:02:04.049> back<00:02:04.350> for<00:02:04.649> 69<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.429> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
element that came back for 69 is the
