00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello to everything today in this 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.580
 second panic nail art I will you 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.109
 show how to catch up with three 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.109
 times nothing a nail polish all your notebooks 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.870
 that's the panic you're not 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.130
 at home tonight you have to go out and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.260
 your nail polish and all your notebooks 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.779
 so I'm going to show you that with 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.640
 scotch a pair of scissors and a 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.090
 second varnish by cons with your 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.609
 pics 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.920
 Bernie who preferably goes well with 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.590
 so I cut pieces of scotch 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.870
 in the form of tapes or small 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 really randomly needed triangles 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.950
 just that the pieces are pretty 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.899
 long for the width of the nail when 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.210
 so I cut out all my pieces of 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.579
 scotch as you see here then with 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.289
 my tweezers or with my fingers I 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.170
 I'm going to stick them on my nails 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.789
 especially we do not stick the tape on 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.559
 places and notebooks since it's 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.600
 what will have to be covered with the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.329
 varnish so I stick but part of it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.070
 coach where the polish is still 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.930
 usable 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.520
 so I stuck them randomly as 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.159
 you see here so as to do like 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.590
 little bands everywhere and then 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.090
 I take my second polish so there 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.450
 I chose a black polish and so I 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.119
 will apply this varnish surely on 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.650
 the parts especially long done and 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.740
 so the parties there is no scotch 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.570
 will color so preferably 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 the varnish should be the second 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.939
 varnish you have either opaque enough 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.680
 because otherwise it's not very pretty so 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.210
 there I apply the varnish no matter 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.250
 how about long as if I was applying 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.960
 a normal varnish I stone anyway 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.820
 good enough for them to recover 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.380
 correctly in the small holes 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.340
 spaces and that it does not go from bubble 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.040
 and then I take off but this coach in 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.720
 the meaning of the tape take off not the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.939
 tape anyhow like a tape 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.170
 to epilate it goes all dressed so I 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.899
 take off the scotch 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.369
 when the varnish has dried just two three 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.479
 seconds not that they are too liquid 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.759
 but it must not be 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.850
 too sexy no it tears everything when I 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.970
 overwhelmed so I quickly catch up with 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.880
 a little graz snow boat that sank 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.750
 under the tape so I do the same 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.750
 for the second 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.359
 and here is neither seen nor known below 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.890
 there is a good varnish and notebooks but that 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.689
 no one knows so if you do not have 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.069
 top coat you stay like that otherwise 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.420
 it's always better to ask some of the best 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.340
 coach is always a gold top coat in 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.260
 handbag to avoid disasters 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.640
 here I hope that this panic born there 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.230
 I liked you I give you an appointment 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.599
 in a month do not hesitate to give me 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.959
 ideas for others panic nail 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.290
 art 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.290
 see you soon
