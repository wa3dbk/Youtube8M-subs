was never sent there to do anything with
Team<00:03:57.530> Alpha<00:03:58.989> because<00:03:59.989> they<00:04:00.170> didn't<00:04:00.379> really

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
gadgets and technology so we can get an

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.500 
gadgets and technology so we can get an
idea<00:04:52.070> of<00:04:52.669> what<00:04:53.510> the<00:04:54.410> team<00:04:54.710> alpha<00:04:55.210> uses<00:04:56.210> on

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510
