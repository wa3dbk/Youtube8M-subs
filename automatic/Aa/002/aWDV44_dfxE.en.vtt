00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.190
 we enter a command hear hear it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.780
 action team 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.229
 which happens around you or 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.260
 describes a specific situation before 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:19.140
 that is, an example will hear a stick and 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.600
 handcuffs hang on the belt 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.610
 we showed that we have a baton and that 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.240
 we have handcuffs now we can her 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.180
 to get 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.710
 get it using the slash mid command with 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.229
 on a swede which team which 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.450
 shows certain of your actions then 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.509
 have heard 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.310
 took the money baton 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.100
 with a belt with only revenge gave a baton with 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.740
 belt gain late mason took off his baton 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.979
 arguing we shoot it and we can both 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.399
 would get on now she is in our hands we 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.649
 we enter 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:55.080
 again fold a baton in the hands of a baton 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.470
 in the hands of 7 sen yes it will show shows 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.679
 that we have a baton in our hands now we 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.200
 can hit the offender we beat him 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:06.690
 and now in general binds in front 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.039
 binding we have to do the following 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.420
 wagering ie write 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.090
 removed the handcuffs from his belt and put them on 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.400
 violator 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.250
 so we removed the handcuffs from the belt and put on 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.670
 them on the troublemaker on all our troublemaker 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.590
 chained without any rolle play mistakes we 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.459
 we show that the offender is the violator 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.129
 in handcuffs handcuffs all offenders 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.810
 we showed 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:39.250
 so well, in general, this was the right one 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.599
 roll play arrest here were the easiest 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.000
 wagering that anyone can perform 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.519
 human text can vary which 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.340
 it all depends on you to 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.590
 suppose now that we need to do you 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.510
 want to put a person in the car 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.069

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.019
 go car and that is now we need 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.230
 shove it right in general, in 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.840
 car yes because without any action 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.860
 Enter the command and it will be the car as 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:16.420
 seemingly wrong so we must 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.540
 enter audible opened the back door and 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.500

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.200
 break for the inside that is into one 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.629
 action we open the door and tighten 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.569
 intruder inside after that we introduce 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:33.489
 incar command 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:36.760
 68 get away man but let the place 3 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.760

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.069
 shock 2 place 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:54.140

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.660
 write a command hear describe the action 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:14.840
 until the offender is bound and is inside 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:19.090
 car so here we are shown now 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.090
 close the door alone 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:25.160

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.810
 yellow wake which which if you 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.639

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.380
 claims by either player which 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.139
 you are not arrested by 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.510
 administration is understandable is not the most 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.900
