00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:20.180
 friends friends hello let's make a 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.490
 new recipe today make a cake with 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.520
 peanut butter because it has 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.770
 desired nothing more than nothing because 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.510
 friends ask me why I put the 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.640
 albal paper that down at the bottom of the 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.830
 blunt is very simple because yes there 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.180
 crap I remove the albal paper I put 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.470
 another and I do not have to clean all the 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.440
 oven truth that you think is a good 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.080
 idea because you know what to do and then 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.440
 I put the grill down practically 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.600
 down completely because in this way not 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.460
 it burns me a lot above because 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.149
 we are always as always I put the 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.340
 fire up and down then in this way 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.890
 is in the up part is further away 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.780
 what is the resistance of the fire and 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.579
 like you burn less if you put it 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.649
 above obviously it would burn 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.890
 before the cake and we will take it out 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.130
 singed well he had not explained 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.070
 this 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.470
 I tell you, look, I have 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.740
 6 eggs that separated and the yolks of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.070
 the whites a glass with 200 grams of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.270
 oil I also have 240 grams of 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.480
 brown sugar I have 240 grams of flour 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.050
 with 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.690
 to see if those 10 grams of yeast in 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.960
 chemical powder or what they call in america 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.360
 baking powder 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.890
 with good and peanut butter that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.799
 I have a jar there to see if or with 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.740
 signs and you see a jar that I'm going to 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.790
 take two tablespoons that's what I think 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.710
 you can do it with butter 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.909
 peanut without any problem because 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.520
 it's not a matter of you going 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.020
 looking at pastry shops this 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.590
 peanut butter as I have it 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.110
 I 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.280
 but like a peanut butter 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.810
 that today is within reach of 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.920
 anyone can do exactly 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.409
 same 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.409
 good the contario mold of butter and 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.820
 milk a little bit of flour and then the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.340
 oven that I'm going to ascend right now 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.039
 so that it is done at 175 degrees 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.100
 with the fire up and down now I'm going to 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.610
 beat the two ingredients is like 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.380
 I will always raise the whites to 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.340
 soft peaks then the yolks 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.810
 they acquire together with half the sugar 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.959
 the other half of those made of the whites 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.570
 the oil and then chare the cream 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:34.350
 peanut the flour for dad dad and al 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.600
 final I will add you the clear ones 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.210
 and remove that so it does not get off 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.100
 a lot and that's all a cake more 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.570
 what is it that you have then that you are going to know 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.280
 to peanut it's going to be a bit 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.720
 different come I'm going to beat 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.720
 you are going to see it in fast camera des 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.040
 Well after much that the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.030
 You're author merengue I'm gone all the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.430
 but let's hope we talk about the 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.650
 recover from the oven because if you do not go to me 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.680
 said river 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.340
 I hope I do not shit in the sea because 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.640
 the smell is very rich 200 peanuts 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:59.030
 what comes to me promises 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.030
 then north lets me out to see 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:07.010
 then to see what to see what comes out of 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.620
 here this now obviously to the jacuzzi 30 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.090
 or 35 minutes I calculate I'm not going to 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.680
 answer exactly how long has 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.680
 been come until then 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:24.230
 good and here we have the cake with 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:27.080
 Peanut butter ready to go 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.199
 in order to suffer 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.669
 I'm here in my living room 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.669
 listening to the birds, not only are you 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.559
 this is the noise that I am in my street 

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:41.380
 Notice that I live like 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:45.300
 well then 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.130
 now since I have put a sugar 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.170
 thanks above we are going to cut a 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.370
 piece to see how it has been 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.760
 important to see how the 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.760
 Biscuit 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:03.729
 Sometimes I have been cool 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.860
 and although rich it will be because the aroma 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.949
 value is not 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.009
 maybe I should confess that I was made a 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:13.840
 little bit more 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.850
 It is so perfect 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.360
 it's perfect let's see if it teaches you 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.360
 the cut 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.289
 cortez fixes what 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.710
 what a fluffy place is 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:31.219
 it's good, good, good, forever 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.219
 friends
