up in a circular motion mounted on to a

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.910 
up in a circular motion mounted on to a
PC<00:01:17.640> board<00:01:17.880> shooting<00:01:18.240> straight<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:19.680> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
PC board shooting straight out this is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.850 
PC board shooting straight out this is
like<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.810> kind<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.840> an<00:01:21.960> acrylic<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.770> an

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
like a kind of an acrylic like an

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.030 
like a kind of an acrylic like an
acrylic<00:01:25.610> fixture<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.710> appear

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
acrylic fixture here and it would appear

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.830 
acrylic fixture here and it would appear
in<00:01:29.130> some<00:01:29.310> pictures<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.820> might<00:01:30.000> also<00:01:30.270> appear<00:01:30.810> on

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
in some pictures it might also appear on

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.030 
in some pictures it might also appear on
the<00:01:30.990> video<00:01:32.000> that<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:34.380> screw<00:01:34.740> would<00:01:34.920> be

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
the video that the screw would be

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.010 
the video that the screw would be
exposed<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.939> it's<00:01:36.329> actually<00:01:36.689> not<00:01:37.759> it<00:01:38.759> is

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
exposed and it's actually not it is

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.600 
exposed and it's actually not it is
recessed<00:01:40.020> below<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.799> acrylic<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.460> it's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
recessed below the acrylic so it's

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.679 
recessed below the acrylic so it's
completely<00:01:42.030> covered<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:44.270> is<00:01:45.270> try<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> give

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
completely covered and is try to give

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.300 
completely covered and is try to give
you<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> little<00:01:45.899> close-up<00:01:46.229> here<00:01:48.829> there<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:50.009> 12

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
you a little close-up here there are 12

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.179 
you a little close-up here there are 12
LEDs<00:01:50.670> inside<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:52.350> on<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.680> back<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
LEDs inside and then on the back of the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.920 
LEDs inside and then on the back of the
light<00:01:53.369> housing<00:01:54.590> this<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.770> really<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.930> don't

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
light housing this is really I don't

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.899 
light housing this is really I don't
know<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.140> feels<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.530> metal<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.759> almost

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
know it feels like metal but it's almost

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.459 
know it feels like metal but it's almost
like<00:02:00.149> an<00:02:00.270> aluminum<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:01.020> really<00:02:01.259> lightweight

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
like an aluminum it's really lightweight

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.340 
like an aluminum it's really lightweight
but<00:02:02.149> anyway<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.329> your<00:02:03.450> heat<00:02:03.780> sink<00:02:04.079> and

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
but anyway this is your heat sink and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.370 
but anyway this is your heat sink and
that<00:02:04.729> is<00:02:05.729> designed<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.570> pull<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> heat

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that is designed to pull all the heat

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.180 
that is designed to pull all the heat
away<00:02:07.500> from<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.890> LEDs<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:09.229> you<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.349> draw<00:02:11.039> it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
away from the LEDs and you know draw it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.250 
away from the LEDs and you know draw it
away<00:02:11.280> try<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.000> keep<00:02:12.150> those<00:02:12.300> LED<00:02:12.780> light<00:02:13.050> heads

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
away try to keep those LED light heads

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.970 
away try to keep those LED light heads
cool

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
cool

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.200 
cool
then<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.160> back<00:02:15.340> here<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.670> can<00:02:15.760> see<00:02:15.970> where<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
then the back here you can see where the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.150 
then the back here you can see where the
the<00:02:16.540> wiring<00:02:16.900> goes<00:02:17.080> into<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.470> head<00:02:17.680> that's<00:02:17.980> all

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
the wiring goes into the head that's all

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.720 
the wiring goes into the head that's all
epoxy-coated<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:24.010> then<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.490> your<00:02:24.580> two

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
epoxy-coated and then you have your two

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.450 
epoxy-coated and then you have your two
mounting<00:02:25.090> holes<00:02:25.270> as<00:02:25.450> well<00:02:26.070> we<00:02:27.070> haven't<00:02:27.370> really

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
mounting holes as well we haven't really

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.130 
mounting holes as well we haven't really
tested<00:02:27.730> them<00:02:28.000> out<00:02:28.120> but<00:02:28.330> evidently<00:02:28.600> this<00:02:28.870> light

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
tested them out but evidently this light

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.580 
tested them out but evidently this light
head<00:02:29.350> gets<00:02:29.590> pretty<00:02:30.520> warm<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.690> warm<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:32.440> they

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
head gets pretty warm so warm that they

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.170 
head gets pretty warm so warm that they
went<00:02:33.250> ahead<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.550> put<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.700> little<00:02:33.880> warning

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
went ahead and put a little warning

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.820 
went ahead and put a little warning
device<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:37.000> saying<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.830> it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
device on it and it's saying that it

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.210 
device on it and it's saying that it
could<00:02:38.950> burn<00:02:39.100> your<00:02:39.280> skin<00:02:39.490> so<00:02:39.880> I<00:02:40.950> would<00:02:41.950> assume

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
could burn your skin so I would assume

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.949 
could burn your skin so I would assume
that's<00:02:42.459> obviously<00:02:43.180> going<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.480> depend<00:02:43.660> on<00:02:43.810> how

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
that's obviously going to depend on how

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.410 
that's obviously going to depend on how
long<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.260> keep<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.740> but<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:46.180> warning

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
long you keep it on but that warning

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.970 
long you keep it on but that warning
device<00:02:46.660> is<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:46.959> there<00:02:47.140> okay<00:02:47.560> so<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.860> have

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
device is on there okay so then you have

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.000 
device is on there okay so then you have
some<00:02:48.160> wire<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.550> travels<00:02:48.940> down<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.360> your

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
some wire that travels down to your

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.970 
some wire that travels down to your
flasher<00:02:51.010> unit<00:02:51.930> this<00:02:52.930> flasher<00:02:53.350> unit<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.709> rather

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
flasher unit this flasher unit is rather

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.850 
flasher unit this flasher unit is rather
large<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:55.720> made<00:02:55.930> out<00:02:56.050> of<00:02:56.080> kind<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.800> a

large it's made out of kind of a
combination<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.520> plastic<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.510> metal<00:03:02.580> this

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
combination of plastic in and metal this

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.580 
combination of plastic in and metal this
section<00:03:04.180> that's<00:03:04.300> screwed<00:03:04.690> in<00:03:04.810> here<00:03:05.140> is<00:03:05.290> all

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
section that's screwed in here is all

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.330 
section that's screwed in here is all
metal<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:07.500> then<00:03:08.500> you<00:03:08.620> got<00:03:08.739> plastic<00:03:09.160> here<00:03:09.280> on

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
metal and then you got plastic here on

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.070 
metal and then you got plastic here on
the<00:03:09.430> sides<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.880> on<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.090> ends<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.690> then<00:03:10.989> you

go<00:03:11.170> back<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.440> other<00:03:11.470> section<00:03:11.920> this<00:03:12.040> sections

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
go back the other section this sections

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.330 
go back the other section this sections
metal<00:03:12.640> as<00:03:12.760> well

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.370 

and<00:03:18.430> then<00:03:19.360> your<00:03:19.510> wiring<00:03:19.870> that<00:03:19.959> comes<00:03:20.200> out<00:03:20.349> of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
and then your wiring that comes out of

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.320 
and then your wiring that comes out of
the<00:03:20.530> bottom<00:03:22.020> four<00:03:23.020> wires<00:03:24.030> red<00:03:25.030> black<00:03:25.300> yellow

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
the bottom four wires red black yellow

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.080 
the bottom four wires red black yellow
blue<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.020> if<00:03:26.739> you're<00:03:27.400> familiar<00:03:27.550> with<00:03:27.790> the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
blue and if you're familiar with the

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.870 
blue and if you're familiar with the
older<00:03:28.450> Phoenix<00:03:29.200> Python<00:03:29.860> T<00:03:30.220> fours

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
older Phoenix Python T fours

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.949 
older Phoenix Python T fours
they<00:03:31.420> had<00:03:31.630> five<00:03:32.140> wires<00:03:32.349> so<00:03:33.599> these<00:03:34.599> are<00:03:34.750> very

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
they had five wires so these are very

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.670 
they had five wires so these are very
thin<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:36.690> then<00:03:37.690> of<00:03:37.840> course<00:03:38.019> they're<00:03:38.230> they're

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
thin and then of course they're they're

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.809 
thin and then of course they're they're
all<00:03:38.830> wrapped<00:03:39.130> in<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:42.340> black<00:03:42.580> plastic

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
all wrapped in the the black plastic

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.199 
all wrapped in the the black plastic
wiring<00:03:43.450> there<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:45.370> hypothetically<00:03:46.060> if<00:03:46.090> we

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
wiring there so hypothetically if we

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.190 
wiring there so hypothetically if we
were<00:03:46.269> going<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.450> use<00:03:46.540> this<00:03:46.660> in<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.870> surface

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
were going to use this in a surface

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.360 
were going to use this in a surface
mount<00:03:47.410> model<00:03:49.290> or<00:03:50.290> surface<00:03:50.680> mount<00:03:50.860> application

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
mount model or surface mount application

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:00.300 
mount model or surface mount application
that's<00:03:51.519> what<00:03:51.730> it<00:03:51.819> would<00:03:51.880> look<00:03:52.030> like

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.120 

so<00:04:01.270> this<00:04:01.660> does<00:04:01.900> not<00:04:01.930> really<00:04:02.350> protrude<00:04:02.920> that

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
so this does not really protrude that

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.130 
so this does not really protrude that
far<00:04:03.430> maybe<00:04:03.790> quarter<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.780> an<00:04:04.840> inch

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
far maybe quarter of an inch

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.820 
far maybe quarter of an inch
I'm<00:04:05.680> guessing<00:04:06.160> and<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:07.600> know<00:04:08.290> it's<00:04:08.650> pretty

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
I'm guessing and you know it's pretty

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.830 
I'm guessing and you know it's pretty
sturdy<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.310> mean<00:04:09.490> that's<00:04:09.640> pretty<00:04:09.819> it<00:04:10.209> almost

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
sturdy I mean that's pretty it almost

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.110 
sturdy I mean that's pretty it almost
feels<00:04:11.110> like<00:04:11.170> glass<00:04:11.650> but<00:04:12.100> but<00:04:12.850> I<00:04:15.000> think<00:04:16.000> it's

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
feels like glass but but I think it's

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.430 
feels like glass but but I think it's
really<00:04:16.359> like<00:04:16.600> an<00:04:16.720> acrylic<00:04:16.989> kind<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.410> deal<00:04:19.440> okay

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
really like an acrylic kind of deal okay

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.520 
really like an acrylic kind of deal okay
so<00:04:20.500> that's<00:04:20.739> how<00:04:20.829> that<00:04:20.919> would<00:04:21.130> look<00:04:22.380> one<00:04:23.380> of<00:04:23.470> the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
so that's how that would look one of the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.890 
so that's how that would look one of the
probably<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.460> most<00:04:24.790> interesting<00:04:25.660> feature

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
probably the most interesting feature

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.110 
probably the most interesting feature
about<00:04:26.050> this<00:04:26.500> light<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.550> really<00:04:27.850> it's

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
about this light and and and really it's

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.420 
about this light and and and really it's
something<00:04:28.660> that<00:04:28.840> they<00:04:29.620> have<00:04:29.650> cornered<00:04:30.190> on<00:04:30.310> the

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
something that they have cornered on the

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.490 
something that they have cornered on the
whole<00:04:30.580> market<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.110> best<00:04:32.260> of<00:04:32.380> our

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
whole market to the best of our

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.980 
whole market to the best of our
knowledge<00:04:32.530> is<00:04:33.010> that<00:04:33.850> this<00:04:34.150> can<00:04:34.480> actually

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
knowledge is that this can actually

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.180 
knowledge is that this can actually
replace<00:04:35.380> your<00:04:35.680> OEM<00:04:35.860> bulb<00:04:36.490> in<00:04:37.350> your<00:04:38.350> in<00:04:39.040> your

replace your OEM bulb in your in your

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.500 
replace your OEM bulb in your in your
vehicle<00:04:39.550> so<00:04:39.700> let's<00:04:39.880> say<00:04:40.030> you're<00:04:40.180> going<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.390> put

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
vehicle so let's say you're going to put

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.900 
vehicle so let's say you're going to put
this<00:04:40.600> in<00:04:40.810> your<00:04:40.960> reverse<00:04:41.380> light<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:42.610> would<00:04:42.730> pop

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
this in your reverse light you would pop

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.790 
this in your reverse light you would pop
out<00:04:43.060> your<00:04:43.240> your<00:04:43.690> bulb<00:04:44.200> that<00:04:44.410> is<00:04:44.470> in<00:04:44.680> your

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
out your your bulb that is in your

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.080 
out your your bulb that is in your
reverse<00:04:45.010> light<00:04:45.130> and<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.520> would<00:04:45.640> put<00:04:45.790> this<00:04:45.910> guy

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
reverse light and you would put this guy

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.780 
reverse light and you would put this guy
in<00:04:46.210> its<00:04:46.330> place<00:04:46.540> and<00:04:47.340> what<00:04:48.340> it's<00:04:48.460> going<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.610> do

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
in its place and what it's going to do

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.520 
in its place and what it's going to do
because<00:04:49.060> you<00:04:49.300> have<00:04:49.330> 12<00:04:49.720> LEDs<00:04:50.020> in<00:04:50.230> there<00:04:50.380> you

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
because you have 12 LEDs in there you

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.740 
because you have 12 LEDs in there you
have<00:04:50.710> actually<00:04:51.100> two<00:04:51.280> options<00:04:51.760> you<00:04:52.360> can<00:04:52.510> order

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
have actually two options you can order

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.530 
have actually two options you can order
this<00:04:52.900> in<00:04:53.140> all<00:04:53.590> one<00:04:53.979> color<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:54.669> all<00:04:54.910> 12<00:04:55.210> LEDs

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
this in all one color so all 12 LEDs

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.680 
this in all one color so all 12 LEDs
would<00:04:55.780> be<00:04:55.960> let's<00:04:56.320> say<00:04:56.500> white<00:04:56.880> or<00:04:57.880> you<00:04:58.540> could

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
would be let's say white or you could

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.640 
would be let's say white or you could
order<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:59.110> let's<00:04:59.680> say<00:04:59.950> red<00:05:00.910> white<00:05:01.180> and<00:05:01.650> the

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
order it let's say red white and the

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.180 
order it let's say red white and the
difference<00:05:03.010> is<00:05:03.190> when<00:05:03.490> you<00:05:04.650> when<00:05:05.650> you<00:05:05.830> turn

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
difference is when you when you turn

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.150 
difference is when you when you turn
your<00:05:06.310> when<00:05:06.669> you<00:05:06.760> put<00:05:06.790> the<00:05:07.000> car<00:05:07.150> in<00:05:07.270> reverse<00:05:07.570> and

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
your when you put the car in reverse and

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.680 
your when you put the car in reverse and
you're<00:05:09.160> in<00:05:09.280> Reverse<00:05:09.430> your<00:05:10.150> reverse<00:05:10.419> lights

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
you're in Reverse your reverse lights

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.659 
you're in Reverse your reverse lights
come<00:05:10.900> on<00:05:10.930> this<00:05:11.830> light<00:05:12.040> is<00:05:12.160> going<00:05:12.190> to<00:05:12.340> come<00:05:12.490> on

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
come on this light is going to come on

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:14.700 
come on this light is going to come on
and<00:05:12.820> emit<00:05:13.030> white<00:05:13.210> just<00:05:14.020> like<00:05:14.110> your<00:05:14.380> your

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
and emit white just like your your

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.950 
and emit white just like your your
regular<00:05:14.919> bulb<00:05:15.550> would<00:05:15.850> do<00:05:16.060> that<00:05:16.450> we<00:05:16.570> took<00:05:16.750> out

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
regular bulb would do that we took out

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.760 
regular bulb would do that we took out
and<00:05:17.669> then<00:05:18.669> if<00:05:18.910> you<00:05:19.150> wanted<00:05:19.450> to<00:05:19.600> actually<00:05:20.380> turn

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
and then if you wanted to actually turn

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.210 
and then if you wanted to actually turn
the<00:05:20.890> light<00:05:21.039> on

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
the light on

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.070 
the light on
so<00:05:21.610> you're<00:05:21.760> responding<00:05:22.270> somewhere<00:05:22.750> you're<00:05:22.990> on

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
so you're responding somewhere you're on

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
so you're responding somewhere you're on
the<00:05:23.169> side<00:05:23.320> of<00:05:23.410> the<00:05:23.470> road<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:23.800> you<00:05:23.860> needed

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
the side of the road and you needed

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.420 
the side of the road and you needed
lighting<00:05:25.140> if<00:05:26.140> you<00:05:26.620> turn<00:05:26.770> the<00:05:26.890> light<00:05:27.039> on<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.190> of

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
lighting if you turn the light on and of

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.040 
lighting if you turn the light on and of
course<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.760> was<00:05:27.880> all<00:05:28.030> white<00:05:28.330> then<00:05:28.810> it<00:05:28.930> would

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
course it was all white then it would

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.440 
course it was all white then it would
emit<00:05:29.470> all<00:05:29.650> white<00:05:29.919> however<00:05:30.610> if<00:05:31.060> you<00:05:31.270> had

ordered<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:31.900> red<00:05:32.110> white<00:05:32.350> version<00:05:32.860> then<00:05:33.490> it

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
ordered the red white version then it

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.430 
ordered the red white version then it
would<00:05:34.600> it<00:05:34.840> would<00:05:34.960> come<00:05:35.140> on<00:05:35.169> as<00:05:35.860> red<00:05:36.270> so<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.570> you

let's<00:06:01.690> turn<00:06:01.900> it<00:06:02.020> on<00:06:02.110> here<00:06:02.410> kind<00:06:03.340> of<00:06:03.400> take<00:06:03.550> a

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
let's turn it on here kind of take a

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.659 
let's turn it on here kind of take a
look<00:06:03.760> at<00:06:03.940> it<00:06:04.060> together<00:06:04.539> I<00:06:05.190> will<00:06:06.190> tell<00:06:06.430> you<00:06:06.520> it

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
look at it together I will tell you it

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:12.210 
look at it together I will tell you it
is<00:06:06.729> a<00:06:06.789> very<00:06:07.300> very<00:06:07.690> intense<00:06:08.140> light<00:06:11.220> it's

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
is a very very intense light it's

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.740 
is a very very intense light it's
extremely<00:06:12.729> bright

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.780 

and<00:06:16.750> there's<00:06:17.650> really<00:06:17.920> not<00:06:18.130> any<00:06:18.370> way<00:06:18.550> that<00:06:18.760> I

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:18.790 
and there's really not any way that I

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.450 
and there's really not any way that I
can<00:06:19.030> try<00:06:19.270> to<00:06:19.470> dampen<00:06:20.470> this<00:06:20.710> down<00:06:20.950> for<00:06:21.220> you<00:06:21.340> and

can try to dampen this down for you and
if<00:06:21.550> I<00:06:21.610> turn<00:06:21.670> it<00:06:21.970> that<00:06:22.120> way

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
if I turn it that way

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.470 
if I turn it that way
or<00:06:23.200> turn<00:06:23.440> it<00:06:23.560> this<00:06:23.680> way<00:06:23.760> or<00:06:24.760> turn<00:06:25.000> it<00:06:25.120> that<00:06:25.300> way

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480
