got from bash Jacques was the following
whether<00:00:41.600> diablo<00:00:42.170> 2<00:00:42.320> did<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:42.620> purposefully<00:00:43.010> or

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
whether diablo 2 did it purposefully or

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.190 
whether diablo 2 did it purposefully or
not<00:00:43.640> we<00:00:43.880> very<00:00:44.120> much<00:00:44.270> like<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.660> feeling<00:00:45.080> of

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
not we very much like the feeling of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.750 
not we very much like the feeling of
accelerating<00:00:45.860> toward<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.309> end<00:00:46.489> of<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.730> game

think<00:00:56.420> we're<00:00:56.870> quite<00:00:57.110> a<00:00:57.199> bit<00:00:57.559> over<00:00:57.800> in<00:00:58.190> any<00:00:58.699> case

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
think we're quite a bit over in any case

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.880 
think we're quite a bit over in any case
we<00:00:59.210> want<00:00:59.449> the<00:00:59.570> player<00:00:59.840> to<00:00:59.870> accelerate<00:01:00.559> towards

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
we want the player to accelerate towards

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.890 
we want the player to accelerate towards
the final<00:01:01.280> conclusion<00:01:01.790> so<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.270> last<00:01:02.570> act

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
the final conclusion so the last act

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.469 
the final conclusion so the last act
will<00:01:03.170> certainly<00:01:03.590> be<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.010> shortest<00:01:04.460> so<00:01:05.180> as<00:01:05.300> it

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
will certainly be the shortest so as it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.210 
will certainly be the shortest so as it
stands<00:01:05.720> right<00:01:05.900> now<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.229> is<00:01:06.320> looking<00:01:06.710> like<00:01:06.770> act

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
stands right now it is looking like act

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.820 
stands right now it is looking like act
4<00:01:07.820> will<00:01:08.120> be<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.390> shortest<00:01:08.420> in<00:01:08.930> diablo<00:01:09.320> 3<00:01:09.590> much

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
4 will be the shortest in diablo 3 much

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.219 
4 will be the shortest in diablo 3 much
as<00:01:10.010> it<00:01:10.159> were<00:01:10.310> in<00:01:10.550> diablo<00:01:11.000> 2<00:01:11.060> and<00:01:11.510> we<00:01:11.840> do<00:01:11.990> need<00:01:12.110> to

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
as it were in diablo 2 and we do need to

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.480 
as it were in diablo 2 and we do need to
realize<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:12.710> this<00:01:12.800> is<00:01:12.979> something<00:01:13.159> that<00:01:13.370> is

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
realize that this is something that is

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.670 
realize that this is something that is
planned<00:01:13.820> by<00:01:14.030> blizzard<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.659> it<00:01:15.140> is<00:01:15.260> all<00:01:15.440> due<00:01:15.650> to

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
planned by blizzard and it is all due to

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.950 
planned by blizzard and it is all due to
pacing<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.880> general<00:01:17.180> feeling<00:01:17.390> of<00:01:17.780> the

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
pacing and the general feeling of the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.600 
pacing and the general feeling of the
game

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.700 

the<00:01:24.240> town<00:01:24.420> portal<00:01:24.720> has<00:01:24.870> made<00:01:25.080> its<00:01:25.260> triumphant

return back into diablo 3 what was once
considered<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.440> bad<00:01:28.710> gameplay<00:01:29.010> mechanic<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> be

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
considered a bad gameplay mechanic to be

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.420 
considered a bad gameplay mechanic to be
replaced<00:01:30.480> by<00:01:31.110> more<00:01:31.350> frequent<00:01:31.830> waypoints

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430

Blizzard<00:01:32.700> has<00:01:32.850> decided<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.420> town<00:01:33.690> portals

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
Blizzard has decided that town portals

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.200 
Blizzard has decided that town portals
do<00:01:34.620> fit<00:01:34.950> within<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.400> game<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.850> then<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.060> just

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
do fit within the game and then it just

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
do fit within the game and then it just
makes<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.480> a<00:01:36.600> better<00:01:36.780> gameplay<00:01:37.170> experience

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
makes for a better gameplay experience

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.650 
makes for a better gameplay experience
now<00:01:38.550> they<00:01:38.730> are<00:01:38.880> worried<00:01:39.240> about<00:01:39.420> possible

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
now they are worried about possible

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.480 
now they are worried about possible
hang-ups<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.440> any<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.830> exploits<00:01:41.280> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
hang-ups or any of the exploits that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.520 
hang-ups or any of the exploits that
were<00:01:41.610> used<00:01:41.850> in<00:01:42.030> diablo<00:01:42.420> 2<00:01:42.600> town<00:01:42.930> portal<00:01:43.260> system

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
were used in diablo 2 town portal system

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.800 
were used in diablo 2 town portal system
but<00:01:44.370> i'm<00:01:44.520> assuming<00:01:44.910> that<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.390> they<00:01:45.510> plan<00:01:45.780> to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
but i'm assuming that what they plan to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.810 
but i'm assuming that what they plan to
do<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.350> add<00:01:46.830> something<00:01:47.160> like<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.580> may<00:01:47.670> not

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
do is add something like you may not

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.640 
do is add something like you may not
town<00:01:48.060> portal<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.870> may<00:01:48.960> not<00:01:49.080> use<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.350> town

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
town portal you may not use a town

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.530 
town portal you may not use a town
portal<00:01:49.979> while<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.280> combat<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.940> this<00:01:51.360> will

portal while in combat and this will
help<00:01:51.600> prevent<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.320> lot<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.800> major<00:01:52.979> issues

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
