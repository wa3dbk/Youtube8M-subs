 Hello we conflict for each other 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.210
 today I tell you how here 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.649
 without a CD 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:12.839
 virtual drive game or program can stand and play too 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.460

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.640
 why is Heinemann the 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.050
 the files from 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.189
 moved from the spot 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.050
 so now with all this it needs a crash landing at 11 o'clock good 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.399

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.399
 under control 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.470
 later the winter is too way 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.850
 You can do this again as in the four-leg third on corner again 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.930

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.570

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.710
 because here everything was as it was 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.400
