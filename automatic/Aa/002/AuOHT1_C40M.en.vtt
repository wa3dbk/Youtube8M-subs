 yoopa senio take to friends we get 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.500
 find for a small video announcement 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.550
 and yes indeed I have some little ones 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.160
 tips to announce you 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.900
 firstly, I am mainly addressing 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.580
 new people on my channel who 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.940
 like to watch but stream et cetera and 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.760
 so 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.720
 know that I stream every Thursday of 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.750
 15h to 19h on gaming live on the webtv 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 pokemon and so I 'm doing it mainly 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.240
 hunting but especially fighting 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.500
 trio of rotary fights and fights 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.620
 miracle here is it 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.700
 every Thursday from 15h to 19h I will put 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.270
 the link in the description 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.070
 then know precisely in partnership 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.230
 with live gaming that I own my 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.690
 own switch chain called gl 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.969
 so live gaming shot from low new 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.140
 'prince' all tied in fact it's a 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.940
 partnership with live gaming 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.129
 I did not start doing lives 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.559

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.640

 pokemon mystery dungeon and so on end 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.100
 in short all that I do not do on my 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.790
 chain is also maybe other games 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.549
 it can happen 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.920
 maybe even super smash bros 3ds 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.990

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.560
