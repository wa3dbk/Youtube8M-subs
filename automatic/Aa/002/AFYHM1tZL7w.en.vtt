00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
they're burrowers so he was just I

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.099 
they're burrowers so he was just I
specifically<00:00:29.369> waited<00:00:30.060> till<00:00:30.240> he<00:00:30.330> came<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:30.750> but

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
specifically waited till he came out but

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.440 
specifically waited till he came out but
of<00:00:31.710> course<00:00:32.130> he's<00:00:32.369> camera-shy<00:00:32.730> anyway<00:00:33.180> he<00:00:33.329> was

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
of course he's camera-shy anyway he was

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.580 
of course he's camera-shy anyway he was
poking<00:00:33.690> his<00:00:33.930> head<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:34.410> he's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
poking his head out of there he's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.729 
poking his head out of there he's
actually<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> big<00:00:35.309> beautiful<00:00:35.910> male<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
actually a big beautiful male and so and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.500 
actually a big beautiful male and so and
because<00:00:38.010> he's<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> bird<00:00:38.670> that's<00:00:39.000> why<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> have

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
because he's a bird that's why I have

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.940 
because he's a bird that's why I have
about<00:00:39.750> six<00:00:40.200> seven<00:00:40.469> inches<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:41.450> mulch<00:00:42.950> potting

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
about six seven inches of mulch potting

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.520 
about six seven inches of mulch potting
soil<00:00:44.190> stuff<00:00:44.520> here<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.030> anyway<00:00:45.840> right<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.260> he's

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
soil stuff here so anyway right now he's

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.400 
soil stuff here so anyway right now he's
under<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.829> water<00:00:47.219> bowl<00:00:48.140> this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> his

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
under that water bowl this is his

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.340 
under that water bowl this is his
habitat<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.210> probably<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.809> ended

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
habitat I think it's probably it ended

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.600 
habitat I think it's probably it ended
up<00:00:52.440> pretty<00:00:52.620> well<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:53.129> supposed<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> they

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
up pretty well it's supposed to they

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.130 
up pretty well it's supposed to they
live<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.879> South<00:00:54.120> America<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.809> that's<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:55.110> I

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
live in South America so that's what I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.270 
live in South America so that's what I
was<00:00:55.289> going<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.559> kind<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> South<00:00:56.160> American

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
was going for kind of a South American

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.270 
was going for kind of a South American
type<00:00:56.850> thing<00:00:57.120> over<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:59.070> think

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
type thing over here is just I think

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.750 
type thing over here is just I think
it's<00:00:59.579> called<00:00:59.760> orchid<00:00:59.940> bark<00:01:00.469> and<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.739> cut<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> slab

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
it's called orchid bark and I cut a slab

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.549 
it's called orchid bark and I cut a slab
there<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.359> he<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.690> go<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> back<00:01:04.260> here

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
there so that he can go in the back here

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.310 
there so that he can go in the back here
and<00:01:04.650> hide<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.330> his<00:01:06.479> heat<00:01:06.750> lamp<00:01:07.049> which

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and hide up here is his heat lamp which

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.130 
and hide up here is his heat lamp which
is<00:01:07.439> just<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.710> 75<00:01:08.220> watt<00:01:08.610> light<00:01:08.880> bulb<00:01:09.180> over<00:01:09.930> here

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
