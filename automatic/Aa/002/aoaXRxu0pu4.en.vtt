00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.050
 accustomed to being a firefighter 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.760
 What does not seem after all 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.320
 the service 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.320
 it's not going to work 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.020
 this law was today 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.480

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.280
 Merry Christmas 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.320
 I'm not the greatest 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.650
 it's the biggest 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.050
 and she goes all over the air 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.680
 because the selection 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.770
 and are the same northeast 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.570
 the same progression does not change its appearance. 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.859
 only has another detail in the hour of the he that she has 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.859
 which is the base goes to the biggest sun 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.620
 and I the biggest fall 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.620
 - I leave the person or people who are afraid of minutes 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.899
 can be done 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:19.899
 or here nothing is the largest screen 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.299
 in another option 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.239
 I would stay there in Brasilia 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.240
 for him good luck to all the state wants to 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.629

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.609
 just in case of the sister already the amendment changes of side it shows how it is done 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.609

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.249
 all through seeing 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.619
 in the refrain 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:10.479
 a jotex costumes to be born mathieu will fit if it really hits the 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.379
 strings and no more strumming 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.379
 same thing 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.949
 I think this case when making an eyelash 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.319
 but you can also play with open hands in some cases I'm not 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.319
 totally the sun quite well too 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.279

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:14.179

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:50.319

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.029

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:57.180

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.360
 the soil 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.669

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.779

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:05.499
