00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.400
 at the end of makeup and hairstyle 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.139
 pin-up inspired by the 50s the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.849
 it's true that I love how the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.250
 women dressed and makeup combed 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.830
 at this time I think it looks super 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.840
 elegant super nice and that also hits 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.880
 a lot of behavior so I hope that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:36.780
 like a lot and above all that serves them 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:38.790
 let's start I'm going to start already with the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.739
 foundation applied to erase 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.930
 a little while already you know that he used 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.600
 is revlon the colors for me 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.030
 I really like to start makeup 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.829
 of eyes with this shadow tone around 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.260
 the mobile eyelid the truth is that I want 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.210
 a very light eye makeup and I'm going to 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.420
 apply this coffee shade in all the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.420
 basin 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.640
 and with a loose hair brush I'm going to 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.640
 blur and remove all cuts 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.680
 until I get something like that I'm going to use 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.050
 is thin tip delineator of 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.790
 Ã©sika that is a black tone and basically 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.920
 what I do for the delineated is 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.770
 first make a trace of how you want the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.030
 we outlined a sketch and say 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.830
 I try to say that I always 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.840
 I use the mirror from the bottom 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.510
 because I think it 's much easier 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.070
 the application and since I have the stroke of 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.970
 how do you want the outline I start 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.009
 fill all that space and as always 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.320
 I advise you to go one step and one step 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.729
 in each eye in everything they do to 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.990
 that in this way they can measure 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.579
 how's it going 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.229
 and now for the delineate tail 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.659
 basically what I do is make a 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.060
 pretty long or longer line of what 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.759
 that I usually do the delineated and 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.460
 begins to unite with the rest after 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.710
 only stuffed and ready some 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:17.819
 adjustments so that it is as even 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:19.769
 possible and something like that we still apply 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.030
 a lot of mascara that you already know that I 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.040
 love passing the face I will apply 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.569
 this foundation of mary kay makeup that 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.640
 It's bright but I'm going to apply very 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.819
 little bit and I really like the finish that 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.860
 leaves on top of the other and here I leave 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.360
 the difference in how it looks without illuminating 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.290
 and as it is seen illuminating with the base and 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.810
 I will comb my eyebrows 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.940
 first to accommodate them and then 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.459
 with a bevelled brush and a shadow on 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.840
 dark tone I'm going to fill them 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.280
 I guess I thought that blouse and going to 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.170
 be very fine problem I realized that 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.640
 in the case and also night that with the 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.040
 lips is that it changed me at the end of the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.750
 video and comb again to remove the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.790
 excesses 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.800
 I'm going to use this mink corrector 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.380
 to illuminate the areas of the ojera is 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.420
 8 yellow tone and once already 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.070
 I have applied I will start to blur 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.070
 and expand with this finger 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.220
 and applied a bit of the illuminating base 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.280
 in those areas so it does not look so 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.040
 clear but still after bronze oy ya 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.960
 it does not look so clear I'm going to seal everything 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:31.570
 this with a brush and some powder 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:33.670
 loose with a larger brush 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:39.520
 I start to seal in the parts where I'm going 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:41.200
 to contour and to tan I take a little 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.000
 of powder to contour but you know 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.190
 that this is finished and maximum and 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.440
 basically what I do is give dimension 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.360
 to the face only in areas in 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.520
 where I want but if you want to be 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.410
 it's easier for you to make a 3 like 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.380
 I'm doing it now and it's going to be 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.150
 much easier to identify I'm going to 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.770
 apply a little bronze this is the one of 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.870
 I see and more or less at the height of 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.730
 cheekbone 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.830
 and I'm going to use this leber lipstick 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.409
 I really love that I love me 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.890
 the tone seems beautiful and they are going to see and 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:14.850
 it's also that I'm too much of this tone 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.850
 but not 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.920
 passing the hairstyle first I'm going to 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.310
 apply a little bit of protector against 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.930
 hot 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.360
 this is the brand billion of are and what 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.610
 you can find in leaving beauty supply 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.070
 more than anything I put on the tips and with 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.200
 a pincer of these for encinar or pincer 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.930
 of which you have I'm going to start 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.490
 take healthy hair lazaro follows us a 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.610
 order I simply take strands of 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.910
 hair and I do the ripples for 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.910
 behind 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.669
 and since the loose I start to shape 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.669
 with the fingers 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.180
 and the final look could look like this 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.070
 simply with the ripples the 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.650
 I really like it a lot but as I am 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.590
 a little thinner then let's add 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.060
 other little things like those strips that sell 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.580
 in many parts I for example the 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.870
 I bought is in the socket of the city of 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.490
 mexico then if they go to the 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.470
 You put in there sure you find 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.150
 for those who are the df and are about 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.830
 wires that come lined with fabric that 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.630
 allow you to give it the form that 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.120
 you want then he is very father and besides 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.220
 grip the hair very well since 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.289
 I put like a little Chinese people like 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.090
 I want and for the back hairstyle 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.910
 I'm just going to start turning the 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.949
 hair like rolling it and I apply many 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.900
 good not so many pins the truth is 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:49.620
 that my hair holds is with a 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:51.180
 passed because I do not have and already for 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.770
 finish applied a little protector 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.590
 against the heat to give a little bit of 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.150
 shine and so is the hairstyle that 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.130
 it seems the truth to me it makes me super 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.130
 nice and also very fast 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.689
