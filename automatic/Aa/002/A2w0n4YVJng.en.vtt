00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hello and I come to the next video in

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.340 
hello and I come to the next video in
the<00:00:02.159> Satori<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.700> serious<00:00:03.179> and<00:00:03.449> in<00:00:03.899> this<00:00:04.080> video

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
the Satori is serious and in this video

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.600 
the Satori is serious and in this video
we<00:00:04.890> will<00:00:05.069> have<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.370> closer<00:00:05.759> look<00:00:06.000> at<00:00:06.359> reclaim

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:07.610 
we will have a closer look at reclaim

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.220 
we will have a closer look at reclaim
reclaim<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> pretty<00:00:09.240> unique<00:00:09.540> thing<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.990> sap

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
reclaim is a pretty unique thing in sap

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.780 
reclaim is a pretty unique thing in sap
comm<00:00:10.500> there<00:00:10.740> are<00:00:10.860> similar<00:00:11.190> things<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.639> other

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
comm there are similar things and other

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.010 
comm there are similar things and other
RPGs<00:00:12.480> but<00:00:12.509> not<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.590> important<00:00:14.630> so<00:00:15.630> it's

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
RPGs but not that important so it's

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.590 
RPGs but not that important so it's
basically<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:17.550> can<00:00:17.850> reclaim<00:00:18.180> any

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
basically that you can reclaim any

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.140 
basically that you can reclaim any
building<00:00:19.230> or<00:00:19.439> rack<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.520> game<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:21.029> an

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
building or rack in this game with an

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.509 
building or rack in this game with an
engineer<00:00:21.630> with<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.869> ACU<00:00:22.320> with<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.859> technical

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
engineer with the ACU with a technical

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.250 
engineer with the ACU with a technical
drone<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.359> commander<00:00:24.779> or<00:00:24.930> whatever

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
drone with your commander or whatever

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.470 
drone with your commander or whatever
and<00:00:27.410> you<00:00:28.410> gain<00:00:28.650> mass<00:00:28.920> from<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.119> mean

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
and you gain mass from it so that mean

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.420 
and you gain mass from it so that mean
you<00:00:30.599> don't<00:00:30.779> get<00:00:31.109> mass<00:00:31.470> from<00:00:31.830> reclaiming

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
you don't get mass from reclaiming

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.270 
you don't get mass from reclaiming
buildings<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:33.510> actually<00:00:33.930> not<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.280> so

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
buildings that are actually not that so

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.250 
buildings that are actually not that so
if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.700> reclaim<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.300> building<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.020> will

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
if you reclaim this building you will

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.590 
if you reclaim this building you will
gain<00:00:37.469> no<00:00:37.739> mass<00:00:37.980> from<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.370> until<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:39.059> gets

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
gain no mass from it until it gets

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.600 
gain no mass from it until it gets
destroyed<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:41.540> you<00:00:42.540> actually<00:00:43.430> reclaim<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
destroyed and you actually reclaim the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.310 
destroyed and you actually reclaim the
mass<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> building<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.660> not<00:00:45.930> building

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
mass of the building and not building

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.740 
mass of the building and not building
Excel<00:00:46.680> or<00:00:47.190> apples<00:00:47.550> before<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:49.219> as<00:00:50.570> you<00:00:51.570> can

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
Excel or apples before but as you can

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.900 
Excel or apples before but as you can
see<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.110> soon<00:00:52.260> as<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> building<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.160> destroyed

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
see as soon as the building is destroyed

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.049 
see as soon as the building is destroyed
my<00:00:54.239> mass<00:00:54.510> goes<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:54.930> again<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.640> it<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.879> give

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
my mass goes up again and it will give

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.420 
my mass goes up again and it will give
me<00:00:57.270> back<00:00:57.510> around<00:00:57.899> 80<00:00:58.199> percentage<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.980> my<00:00:59.190> mass

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
me back around 80 percentage of my mass

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.970 
me back around 80 percentage of my mass
and<00:00:59.930> that's<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> first<00:01:01.289> thing<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.770> should

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and that's the first thing you should

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.070 
and that's the first thing you should
know<00:01:02.160> about<00:01:02.190> reclaim<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.840> have<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
know about reclaim if you have a

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.030 
know about reclaim if you have a
destructed<00:01:04.799> building<00:01:05.420> then<00:01:06.860> then<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> can

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
destructed building then then you can

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
destructed building then then you can
use<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.450> feature<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:12.630> build

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
use this this feature that you build

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.560 
use this this feature that you build
something<00:01:13.590> upon<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> destructive<00:01:15.150> building

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
something upon a destructive building

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.850 
something upon a destructive building
and<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.140> get<00:01:16.790> half<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.530> building<00:01:19.530> for

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and you get half of the building for

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.920 
and you get half of the building for
free<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.700> start<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.330> wreck<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> this

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
free so if I start on the wreck of this

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
free so if I start on the wreck of this
it<00:01:22.740> will<00:01:22.890> already<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.430> half<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.880> building

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it will already have half the building

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.200 
it will already have half the building
table<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.350> that's<00:01:25.530> pretty<00:01:25.770> nice<00:01:26.100> because<00:01:26.490> if

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
table so that's pretty nice because if

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.300 
table so that's pretty nice because if
you<00:01:27.450> reclaim<00:01:27.780> buildings<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> only<00:01:29.009> get<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you reclaim buildings you only get the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.539 
you reclaim buildings you only get the
mass<00:01:29.460> back<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.270> energy<00:01:30.770> but<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:32.189> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
mass back but not the energy but if you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.330 
mass back but not the energy but if you
have<00:01:32.820> enough<00:01:33.210> energy<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.780> if<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.799> don't<00:01:35.040> need

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
have enough energy and if you don't need

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.310 
have enough energy and if you don't need
the<00:01:35.520> building<00:01:35.880> right<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:37.079> should

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the building right now you should

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.289 
the building right now you should
reclaim<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> rack<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:38.909> build<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
reclaim the rack and then build a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
reclaim the rack and then build a
building<00:01:39.750> upon<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.400> especially

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
building upon it this is especially

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.880 
building upon it this is especially
important<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:42.869> take<00:01:43.470> free<00:01:43.710> mass

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
important if you have take free mass

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.810 
important if you have take free mass
extractors<00:01:44.630> because<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.460> if<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
extractors because if you if you have a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.370 
extractors because if you if you have a
destroy<00:01:48.180> tech<00:01:48.420> free<00:01:48.630> mass<00:01:48.780> extractor<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
destroy tech free mass extractor and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.080 
destroy tech free mass extractor and
just<00:01:49.560> pull<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> take<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.340> mass<00:01:50.549> extractor<00:01:50.850> on

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
just pull the take one mass extractor on

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.880 
just pull the take one mass extractor on
it<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.360> take<00:01:51.509> mod<00:01:51.720> mass<00:01:51.930> extractor<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.619> gain

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
it and take mod mass extractor will gain

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.730 
it and take mod mass extractor will gain
half<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.340> itself<00:01:53.899> but<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.229> take<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.560> mass

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
half of itself but the take one mass

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.060 
half of itself but the take one mass
extract<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.250> only<00:01:56.369> light<00:01:57.469> 816<00:01:58.469> mass<00:01:58.710> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
extract is the only light 816 mass and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.420 
extract is the only light 816 mass and
take<00:01:59.850> freeze<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.810> than<00:02:00.899> 2,000<00:02:01.619> sure

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
take freeze like more than 2,000 sure

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.520 
take freeze like more than 2,000 sure
you<00:02:02.579> should<00:02:02.820> reclaim<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> tech<00:02:04.079> free<00:02:04.350> mass

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you should reclaim the tech free mass

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.440

take one or build it up take free
directly<00:02:09.000> upon<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.560> but<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:11.280> not<00:02:11.310> both<00:02:11.670> take

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.490 
the wrecks of tech Freeman's extractors
so<00:02:17.850> at<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> very<00:02:18.690> beginning<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.470> game

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
so at the very beginning of the game

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.520 
so at the very beginning of the game
you're<00:02:20.310> threatened<00:02:21.240> or<00:02:21.480> at<00:02:21.990> least<00:02:22.230> third

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
you're threatened or at least third

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.190 
you're threatened or at least third
engineer<00:02:23.100> should<00:02:23.460> go<00:02:23.700> reclaiming<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
engineer should go reclaiming and the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.250 
engineer should go reclaiming and the
first<00:02:25.470> thing<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.890> look<00:02:26.040> for<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.670> big<00:02:27.420> rocks<00:02:27.750> so

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
first thing you look for is big rocks so

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.430 
first thing you look for is big rocks so
like<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.360> if<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.480> have<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.780> big<00:02:31.050> rocks

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
like this and if you have this big rocks

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.970 
like this and if you have this big rocks
it's<00:02:31.710> really<00:02:31.980> rough<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:33.230> make<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.470> manual

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
it's really rough to make this manual

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.150 
it's really rough to make this manual
reclaim<00:02:35.400> order<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.620> look<00:02:37.620> for<00:02:37.830> more<00:02:37.980> big

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
reclaim order and look for more big

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.360 
reclaim order and look for more big
rocks<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:39.000> really<00:02:39.920> make<00:02:40.920> reclaim

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
rocks and you can really make reclaim

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.490 
rocks and you can really make reclaim
order<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:41.850> all<00:02:42.060> big<00:02:42.330> rocks<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.930> as<00:02:43.170> long<00:02:43.440> as

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
order for all big rocks it's as long as

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.700 
order for all big rocks it's as long as
you<00:02:43.770> can<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.340> sure<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.350> protect

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
you can be sure that you can protect

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.640 
you can be sure that you can protect
your<00:02:46.980> engineer<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.730> these<00:02:48.570> big<00:02:48.870> rocks<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.620> be

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
your engineer and these big rocks can be

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.250 
your engineer and these big rocks can be
about<00:02:50.390> 100<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:52.280> 250<00:02:53.280> mass<00:02:54.140> there<00:02:55.140> are

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
about 100 to 250 mass there are

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.790 
about 100 to 250 mass there are
different<00:02:55.620> big<00:02:55.770> rocks<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:58.230> small<00:02:58.500> rocks

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
different big rocks and the small rocks

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.860 
different big rocks and the small rocks
there<00:02:59.010> are<00:02:59.040> small<00:02:59.550> rocks<00:02:59.880> with<00:03:00.210> around

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
there are small rocks with around

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.690 
there are small rocks with around
hundred<00:03:01.230> mass<00:03:01.440> most<00:03:01.770> of<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.920> small<00:03:02.190> rocks<00:03:02.460> are

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
hundred mass most of the small rocks are

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.840 
hundred mass most of the small rocks are
only<00:03:03.030> like<00:03:03.210> 20<00:03:03.840> or<00:03:04.200> 40<00:03:04.860> mass<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.520> it's<00:03:05.640> really

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
only like 20 or 40 mass but it's really

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.840 
only like 20 or 40 mass but it's really
worth<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.330> if<00:03:06.510> you<00:03:06.590> just<00:03:07.590> reclaim<00:03:08.010> all<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
worth it if you just reclaim all the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.930 
worth it if you just reclaim all the
rocks<00:03:09.210> here<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.780> probably<00:03:10.260> gain<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.940> 2,000

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
rocks here you probably gain like 2,000

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.480 
rocks here you probably gain like 2,000
miles<00:03:12.120> extra<00:03:12.570> heads<00:03:13.160> basically<00:03:14.160> it's<00:03:14.280> lower

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
miles extra heads basically it's lower

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.630 
miles extra heads basically it's lower
but<00:03:14.960> it's<00:03:15.960> really<00:03:16.200> important<00:03:16.800> is<00:03:16.920> it's<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.400> huge

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
but it's really important is it's a huge

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.090 
but it's really important is it's a huge
advantage<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.360> early<00:03:18.660> game<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.170> big

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
advantage in the early game a big

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.670 
advantage in the early game a big
mistake<00:03:20.520> that<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.060> made<00:03:21.090> with<00:03:21.780> freak<00:03:22.170> land<00:03:22.470> is

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
mistake that is made with freak land is

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.760 
mistake that is made with freak land is
that<00:03:22.950> many<00:03:23.370> people<00:03:23.490> are<00:03:24.300> not<00:03:24.959> able<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.440> spend

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
that many people are not able to spend

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.800 
that many people are not able to spend
the<00:03:25.920> reclaiming<00:03:26.250> thing<00:03:26.490> lately<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:27.180> updated

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
the reclaiming thing lately just updated

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.170 
the reclaiming thing lately just updated
massive<00:03:28.140> great<00:03:28.560> massive<00:03:28.890> structures<00:03:29.310> but

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
massive great massive structures but

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.090 
massive great massive structures but
that's<00:03:30.330> actually<00:03:30.690> pretty<00:03:30.870> bad<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:31.380> if<00:03:31.740> you

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
that's actually pretty bad so if you

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.340 
that's actually pretty bad so if you
play<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> map<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.820> first<00:03:33.030> time<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:34.080> see

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
play a map the first time and you see

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.220 
play a map the first time and you see
that<00:03:34.620> you<00:03:34.950> have<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.970> upgrade<00:03:36.120> mass<00:03:36.540> extractors

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
that you have to upgrade mass extractors

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.470 
that you have to upgrade mass extractors
in<00:03:37.470> order<00:03:37.740> to<00:03:37.830> not<00:03:38.040> based<00:03:38.250> mass<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:39.000> next<00:03:39.300> time

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
in order to not based mass the next time

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.300 
in order to not based mass the next time
just<00:03:39.750> hold<00:03:39.930> more<00:03:40.200> engineers<00:03:40.740> at<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.070> start

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
just hold more engineers at the start

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.180 
just hold more engineers at the start
for<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.520> game<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.320> can<00:03:43.470> spend<00:03:44.100> the

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
for the game so you can spend the

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.580 
for the game so you can spend the
massive<00:03:44.489> factories<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.239> as<00:03:46.020> long<00:03:46.290> as<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:46.470> do

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
massive factories and as long as you do

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.530 
massive factories and as long as you do
not<00:03:46.739> play<00:03:46.950> Seaton's<00:03:47.400> or<00:03:47.670> another<00:03:48.000> type<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.270> map

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
not play Seaton's or another type of map

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.090 
not play Seaton's or another type of map
you<00:03:48.570> should<00:03:48.810> never<00:03:48.959> use<00:03:49.290> your<00:03:49.440> reclaim<00:03:49.860> to

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
you should never use your reclaim to

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.400 
you should never use your reclaim to
instantly<00:03:50.640> all<00:03:50.880> upgrade<00:03:51.450> all<00:03:51.600> your<00:03:51.630> maxes<00:03:52.170> but

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
instantly all upgrade all your maxes but

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.210 
instantly all upgrade all your maxes but
put<00:03:52.770> no<00:03:52.920> factory<00:03:53.400> especially<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.000> 1v1<00:03:55.010> yes<00:03:56.010> it

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
put no factory especially in 1v1 yes it

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.830 
put no factory especially in 1v1 yes it
might<00:03:56.340> be<00:03:56.489> different<00:03:56.880> than<00:03:56.940> for<00:03:57.239> before<00:03:57.660> but

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
might be different than for before but

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.620 
might be different than for before but
definitely<00:03:58.440> not<00:03:58.530> in<00:03:58.709> between<00:03:59.040> one

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
definitely not in between one

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.410 
definitely not in between one
the<00:04:01.770> problem<00:04:02.770> many<00:04:03.010> new<00:04:03.400> players<00:04:03.730> have<00:04:04.209> for

the problem many new players have for
free<00:04:04.600> chem<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:04.870> it's<00:04:05.319> really<00:04:05.770> annoying<00:04:06.190> if<00:04:06.580> you

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
free chem is it's really annoying if you

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.530 
free chem is it's really annoying if you
have<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.720> click<00:04:07.930> every<00:04:08.380> single<00:04:08.770> stone<00:04:09.240> so<00:04:10.240> if

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
have to click every single stone so if

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.780 
have to click every single stone so if
you<00:04:10.750> right-click<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:11.380> stone<00:04:11.830> and<00:04:12.220> if<00:04:12.640> you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
you right-click a stone and if you

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.850 
you right-click a stone and if you
target<00:04:13.000> correctly<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:14.020> won't<00:04:14.200> automatically

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
target correctly you won't automatically

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.289 
target correctly you won't automatically
get<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.130> reclaim<00:04:15.490> but<00:04:15.670> if<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:15.940> click<00:04:16.120> right

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
get to reclaim but if you click right

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.090 
get to reclaim but if you click right
next<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:16.959> will<00:04:17.139> get<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.530> move<00:04:17.680> comment

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
next to it you will get the move comment

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.170 
next to it you will get the move comment
that's<00:04:18.370> pretty<00:04:18.700> annoying<00:04:19.290> so<00:04:20.549> what<00:04:21.549> you<00:04:21.700> do<00:04:21.910> is

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
that's pretty annoying so what you do is

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.440 
that's pretty annoying so what you do is
pressing<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.750> ek<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.470> then<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.760> can<00:04:24.940> just

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
pressing the ek and then you can just

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.060 
pressing the ek and then you can just
click<00:04:25.690> around<00:04:25.840> and<00:04:26.200> even<00:04:26.290> if<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:26.560> click<00:04:26.740> next

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
click around and even if you click next

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.250 
click around and even if you click next
to<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:27.490> doesn't<00:04:27.700> matter<00:04:27.940> if<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:28.930> have<00:04:29.080> the

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
to it it doesn't matter if you have the

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.350 
to it it doesn't matter if you have the
time<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.590> do<00:04:29.740> that<00:04:29.919> that's<00:04:30.160> the<00:04:30.370> fast<00:04:30.580> way<00:04:31.330> to

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
time to do that that's the fast way to

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.860 
time to do that that's the fast way to
reclaim<00:04:31.840> stones<00:04:32.560> or<00:04:33.060> yeah<00:04:34.060> I'm<00:04:34.300> not<00:04:34.450> sure<00:04:34.480> for

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
reclaim stones or yeah I'm not sure for

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.960 
reclaim stones or yeah I'm not sure for
the<00:04:34.990> forest<00:04:35.350> actually<00:04:35.530> but<00:04:35.800> it's<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.280> fastest

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
the forest actually but it's the fastest

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.830 
the forest actually but it's the fastest
way<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.180> blame<00:04:37.450> stones<00:04:38.669> but<00:04:39.669> off<00:04:40.390> you<00:04:40.720> won't

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
way to blame stones but off you won't

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.110 
way to blame stones but off you won't
have<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.260> time<00:04:41.290> for<00:04:41.470> that<00:04:41.710> so<00:04:42.220> in<00:04:42.580> this<00:04:42.820> case

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
have the time for that so in this case

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.590 
have the time for that so in this case
the<00:04:43.480> best<00:04:43.750> option<00:04:44.260> is<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.830> either<00:04:45.669> use<00:04:46.270> the

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
the best option is to either use the

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.280 
the best option is to either use the
Patrol<00:04:46.930> command<00:04:47.320> to<00:04:48.160> cover<00:04:48.520> huge<00:04:49.030> areas<00:04:49.300> just

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
Patrol command to cover huge areas just

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.020 
Patrol command to cover huge areas just
set<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.590> Patrol<00:04:50.950> command<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.550> then<00:04:51.760> the

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
set a Patrol command and then the

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.450 
set a Patrol command and then the
engineer<00:04:52.750> will<00:04:52.960> automatically<00:04:53.800> move<00:04:54.130> around

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
engineer will automatically move around

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.270 
engineer will automatically move around
and<00:04:55.050> we<00:04:56.050> claim<00:04:56.229> some<00:04:56.470> stuff<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.860> cool<00:04:57.040> thing

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
and we claim some stuff the cool thing

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.950 
and we claim some stuff the cool thing
about<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.790> patrol<00:04:58.180> command<00:04:58.479> is<00:04:58.570> actually

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
about the patrol command is actually

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.469 
about the patrol command is actually
that<00:04:59.169> as<00:04:59.560> long<00:04:59.860> as<00:04:59.979> you<00:05:00.070> have<00:05:00.370> mass<00:05:00.729> it<00:05:01.330> does

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
that as long as you have mass it does

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.810 
that as long as you have mass it does
not<00:05:01.570> reclaim<00:05:02.020> anything<00:05:02.560> you<00:05:02.950> only<00:05:03.370> reclaim<00:05:03.700> if

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
not reclaim anything you only reclaim if

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.190 
not reclaim anything you only reclaim if
you<00:05:03.910> don't<00:05:04.090> have<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.450> mass<00:05:04.600> so<00:05:04.840> you're<00:05:05.050> born

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
you don't have the mass so you're born

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.340 
you don't have the mass so you're born
based<00:05:06.479> normally<00:05:07.479> you<00:05:07.630> shouldn't<00:05:07.990> have<00:05:08.110> full

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
based normally you shouldn't have full

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.590 
based normally you shouldn't have full
mess<00:05:08.530> anyway<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.040> it's<00:05:09.580> not<00:05:09.729> really<00:05:10.090> important

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
mess anyway so it's not really important

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.260 
mess anyway so it's not really important
and<00:05:10.860> there<00:05:11.860> is<00:05:11.979> another<00:05:12.190> possibility<00:05:12.640> to

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
and there is another possibility to

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.130 
and there is another possibility to
reclaim<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.850> most<00:05:15.850> people<00:05:16.240> consider<00:05:16.900> this

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
reclaim and most people consider this

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.830 
reclaim and most people consider this
the<00:05:17.410> more<00:05:17.800> efficient<00:05:18.220> way<00:05:18.370> it's<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.600> attack

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
the more efficient way it's the attack

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.990 
the more efficient way it's the attack
move<00:05:20.020> Agana<00:05:20.380> already<00:05:20.860> said<00:05:21.340> something<00:05:21.550> about

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
move Agana already said something about

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.820 
move Agana already said something about
this<00:05:22.180> when<00:05:22.419> we<00:05:22.510> have<00:05:22.660> when<00:05:23.110> we<00:05:23.229> had<00:05:23.380> Celine's

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
this when we have when we had Celine's

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.670 
this when we have when we had Celine's
you<00:05:24.789> press<00:05:25.330> out<00:05:25.570> and<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.169> click<00:05:26.410> somewhere

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
you press out and you click somewhere

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.370 
you press out and you click somewhere
with<00:05:27.310> moving<00:05:27.640> command<00:05:27.970> and<00:05:28.200> then<00:05:29.200> the

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
with moving command and then the

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.560 
with moving command and then the
engineer<00:05:29.800> will<00:05:30.160> reclaim<00:05:30.580> anything<00:05:31.270> on<00:05:31.419> its

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
engineer will reclaim anything on its

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.710 
engineer will reclaim anything on its
way<00:05:31.840> so<00:05:31.900> it<00:05:32.560> will<00:05:32.770> go<00:05:33.039> a<00:05:33.520> bit<00:05:34.000> aside<00:05:34.270> it's<00:05:34.510> way

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
way so it will go a bit aside it's way

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.779 
way so it will go a bit aside it's way
over<00:05:35.020> basically<00:05:35.470> you<00:05:35.560> can<00:05:35.770> say<00:05:35.950> it's<00:05:36.130> claims

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
over basically you can say it's claims

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.610 
over basically you can say it's claims
within<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.479> board<00:05:37.720> range<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.260> moving<00:05:38.530> that

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
within the board range and moving that

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.400 
within the board range and moving that
way<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:39.130> will<00:05:39.690> reclaim<00:05:40.690> any<00:05:41.020> frame

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
way so it will reclaim any frame

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.120 
way so it will reclaim any frame
anything<00:05:42.070> from<00:05:42.250> here<00:05:42.640> to<00:05:42.850> here

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
anything from here to here

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.920 
anything from here to here
and<00:05:46.950> the<00:05:47.950> last<00:05:48.160> very<00:05:48.940> important<00:05:49.480> thing<00:05:49.750> about

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
and the last very important thing about

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.350 
and the last very important thing about
reclaim<00:05:50.620> is<00:05:50.800> actually<00:05:51.220> a<00:05:51.250> small<00:05:51.580> back<00:05:51.880> but

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
reclaim is actually a small back but

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.820 
reclaim is actually a small back but
it's<00:05:52.720> really<00:05:52.900> an<00:05:53.020> accepted<00:05:53.530> back<00:05:53.650> so

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
it's really an accepted back so

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.740 
it's really an accepted back so
everybody<00:05:54.250> does<00:05:54.460> it<00:05:54.700> and<00:05:54.910> it's<00:05:55.180> officially

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
everybody does it and it's officially

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.070 
everybody does it and it's officially
and<00:05:56.430> it's<00:05:57.430> officially<00:05:58.000> allowed<00:05:58.240> so<00:05:58.600> you<00:05:58.660> don't

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
and it's officially allowed so you don't

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.710 
and it's officially allowed so you don't
have<00:05:59.200> to<00:05:59.350> feel<00:05:59.500> bad<00:05:59.530> if<00:06:00.040> you<00:06:00.160> do<00:06:00.280> that<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:00.720> it's

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
have to feel bad if you do that and it's

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.760 
have to feel bad if you do that and it's
that<00:06:01.990> you<00:06:02.110> give<00:06:02.350> the<00:06:02.650> factory<00:06:03.610> an<00:06:03.760> attack<00:06:04.060> move

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
that you give the factory an attack move

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.560 
that you give the factory an attack move
so<00:06:05.770> by<00:06:05.980> giving<00:06:06.340> the<00:06:06.460> factory<00:06:06.910> an<00:06:07.000> attack<00:06:07.300> move

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
so by giving the factory an attack move

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.230 
so by giving the factory an attack move
the<00:06:08.290> engineer<00:06:08.890> will<00:06:09.310> move<00:06:09.610> to<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:09.910> target

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
the engineer will move to the target

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.210 
the engineer will move to the target
position<00:06:10.390> and<00:06:12.420> it<00:06:13.420> will<00:06:13.780> suddenly<00:06:14.410> gain<00:06:14.890> a

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:15.220 
position and it will suddenly gain a

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.420 
position and it will suddenly gain a
huge<00:06:15.730> power<00:06:16.120> and<00:06:16.420> huge<00:06:16.690> boost<00:06:16.990> on<00:06:17.350> its<00:06:17.590> reclaim

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
huge power and huge boost on its reclaim

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.490 
huge power and huge boost on its reclaim
range<00:06:18.730> so<00:06:19.030> it<00:06:19.120> can<00:06:19.330> claim<00:06:19.690> everything<00:06:20.050> in<00:06:20.380> that

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
range so it can claim everything in that

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.260 
range so it can claim everything in that
radius<00:06:20.980> and<00:06:21.190> its<00:06:21.310> really<00:06:21.730> fast<00:06:22.030> for

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
radius and its really fast for

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.770 
radius and its really fast for
reclaiming<00:06:22.660> so<00:06:23.380> if<00:06:23.740> you<00:06:24.340> have<00:06:24.490> huge<00:06:24.820> areas

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
reclaiming so if you have huge areas

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.360 
reclaiming so if you have huge areas
with<00:06:25.990> forests<00:06:26.440> this<00:06:26.620> is<00:06:26.740> really<00:06:27.070> the<00:06:27.160> most

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
with forests this is really the most

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.730 
with forests this is really the most
efficient<00:06:27.850> way<00:06:28.000> and<00:06:28.030> whenever<00:06:28.960> you<00:06:29.170> can<00:06:29.560> do

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
efficient way and whenever you can do

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.890 
efficient way and whenever you can do
this<00:06:29.980> you<00:06:30.100> should<00:06:30.310> do<00:06:30.520> this<00:06:30.730> and<00:06:30.970> if<00:06:31.570> you<00:06:31.690> see

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
this you should do this and if you see

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.540 
this you should do this and if you see
the<00:06:32.140> area<00:06:32.530> here<00:06:32.680> is<00:06:32.740> reclaimed<00:06:33.100> then<00:06:33.280> you<00:06:33.400> can

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
the area here is reclaimed then you can

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.040 
the area here is reclaimed then you can
use<00:06:33.730> the<00:06:33.940> normal<00:06:34.120> attack<00:06:34.360> move<00:06:34.690> somewhere

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
use the normal attack move somewhere

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.470 
use the normal attack move somewhere
else<00:06:35.110> and<00:06:35.590> just<00:06:36.370> set<00:06:36.670> the<00:06:36.790> factory<00:06:37.240> somewhere

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
else and just set the factory somewhere

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
else and just set the factory somewhere
out<00:06:37.780> so<00:06:38.230> it<00:06:38.710> can<00:06:39.010> reclaim<00:06:39.280> some<00:06:39.610> rads<00:06:40.500> the

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
out so it can reclaim some rads the

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.410 
out so it can reclaim some rads the
problematic<00:06:42.040> and<00:06:42.370> cool<00:06:42.610> thing<00:06:42.940> at<00:06:43.090> the<00:06:43.210> same

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
problematic and cool thing at the same

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.260 
problematic and cool thing at the same
time<00:06:43.720> this<00:06:43.900> is<00:06:44.380> actually<00:06:44.650> that<00:06:45.070> you<00:06:45.940> see<00:06:46.120> we

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
time this is actually that you see we

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.810 
time this is actually that you see we
can<00:06:46.300> really<00:06:47.010> burst<00:06:48.010> up<00:06:48.250> the<00:06:48.370> Ranger<00:06:48.640> just

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
can really burst up the Ranger just

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.090 
can really burst up the Ranger just
reclaim<00:06:49.150> something<00:06:49.450> here<00:06:49.960> above<00:06:50.230> an<00:06:50.620> engineer

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
reclaim something here above an engineer

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.540 
reclaim something here above an engineer
that<00:06:51.340> is<00:06:51.400> standing<00:06:52.090> here<00:06:52.390> and<00:06:52.860> for<00:06:53.860> example<00:06:54.160> if

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
that is standing here and for example if

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.430 
that is standing here and for example if
you<00:06:54.670> build<00:06:54.880> a<00:06:54.970> factory<00:06:55.150> at<00:06:55.540> the<00:06:55.570> front<00:06:55.990> and<00:06:56.380> you

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
you build a factory at the front and you

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.090 
you build a factory at the front and you
have<00:06:56.800> a<00:06:56.920> huge<00:06:57.250> fight<00:06:57.580> going<00:06:57.880> on<00:06:58.060> here<00:06:58.450> and<00:06:59.100> the

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.100 
have a huge fight going on here and the

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.440 
have a huge fight going on here and the
command<00:07:00.430> is<00:07:00.550> probably<00:07:00.850> standing<00:07:01.120> somewhere

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.450 
command is probably standing somewhere

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.240 
command is probably standing somewhere
around<00:07:01.540> there<00:07:01.900> you<00:07:02.470> have<00:07:02.740> actually<00:07:03.130> your

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.250 
around there you have actually your

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.060 
around there you have actually your
engineers<00:07:03.730> in<00:07:03.910> the<00:07:04.300> second<00:07:04.660> row<00:07:04.840> and<00:07:05.080> that<00:07:05.800> can

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
engineers in the second row and that can

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.150 
engineers in the second row and that can
reclaim<00:07:06.520> everything<00:07:06.790> that<00:07:07.330> is<00:07:07.810> there<00:07:08.020> so<00:07:08.320> if

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
reclaim everything that is there so if

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.860 
reclaim everything that is there so if
you<00:07:09.280> have<00:07:09.460> huge<00:07:09.850> reclaim<00:07:10.240> faults<00:07:10.630> you<00:07:10.720> can

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
you have huge reclaim faults you can

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.480 
you have huge reclaim faults you can
really<00:07:11.110> afford<00:07:11.230> to<00:07:11.560> build<00:07:11.770> a<00:07:11.920> factory<00:07:12.100> at<00:07:12.400> the

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
really afford to build a factory at the

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.550 
really afford to build a factory at the
front<00:07:12.820> and<00:07:13.000> then<00:07:13.720> use<00:07:14.050> this<00:07:14.200> a<00:07:14.260> tecmo

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 
front and then use this a tecmo

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.400 
front and then use this a tecmo
somewhere<00:07:15.340> at<00:07:15.610> the<00:07:15.940> front<00:07:16.210> but<00:07:16.420> not<00:07:16.630> but

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 
somewhere at the front but not but

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.410 
somewhere at the front but not but
behind<00:07:17.620> your<00:07:17.830> tanks<00:07:18.190> and<00:07:18.370> then<00:07:19.150> it<00:07:19.240> will

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.420 
behind your tanks and then it will

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.970 
behind your tanks and then it will
actually<00:07:19.630> reclaim<00:07:20.230> all<00:07:20.260> the<00:07:20.500> racks<00:07:20.710> and

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:20.980 
actually reclaim all the racks and

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.130 
actually reclaim all the racks and
sometimes<00:07:21.430> it<00:07:21.550> even<00:07:21.730> reclaims<00:07:22.270> enemy<00:07:22.660> tanks

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.140 
sometimes it even reclaims enemy tanks

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.250 
sometimes it even reclaims enemy tanks
and<00:07:23.970> it<00:07:24.970> actually<00:07:25.120> out<00:07:25.360> ranges<00:07:25.750> enemy<00:07:26.050> tanks

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:26.260 
and it actually out ranges enemy tanks

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.190 
and it actually out ranges enemy tanks
it's<00:07:26.710> a<00:07:26.800> bit<00:07:26.980> strange<00:07:27.640> but<00:07:28.090> you<00:07:28.690> will<00:07:28.840> get<00:07:29.050> you

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.200 
it's a bit strange but you will get you

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.120 
it's a bit strange but you will get you
stared<00:07:29.590> and<00:07:30.900> that's<00:07:31.900> pretty<00:07:32.320> much<00:07:32.530> everything

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
stared and that's pretty much everything

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.470 
stared and that's pretty much everything
you<00:07:33.160> should<00:07:33.340> have<00:07:33.490> to<00:07:33.640> know<00:07:33.760> about<00:07:33.880> reclaim

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:34.480 
you should have to know about reclaim

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.830 
you should have to know about reclaim
see<00:07:35.050> you<00:07:35.140> in<00:07:35.230> the<00:07:35.320> next<00:07:35.560> video
