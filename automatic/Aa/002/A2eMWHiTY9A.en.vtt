00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.020
 at 12 minutes he pants open 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.170
 in theory 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.740
 nothing changes on your tv from the beginning of digital signal transmissions 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.239
 in practice 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.169
 and there we have digital tv 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.259
 we have two ways 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.970
 television set-top box that is nothing more than a box that 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:26.489
 receives the digital signal internally transformed them analog and then you call 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.710
 the analog tv if you can get it digital but not me high definition 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.629
 because by acp high definition and 21 monitors it comes and it follows me 80 lines 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.190
 I was guarabira 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.620
 and still have the beginning to end also digital stayed six months high signal 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.860
 definition and transfer in high definition beach and yes I did see 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.690
 the wonderful image cable TV subscribers will need to exchange the 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.070
 pay-TV decoders to improve image definition 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.090
 and the cost will be the customer's 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.190
 there is still no way to interact with programming but this will be possible 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.090
 in the future 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.079
 the only interactivity currently available in digital tv 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.649
 is the programming guide when provided by the tv station 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.940

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.030

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.650
 focused on analog tv 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.460
 they exhibit digital images but in the union of definition 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.780
 some packages may exceed the amount of five thousand reais in the transept 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.140

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.090
 this is a fact of the electronics industry that has to do what it says 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.090
