00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
that means C suspended let's talk about

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.320 
that means C suspended let's talk about
what<00:00:17.800> that<00:00:17.830> means<00:00:17.980> so<00:00:18.610> first<00:00:18.850> of<00:00:19.030> all<00:00:19.120> in

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
what that means so first of all in

what that means so first of all in
review<00:00:19.690> a<00:00:19.930> C<00:00:20.800> chord<00:00:21.010> is<00:00:21.220> made<00:00:21.460> out<00:00:21.700> of

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
review a C chord is made out of

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.950 
review a C chord is made out of
for<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.510> first<00:00:23.760> five<00:00:24.760> notes<00:00:25.030> of<00:00:25.300> the<00:00:25.420> C<00:00:25.600> scale

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
for the first five notes of the C scale

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.450 
for the first five notes of the C scale
and<00:00:26.350> you<00:00:27.070> would<00:00:27.190> use<00:00:28.320> notes<00:00:29.320> one<00:00:29.650> three<00:00:30.220> and

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
and you would use notes one three and

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.400 
and you would use notes one three and
five

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
five

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.530 
five
relative<00:00:32.410> to<00:00:32.439> C<00:00:32.770> to<00:00:33.309> make<00:00:33.430> a<00:00:33.489> regular<00:00:34.000> C<00:00:34.239> chord

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
relative to C to make a regular C chord

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.270 
relative to C to make a regular C chord
so<00:00:34.780> C<00:00:35.020> chord<00:00:35.290> is<00:00:35.670> 135<00:00:36.670> built<00:00:37.089> on<00:00:37.269> the<00:00:37.420> C<00:00:37.679> so<00:00:38.679> that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
so C chord is 135 built on the C so that

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.459 
so C chord is 135 built on the C so that
happens<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:39.969> be<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.239> major<00:00:40.570> chord<00:00:40.989> because<00:00:41.350> it

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
happens to be a major chord because it

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.610 
happens to be a major chord because it
has<00:00:41.649> three<00:00:42.160> unused<00:00:42.820> notes<00:00:43.149> between<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:44.019> name

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
has three unused notes between the name

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.139 
has three unused notes between the name
of<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:44.890> chord<00:00:45.159> in<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.489> middle<00:00:45.730> of<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.909> chord

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
of the chord in the middle of the chord

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.200 
of the chord in the middle of the chord
and<00:00:46.800> two<00:00:47.800> unused<00:00:48.190> notes<00:00:48.460> between<00:00:48.699> the<00:00:48.969> middle

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
and two unused notes between the middle

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.759 
and two unused notes between the middle
of<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.390> chord<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:49.929> the<00:00:49.989> top<00:00:50.230> that's<00:00:50.559> what

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
of the chord and the top that's what

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.489 
of the chord and the top that's what
makes<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.190> major<00:00:51.399> chord<00:00:51.960> okay<00:00:52.960> now<00:00:53.260> that

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:53.499 
makes it a major chord okay now that

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.290 
makes it a major chord okay now that
we've<00:00:53.679> reviewed<00:00:53.980> that<00:00:54.280> let's<00:00:55.059> talk<00:00:55.239> about

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
we've reviewed that let's talk about

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.380 
we've reviewed that let's talk about
what<00:00:55.690> it<00:00:55.839> means<00:00:55.989> to<00:00:56.140> suspend<00:00:56.979> the<00:00:57.280> chord<00:00:57.579> so<00:00:58.269> if

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
what it means to suspend the chord so if

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.579 
what it means to suspend the chord so if
it<00:00:58.510> says<00:00:58.719> C<00:00:59.109> suspend<00:01:00.100> for<00:01:00.819> that<00:01:01.479> means<00:01:01.809> instead

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
it says C suspend for that means instead

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:05.399 
it says C suspend for that means instead
of<00:01:02.649> playing<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.309> three<00:01:03.699> which<00:01:04.269> is<00:01:04.570> what<00:01:05.229> makes

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
of playing the three which is what makes

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.090 
of playing the three which is what makes
the<00:01:05.650> chord<00:01:05.920> major<00:01:06.390> or<00:01:07.390> minor<00:01:07.870> if<00:01:08.200> it's<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.530> C

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
the chord major or minor if it's a C

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.789 
the chord major or minor if it's a C
minor<00:01:09.369> chord<00:01:09.719> you<00:01:10.719> take<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.140> three<00:01:11.530> of<00:01:11.560> the

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799 
minor chord you take the three of the

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.520 
minor chord you take the three of the
chord<00:01:12.070> and<00:01:12.250> move<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.490> up<00:01:12.610> one<00:01:13.020> two<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.140> fourth

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
chord and move it up one two the fourth

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.130 
chord and move it up one two the fourth
note<00:01:14.920> up<00:01:15.070> from<00:01:15.340> C<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:16.240> your<00:01:16.390> chord<00:01:16.659> is<00:01:16.780> made<00:01:16.810> out

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
note up from C so your chord is made out

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.310 
note up from C so your chord is made out
of<00:01:17.170> one<00:01:17.619> four<00:01:18.520> five

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
of one four five

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.620 
of one four five
four<00:01:21.220> notes<00:01:21.460> up<00:01:21.670> from<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.000> sea<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.420> five

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
four notes up from the sea and five

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.830 
four notes up from the sea and five
notes<00:01:22.900> up<00:01:23.110> up<00:01:23.740> so<00:01:24.040> that<00:01:24.220> is<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.370> sea<00:01:24.820> suspend<00:01:25.510> for

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
notes up up so that is a sea suspend for

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.220 
notes up up so that is a sea suspend for
Court<00:01:26.260> and<00:01:26.410> it<00:01:27.040> adds<00:01:27.370> suspense<00:01:28.230> therefore

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
Court and it adds suspense therefore

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.650 
Court and it adds suspense therefore
that's<00:01:29.530> why<00:01:29.770> it's<00:01:29.950> called<00:01:30.070> suspended<00:01:30.700> because

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
that's why it's called suspended because

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.420 
that's why it's called suspended because
you<00:01:31.870> can't<00:01:32.110> tell<00:01:32.380> if<00:01:32.530> it's<00:01:32.710> major<00:01:32.920> or<00:01:33.250> minor

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
you can't tell if it's major or minor

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.700 
you can't tell if it's major or minor
until<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.150> resolves<00:01:34.480> back<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.260> original

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
until it resolves back to the original

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.030 
until it resolves back to the original
chord<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:36.850> sea<00:01:37.540> suspend<00:01:38.140> for<00:01:38.380> means<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:38.860> take

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
chord so sea suspend for means you take

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.510 
chord so sea suspend for means you take
the<00:01:39.310> 135<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:41.140> C<00:01:41.350> chord<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:42.070> raise<00:01:42.250> the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
the 135 of the C chord and you raise the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.000 
the 135 of the C chord and you raise the
three<00:01:42.850> up<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.300> four<00:01:44.040> suspended<00:01:45.450> result

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
three up to four suspended result

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.010 
three up to four suspended result
suspended<00:01:48.300> resolved<00:01:49.300> so<00:01:49.690> when<00:01:49.900> you're

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
suspended resolved so when you're

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.160 
suspended resolved so when you're
playing<00:01:50.200> us<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.590> spend<00:01:50.890> four<00:01:51.130> chord<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
playing us to spend four chord it

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.230 
playing us to spend four chord it
creates<00:01:53.800> this<00:01:53.979> feeling<00:01:54.430> of<00:01:54.520> suspension

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
creates this feeling of suspension

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.999 
creates this feeling of suspension
because<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.660> don't<00:01:55.960> know<00:01:56.140> if<00:01:56.290> it's<00:01:56.440> major<00:01:56.740> or

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
because you don't know if it's major or

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.150 
because you don't know if it's major or
minor<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:57.729> it<00:01:58.630> also<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.440> tip<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.890> hat<00:01:59.950> to

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
minor and it also is a tip of the hat to

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.270 
minor and it also is a tip of the hat to
the<00:02:00.400> one<00:02:00.790> chord<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:02.080> four<00:02:02.500> chord<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.190> the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
the one chord the four chord and the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.080 
the one chord the four chord and the
five<00:02:03.550> chord<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.270> has<00:02:04.509> elements<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.440> those<00:02:06.090> kind

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
five chord it has elements of those kind

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.290 
five chord it has elements of those kind
of<00:02:07.180> all<00:02:07.330> at<00:02:07.509> once<00:02:07.720> in<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.290> suspended<00:02:08.920> chord<00:02:09.300> so

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
of all at once in the suspended chord so

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.840 
of all at once in the suspended chord so
you<00:02:10.660> could<00:02:10.810> also<00:02:10.929> have<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.260> suspend<00:02:11.890> two<00:02:12.340> chord

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
you could also have a suspend two chord

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.199 
you could also have a suspend two chord
that<00:02:13.540> means<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.170> take<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.410> three<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.910> middle

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
that means you take the three the middle

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.760 
that means you take the three the middle
note<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.570> chord<00:02:16.840> which<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.200> what<00:02:17.380> makes<00:02:17.590> it

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
note of the chord which is what makes it

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.300 
note of the chord which is what makes it
major<00:02:18.010> or<00:02:18.340> minor<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:20.010> suspend<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.160> by

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
major or minor and you suspend it by

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.970 
major or minor and you suspend it by
moving<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.730> down<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.209> two<00:02:22.420> one<00:02:22.900> two<00:02:23.440> five

minor<00:03:43.079> chord<00:03:43.549> just<00:03:44.549> like<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.970> major<00:03:45.209> chord

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
minor chord just like a major chord

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:47.599 
minor chord just like a major chord
could<00:03:45.989> be<00:03:46.139> suspended<00:03:46.709> up<00:03:46.980> to<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.220> four<00:03:47.459> as

could be suspended up to the four as

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.199 
could be suspended up to the four as
well<00:03:47.760> by<00:03:48.090> raising<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.720> three<00:03:49.109> up<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.560> four

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
well by raising the three up to the four

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.980 
well by raising the three up to the four
so<00:03:51.209> D<00:03:51.829> minor<00:03:52.829> suspend<00:03:53.819> four

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
so D minor suspend four

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.500 
so D minor suspend four
it<00:03:55.500> could<00:03:55.710> also<00:03:55.860> just<00:03:56.130> be<00:03:56.220> called<00:03:56.520> D<00:03:57.000> suspend

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
it could also just be called D suspend

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.240 
it could also just be called D suspend
for<00:03:57.840> but<00:03:58.110> once<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.470> resolve<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:59.040> you'll<00:03:59.190> want

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
for but once you resolve it you'll want

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.610 
for but once you resolve it you'll want
to<00:03:59.490> know<00:03:59.700> if<00:03:59.850> it's<00:04:00.030> resolving<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.990> the<00:04:01.110> D<00:04:01.320> minor

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
to know if it's resolving to the D minor

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.180 
to know if it's resolving to the D minor
or<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.670> D<00:04:02.820> major<00:04:03.350> so<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.500> kind<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.890> depends

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
or to the D major so it kind of depends

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.150 
or to the D major so it kind of depends
on<00:04:05.340> where<00:04:05.520> you<00:04:05.640> start<00:04:05.970> what<00:04:06.780> key<00:04:07.020> you're<00:04:07.140> in<00:04:07.200> so

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
on where you start what key you're in so

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.050 
on where you start what key you're in so
