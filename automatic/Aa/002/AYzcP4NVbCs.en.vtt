 here I bring you another video to guys and 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.690
 this time I bring you new information 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.430
 about the mashup pack of skyrim s mass 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.920
 so you know we're waiting 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.240
 so much at least yo guys I'm pretty 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.039
 excited about the pack I have 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.109
 very much desire to see it to try it 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.790
 but at the moment 4j studies has not 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.490
 confirmed nothing of date and price and 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.740
 has not given much more information what 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.420
 only guys who has done 4j studies 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 these days is changing the background of 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.860
 twitter leaving another image more of the pack 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.360
 from skyrim that I liked a lot 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.620
 because you can see some little things 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.780
 quite interesting 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.120
 I leave what is the image in the video 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.010
 and if you do not know what the content is 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.930
 that brings the pack you already know that makes 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.970
 days we already saw that content and I 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.040
 I will leave in the description just in case 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.840
 you are asking what can you see 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.370
 in this image guys do they look 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.649
 some of the skins characters that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.780
 they will be included in what would be the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.579
 prefabricated map that will come from skyrim 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.590
 that you already know that will imitate some of the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.329
 locations of that game apart in the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.530
 area where the skins are can be 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.180
 appreciate some things that have 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.590
 liked especially the skins that I 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.320
 I would say that the one I liked the most is the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.789
 of the protagonist of skyrim I do not know with that 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.290
 cap of horns, I liked it 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.940
 quite 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.890
 the rest of skins are pretty good already 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.750
 you know that in skyrim in that game there are 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.910
 multitude of races good what is the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.530
 saga and many of the skins because they are from 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.010
 different races that are pretty 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.320
 cool, yes, I liked it a lot 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.300
 that you can see the skin of 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.280
 protagonist carries an ax in his hand 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.440
 of diamond and the design I liked a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.720
 heap is a double-edged ax of 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.420
 diamond or be amazing is that the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.190
 design has caught my attention and 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.750
 I'm looking forward to see what that would look like in 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.550
 first person 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.350
 I think it's crazy and I think I know 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.580
 They have worked hard enough, it is true 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.440
 that some of the skins that can be 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.240
 see out there take for example a bow and 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.100
 a sword but in previous images 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.259
 that we already saw in the video that I have 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.119
 left in the description could be 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.530
 appreciate the bow the design is also 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.380
 pretty good and what are the swords 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.850
 yes they will look pretty good but yes 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.800
 it 's true that the design is a bit 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.210
 thinner than the original but I think 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.420
 that are going to look great and they are 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.950
 working very much this image that 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.050
 we are seeing the images that we saw 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.610
 previously and the content do that 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.320
 every day I have more desire to leave the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.970

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.860

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.720

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.700

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.310

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.230
