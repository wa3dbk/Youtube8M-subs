00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
blackest black because I think the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.370

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
eyes and I do about 67 coats I didn't do

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.980 
eyes and I do about 67 coats I didn't do
this<00:01:58.619> much<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.250> time<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.540> doesn't<00:02:00.840> really

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
this much this time so it doesn't really

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.880 
this much this time so it doesn't really
look<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.229> long<00:02:02.000> but

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
look that long but

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.490 
look that long but
I<00:02:04.920> love<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.150> just<00:02:06.360> could<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> lot<00:02:07.020> because<00:02:07.380> it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
I love I just could a lot because it

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.560 
I love I just could a lot because it
looks<00:02:07.650> thicker<00:02:07.980> and<00:02:08.250> fuller<00:02:08.490> and<00:02:08.850> longer<00:02:08.940> so

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
looks thicker and fuller and longer so

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.020 
looks thicker and fuller and longer so
this<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.020> result<00:02:10.410> it's<00:02:10.649> not<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.250> big<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
this is a result it's not that big and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.270 
this is a result it's not that big and
long<00:02:12.180> because<00:02:12.990> I<00:02:13.110> did<00:02:13.290> shorten<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.130> you

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
long because I did shorten it for you
