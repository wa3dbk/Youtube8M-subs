00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:01.689
 to date at least two antonio 

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.689
 this is about inflation 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.460
 the purpose of printing through the use of graphic arts 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:22.960
 it helps us not only to be able to capture an image 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.899
 but a series of reproductions of the same design or art 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.079
 trying to have control of the fifth flow and keeping uniformity in the 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.079
 intensity of colors and shapes 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.930
 print photo consists of a design 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.060
 and the material to be printed depending on the number of colors according to our 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.060
 design if it continues fashion technique to use 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.260
 seeing the impression from an extremely basic point we can see that 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.250
 is based on the simple decision to determine which area of ​​the material will be 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.539
 covered with ink 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:56.679
 and what arellano 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.490
 optimizing the fifth basic 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.490
 black part of that money and what part is not 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.320
 perhaps for those who are not related to the world of the arts 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.290
 graphs 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.640
 this concept is not too clear 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.600
 but it really is like the long-married impression 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.660
 let's start with basic printing 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.740
 the printing of a color or ink 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.740
 in this case black only in white material 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.400
 counting on a template that allows us the controlled step of color 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.620
 well the determined material 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.920
 we have achieved in our first impression which we can follow 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.290
 reproducing in all the material that we have we could even change 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.740
 the color of the material 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.010
 while the technique allows us to print 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.880
 we could stop using the color black and stylize another color that stands out 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.010
 the contrast our material 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.620
 this is how we have managed to develop our first work to a fifth or 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
 also known as still color 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.319
 economically 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:00.300
 this technique is not cheap 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.970
 since we only spend in a single template 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 and in a single color coty inc 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.679
 for our cinemas this print fulfill the first function that 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.759
 we need 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:14.889
 report or share a message 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.699
 now we not only want to capture what is shared 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.699
 but we also want you to draw attention in some way 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.079
 based on the design that you have 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.899
 the option in printing 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:28.859
 is to include more colors in certain areas 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.859
 to give greater visibility to our messages 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.239
 We can include a 2 comas inks or additional colors in areas 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.139
 determined design 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.739
 we are also call plastas of color without one interferes with the other 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.579
 based on the decision in this area of ​​colloquium in this area of 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.559
 color no 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:50.090
 so we manage to have a job appear tapes 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.469
 or solid colors 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:53.669
 separated into specific areas 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.289
 and that do not interact with each other 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:58.829
 this time we want the impression we have 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.639
 It is by color separation 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.969
 We noticed that when using this technique we are interested in working with few colors 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.569
 yes, we are interested in keeping them 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.149
 solids throughout the process and what not to lose this solidity not 

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.279
 interact with each other 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:18.579
 using this same technique we can print in an orderly way starting 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.889
 by the lighter colors following by the means and in the end you end up with 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.329
 the darkest color or in black in this case 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.959
 so that in a certain case I discovered it in one of the colors 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.919
 previously printed 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.709
 the technique of separation printing pop cans of color this 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.419
 stylist two for the majority and the graphic arts 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.419
 was very linked to the use of colors by direct fifths 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.979
 The cost of this technique depends directly on the number of templates and 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.439
 the number of farms or colors to use in it 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.879
 with these examples 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.709
 we have been able to define what printing to a fifth 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.139
 and what is the impression 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.869
 by different color separation oba 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:03.039
 see you in the next topic about impressions
