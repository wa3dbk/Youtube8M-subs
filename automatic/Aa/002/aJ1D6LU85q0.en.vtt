00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.020 
elevated to face miss for the title and
which<00:00:59.660> is<00:00:59.780> what<00:00:59.870> I<00:00:59.960> predicted<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:00.469> happen<00:01:00.829> um<00:01:01.030> I

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
which is what I predicted to happen um I

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.499 
which is what I predicted to happen um I
think<00:01:02.809> Sheamus<00:01:03.379> winning<00:01:04.339> overall<00:01:04.879> was<00:01:05.360> the

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
think Sheamus winning overall was the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.090 
think Sheamus winning overall was the
best<00:01:05.720> thing<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:05.990> do<00:01:06.200> and<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.590> reason<00:01:06.890> for<00:01:06.920> that

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
best thing to do and the reason for that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.690 
best thing to do and the reason for that
is<00:01:07.580> they<00:01:08.420> can<00:01:08.660> now<00:01:08.840> build<00:01:09.200> toward<00:01:09.649> a<00:01:09.860> king<00:01:10.550> of

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
is they can now build toward a king of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.620 
is they can now build toward a king of
the<00:01:10.820> ring<00:01:11.259> versus<00:01:12.259> king<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:13.009> kings<00:01:13.340> food<00:01:13.729> with

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
the ring versus king of kings food with

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.570 
the ring versus king of kings food with
Triple<00:01:15.020> H's<00:01:15.140> inevitable<00:01:15.649> return<00:01:16.009> which<00:01:16.430> will

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
Triple H's inevitable return which will

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.010 
Triple H's inevitable return which will
probably<00:01:16.759> have<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:16.970> Wrestlemania<00:01:17.630> because

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
probably have a Wrestlemania because

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.430 
probably have a Wrestlemania because
that's<00:01:18.200> when<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.470> big<00:01:18.619> payday<00:01:18.950> is<00:01:19.160> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.510 
ring and I think a few a triple h 1 into
WrestleMania<00:02:06.200> will<00:02:06.590> only<00:02:06.799> build<00:02:07.100> him<00:02:07.369> with

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
WrestleMania will only build him with

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.990 
WrestleMania will only build him with
that<00:02:07.700> much<00:02:07.909> more<00:02:08.299> um<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:10.429> tournament<00:02:10.940> was

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
that much more um I the tournament was

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.729 
that much more um I the tournament was
presented<00:02:11.480> pretty<00:02:11.959> well<00:02:12.140> overall<00:02:12.530> um<00:02:14.739> there

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
presented pretty well overall um there

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.229 
presented pretty well overall um there
were<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> couple<00:02:15.920> things<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.940> kind<00:02:17.150> of

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
were a couple things that I kind of

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.880 
were a couple things that I kind of
disagree<00:02:17.360> with<00:02:17.780> III<00:02:18.110> didn't<00:02:18.440> like<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.769> fact

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
disagree with III didn't like the fact

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.380 
disagree with III didn't like the fact
that<00:02:19.010> there<00:02:19.190> was<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.340> double<00:02:19.880> count-out<00:02:20.329> and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
that there was a double count-out and

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.600 
that there was a double count-out and
Sheamus<00:02:20.810> got<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.769> x<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.160> finals<00:02:22.549> I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
Sheamus got the the x to the finals I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.650 
Sheamus got the the x to the finals I
thought<00:02:22.820> that<00:02:23.000> everybody<00:02:23.329> should<00:02:23.510> have

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
thought that everybody should have

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.150 
thought that everybody should have
earned<00:02:23.989> their<00:02:24.200> way<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.410> know<00:02:24.650> it's<00:02:24.799> all<00:02:24.890> pretty

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
earned their way I know it's all pretty

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.440 
earned their way I know it's all pretty
good<00:02:25.250> storyline<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:25.730> in<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.120> grand<00:02:26.299> scheme

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
good storyline but in the grand scheme

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.330 
good storyline but in the grand scheme
of<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.780> storyline<00:02:27.079> it<00:02:27.530> would<00:02:27.980> have<00:02:28.070> made<00:02:28.100> it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
of the storyline it would have made it

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.129 
of the storyline it would have made it
look<00:02:28.489> better<00:02:28.640> if<00:02:29.000> both<00:02:29.389> guys<00:02:29.480> had<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.900> wrestle

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:30.139 
look better if both guys had to wrestle

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.440 
look better if both guys had to wrestle
three<00:02:30.739> times

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
three times

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.630 
three times
just<00:02:31.569> my<00:02:31.690> personal<00:02:32.050> opinion<00:02:32.220> yeah<00:02:33.220> made<00:02:33.459> more

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
just my personal opinion yeah made more

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.770 
just my personal opinion yeah made more
some<00:02:33.760> look<00:02:33.879> like<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.060> underdog<00:02:34.239> going<00:02:34.660> in

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
some look like the underdog going in

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.660 
some look like the underdog going in
because<00:02:34.989> he<00:02:35.140> had<00:02:35.349> less<00:02:35.860> rest<00:02:36.220> than<00:02:36.459> Sheamus

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
because he had less rest than Sheamus

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.330 
because he had less rest than Sheamus
did<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:38.230> know<00:02:38.260> Sheamus<00:02:38.980> would<00:02:39.099> have<00:02:39.220> been

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
did but you know Sheamus would have been

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.920 
did but you know Sheamus would have been
just<00:02:39.370> as<00:02:39.610> much<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.940> badass<00:02:40.150> with<00:02:40.510> two<00:02:40.720> wins

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
just as much of a badass with two wins

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.479 
just as much of a badass with two wins
as<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.230> would<00:02:41.349> have<00:02:41.440> been<00:02:41.500> before<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.069> it

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
as it would have been before so it

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.400 
as it would have been before so it
really<00:02:42.700> wouldn't<00:02:42.879> have<00:02:43.120> affected<00:02:43.599> him<00:02:44.260> I

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
really wouldn't have affected him I

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.199 
really wouldn't have affected him I
don't<00:02:44.470> think<00:02:44.800> any<00:02:44.950> way<00:02:45.129> to<00:02:45.190> have<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:45.670> x<00:02:45.849> and

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
don't think any way to have that x and

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.180 
don't think any way to have that x and
plus<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.870> think<00:02:46.900> Zeke<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.470> drew<00:02:47.680> wrestling<00:02:48.040> to

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
plus I think Zeke and drew wrestling to

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.040 
plus I think Zeke and drew wrestling to
a<00:02:48.220> double<00:02:49.000> count-out<00:02:49.300> is<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:49.660> disservice<00:02:49.900> to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
a double count-out is it disservice to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.030 
a double count-out is it disservice to
both<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.440> them<00:02:50.590> because<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.849> think<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:53.040> both

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
both of them because I think that both

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.080 
both of them because I think that both
those<00:02:54.190> guys<00:02:54.370> are<00:02:54.550> good<00:02:54.670> enough<00:02:54.790> where<00:02:54.970> they

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
those guys are good enough where they

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.070 
those guys are good enough where they
could<00:02:55.209> have<00:02:55.300> had<00:02:55.420> another<00:02:55.450> match<00:02:55.810> especially

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
could have had another match especially

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.660 
could have had another match especially
drew<00:02:56.530> McIntyre<00:02:56.950> can<00:02:57.130> you<00:02:57.220> imagine<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.519> drew

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
drew McIntyre can you imagine a drew

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.660 
drew McIntyre can you imagine a drew
McIntyre<00:02:58.150> Sheamus<00:02:59.049> match<00:02:59.230> or<00:02:59.670> Ezekiel

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
McIntyre Sheamus match or Ezekiel

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.460 
McIntyre Sheamus match or Ezekiel
Jackson<00:03:00.940> Sheamus<00:03:01.690> match<00:03:01.840> both<00:03:02.170> those<00:03:02.319> guys

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
Jackson Sheamus match both those guys

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.990 
Jackson Sheamus match both those guys
would<00:03:02.680> have<00:03:02.799> been<00:03:02.920> I<00:03:03.099> think<00:03:03.220> good<00:03:03.519> for<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> match

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
would have been I think good for a match

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.920 
would have been I think good for a match
with<00:03:04.920> with<00:03:05.920> Sheamus<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:07.660> know<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:10.810> know
