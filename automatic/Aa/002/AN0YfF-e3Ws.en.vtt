I believe that the surge of the UCLA
dynasty<00:05:54.629> put<00:05:55.259> college<00:05:55.680> basketball<00:05:56.310> in<00:05:56.430> a

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
dynasty put college basketball in a

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.670 
dynasty put college basketball in a
higher<00:05:56.699> plane<00:05:57.120> in<00:05:57.539> those<00:05:57.689> days<00:05:57.930> football<00:05:58.409> and

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
higher plane in those days football and

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.830 
higher plane in those days football and
baseball<00:05:59.189> but<00:05:59.729> really<00:06:00.000> a<00:06:00.030> lot<00:06:00.090> bigger<00:06:00.509> as<00:06:00.659> far

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
baseball but really a lot bigger as far

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.659 
baseball but really a lot bigger as far
as<00:06:00.930> spectator<00:06:01.379> sports<00:06:01.710> and<00:06:01.979> basketball<00:06:02.460> was

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
as spectator sports and basketball was

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:05.390 
as spectator sports and basketball was
but<00:06:03.180> that<00:06:03.360> changed<00:06:03.870> when<00:06:04.110> UCLA<00:06:04.889> started

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
but that changed when UCLA started

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.809 
but that changed when UCLA started
running<00:06:05.669> on<00:06:05.759> a<00:06:05.789> national<00:06:06.300> level<00:06:07.250> for<00:06:08.250> him<00:06:08.400> it

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
running on a national level for him it

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.119 
running on a national level for him it
was<00:06:09.000> not<00:06:09.180> necessarily<00:06:09.750> wins<00:06:10.379> and<00:06:10.560> losses<00:06:10.650> but

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129 
was not necessarily wins and losses but

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.399 
was not necessarily wins and losses but
how<00:06:11.370> he<00:06:11.430> affected<00:06:11.909> young<00:06:12.120> men's<00:06:12.330> lives<00:06:12.629> what

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
how he affected young men's lives what

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:15.499 
how he affected young men's lives what
he<00:06:13.560> taught<00:06:13.830> was<00:06:14.039> much<00:06:14.389> realizing<00:06:15.389> that

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
he taught was much realizing that

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:18.020 
he taught was much realizing that
basketball<00:06:16.139> just<00:06:16.740> being<00:06:17.039> a<00:06:17.159> small<00:06:17.550> part<00:06:17.909> of

basketball just being a small part of
your<00:06:18.180> life<00:06:18.360> was<00:06:18.930> a<00:06:18.990> place<00:06:19.349> where<00:06:19.650> you<00:06:19.740> can
