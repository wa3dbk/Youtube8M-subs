these<00:05:42.840> amazing<00:05:43.260> spider-man<00:05:43.530> movies<00:05:43.830> way<00:05:44.220> over

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
these amazing spider-man movies way over

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.370 
these amazing spider-man movies way over
the<00:05:44.909> Sam<00:05:45.479> Raimi<00:05:45.630> spider-man<00:05:45.780> movies<00:05:46.320> I

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
the Sam Raimi spider-man movies I

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.899 
the Sam Raimi spider-man movies I
thought<00:05:46.500> those<00:05:46.650> moves<00:05:46.979> were<00:05:47.070> just<00:05:47.280> incredibly

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
thought those moves were just incredibly

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:48.830 
thought those moves were just incredibly
miscast

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
miscast

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.779 
miscast
except<00:05:49.289> for<00:05:49.380> spider-man<00:05:49.680> 2<00:05:49.919> with<00:05:50.099> guy<00:05:50.550> I

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:50.789 
except for spider-man 2 with guy I

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.460 
except for spider-man 2 with guy I
thought<00:05:51.180> Alfred<00:05:51.449> Molina<00:05:51.630> was<00:05:51.990> great<00:05:52.320> in<00:05:52.409> that

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
thought Alfred Molina was great in that

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.170 
thought Alfred Molina was great in that
role<00:05:52.710> besides<00:05:53.159> that<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.400> thought<00:05:53.729> every<00:05:54.030> one<00:05:54.150> of

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
role besides that I thought every one of

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.270 
role besides that I thought every one of
those<00:05:54.300> movies<00:05:54.570> were<00:05:54.690> miscast<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.919> amazing

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
those movies were miscast the amazing

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.649 
those movies were miscast the amazing
spider-man<00:05:56.520> movies<00:05:56.849> I<00:05:57.030> think<00:05:57.060> the<00:05:57.300> cast<00:05:57.510> is

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
spider-man movies I think the cast is

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:59.390 
spider-man movies I think the cast is
much<00:05:57.960> better<00:05:58.169> I'm<00:05:58.590> looking<00:05:59.070> forward<00:05:59.340> to

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
much better I'm looking forward to

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.219 
much better I'm looking forward to
seeing<00:05:59.580> what<00:05:59.699> they<00:05:59.820> do<00:05:59.880> with<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.659> Rhino<00:06:01.050> as

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
seeing what they do with the Rhino as

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:02.750 
seeing what they do with the Rhino as
