00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.480
 good after this first complete phase 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.790
 and the next step is 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.610
 cuca 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.339
 the middle 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:12.339
 corresponding 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.429
 is card in this classic 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.249
 the lecce says 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:18.789
 first of all 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.619
 Let's face it up, let's do a full tactical part. 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.699
 in this harvest 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.050
 and the cross 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.050
 Let's look for people who do not have a white color. 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.190
 in cases where there is no 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.020
 The credit does not count with Ana 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.020
 it is one of four spaces in the marking 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.420
 we can use the plans 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.480
 by iain 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.010
 we have to be a part of 137 classics of each one of them 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.100
 it's not white 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 I'm passing personally I do not have white 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.790
 but white can not be used 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.390
 first month 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.100
 can be used 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.900
 by means of the bank can not be harvested 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.630
 if we already have more importance with a few years if there is what I like 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.260
 fix or dirty this 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 I will not start with the government providing 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.840
 first of all 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.630
 look to realize this cent to spend obligada the cross 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.640
 the rates is a wonder 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.640
 and will force it to the center of its color 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.680
 I committed 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.030
 that's where the heavy stuff comes in 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.610
 and go look for the wake center 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.450
 sometimes winter 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.070
 sandro becker 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.730
 and it will fill 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.730
 one thing is the near movement I opted for the wind 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.860
 almost a year to come 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.760
 a train 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.130
 everyone knows that cases 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.440
 What do you want, frustrated attack? 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.530
 this thing 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.710
 of the center of the corporations of aveiro 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.510
 let's make a move is to convert 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.320
 this because 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.380
 because despite the cold we think you're thinking of me 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.220
 three passes 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.730
 I have to make value 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.049
 Let's get rid of it. What we do is simple. 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.329
 algorithm 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.129

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:28.819
 again 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.859
 let's alert cross 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.969

 I'm sure 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:06.819
 What did we do? 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.239
 touch and weigh in the index 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.849
 Good, let's leverage futures.

 that hope is 1 and that 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.649
 for the year 

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:31.449
 by this level 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:33.359
 How were we here? 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.699
 the same algorithm crossover 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.269
 kiko the same arguments we previously customized now 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.299

 we are attentive 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.039
 it was very important 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.039
 I'm sure 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.819
 Let's find the other one.
