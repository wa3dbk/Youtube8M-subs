00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
a pencil let low to make this amazing

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.900 
a pencil let low to make this amazing
project<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.500> work<00:00:22.710> you're<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> need<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
project to work you're going to need a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.630 
project to work you're going to need a
tube<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.630> mechanical<00:00:25.230> pencil<00:00:25.619> lead<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.099> copper

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
tube of mechanical pencil lead a copper

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.900 
tube of mechanical pencil lead a copper
wire<00:00:27.000> an<00:00:27.390> AC<00:00:27.930> adapter<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.919> two<00:00:29.399> alligator

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
wire an AC adapter and two alligator

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.990 
wire an AC adapter and two alligator
clips<00:00:30.270> step<00:00:31.109> 1<00:00:31.439> preparing<00:00:32.220> the<00:00:32.460> AC<00:00:32.640> adapter

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
clips step 1 preparing the AC adapter

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.689 
clips step 1 preparing the AC adapter
most<00:00:33.930> adapters<00:00:34.559> have<00:00:34.769> this<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> end<00:00:35.519> of

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
most adapters have this on the end of

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:37.670 
most adapters have this on the end of
them<00:00:35.850> now<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.839> cut<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.350> use

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
them now you can just cut it out and use

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.290 
them now you can just cut it out and use
the<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:38.040> wires<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.610> if<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.879> don't<00:00:39.059> feel<00:00:39.269> like

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the two wires but if you don't feel like

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.810 
the two wires but if you don't feel like
cutting<00:00:39.659> it<00:00:39.930> out<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.409> take<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.250> wire<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
cutting it out you can take the wire and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.299 
cutting it out you can take the wire and
stick<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.659> in<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> center<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:43.680> connector

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
stick it in the center of your connector

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.579 
stick it in the center of your connector
like<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:44.730> take<00:00:45.329> your<00:00:45.480> one<00:00:45.690> alligator<00:00:46.170> clip

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and connect it to the outside metal part

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.599 
and connect it to the outside metal part
of<00:00:48.930> your<00:00:49.050> connector<00:00:49.469> then<00:00:49.920> take<00:00:50.250> your<00:00:50.430> other

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:50.609 
of your connector then take your other

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.549 
of your connector then take your other
alligator<00:00:51.210> clip<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.809> connect<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.410> the
