00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
is very cool and then next of all was

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.959 
is very cool and then next of all was
the<00:03:39.620> plane<00:03:39.949> that<00:03:39.980> the<00:03:40.280> characters<00:03:40.639> got<00:03:40.760> onto

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:40.969 
the plane that the characters got onto

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.209 
the plane that the characters got onto
at<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.329> end<00:03:41.540> I<00:03:41.870> talked<00:03:42.349> about<00:03:42.409> this<00:03:42.620> again<00:03:42.769> in

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:43.219 
at the end I talked about this again in

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:44.890 
at the end I talked about this again in
my<00:03:43.280> previous<00:03:43.609> video<00:03:43.939> for<00:03:44.389> mobile<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.689> dead

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
my previous video for mobile the dead

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.780 
my previous video for mobile the dead
and<00:03:45.079> I<00:03:45.500> believe<00:03:45.799> this<00:03:45.949> is<00:03:46.010> what<00:03:46.219> the<00:03:46.310> Easter

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
and I believe this is what the Easter

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.970 
and I believe this is what the Easter
Egg<00:03:46.909> builds<00:03:47.299> up<00:03:47.449> to<00:03:47.719> is<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.379> building<00:03:48.889> the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
Egg builds up to is you building the

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.860 
Egg builds up to is you building the
plane<00:03:49.219> and<00:03:49.430> then<00:03:49.519> escaping<00:03:49.939> the<00:03:50.209> island<00:03:50.689> and

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
plane and then escaping the island and

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.689 
plane and then escaping the island and
so<00:03:51.500> just<00:03:51.799> those<00:03:52.040> were<00:03:52.189> the<00:03:52.310> two<00:03:52.489> most

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
so just those were the two most

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.009 
so just those were the two most
important<00:03:53.209> things<00:03:53.389> from<00:03:53.599> the<00:03:53.810> video

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
important things from the video

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.959 
important things from the video
nonetheless<00:03:54.560> it's<00:03:54.949> really<00:03:55.310> exciting<00:03:55.790> stuff

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:55.969 
nonetheless it's really exciting stuff

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.909 
nonetheless it's really exciting stuff
and<00:03:56.359> I<00:03:56.569> can't<00:03:56.870> wait<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.019> play<00:03:57.290> this<00:03:57.439> map<00:03:57.709> in
