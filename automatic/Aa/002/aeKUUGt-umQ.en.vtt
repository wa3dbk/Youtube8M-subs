00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
technique that I'm going to show you I

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.900 
technique that I'm going to show you I
was<00:01:00.690> trying<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:02.070> some<00:01:02.250> airbrushing<00:01:02.579> with

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
was trying to do some airbrushing with

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.090 
was trying to do some airbrushing with
this<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> did<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> airbrushing<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this and when I did the airbrushing it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.840 
this and when I did the airbrushing it
blew<00:01:05.430> underneath<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.540> edge<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
blew underneath of the edge of this and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.700 
blew underneath of the edge of this and
made<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.360> giant<00:01:09.689> mess<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:10.049> was<00:01:10.170> all<00:01:10.290> spooky

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
made just a giant mess it was all spooky

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.190 
made just a giant mess it was all spooky
I<00:01:11.090> couldn't<00:01:12.090> figure<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.330> how<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.540> adhere<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I couldn't figure out how to adhere this

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.320 
I couldn't figure out how to adhere this
down<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.549> would<00:01:14.670> stay<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.299> just

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
down so that all of it would stay I just

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.940 
down so that all of it would stay I just
kept<00:01:15.630> having<00:01:15.780> all<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> kinds<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.380> issues<00:01:16.500> so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
using some since I was using Copic I was

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.609 
using some since I was using Copic I was
using<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.820> various<00:01:27.659> ink<00:01:27.960> colorless<00:01:28.470> blender

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
using the various ink colorless blender

using the various ink colorless blender
bottle<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.869> this<00:01:30.869> wonderful<00:01:31.140> thing

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
bottle to do it and this wonderful thing

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.200 
bottle to do it and this wonderful thing
appeared<00:01:31.920> which<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:32.610> turned<00:01:32.670> into<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
appeared which I have now turned into a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.020 
appeared which I have now turned into a
technique<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.470> let's<00:01:34.890> show<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:35.909> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
technique so let's show you how to do it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.219 
technique so let's show you how to do it
you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.630> airbrushing<00:01:37.140> this

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you can do it with airbrushing this

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.450 
you can do it with airbrushing this
stuff<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:37.799> I'm<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.009> gonna<00:01:38.189> color

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
stuff on there but I'm just gonna color

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.010 
stuff on there but I'm just gonna color
on<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:38.909> simply<00:01:39.180> because<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:42.020> it'll

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
on there simply because I can and it'll

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.420 
on there simply because I can and it'll
show<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> don't<00:01:43.770> have<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.159> have<00:01:44.310> an
