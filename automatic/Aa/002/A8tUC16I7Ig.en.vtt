Michael Raines on expert village now as
you<00:00:03.929> might<00:00:04.080> have<00:00:04.170> noticed<00:00:04.560> our<00:00:04.980> containers

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
you might have noticed our containers

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.519 
you might have noticed our containers
are<00:00:05.700> almost<00:00:06.089> together<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.870> fact<00:00:07.350> they're

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
are almost together in fact they're

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:08.780 
are almost together in fact they're
going<00:00:07.740> together<00:00:07.890> right<00:00:08.309> now<00:00:08.340> because<00:00:08.610> I'm

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
going together right now because I'm

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.970 
going together right now because I'm
gonna<00:00:08.910> screw<00:00:09.330> them<00:00:09.420> together<00:00:09.769> yep

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
gonna screw them together yep

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.770 
gonna screw them together yep
they<00:00:11.190> just<00:00:11.429> screw<00:00:11.790> together<00:00:12.179> like<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> water

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
they just screw together like a water

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.640 
they just screw together like a water
filter<00:00:13.259> because<00:00:13.410> they<00:00:14.190> are<00:00:14.370> water<00:00:14.820> filters

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
filter because they are water filters

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.120 
filter because they are water filters
and<00:00:16.650> they<00:00:16.740> seal<00:00:17.039> up<00:00:17.190> nice<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.460> tight<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:19.130> then

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
and they seal up nice and tight and then

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.000 
and they seal up nice and tight and then
I'm<00:00:20.250> gonna<00:00:20.369> explain<00:00:20.939> all<00:00:21.380> our<00:00:22.380> electrical

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
I'm gonna explain all our electrical

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250 
I'm gonna explain all our electrical
hookups<00:00:23.460> because<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.180> know<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.480> runs<00:00:24.660> off<00:00:24.930> 12

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
hookups because you know it runs off 12

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.400 
hookups because you know it runs off 12
volts<00:00:25.849> yeah<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.060> same<00:00:27.330> 12<00:00:27.570> volts<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.199> car

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
volts yeah the same 12 volts is in a car

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.910 
volts yeah the same 12 volts is in a car
battery

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
battery

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.810 
battery
thus<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.060> car<00:00:30.269> battery<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.700> we're<00:00:32.700> all

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
thus the car battery so we're all

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.740 
thus the car battery so we're all
screwed<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.329> together

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
screwed in together

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.220 
screwed in together
oops<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.770> what<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.219> almost<00:00:35.700> forgot<00:00:36.230> we

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
oops you know what I almost forgot we

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.889 
oops you know what I almost forgot we
got<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.469> fill<00:00:37.590> up<00:00:37.710> our<00:00:37.860> bubbler<00:00:38.239> our<00:00:39.239> secondary

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
got to fill up our bubbler our secondary

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.170 
got to fill up our bubbler our secondary
safety<00:00:40.260> device<00:00:40.739> remember<00:00:41.550> our<00:00:41.730> first<00:00:41.910> safety

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
safety device remember our first safety

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.510 
safety device remember our first safety
device<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.840> one-way<00:00:43.020> valve<00:00:43.520> our

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
device is the one-way valve our

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.420 
device is the one-way valve our
secondary<00:00:45.120> safety<00:00:45.570> device<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:47.039> bubbler

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
secondary safety device is the bubbler

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.290 
secondary safety device is the bubbler
what's<00:00:48.329> neat<00:00:48.539> about<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.870> bubbler<00:00:50.120> you<00:00:51.120> can

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
what's neat about the bubbler you can

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.760 
what's neat about the bubbler you can
see<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.690> hydrogen<00:00:51.989> bubbling<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.739> through

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
see the hydrogen bubbling up through

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.439 
see the hydrogen bubbling up through
there<00:00:53.390> that's<00:00:54.390> really<00:00:55.289> cool<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.910> put<00:00:57.149> our<00:00:57.239> cap

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
there that's really cool so put our cap

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.189 
there that's really cool so put our cap
back<00:00:57.719> on

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
back on

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.279 
back on
remember<00:00:58.829> our<00:00:58.980> cap<00:00:59.280> doesn't<00:00:59.699> stay<00:00:59.910> tight<00:01:00.289> it's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
remember our cap doesn't stay tight it's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.280 
remember our cap doesn't stay tight it's
a<00:01:01.440> safety<00:01:01.710> device<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.520> there's<00:01:03.000> an<00:01:03.290> accidental

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
a safety device if there's an accidental

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.890 
a safety device if there's an accidental
backfire<00:01:04.830> through<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.180> cap<00:01:06.450> will<00:01:06.659> pop

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
backfire through here the cap will pop

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.660 
backfire through here the cap will pop
off<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.439> won't<00:01:07.560> backfire<00:01:07.890> through<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> water

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
off it won't backfire through the water

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.920 
off it won't backfire through the water
and<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.939> won't<00:01:09.119> come<00:01:09.330> back<00:01:09.510> into<00:01:09.810> our

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
and it won't come back into our

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.550 
and it won't come back into our
container<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.270> with<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.390> said<00:01:12.750> put<00:01:13.229> away<00:01:13.409> our

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
container so with that said put away our

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.100 
container so with that said put away our
water<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.390> when<00:01:15.540> we're<00:01:15.659> getting<00:01:15.869> ready<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
water and I when we're getting ready to

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.980 
water and I when we're getting ready to
get<00:01:16.350> into<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.650> electrical<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.540> remember

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
get into the electrical as you remember

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.910 
get into the electrical as you remember
it's<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.830> 12-volt<00:01:20.310> system<00:01:21.439> direct<00:01:22.439> current

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it's a 12-volt system direct current

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.730 
it's a 12-volt system direct current
alternating<00:01:23.159> current<00:01:23.909> will<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.330> work<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.590> now

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
alternating current will not work so now

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.440 
alternating current will not work so now
as<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.369> we're<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> parallel<00:01:27.210> system

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
as you know we're a parallel system

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.630 
as you know we're a parallel system
would<00:01:28.380> go<00:01:28.530> down<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.920> our<00:01:28.950> gauges<00:01:29.310> our

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
would go down to our gauges our

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.210 
would go down to our gauges our
voltmeter<00:01:29.970> our<00:01:30.390> amp<00:01:30.659> meter<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.979> from

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
voltmeter our amp meter and then from

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.120 
voltmeter our amp meter and then from
there<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.670> go<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.909> our<00:01:33.090> battery<00:01:33.680> which<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.860> here

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
there we go to our battery which is here

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.390 
there we go to our battery which is here
but<00:01:35.970> our<00:01:36.180> battery<00:01:36.650> needs<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.770> charging<00:01:38.220> system

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
but our battery needs a charging system

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.060 
but our battery needs a charging system
it's<00:01:38.909> gonna<00:01:39.180> die<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.380> hook<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.920> up

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
it's gonna die if we just hook it up

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
it's gonna die if we just hook it up
it's<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:41.460> gonna<00:01:41.549> drain<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.909> battery<00:01:42.420> 30

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it's just gonna drain the battery 30

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.870 
it's just gonna drain the battery 30
amps<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> lot<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.100> current<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.549> pulling

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
amps is a lot of current to be pulling

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.510 
amps is a lot of current to be pulling
on<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> battery<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:46.170> 10<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.530> 15<00:01:46.649> or<00:01:47.009> 20<00:01:47.340> minutes

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
on a battery for 10 to 15 or 20 minutes

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.760 
on a battery for 10 to 15 or 20 minutes
it's<00:01:47.939> more<00:01:48.210> than<00:01:48.450> what<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.290> would<00:01:49.500> use<00:01:49.740> to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it's more than what you would use to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.910 
it's more than what you would use to
start<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> car<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:51.750> we're<00:01:52.320> gonna<00:01:52.470> hook<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.829> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
start the car so we're gonna hook up a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.399 
start the car so we're gonna hook up a
charger<00:01:53.369> no<00:01:53.970> ordinary<00:01:54.420> charger<00:01:54.960> mind<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
charger no ordinary charger mind you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.310 
charger no ordinary charger mind you
it's<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.520> these<00:01:56.640> bad<00:01:56.939> boys

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
it's one of these bad boys

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.609 
it's one of these bad boys
now<00:01:58.320> I've<00:01:58.619> already<00:01:59.009> had<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> hookups<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.939> them

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
now I've already had the hookups on them

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.069 
now I've already had the hookups on them
and<00:02:01.619> we're<00:02:01.829> just<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.250> put<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:03.079> parallel

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
and we're just going to put it parallel

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.679 
and we're just going to put it parallel
to<00:02:04.110> our<00:02:04.469> hookups<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.640> for<00:02:05.909> our

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
to our hookups that we have for our

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809 
to our hookups that we have for our
cylinders<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.129> get<00:02:08.280> its<00:02:08.399> negative

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
cylinders and I get its negative

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.990 
cylinders and I get its negative
positive<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.390> positive

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.870 

listen<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.209> puppy<00:02:13.720> hum<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:15.040> puts<00:02:15.400> out<00:02:15.580> 10

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
listen to that puppy hum it puts out 10

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.390 
listen to that puppy hum it puts out 10
to<00:02:16.030> 20<00:02:16.390> amps<00:02:16.750> it'll<00:02:17.110> keep<00:02:17.230> my<00:02:17.440> battery<00:02:17.920> charged

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
to 20 amps it'll keep my battery charged

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.360 
to 20 amps it'll keep my battery charged
and<00:02:18.670> keep<00:02:19.510> our<00:02:19.690> system<00:02:20.080> going<00:02:20.500> for<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.069> nice

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and keep our system going for a nice

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.059 
and keep our system going for a nice
smooth<00:02:22.030> experiment<00:02:22.870> all<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.050> way<00:02:23.260> through<00:02:23.620> we

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
smooth experiment all the way through we

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.800 
smooth experiment all the way through we
won't<00:02:24.280> kill<00:02:24.459> our<00:02:24.640> battery<00:02:24.970> our<00:02:25.180> battery<00:02:25.569> gives

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
won't kill our battery our battery gives

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.030 
won't kill our battery our battery gives
us<00:02:25.989> our<00:02:26.170> steady<00:02:26.440> current

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
us our steady current

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.250 
us our steady current
but<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.760> charger<00:02:28.269> keeps<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.930> battery

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
but the charger keeps the battery

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:38.370 
but the charger keeps the battery
charged<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:31.650> here<00:02:32.650> we<00:02:32.800> go

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.630 

okay<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:40.190> can<00:02:40.340> see<00:02:40.550> our<00:02:40.700> currents<00:02:41.150> going<00:02:41.360> here

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
okay you can see our currents going here

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.950 
okay you can see our currents going here
both<00:02:43.640> cylinders<00:02:44.180> are<00:02:44.330> producing<00:02:44.750> hydrogen

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
both cylinders are producing hydrogen

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.440 
both cylinders are producing hydrogen
and<00:02:45.500> look<00:02:45.950> our<00:02:46.310> bubbler<00:02:47.060> is<00:02:47.440> bubbling
