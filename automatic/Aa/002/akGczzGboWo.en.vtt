let's get into the settings it's got HDR
a<00:03:07.910> swinging<00:03:08.870> switch<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.530> have<00:03:09.920> no<00:03:10.250> idea<00:03:10.280> why

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
a swinging switch I have no idea why

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.490 
a swinging switch I have no idea why
they<00:03:10.790> live<00:03:10.970> with<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.210> that<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:12.260> got<00:03:12.410> the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
they live with it that you got the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.450 
they live with it that you got the
regular<00:03:12.770> white<00:03:12.950> balance<00:03:14.830> location<00:03:15.830> exposure

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
regular white balance location exposure

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.480 
regular white balance location exposure
and<00:03:16.700> everything<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:18.500> pretty<00:03:18.770> much<00:03:18.830> it's<00:03:18.980> kind

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
and everything but pretty much it's kind

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.280 
and everything but pretty much it's kind
of<00:03:19.550> a<00:03:19.640> real<00:03:19.850> basic<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.570> default<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.050> six

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
of a real basic and the default is six

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.780 
of a real basic and the default is six
megapixels<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.010> can<00:03:22.160> change<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.430> up<00:03:22.490> to<00:03:22.640> eight

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
megapixels you can change it up to eight

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.420 
megapixels you can change it up to eight
but<00:03:23.090> it<00:03:23.180> gets<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.690> 4<00:03:23.930> by<00:03:24.020> 3<00:03:24.050> ratio<00:03:24.430> so

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
but it gets to the 4 by 3 ratio so

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.160 
but it gets to the 4 by 3 ratio so
leaving<00:03:25.610> it<00:03:25.760> at<00:03:25.880> six<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.360> probably<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:26.990> best

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
leaving it at six is probably the best

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.990 
leaving it at six is probably the best
way<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.380> go<00:03:27.560> well<00:03:28.040> it's<00:03:28.340> up<00:03:28.490> to<00:03:28.520> you<00:03:28.640> though<00:03:28.850> how

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
way to go well it's up to you though how

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.860 
way to go well it's up to you though how
you<00:03:29.060> want<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.360> do<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.660> and<00:03:30.020> that<00:03:31.150> is<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.390> camera
