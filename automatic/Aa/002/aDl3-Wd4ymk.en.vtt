it<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.340> interview<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.759> he<00:01:32.880> knows<00:01:33.090> it's

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
it in an interview that he knows it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.370 
it in an interview that he knows it's
gonna<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.479> published<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> national

gonna be published in a national
magazine<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:35.220> think<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:36.090> remarkable<00:01:36.360> yeah<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
magazine I think is remarkable yeah and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.109 
magazine I think is remarkable yeah and
it's<00:01:37.350> also<00:01:37.530> richly<00:01:38.009> ironic<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.729> Barack

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it's also richly ironic that Barack

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.929 
it's also richly ironic that Barack
Obama<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.470> calling<00:01:40.829> somebody<00:01:41.220> else<00:01:41.400> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
Obama is the one calling somebody else a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.060 
Obama is the one calling somebody else a
BS<00:01:42.600> sir<00:01:42.810> I'll<00:01:43.140> just<00:01:43.200> leave<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.829> point

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
BS sir I'll just leave that point

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.889 
BS sir I'll just leave that point
hanging<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:44.820> but<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.570> Doug<00:01:45.750> is

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
hanging out there but I think Doug is

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.780 
hanging out there but I think Doug is
right<00:01:46.140> look<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.860> hurts<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> Obama

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
right look this really hurts the Obama

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.060 
right look this really hurts the Obama
brand<00:01:48.180> because<00:01:48.720> he<00:01:48.869> did<00:01:49.079> run<00:01:49.350> four<00:01:49.649> years<00:01:49.890> ago

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
brand because he did run four years ago

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.530 
brand because he did run four years ago
as<00:01:50.430> somebody<00:01:50.939> who<00:01:51.119> was<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.450> to

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
as somebody who was going to

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.350 
as somebody who was going to
fundamentally<00:01:52.350> transform<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.640> way<00:01:53.790> politics

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
fundamentally transform the way politics

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.690 
fundamentally transform the way politics
was<00:01:54.600> done<00:01:54.869> he<00:01:55.110> was<00:01:55.259> positioning<00:01:56.070> himself<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
was done he was positioning himself as a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.219 
was done he was positioning himself as a
transcendent<00:01:57.420> figure<00:01:57.600> who<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
transcendent figure who was going to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.200 
transcendent figure who was going to
change<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.770> tone<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.130> Washington<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.939> what

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
change the tone in Washington and what

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.969 
change the tone in Washington and what
now<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.509> have<00:02:00.869> four<00:02:01.079> years<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.409> evidence<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
now we have four years of evidence to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.830 
now we have four years of evidence to
show<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.549> hasn't<00:02:03.030> been<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> case<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
show that that hasn't been the case and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840 
show that that hasn't been the case and
he<00:02:03.960> hasn't<00:02:04.170> succeeded<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.920> doing<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.340> but

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
he hasn't succeeded in doing that but

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.609 
he hasn't succeeded in doing that but
there's<00:02:06.000> also<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.299> critical<00:02:06.780> other<00:02:06.930> point<00:02:07.350> here

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
there's also a critical other point here

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.440 
there's also a critical other point here
I<00:02:07.799> think<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.459> we've<00:02:08.610> been<00:02:08.789> missing<00:02:09.030> is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
I think that that we've been missing is

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.150 
I think that that we've been missing is
that<00:02:09.810> Barack<00:02:10.110> Obama<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.590> spending<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.979> lot<00:02:11.129> of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
that Barack Obama is spending a lot of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.120 
that Barack Obama is spending a lot of
time<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.610> college<00:02:11.910> campuses<00:02:12.480> he<00:02:12.989> went<00:02:13.410> on<00:02:13.500> Leno

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
think the president in some way is

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.130 
think the president in some way is
trying<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:38.010> recapture<00:03:38.940> what<00:03:39.300> Monica<00:03:39.750> alluded

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
trying to recapture what Monica alluded

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.440 
trying to recapture what Monica alluded
to<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> second<00:03:40.740> ago<00:03:40.950> which<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:42.030> sense<00:03:42.330> that

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
to a second ago which is the sense that

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.800 
to a second ago which is the sense that
he<00:03:42.750> was<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:43.970> transformational<00:03:44.970> president<00:03:45.630> that

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
he was a transformational president that

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.660 
he was a transformational president that
he<00:03:45.930> was<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.230> sort<00:03:46.440> of<00:03:46.500> person<00:03:46.680> who<00:03:47.280> would<00:03:47.430> do

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
he was the sort of person who would do

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.860 
he was the sort of person who would do
what<00:03:47.850> he<00:03:47.940> said<00:03:48.209> he<00:03:48.300> was<00:03:48.390> going<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.660> do<00:03:48.750> and

what he said he was going to do and

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.990 
what he said he was going to do and
change<00:03:49.050> politics<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:50.190> sad<00:03:50.459> thing<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.730> when

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
change politics the sad thing is when

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.880 
change politics the sad thing is when
you<00:03:51.090> look<00:03:51.300> at<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.510> economic<00:03:52.110> news<00:03:52.650> in<00:03:52.830> the

you look at the economic news in the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.040 
you look at the economic news in the
economic<00:03:53.370> condition<00:03:53.790> we're<00:03:53.940> facing<00:03:54.180> in<00:03:54.540> terms

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
economic condition we're facing in terms

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.949 
economic condition we're facing in terms
of<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.320> debt<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.770> deficit<00:03:56.250> most<00:03:56.550> of<00:03:56.700> all

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
of the debt the deficit most of all

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.630 
of the debt the deficit most of all
unemployment<00:03:57.959> he<00:03:58.110> clearly<00:03:58.560> hasn't<00:03:59.160> been<00:03:59.520> able

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
unemployment he clearly hasn't been able

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.330 
unemployment he clearly hasn't been able
to<00:03:59.790> fulfill<00:04:00.450> his<00:04:00.840> promises<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
to fulfill his promises and to the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.290 
to fulfill his promises and to the
extent<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.990> he<00:04:03.990> did<00:04:04.200> things<00:04:04.500> like<00:04:05.300> Obamacare

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
extent that he did things like Obamacare

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.930 
extent that he did things like Obamacare
he<00:04:07.260> hasn't<00:04:07.620> exactly<00:04:07.709> wanted<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.430> talk<00:04:08.640> about

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
he hasn't exactly wanted to talk about

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.720 
he hasn't exactly wanted to talk about
them<00:04:09.180> all<00:04:09.570> that<00:04:09.930> much<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.950> campaign<00:04:11.430> trail

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
them all that much on the campaign trail

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.240 
them all that much on the campaign trail
so<00:04:12.630> it's<00:04:12.810> it's<00:04:13.110> been<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.320> different<00:04:13.620> campaign

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
so it's it's been a different campaign

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.400 
so it's it's been a different campaign
and<00:04:14.580> a<00:04:14.820> different<00:04:15.240> President<00:04:15.750> Obama<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.200> think

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
and a different President Obama I think

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.680 
and a different President Obama I think
Monica<00:04:16.770> would<00:04:16.859> agree<00:04:17.160> from<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.850> one<00:04:18.060> we<00:04:18.359> saw

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
Monica would agree from the one we saw

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.960 
Monica would agree from the one we saw
in<00:04:19.190> 2008<00:04:20.190> when<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.430> think<00:04:20.580> about<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.820> big

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
in 2008 when you think about the big

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.850 
in 2008 when you think about the big
picture<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.690> know<00:04:22.049> he<00:04:22.200> promised<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.680> he

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
picture you know he promised that he

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.350 
picture you know he promised that he
would<00:04:23.070> fix<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> economy<00:04:23.820> get<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.060> back<00:04:24.180> on

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
would fix the economy get it back on

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.530 
would fix the economy get it back on
track<00:04:24.540> and<00:04:24.750> improve<00:04:25.200> our

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
track and improve our

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.330 
track and improve our
you<00:04:26.600> know<00:04:26.720> relations<00:04:27.320> in<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.680> world<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.280> put

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
you know relations in the world and put

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.120 
you know relations in the world and put
us<00:04:28.460> in<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.670> better<00:04:28.850> position<00:04:29.800> globally<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.040> I

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
us in a better position globally and I

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.460 
us in a better position globally and I
think<00:04:31.370> there's<00:04:31.550> a<00:04:31.610> lot<00:04:32.330> of<00:04:32.540> debate<00:04:32.990> Monica

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
think there's a lot of debate Monica

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.810 
think there's a lot of debate Monica
over<00:04:33.770> whether<00:04:33.920> or<00:04:34.040> not<00:04:34.130> either<00:04:34.430> one<00:04:34.640> of<00:04:34.670> those

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
over whether or not either one of those

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.100 
over whether or not either one of those
things<00:04:35.120> has<00:04:35.210> been<00:04:35.270> accomplished<00:04:35.600> as<00:04:35.900> judges

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
things has been accomplished as judges

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.080 
things has been accomplished as judges
points<00:04:36.500> out<00:04:36.650> yeah<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:37.430> know<00:04:37.670> more<00:04:37.850> I<00:04:37.880> think

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
points out yeah you know more I think

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.790 
points out yeah you know more I think
there's<00:04:38.390> a<00:04:38.450> different<00:04:38.870> way<00:04:38.960> of<00:04:38.990> looking<00:04:39.290> at<00:04:39.650> it

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
there's a different way of looking at it

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.440 
there's a different way of looking at it
if<00:04:39.920> you<00:04:40.010> listen<00:04:40.430> too<00:04:40.520> closely<00:04:40.550> to<00:04:41.030> Barack

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
if you listen too closely to Barack

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.590 
if you listen too closely to Barack
Obama<00:04:41.480> in<00:04:41.870> 2008<00:04:42.500> he<00:04:42.920> promised<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.850> radical

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
Obama in 2008 he promised a radical

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.690 
Obama in 2008 he promised a radical
transformation<00:04:45.440> of<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:45.740> nation<00:04:46.190> his<00:04:46.460> words

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
transformation of the nation his words

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.810 
transformation of the nation his words
not<00:04:46.850> mine<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.660> I<00:04:48.410> think<00:04:48.800> to<00:04:49.100> a<00:04:49.130> large<00:04:49.370> extent

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
not mine and I think to a large extent

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.240 
not mine and I think to a large extent
he<00:04:50.300> delivered<00:04:50.810> on<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:51.170> the<00:04:51.470> problem<00:04:51.890> is<00:04:52.070> the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
he delivered on that the problem is the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.250 
he delivered on that the problem is the
fundamental<00:04:52.880> transformation<00:04:53.660> he<00:04:53.870> had<00:04:54.110> in

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
fundamental transformation he had in

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.230 
fundamental transformation he had in
mind<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:55.250> he<00:04:55.460> carried<00:04:55.820> out<00:04:55.940> over<00:04:56.090> the

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
mind and that he carried out over the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.870 
mind and that he carried out over the
last<00:04:56.450> four<00:04:56.720> years<00:04:56.750> is<00:04:57.260> not<00:04:58.130> what<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.430> American

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
last four years is not what the American
