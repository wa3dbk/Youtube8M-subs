00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
awful and I don't think maybe it wasn't

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.010 
awful and I don't think maybe it wasn't
its<00:06:39.460> own<00:06:39.580> fault<00:06:39.909> maybe<00:06:40.330> cuz<00:06:40.539> it<00:06:40.689> was<00:06:40.779> sitting

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
its own fault maybe cuz it was sitting

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.420 
its own fault maybe cuz it was sitting
at<00:06:41.110> the<00:06:41.139> bottom<00:06:41.349> of<00:06:41.560> bin<00:06:41.830> yeah<00:06:42.189> for<00:06:42.339> a<00:06:42.399> couple
