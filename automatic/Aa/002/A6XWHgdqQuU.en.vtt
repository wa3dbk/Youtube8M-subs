00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 friends of cuny picks in this episode 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.790
 Antonio is going to answer all the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.680
 Frequently asked questions that you ask us in 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.670
 internet about guinea pigs closeup 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.670
 health chapter 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.770
 antonio first question my guinea pig has 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.860
 diarrhea and is very weak that 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.119
 I have to do good so first thing 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.550
 what you have to answer is that it's something 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.430
 serious or diarrhea in all 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.200
 herbivores is a serious process because 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.290
 besides, it is never chronic because 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.730
 often have serious problems before 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.230
 so much going to the vet is the most 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.500
 important because there is not one thing 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.360
 only that it is the cause of the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.340
 diarrhea in guinea pigs so you have to 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.859
 make an accurate diagnosis while 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.600
 what can we do good? 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.579
 go to the vet quickly but if 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.640
 you want to do something while you can 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.339
 force him to drink some serum or 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.140
 even of water with a syringe and 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.120
 you can give the airbag with temps vouchers 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.609
 you have the videos done you can see the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.670
 videos of the product so that the guinea pig 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.409
 at least since he 's having those 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.110
 serious losses that at least go away 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.659
 replacing what he loses in second 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.780
 Question my guinea pig does not eat and does not drink 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.700
 more than two days ago good even ago 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.830
 even if it was a day one or two days for 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.220
 a guinea pig especially when it's a 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.750
 little girl is a very serious problem and very 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.700
 serious and you have to go to the vet 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.190
 because it can even be a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.440
 obstruction problem or has eaten 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.030
 some toxic or millions of things there is not 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.930
 only one school thing to do and 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.390
 in this case yes you have to go 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.850
 urgently to the veterinarian third my 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.560
 guinea pig has eaten something that is in the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.250
 list of toxic foods and products 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.920
 What should I do? 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.980
 quickly to the vet nonetheless 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.930
 You can also get information from 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.490
 these toxic products because sometimes 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.320
 we think that they have eaten something and not 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.450
 there is no problem but yes 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.150
 it really can be a serious problem 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.220
 -and the listing with products and 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.250
 toxic plants will find it in 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.990
 our video on the subject and while 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.760
 if you want in these videos too 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.630
 we explain that coal can be given 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.300
 activated as a product that inhibits 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.670
 absorption of many of these toxic or 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.830
 toxins can therefore be given carbon 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.270
 activated with water but we insist that 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.180
 quick to the vet because the life of the 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.150
 animal depends on this another question 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.010
 it scratches a lot because it makes it good 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.810
 it's not uncommon this in fact the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.340
 skin problems of guinea pigs are 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.560
 quite frequent and I'm glad that I 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.480
 ask the question because even some 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.370
 of these problems can be stuck to 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.469
 people so you have to have a lot 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.469
 Be careful if you have children at home or 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:42.930
 especially the skin of women is more 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:44.879
 receptive to being able to have problems that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.139
 can stick the skin of guinea pigs 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.819
 so much if we see our guinea pig 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.879
 scratching we're going to go to the vet 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.409
 especially if they appear bald or if we see 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.049
 that the animal scratches excessively can 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.819
 have mites are parasites but also 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.470
 you can have fungi or you can also have 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.970
 bacterial problems or deficiency in 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.169
 vitamins there are many things that can 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.209
 occur not I can not tell you one 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.489
 solution alone but what I say 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.829
 is that it is important and that you go to 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.969
 veterinary new question do I have to 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.980
 vaccinate my guinea pig 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.079
 good in principle the guinea pigs 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.000
 they need a vaccine but if they need 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.409
 deworming this that does not have to 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.359
 Vaccinating does not mean you do not have to go 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.730
 to the veterinarian the guinea pigs need 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.219
 less two revisions a year does not stop 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.470
 vaccines but for deworming and 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:26.700
 the general reviews and in addition 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.709
 observe your teeth because 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.970
 the veterinarian should look inside the 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.879
 mouth of things that happen many 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.030
 problems last question or guinea pig not 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.270
 eat and your gums bleed to what 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.880
 should 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.710
 There may be several reasons but one of 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.840
 the most typical is the deficiency in 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.780
 vitamin C for not feeding well at 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.610
 guinea pigs guinea pigs if they need fruit and 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.070
 a few amounts of vitamin c very 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.390
 important therefore if we see you these 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.940
 signs let's go to the vet 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.980
 but it is important to prevent we look at the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.410
 videos in which we tell you the care 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.300
 of these pets should take a 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.250
 quantity of important fruit and vegetables 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.470
 to prevent vitamin deficiency 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.270
 c this disease is called scurvy and 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.630
 is something that frequently happens to 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.630
 Guinea pigs
