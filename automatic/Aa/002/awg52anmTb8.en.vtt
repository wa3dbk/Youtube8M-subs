wifes at this point I'd like to give a

wifes at this point I'd like to give a
brief<00:00:06.150> summary<00:00:06.480> of<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:07.049> model<00:00:07.350> presented<00:00:07.560> in

brief summary of the model presented in
this<00:00:08.010> book<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.519> I'd<00:00:08.910> also<00:00:09.059> like<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.420> present<00:00:09.719> a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
this book and I'd also like to present a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.290 
this book and I'd also like to present a
take<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.530> model<00:00:10.800> but<00:00:11.610> first<00:00:11.849> let's<00:00:12.150> go

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
take on that model but first let's go

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.930 
take on that model but first let's go
back<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.509> documentary<00:00:13.259> hypothesis<00:00:14.070> many<00:00:14.790> of

back to documentary hypothesis many of

you are probably aware of the proposed

you are probably aware of the proposed

connections between the biblical flood

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.019 
connections between the biblical flood

the Epic of Gilgamesh however much more
of<00:00:24.060> Genesis<00:00:24.570> seems<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.080> modeled<00:00:25.470> after<00:00:25.650> a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
of Genesis seems to be modeled after a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.490 
of Genesis seems to be modeled after a
Babylonian<00:00:26.609> understanding<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:28.109> problem

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
Babylonian understanding the problem

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.169 
Babylonian understanding the problem
with<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.769> Babylonian<00:00:29.250> understanding<00:00:30.060> is

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
with this Babylonian understanding is

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.939 
with this Babylonian understanding is
that<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.420> comes<00:00:30.630> from<00:00:30.689> multiple<00:00:31.199> sources<00:00:31.470> in

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that it comes from multiple sources in

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.610 
that it comes from multiple sources in
fact<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> comes<00:00:32.850> from<00:00:33.000> too<00:00:33.300> many<00:00:33.480> sources<00:00:33.960> so

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
fact it comes from too many sources so

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.229 
fact it comes from too many sources so
the<00:00:34.739> question<00:00:34.860> has<00:00:35.280> been<00:00:35.309> how<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:35.880> this

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the question has been how was this

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.850 
the question has been how was this
transmitted<00:00:36.899> into<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> Torah<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
transmitted into the Torah and the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.220 
transmitted into the Torah and the
answer<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.760> far<00:00:39.059> has<00:00:39.329> been<00:00:39.360> documentary

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
answer so far has been documentary

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.709 
answer so far has been documentary
hypothesis<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.340> essentially<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> Torah

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
hypothesis that essentially the Torah

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.690 
hypothesis that essentially the Torah
was<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> result<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.649> slow<00:00:43.920> process<00:00:44.250> of

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
was the result of a slow process of

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.760 
was the result of a slow process of
collection<00:00:45.090> where<00:00:45.809> these<00:00:45.960> multiple<00:00:46.469> sources

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
collection where these multiple sources

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.160 
collection where these multiple sources
eventually<00:00:47.399> made<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.700> into<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.030> Bible<00:00:48.270> this

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
eventually made it into the Bible this

scholarship but that term is loaded with

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.740 
scholarship but that term is loaded with
problems<00:03:43.220> and<00:03:43.430> my<00:03:43.700> proposition<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
problems and my proposition and the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.170 
problems and my proposition and the
American<00:03:45.109> model<00:03:45.440> excludes<00:03:46.040> many<00:03:46.459> facets<00:03:47.060> of

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
American model excludes many facets of

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.629 
American model excludes many facets of
the<00:03:47.299> broader<00:03:47.569> minimalist<00:03:48.290> context<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.609> I

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639 
the broader minimalist context so I

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.460 
the broader minimalist context so I
think<00:03:49.970> we<00:03:50.299> need<00:03:50.450> a<00:03:50.480> new<00:03:50.660> term<00:03:50.900> for<00:03:50.930> this<00:03:51.290> type

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
think we need a new term for this type

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.830 
think we need a new term for this type
of<00:03:51.500> proposition<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.489> my<00:03:53.060> suggestion<00:03:53.660> would

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
of proposition and my suggestion would

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.329 
of proposition and my suggestion would
be<00:03:53.900> Septuagint<00:03:54.859> priority<00:03:55.519> hypothesis
