00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
that's what we're looking for when

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.160 
that's what we're looking for when
they're<00:01:46.340> already<00:01:46.550> pretty<00:01:46.789> opaque<00:01:47.149> but<00:01:47.509> you'll

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
they're already pretty opaque but you'll

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.499 
they're already pretty opaque but you'll
see<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.590> difference<00:01:48.979> once<00:01:49.880> your<00:01:50.060> rice<00:01:50.270> is

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
see a difference once your rice is

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.100 
see a difference once your rice is
looking<00:01:50.660> like<00:01:51.289> this<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.550> it's<00:01:52.940> all<00:01:53.179> white<00:01:53.720> as

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
looking like this so it's all white as

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.690 
looking like this so it's all white as
opposed<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.649> like<00:01:54.920> having<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.310> little<00:01:55.460> white

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
opposed to like having a little white

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.800 
opposed to like having a little white
Center<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.270> then<00:01:56.360> being<00:01:56.539> sort<00:01:56.780> of

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
Center and then being sort of

translucent<00:01:57.110> around<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.500> edges<00:01:57.770> we're<00:01:58.039> gonna

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
translucent around the edges we're gonna

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.840 
translucent around the edges we're gonna
add<00:01:58.310> half<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.610> cup<00:01:58.759> of<00:01:58.940> white<00:01:59.149> wine<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:01.789> let

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
just kidding you could just use like

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.779 
just kidding you could just use like
half<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:09.140> cup<00:02:09.319> of<00:02:09.470> broth<00:02:09.740> instead<00:02:09.979> just<00:02:10.490> to<00:02:10.610> kind

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
half a cup of broth instead just to kind

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.850 
half a cup of broth instead just to kind
of<00:02:10.850> get<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.090> started<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.540> guess<00:02:11.600> but<00:02:12.050> you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
of get this started I guess but you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.170 
of get this started I guess but you
probably<00:02:13.069> could<00:02:13.310> actually<00:02:13.460> just<00:02:13.760> skip<00:02:14.150> right

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
probably could actually just skip right

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.020 
probably could actually just skip right
ahead<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.110> cooking<00:02:15.590> part<00:02:15.830> since<00:02:16.640> this<00:02:16.850> is

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
ahead to the cooking part since this is

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.440 
ahead to the cooking part since this is
really<00:02:17.270> for<00:02:17.450> flavor<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.840> think<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:20.000> we're<00:02:20.420> just

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
really for flavor I think so we're just

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.100 
really for flavor I think so we're just
going<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.780> kick<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:21.050> up<00:02:21.140> until<00:02:21.410> its<00:02:21.590> evaporated

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
going to kick it up until its evaporated

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.350 
going to kick it up until its evaporated
okay<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:24.350> once<00:02:24.620> your<00:02:24.800> wine<00:02:25.460> is<00:02:25.819> absorbed

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
okay so once your wine is absorbed

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.420 
okay so once your wine is absorbed
and/or<00:02:26.810> evaporated<00:02:27.500> now's<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.890> time<00:02:28.069> for<00:02:28.130> the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
and/or evaporated now's the time for the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.870 
and/or evaporated now's the time for the
simmering<00:02:29.300> stock<00:02:30.280> you<00:02:31.280> want<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.490> add<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.700> about

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
simmering stock you want to add it about

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.720 
simmering stock you want to add it about
a<00:02:31.910> cup<00:02:32.180> at<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.360> time<00:02:32.600> at<00:02:32.780> first<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.709> having<00:02:34.610> it

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
a cup at a time at first and having it

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.920 
a cup at a time at first and having it
hot<00:02:34.910> like<00:02:35.120> this<00:02:35.270> is<00:02:35.420> going<00:02:35.569> to<00:02:35.630> make<00:02:35.780> the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
hot like this is going to make the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.660 
hot like this is going to make the
risotto<00:02:36.170> cook<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.530> lot<00:02:36.680> faster<00:02:37.069> and<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.459> helps

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
risotto cook a lot faster and it helps

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.440 
risotto cook a lot faster and it helps
it<00:02:37.790> get<00:02:37.880> super<00:02:38.660> duper<00:02:38.780> creamy<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:41.150> we<00:02:41.270> add<00:02:41.420> a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
it get super duper creamy so we add a

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.180 
it get super duper creamy so we add a
cup<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:43.220> then<00:02:43.310> we<00:02:44.030> stir<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.720> we<00:02:45.530> wait<00:02:45.710> until

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
cup and then we stir and we wait until

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.990 
cup and then we stir and we wait until
that<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.550> all<00:02:46.730> absorbed

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that is all absorbed

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.790 
that is all absorbed
and<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.300> stirring<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.780> very<00:02:48.930> important<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
and the stirring is very important the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.160 
and the stirring is very important the
constant<00:02:50.280> stirring<00:02:50.460> helps<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.150> starch<00:02:51.630> form

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
constant stirring helps that starch form

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.050 
constant stirring helps that starch form
helps<00:02:52.830> it<00:02:52.980> release<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.550> form<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.850> really

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
helps it release and form a really

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.230 
helps it release and form a really
creamy<00:02:54.390> thing<00:02:54.660> that<00:02:55.530> almost<00:02:56.340> it<00:02:56.760> has<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
creamy thing that almost it has the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.060 
creamy thing that almost it has the
consistency<00:02:57.390> when<00:02:58.050> it's<00:02:58.200> done<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.740> like<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
consistency when it's done that like the

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.850 
consistency when it's done that like the
rice<00:02:59.250> has<00:02:59.430> been<00:02:59.460> cooked<00:02:59.850> in<00:03:00.030> heavy<00:03:00.240> cream<00:03:00.540> but

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
rice has been cooked in heavy cream but

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.260 
rice has been cooked in heavy cream but
surprised<00:03:01.860> it's<00:03:02.190> actually<00:03:02.610> pretty<00:03:02.760> dietary

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
surprised it's actually pretty dietary

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.160 
surprised it's actually pretty dietary
except<00:03:03.570> for<00:03:03.690> all<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> butter<00:03:03.990> or<00:03:04.110> the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
except for all the butter or the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.290 
except for all the butter or the
parmesan<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.640> takes<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.820> lot<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:08.970> patience

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
parmesan and it takes a lot of patience

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.430 
parmesan and it takes a lot of patience

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
this is probably like the worst recipe I

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.420 
this is probably like the worst recipe I
myself<00:03:12.630> could<00:03:13.020> try<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.200> demo<00:03:13.470> because<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:13.950> lack

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
myself could try to demo because I lack

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.449 
myself could try to demo because I lack
patience<00:03:14.790> but<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.240> will<00:03:15.780> do<00:03:15.870> my<00:03:15.900> best<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:17.280> we've

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
patience but I will do my best so we've

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.060 
patience but I will do my best so we've
got<00:03:17.610> it<00:03:17.670> over<00:03:17.820> kind<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.090> medium<00:03:18.120> low<00:03:18.420> heat

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
got it over kind of a medium low heat

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.370 
got it over kind of a medium low heat
which<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.220> torturous<00:03:20.670> for<00:03:20.700> me<00:03:21.200> but<00:03:22.200> it's

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
which is torturous for me but it's

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.770 
which is torturous for me but it's
happening<00:03:22.800> things<00:03:23.160> are<00:03:23.280> happening<00:03:23.670> all<00:03:24.660> right

happening things are happening all right

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.660 
happening things are happening all right
when<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.080> about<00:03:25.320> absorbed<00:03:25.950> like<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.340> I

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670

when it's about absorbed like this I
mean<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.880> don't<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.150> know<00:03:27.270> you<00:03:27.480> don't<00:03:27.510> want

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.780 
it to like dry out but mostly absorbed
we<00:03:30.239> can<00:03:30.360> add<00:03:30.480> another<00:03:32.180> simmering<00:03:33.180> stock<00:03:33.570> and

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
we can add another simmering stock and

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.340 
we can add another simmering stock and
stir<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:36.000> again<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:36.989> want<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.230> keep

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
stir it again so you just want to keep

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.560 
stir it again so you just want to keep
adding<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.800> stock<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.340> cup<00:03:38.790> at<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:38.970> time<00:03:39.000> until

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
adding the stock a cup at a time until

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.340 
adding the stock a cup at a time until
you've<00:03:39.810> added<00:03:39.959> 6<00:03:40.410> cups<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.959> it'll<00:03:42.959> take<00:03:43.170> about

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
you've added 6 cups and it'll take about

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.560 
you've added 6 cups and it'll take about
5<00:03:43.770> minutes<00:03:43.800> or<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.580> in<00:03:44.730> between<00:03:45.030> each<00:03:45.150> addition

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
5 minutes or so in between each addition

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.960 
5 minutes or so in between each addition
for<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.110> absorb<00:03:46.410> into<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.770> rice<00:03:46.950> and<00:03:47.280> then

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
for it to absorb into the rice and then

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.720 
for it to absorb into the rice and then
once<00:03:48.930> we<00:03:49.110> get<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.770> where<00:03:49.950> we've<00:03:50.100> added<00:03:50.220> 6<00:03:50.520> cups

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
once we get to where we've added 6 cups

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.360 
once we get to where we've added 6 cups
will<00:03:51.350> will<00:03:52.350> wash<00:03:52.830> it<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:53.040> little<00:03:53.160> bit<00:03:53.280> more

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
will will wash it a little bit more

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.350 
will will wash it a little bit more
carefully<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:53.820> I'm<00:03:53.910> just<00:03:54.000> going<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.269> keep

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
carefully so I'm just going to keep

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.380 
carefully so I'm just going to keep
doing<00:03:54.660> that<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:54.989> I'll<00:03:55.470> see<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:56.130> 4<00:03:57.060> cups

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
doing that and I'll see you in 4 cups

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.830 
doing that and I'll see you in 4 cups
worth<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.780> time<00:03:59.060> for<00:04:00.060> more<00:04:00.269> cups<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.660> mean

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
worth of time for more cups I mean

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.320 
worth of time for more cups I mean
because<00:04:01.230> we<00:04:01.320> are<00:04:01.410> needed<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.830> get<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.280> ok<00:04:03.090> after

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
because we are needed to get it ok after

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.600 
because we are needed to get it ok after
our<00:04:03.810> 6<00:04:04.230> cups<00:04:04.500> of<00:04:04.650> stock<00:04:04.830> has<00:04:05.040> been<00:04:05.220> added<00:04:05.489> and

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
our 6 cups of stock has been added and

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.920 
our 6 cups of stock has been added and
it's<00:04:05.820> looking<00:04:06.090> like<00:04:06.239> this<00:04:06.420> that's<00:04:06.750> when<00:04:06.900> you

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
it's looking like this that's when you

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.500 
it's looking like this that's when you
want<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.410> give<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.310> taste<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:09.330> we're

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
want to give it a taste and we're

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.780 
want to give it a taste and we're
looking<00:04:09.780> for<00:04:09.989> tender<00:04:10.500> rice<00:04:13.220> this<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:14.400> great<00:04:14.610> so

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
looking for tender rice this is great so

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.940 
looking for tender rice this is great so
it's<00:04:14.940> like<00:04:15.120> al<00:04:15.630> dente<00:04:15.690> basically<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.650> center

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
it's like al dente basically the center

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.650 
it's like al dente basically the center
is<00:04:17.130> cooked<00:04:17.370> through<00:04:17.609> but<00:04:18.299> it's<00:04:18.450> still<00:04:18.600> a

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
is cooked through but it's still a

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.750 
is cooked through but it's still a
little<00:04:18.870> bit<00:04:19.079> chewy

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
little bit chewy

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.460 
little bit chewy
so<00:04:20.760> we<00:04:21.269> might<00:04:21.419> not<00:04:21.510> need<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.780> add<00:04:21.900> all<00:04:22.049> 8<00:04:22.229> cups

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
so we might not need to add all 8 cups

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.110 
so we might not need to add all 8 cups
but<00:04:22.710> now<00:04:23.130> we're<00:04:23.310> going<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.490> start<00:04:23.729> adding<00:04:23.850> it

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
but now we're going to start adding it

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.020 
but now we're going to start adding it
in<00:04:24.390> smaller<00:04:25.260> increments<00:04:25.530> like<00:04:25.890> just<00:04:26.640> a<00:04:26.729> 1/2<00:04:26.910> a

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
in smaller increments like just a 1/2 a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.580 
in smaller increments like just a 1/2 a
cup<00:04:27.150> at<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.360> time

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
cup at a time

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.950 
cup at a time
stir<00:04:28.590> that<00:04:28.770> in<00:04:28.979> just<00:04:29.580> until<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.479> rice<00:04:30.690> is

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
stir that in just until the rice is

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.690 
stir that in just until the rice is
cooked<00:04:31.320> through<00:04:31.530> so<00:04:31.919> like<00:04:32.130> when<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.340> taste<00:04:32.550> it

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
cooked through so like when you taste it

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.420 
cooked through so like when you taste it
it<00:04:32.820> doesn't<00:04:33.000> like<00:04:33.390> it's<00:04:33.630> stuck<00:04:33.900> in<00:04:34.050> your<00:04:34.140> teeth

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
it doesn't like it's stuck in your teeth

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.800 
it doesn't like it's stuck in your teeth
like<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.640> last<00:04:35.820> little<00:04:36.030> bite<00:04:36.180> that<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.330> got<00:04:36.540> did

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
like the last little bite that I got did

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.540 
like the last little bite that I got did
a<00:04:36.840> little<00:04:37.020> bit<00:04:37.200> but<00:04:37.470> not<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.919> it's<00:04:38.100> mushy

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
a little bit but not that it's mushy

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.090 
a little bit but not that it's mushy
like<00:04:38.790> the<00:04:38.940> rice<00:04:39.090> grain<00:04:39.330> should<00:04:39.600> still

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
like the rice grain should still

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.350 
like the rice grain should still
maintain<00:04:41.100> their<00:04:41.250> integrity<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.790> still<00:04:42.120> look

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
maintain their integrity and still look

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.030 
maintain their integrity and still look
like<00:04:42.570> rice<00:04:42.750> grains<00:04:43.050> and<00:04:43.590> if<00:04:43.710> you<00:04:43.800> wanted<00:04:43.979> to

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
like rice grains and if you wanted to

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.860 
like rice grains and if you wanted to
add<00:04:44.250> like<00:04:44.700> sauteed<00:04:45.090> mushrooms<00:04:45.419> to<00:04:45.540> this<00:04:45.660> and

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
add like sauteed mushrooms to this and

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.590 
add like sauteed mushrooms to this and
do<00:04:45.960> a<00:04:45.990> mushroom<00:04:46.320> risotto<00:04:46.470> or<00:04:47.600> whatever

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
do a mushroom risotto or whatever

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.150 
do a mushroom risotto or whatever
sauteed<00:04:49.050> asparagus<00:04:49.320> or<00:04:49.740> anything<00:04:49.919> like<00:04:50.100> that

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
sauteed asparagus or anything like that

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.280 
sauteed asparagus or anything like that
you<00:04:50.490> could<00:04:50.640> add<00:04:50.790> that<00:04:51.150> and<00:04:51.450> at<00:04:51.660> this<00:04:51.900> point

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
you could add that and at this point

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.530 
you could add that and at this point
like<00:04:52.530> once<00:04:53.310> your<00:04:53.610> risotto<00:04:54.000> is<00:04:54.240> almost

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
like once your risotto is almost

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.029 
like once your risotto is almost
finished<00:04:55.050> cooking<00:04:55.229> is<00:04:55.560> when<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:55.800> could<00:04:55.950> add

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
finished cooking is when you could add

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:58.210 
finished cooking is when you could add
in<00:04:56.220> some<00:04:56.520> sauteed<00:04:57.030> vegetables<00:04:57.060> or<00:04:57.630> something

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
in some sauteed vegetables or something

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.730 
in some sauteed vegetables or something
and<00:04:59.220> you<00:04:59.849> can<00:05:00.000> also<00:05:00.120> you'd<00:05:00.479> also<00:05:00.660> be<00:05:00.990> tasting

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
and you can also you'd also be tasting

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.279 
and you can also you'd also be tasting
salt<00:05:01.919> when<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.280> taste<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.639> now<00:05:02.819> my<00:05:03.389> broth<00:05:03.930> was

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
salt when you taste it now my broth was

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.129 
salt when you taste it now my broth was
really<00:05:04.650> well<00:05:05.250> seasoned<00:05:05.759> so<00:05:06.180> I<00:05:06.479> don't<00:05:06.960> think<00:05:07.020> I

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
really well seasoned so I don't think I

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.200 
really well seasoned so I don't think I
need<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.319> add<00:05:07.440> any<00:05:07.620> salt<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:08.160> the<00:05:08.520> risotto<00:05:08.849> but

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
need to add any salt to the risotto but

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.809 
need to add any salt to the risotto but
if<00:05:09.539> you're<00:05:09.810> using<00:05:09.990> a<00:05:10.169> low<00:05:10.319> sodium<00:05:10.560> stock<00:05:11.069> or

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:11.819 
if you're using a low sodium stock or

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:13.189 
if you're using a low sodium stock or
something<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:12.210> made<00:05:12.360> yourself<00:05:12.660> without<00:05:12.810> salt

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 
something you made yourself without salt
