00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
of similar to the optimus 2x except you

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.930

have<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> little<00:00:16.830> bit<00:00:16.949> downgraded<00:00:17.460> camera<00:00:17.820> but

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
have a little bit downgraded camera but

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.500 
have a little bit downgraded camera but
then<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.210> an<00:00:18.270> upgraded<00:00:18.660> display<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:20.510> it

then you have an upgraded display and it

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.700 
then you have an upgraded display and it
should<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.810> little<00:00:21.960> bit<00:00:22.140> more<00:00:22.260> affordable

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
mean things so for example there's the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.340 
mean things so for example there's the
usual<00:00:40.379> home<00:00:40.890> screens<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:42.239> if<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:43.020> want<00:00:43.230> to

swipe through them you can use the

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.190 
swipe through them you can use the
