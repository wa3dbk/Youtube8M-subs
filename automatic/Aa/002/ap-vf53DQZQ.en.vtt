00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
theater so we're very proud of it but

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.660 
theater so we're very proud of it but
but<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:20.290> then<00:02:20.500> again<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.160> like<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.370> said

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
smaller venue is easier but uh it's the

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:27.390

stuff<00:06:40.290> when<00:06:40.650> I<00:06:40.710> started<00:06:41.160> in<00:06:41.310> this<00:06:41.430> there<00:06:41.640> were

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
stuff when I started in this there were

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.430 
stuff when I started in this there were
no<00:06:41.940> weight<00:06:42.150> classes<00:06:42.450> everybody<00:06:43.020> just<00:06:43.230> fought

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
no weight classes everybody just fought

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.350 
no weight classes everybody just fought
everybody<00:06:43.920> there<00:06:44.100> was<00:06:44.220> no<00:06:44.370> round<00:06:44.670> system<00:06:45.180> and

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
everybody there was no round system and

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.880 
everybody there was no round system and
and<00:06:45.630> I<00:06:45.900> never<00:06:46.080> really<00:06:46.410> bought<00:06:46.560> into<00:06:46.620> that

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
and I never really bought into that

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.310 
and I never really bought into that
mentality<00:06:47.340> of<00:06:47.760> uh<00:06:47.940> you<00:06:48.780> know<00:06:48.810> what<00:06:49.080> a<00:06:49.110> guy

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
mentality of uh you know what a guy

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.170 
mentality of uh you know what a guy
weighs<00:06:49.560> or<00:06:49.830> anything<00:06:50.130> I<00:06:50.160> I<00:06:50.580> think<00:06:51.030> that's

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
weighs or anything I I think that's

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.020 
weighs or anything I I think that's
probably<00:06:51.360> a<00:06:51.540> better<00:06:51.660> way<00:06:51.900> to<00:06:51.960> do<00:06:52.170> it<00:06:52.350> uh<00:06:52.910> but<00:06:53.910> it

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
probably a better way to do it uh but it

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.130 
probably a better way to do it uh but it
doesn't<00:06:54.330> make<00:06:54.390> any<00:06:54.450> difference<00:06:54.780> to<00:06:54.990> me<00:06:55.080> you

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:55.140
