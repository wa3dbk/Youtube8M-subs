00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
I used to do it for free but this year

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.790

he<00:06:13.120> started<00:06:13.480> paying<00:06:13.660> me<00:06:13.870> 20<00:06:14.170> bucks<00:06:14.410> to<00:06:14.620> do<00:06:14.770> it

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
he started paying me 20 bucks to do it

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.840
