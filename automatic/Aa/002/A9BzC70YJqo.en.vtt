00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hey people welcome to skin 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.849
 like precious today , this is about one 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.620
 couple performing well from the corsa opc 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.889
 sit 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.719
 Recaro sports acs just for a short time 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.490
 to clarify how often the question 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.539
 is the water transfer pressure i have 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.910
 me such a good execution in the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.869
 hand, I think there is clearly no 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.490
 it is not a water transfer as you can see 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.840
 It could also be countries during the day 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.030
 really real carbon what you guys 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.770
 Today it wants to show in principle one 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.140
 small thing 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.920
 it's about good leadership 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.629
 expand 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.210
 in the car if you paint the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.320
 If you want to let it change 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.350
 want to let us refine in principle 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.280
 a very simple box come why 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.300
 here in the sense for one was called 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.520
 usually a flap in front 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.579
 who is also equal to the hand 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.920
 As it is, it usually looks like this 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.210
 of course I have the from before 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.640
 wrong his hand is of course great 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.050
 we have two sets of it shut up 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.520
 in principle issues out to click 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.870
 you can see here are two noses 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.860
 I just got it clicked 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.270
 the other side is the lever around 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.770
 seat forward and he helps 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.130
 us also because that's not how it is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.810
 tuned 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.830
 we see here behind it are screws 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.270
 you see the so advises are solvente 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.259
 screw 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.790
 It does not get that way 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.240
 of course a little stupid we see it 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.259
 but the seat of it did not work out because 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.520
 We'll just follow suit with that 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.820
 once in the fold 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.369
 oh wonder, the lever stays automatic 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.720
 front the ball forward and we can 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.810
 very easy easy here with ours 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.280
 recessions tool tv 10 is the 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.990
 unscrew the screw and the screws 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.490
 unscrew screw and it comes to us 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.570
 whole thing against on other side 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.310
 It is not quite pure yet 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.860
 you can see it recognizes that way 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.210
 that is the question 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.909
 on the other side are just two 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.920
 clicks that sounds rather solid and 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.159
 already it was natural in there 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.579
 bomb again that was it in the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.579
 principle already
