 of the river of silver in this image 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 we have the July teacher of expensive who has 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.210
 totally revolutionized the tango in 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.699
 this image to the master pinocho routin 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.670
 murguero of a genre that is the murga 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.370
 Uruguayan let's start with tango and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.250
 the milonga 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.590
 the tango and the milonga are danced in the 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.720
 tango in the old guard that is 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.570
 called was divided in two the tango 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:40.010
 instrumental or the orchestras 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.870
 who played in the bars in the bars 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.789
 to dance for people to 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.190
 immigrants in a time of much 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.250
 immigration this is very important is 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.460
 original so the immigration that there was 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.329
 Italian Spaniards especially and for 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.329
 another side we had 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.390
 the song tango 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.940
 this genre I have a song you can say 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.850
 that was inaugurated by maestro Carlos Gardel 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.990
 with my sad night in the song tango 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.210
 three things got together a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.840
 interpreter in this case carlos gardel 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.869
 but a lot more a poet who did the 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.110
 lyrics of the song and a musician who 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.450
 put music to that poetry every tango 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.759
 he gathered these three important or three 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.970
 imposing pillars of which 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.560
 They came out very beautiful tangos and very 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.570
 sad we also remember that the tango 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.070
 it's a sad song or it's usually sad 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.600
 after July face as we saw in 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.420
 what is the guard new study is 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.360
 joined and the typical orchestras started 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.300
 to have a singer let's chat now 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.880
 little in the candombe in Uruguay or the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.909
 candombe is a music of black origin 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.390
 it's a mixture of an emigration that there was 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.640
 to the river the silver but of slaves union 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.090
 of Africa then clear that in the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.840
 conventillos and in their houses let's say 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.680
 he played music and played black music this 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.799
 it was mixing and gave rise to the candombe 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.230
 in the most traditional neighborhoods in 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:23.230
 uruguay montevideo is precisely where 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.220
 Candombe is born in Palermo 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.220
 and southern neighborhood 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.140
 in Buenos Aires at the beginning knew 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.810
 see candombe also but then the 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.580
 blacks have mixed with the Italians 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.670
 and Spaniards those who have blacks who have 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.510
 stayed and the black culture has been lost 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.430
 so 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.880
 buenos aires- the candombe has been lost 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.830
 and just now ends and the 20 and 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.080
 early 21st century 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.150
 is starting to have groups of 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.670
 candombe for what they do is imitate the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.480
 Uruguayan candombe and the candombe of 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.170
 Uruguay continued as music and as a dance 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.400
 and it has a very great wealth 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.290
 let's continue with the murga on the one hand 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.599
 the river of silver divides us the murga 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.730
 in two we have the murga porte침a la muro 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.630
 of Buenos Aires, which is a murga of 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.880
 parade in which hung bass drums play 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.489
 with surfing drummers 200 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.640
 instruments and it goes parading it goes 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.860
 marching the Buenos Aires murga is played and 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.750
 especially dancing is a very dance 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.780
 important the river of silver 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.380
 the murga porte침a and on the other hand we have 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.780
 the Uruguayan murga that is totally 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.600
 different from the porte침a mule and it is also 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.060
 other than Uruguayan candombe la murga 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.630
 Uruguayan difference Buenos Aires is murga 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:50.050
 of Uruguayan scenery do not parade and 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.100
 dance camos places a choir 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.710
 approximately 20 people with a 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.110
 director and percussion has three 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.960
 instruments nothing else touched by three 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.900
 people who are the hype and cymbal 'and 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.690
 the drummer should be noted that both the 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.690
 Uruguayan murga as the Buenos Aires murga 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.860
 they have a great social content and of 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:16.670
 protest to finish this video we go 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:22.030
 to listen to a tango sung here with me 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.030
 partner that is the tango 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:36.420
 I guess the flicker of the sweet goes to 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.569
 market and all those friends that 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.899
 illuminate 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:43.379
 with the pale reflections are the hours 

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:43.379
 of pain 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.500

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.890
 And come back 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.400
