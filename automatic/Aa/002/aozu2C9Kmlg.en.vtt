00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:04.730 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.980 

traditionally<00:00:05.730> when<00:00:05.850> we<00:00:05.910> think<00:00:06.240> about<00:00:06.390> robots

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
traditionally when we think about robots

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.900 
traditionally when we think about robots
we<00:00:07.200> think<00:00:07.410> about<00:00:07.529> rigid<00:00:07.919> pieces<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.790> are

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
we think about rigid pieces that are

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.959 
we think about rigid pieces that are
linked<00:00:09.150> together<00:00:09.330> things<00:00:09.960> like<00:00:10.050> c-3po<00:00:10.969> things

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
linked together things like c-3po things

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.060 
linked together things like c-3po things
like<00:00:12.210> wall-e<00:00:12.540> and<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.410> we're<00:00:13.620> trying<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.920> do

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
like wall-e and what we're trying to do

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.609 
like wall-e and what we're trying to do
is<00:00:14.190> build<00:00:14.340> robots<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.940> emulate<00:00:15.870> biological

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
is build robots that emulate biological

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.380 
is build robots that emulate biological
system<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.160> they<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.430> soft<00:00:17.699> components

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
system so they have soft components

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.450 
system so they have soft components
they're<00:00:18.570> very<00:00:18.779> deformable<00:00:19.470> they<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:20.100> squeeze

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
they're very deformable they can squeeze

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.519 
they're very deformable they can squeeze
through<00:00:20.699> small<00:00:21.000> spaces<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.720> they<00:00:22.350> can

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
through small spaces and they can

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.769 
through small spaces and they can
interact<00:00:22.740> safely<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.580> people<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.539> what

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
interact safely with people and so what

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.560 
interact safely with people and so what
we're<00:00:24.990> trying<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.439> do<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:27.029> go<00:00:27.180> away<00:00:27.300> from

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
we're trying to do is to go away from

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.450 
we're trying to do is to go away from
that<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:28.019> bit<00:00:28.170> we<00:00:28.439> wanted<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.099> develop

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
that a little bit we wanted to develop

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.030 
that a little bit we wanted to develop
tunable<00:00:30.330> stiffness<00:00:31.080> structures<00:00:31.830> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
tunable stiffness structures and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.490 
tunable stiffness structures and
materials<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.000> idea<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:34.110> robot

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
materials and the idea is that the robot

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.979 
materials and the idea is that the robot
should<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.920> soft<00:00:35.280> in<00:00:35.640> situations<00:00:36.420> where<00:00:36.719> we

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
should be soft in situations where we

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.380 
should be soft in situations where we
want<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.800> conform<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> environment<00:00:39.180> or

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
want to conform to the environment or

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.049 
want to conform to the environment or
squeeze<00:00:39.809> through<00:00:40.140> tight<00:00:40.500> spaces<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:41.850> also

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
squeeze through tight spaces but we also

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.840 
squeeze through tight spaces but we also
would<00:00:42.809> need<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.379> rigid<00:00:43.620> but<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.550> need<00:00:44.700> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
would need it to be rigid but we need to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.000 
would need it to be rigid but we need to
apply<00:00:45.120> loads<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.840> environment<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
apply loads on the environment so that

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
apply loads on the environment so that
we<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.309> adequately<00:00:47.670> push<00:00:48.210> against<00:00:48.719> objects

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
we can adequately push against objects

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.020 
we can adequately push against objects
and<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.620> sort<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.890> thing<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.879> were

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
and that sort of thing so what we were

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000 
and that sort of thing so what we were
looking<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.420> was<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> material<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.800> could

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
looking for was a material that could

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.670 
looking for was a material that could
shift<00:00:53.430> between<00:00:53.789> soft<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.660> hard<00:00:54.780> states<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
shift between soft and hard states so

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.260 
shift between soft and hard states so
what<00:00:55.800> you're<00:00:55.949> looking<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> soft

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
what you're looking at here is a soft

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.599 
what you're looking at here is a soft
scaffold<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.350> foam<00:00:58.590> that's<00:00:58.949> been<00:00:59.129> coated<00:00:59.399> in

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
scaffold of foam that's been coated in

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.270 
scaffold of foam that's been coated in
wax<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.210> when<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> wax<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.320> heated<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.129> get

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
wax and when the wax is heated you get

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.219 
wax and when the wax is heated you get
the<00:01:02.399> soft<00:01:02.640> structure<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.359> when<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> wax<00:01:03.870> is

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the soft structure and when the wax is

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.390 
the soft structure and when the wax is
resolidify

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
resolidify

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.960 
resolidify
it<00:01:05.700> regains<00:01:06.090> at<00:01:06.270> rigidity<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.890> imagine<00:01:08.700> if

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it regains at rigidity so imagine if

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.240 
it regains at rigidity so imagine if
your<00:01:09.390> components<00:01:10.080> were<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:10.409> compliant<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
your components were more compliant and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.090 
your components were more compliant and
perhaps<00:01:11.750> increase<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.960> robots<00:01:13.320> capabilities

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
perhaps increase the robots capabilities

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700 
perhaps increase the robots capabilities
so<00:01:14.460> for<00:01:14.760> example<00:01:15.210> if<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.540> wanted<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.049> use<00:01:16.259> this

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
so for example if you wanted to use this

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.539 
so for example if you wanted to use this
composite<00:01:17.570> foam<00:01:18.570> wax<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.920> has<00:01:20.100> tunable

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
composite foam wax that has tunable

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.370 
composite foam wax that has tunable
stiffness<00:01:20.970> properties<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.869> make<00:01:22.080> some

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
stiffness properties to make some

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.590 
stiffness properties to make some
autonomous<00:01:23.040> robot<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.939> control<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.360> shape

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
autonomous robot or to control the shape

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.590 
autonomous robot or to control the shape
of<00:01:24.780> robot<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.310> different<00:01:26.880> segments

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
of robot you can have different segments

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.039 
of robot you can have different segments
of<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.110> foam<00:01:28.530> coated<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.040> wax<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
of the foam coated and wax and

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.870 
of the foam coated and wax and
selectively<00:01:31.049> change<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.040> stiffness<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.640> them

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
selectively change the stiffness of them

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.960 
selectively change the stiffness of them
so<00:01:33.180> let's<00:01:33.450> say<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.799> three<00:01:35.369> segments

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
so let's say if you have three segments

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.999 
so let's say if you have three segments
and<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.180> wanted<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.170> bend<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.770> middle

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
and you wanted to just bend the middle

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.310 
and you wanted to just bend the middle
one<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.520> keep<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> outer<00:01:39.420> two<00:01:39.689> segments

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
one you keep the outer two segments

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.590 
one you keep the outer two segments
rigid<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.070> cold<00:01:41.340> state<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.360> heat<00:01:42.570> up

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
rigid in the cold state and you heat up

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.389 
rigid in the cold state and you heat up
the<00:01:42.720> middle<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.649> softens<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the middle one so that it softens and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.359 
the middle one so that it softens and
you<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.640> bend<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.659> example<00:01:46.140> by<00:01:46.380> pulling<00:01:47.130> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you can bend it for example by pulling a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.060 
you can bend it for example by pulling a
string<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> cable<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.380> goes<00:01:49.409> down<00:01:49.860> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
string or a cable that goes down the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.160 
string or a cable that goes down the
length<00:01:50.250> just<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.820> bend<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.720> of

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
length just to bend that one and of

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.630 
length just to bend that one and of
course<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> want<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.979> shape<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.549> that

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
course if you want that shape or that

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.460
