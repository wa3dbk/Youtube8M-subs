actual holder of the tube itself I want
to<00:00:18.320> explain<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:19.190> what's<00:00:19.850> unique<00:00:20.270> about<00:00:20.390> this

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
to explain and what's unique about this

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.470 
to explain and what's unique about this
tube<00:00:21.410> is<00:00:21.650> this<00:00:22.040> ratchet<00:00:22.610> system<00:00:22.790> has<00:00:23.210> on<00:00:23.360> the

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
tube is this ratchet system has on the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.960 
tube is this ratchet system has on the
side<00:00:23.750> here<00:00:24.200> which<00:00:24.770> allows<00:00:25.130> you<00:00:25.340> to<00:00:25.460> tilt<00:00:25.760> this

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
side here which allows you to tilt this

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.840 
side here which allows you to tilt this
qu<00:00:26.360> forward<00:00:26.990> and<00:00:27.140> back<00:00:27.350> and<00:00:27.800> that's<00:00:28.130> common<00:00:28.550> to

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
qu forward and back and that's common to

this<00:00:37.310> post<00:00:38.239> here<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.870> different<00:00:39.739> throughout

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
this post here is different throughout

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.270 
this post here is different throughout
the<00:00:40.700> 3-1<00:00:41.180> series<00:00:41.510> but<00:00:42.230> this<00:00:42.380> top<00:00:42.649> cradle<00:00:43.160> and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
the 3-1 series but this top cradle and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.220 
the 3-1 series but this top cradle and
ratchet<00:00:43.670> system<00:00:44.000> right<00:00:44.360> here<00:00:44.750> is<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.649> same

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
ratchet system right here is the same

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.299 
ratchet system right here is the same
there<00:00:48.230> is<00:00:48.260> a<00:00:48.410> wrap<00:00:48.829> our<00:00:49.760> AP<00:00:50.239> -<00:00:50.570> 1<00:00:51.350> 1<00:00:51.500> 9<00:00:51.829> series

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
there is a wrap our AP - 1 1 9 series

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.090 
there is a wrap our AP - 1 1 9 series
which<00:00:52.730> is<00:00:52.880> the<00:00:52.910> exact<00:00:53.360> same<00:00:53.630> tube<00:00:54.110> except<00:00:54.980> on

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
which is the exact same tube except on

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.729 
which is the exact same tube except on
the<00:00:55.190> bottom<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.760> a<00:00:56.090> one<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.260> half<00:00:57.290> inch

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
the bottom is a one and a half inch

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.950 
the bottom is a one and a half inch
socket<00:00:58.460> for<00:00:58.850> mounting<00:00:59.300> so<00:00:59.719> it<00:00:59.809> actually

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
socket for mounting so it actually

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.869 
socket for mounting so it actually
mounts<00:01:00.500> from<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.739> bottom<00:01:01.129> rather<00:01:01.460> than<00:01:01.760> the

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
mounts from the bottom rather than the

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.719 
mounts from the bottom rather than the
side<00:01:02.090> like<00:01:02.360> this<00:01:02.510> one<00:01:02.719> here<00:01:03.020> so<00:01:03.920> what<00:01:04.579> you'll

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
side like this one here so what you'll

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.370 
side like this one here so what you'll
see<00:01:04.759> here<00:01:05.119> though<00:01:05.299> is<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.840> mounting<00:01:06.170> tube

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
see here though is is the mounting tube

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.709 
see here though is is the mounting tube
itself<00:01:06.770> is<00:01:06.920> about<00:01:07.130> 10<00:01:07.399> inches<00:01:07.729> long<00:01:07.759> or<00:01:08.270> it's

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
itself is about 10 inches long or it's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.779 
itself is about 10 inches long or it's
10<00:01:08.959> inches<00:01:09.259> from<00:01:09.499> inside<00:01:09.950> here<00:01:10.159> measured<00:01:10.609> down

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
10 inches from inside here measured down

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:12.849 
10 inches from inside here measured down
to<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.119> inside<00:01:11.359> so<00:01:11.600> overall<00:01:12.380> is<00:01:12.469> about<00:01:12.499> 10

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
to the inside so overall is about 10

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.190 
to the inside so overall is about 10
inches<00:01:12.889> long<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.670> has<00:01:14.090> two<00:01:14.329> grooves<00:01:14.689> here

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
inches long it has two grooves here

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.160 
inches long it has two grooves here
which<00:01:15.619> is<00:01:15.770> actually<00:01:16.100> designed<00:01:16.219> for<00:01:16.729> your<00:01:17.170> real

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
which is actually designed for your real

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.769 
which is actually designed for your real
and<00:01:18.409> your<00:01:18.469> fishing<00:01:18.889> rod<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.459> actual<00:01:19.880> arm<00:01:20.479> on

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:20.779 
and your fishing rod the actual arm on

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.590 
and your fishing rod the actual arm on
the<00:01:20.869> reel<00:01:21.109> to<00:01:21.319> slide<00:01:22.159> into<00:01:22.340> if<00:01:22.729> your<00:01:23.029> rods<00:01:23.359> not

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
the reel to slide into if your rods not

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.809 
the reel to slide into if your rods not
too<00:01:23.810> long<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.009> have<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.369> fishing<00:01:25.549> right<00:01:25.789> here

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
too long so I have a fishing right here

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.629 
too long so I have a fishing right here
and<00:01:26.509> what<00:01:26.749> you<00:01:26.869> just<00:01:26.929> need<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.469> do<00:01:27.679> is<00:01:27.920> just

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
and what you just need to do is just

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:32.019 
and what you just need to do is just
place<00:01:28.999> smack-bang<00:01:29.899> into<00:01:30.740> that<00:01:30.979> rod<00:01:31.670> holder

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:32.029 
place smack-bang into that rod holder

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:32.589 
place smack-bang into that rod holder
like<00:01:32.209> that

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:32.599 
like that

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:35.679 
like that
as<00:01:33.079> you<00:01:33.289> can<00:01:33.380> see<00:01:33.590> my<00:01:33.829> my<00:01:34.609> bottom<00:01:35.329> part<00:01:35.509> of<00:01:35.599> my

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
as you can see my my bottom part of my

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.109 
as you can see my my bottom part of my
rod<00:01:35.929> is<00:01:36.049> longer<00:01:36.529> than<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.859> tube<00:01:37.159> so<00:01:37.520> it

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
rod is longer than the tube so it

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.209 
rod is longer than the tube so it
actually<00:01:38.509> won't<00:01:38.659> fit<00:01:39.319> the<00:01:39.529> reel

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
actually won't fit the reel

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.120 
actually won't fit the reel
this<00:01:40.969> reel<00:01:41.240> neck<00:01:41.479> into<00:01:41.779> the<00:01:42.109> groove<00:01:42.469> but

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
this reel neck into the groove but

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.159 
this reel neck into the groove but
that's<00:01:43.310> okay<00:01:43.759> as<00:01:43.969> I<00:01:44.029> said<00:01:44.450> if<00:01:44.779> you<00:01:44.929> want<00:01:45.139> to

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:45.169 
that's okay as I said if you want to

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:48.519 
that's okay as I said if you want to
tilt<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:46.569> it's<00:01:47.569> just<00:01:47.749> as<00:01:47.869> simple<00:01:48.200> as<00:01:48.289> turning

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:48.529 
tilt this it's just as simple as turning

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:50.620 
tilt this it's just as simple as turning
and<00:01:49.069> there's<00:01:49.399> teeth<00:01:49.669> in<00:01:49.880> here<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:50.359> allow<00:01:50.569> you

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
and there's teeth in here that allow you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.749 
and there's teeth in here that allow you
to<00:01:50.749> just<00:01:51.020> move<00:01:51.200> this<00:01:51.469> and<00:01:52.009> then<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.520> teeth

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
to just move this and then the teeth

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.809 
to just move this and then the teeth
just<00:01:52.789> connected<00:01:53.569> in<00:01:53.719> to<00:01:54.499> whatever<00:01:55.159> angle<00:01:55.490> you

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
just connected in to whatever angle you

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.300 
just connected in to whatever angle you
want<00:01:56.029> and<00:01:56.329> that's<00:01:57.020> it<00:01:57.409> there's<00:01:57.709> not<00:01:57.829> a<00:01:57.889> lot<00:01:58.069> to

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
want and that's it there's not a lot to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.629 
want and that's it there's not a lot to
this<00:01:58.489> it<00:01:59.090> is<00:01:59.270> made<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.810> a<00:02:00.639> high-strength

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639 
this it is made of a high-strength

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.330 
this it is made of a high-strength
plastic<00:02:02.539> composite<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:03.649> it's<00:02:03.770> actually<00:02:04.069> very

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
plastic composite so it's actually very

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.120 
plastic composite so it's actually very
very<00:02:04.549> durable<00:02:05.289> even<00:02:06.289> though<00:02:06.499> it's<00:02:06.649> plastic

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
very durable even though it's plastic

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.330 
very durable even though it's plastic
but<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.429> plastic<00:02:07.609> keeps<00:02:07.939> a<00:02:08.060> price<00:02:08.360> down<00:02:08.660> and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
but the plastic keeps a price down and

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.180 
but the plastic keeps a price down and
still<00:02:10.340> keeps<00:02:10.700> its<00:02:11.470> lifetime<00:02:12.470> warranty<00:02:12.980> like

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
still keeps its lifetime warranty like

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.070 
still keeps its lifetime warranty like
Ram

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
Ram

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.230 
Ram
so<00:02:15.080> there<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.320> have<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.530> that's<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.400> RAM<00:02:16.610> -<00:02:16.970> a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
so there you have it that's the RAM - a

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.550 
so there you have it that's the RAM - a
