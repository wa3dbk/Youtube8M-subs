00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
okay so we have this thing outside got

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.820 
okay so we have this thing outside got
two<00:01:15.840> connected<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.200> an<00:01:16.320> external<00:01:16.350> power

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
two connected to an external power

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.700 
two connected to an external power
supply<00:01:17.570> we<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> actually<00:01:18.930> turn<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.380> pc

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
supply we have to actually turn the pc

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.899 
supply we have to actually turn the pc
on<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> i'll<00:01:21.390> try<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> power<00:01:21.840> supply<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:25.909> we

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
on so i'll try to power supply on and we

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.780 
on so i'll try to power supply on and we
will<00:01:29.479> fire<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.750> up<00:01:31.310> alright<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.579> ready

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
will fire that up alright so it's ready

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.620 
will fire that up alright so it's ready
the<00:01:33.180> pc<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:33.990> booting<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.420> will

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the pc is actually booting and we will

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.780 
the pc is actually booting and we will
prep<00:01:38.479> rocket<00:01:39.479> number<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:40.130> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.369> back

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
prep rocket number one you can see back

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.380 
prep rocket number one you can see back
here<00:01:43.280> silo<00:01:44.280> number<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.640> does<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.090> rocket

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
here silo number one does have a rocket

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.830

at<00:01:45.649> those<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> alligator<00:01:47.159> clips<00:01:47.780> kind<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
at those the alligator clips kind of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.859 
at those the alligator clips kind of
connected<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.470> ignition<00:01:52.100> alright<00:01:53.100> so

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
connected to the ignition alright so

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.319
