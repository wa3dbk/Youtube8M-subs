although the front axle and is loose in

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.300 
although the front axle and is loose in
terms<00:03:21.079> of<00:03:21.200> its<00:03:21.319> steering<00:03:21.769> so<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.040> wants<00:03:22.220> to

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
terms of its steering so it wants to

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.580 
terms of its steering so it wants to
keep<00:03:22.459> steering<00:03:22.849> different<00:03:23.299> directions<00:03:23.780> the

keep steering different directions the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.890 
keep steering different directions the
rear<00:03:24.950> axles<00:03:25.370> don't<00:03:25.609> have<00:03:25.849> working<00:03:26.720> suspension

but<00:03:27.379> a<00:03:27.410> little<00:03:27.590> bit<00:03:27.709> of<00:03:27.799> play<00:03:27.980> in<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.190> mechanism

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
but a little bit of play in a mechanism

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:30.759 
but a little bit of play in a mechanism
and<00:03:28.910> there<00:03:29.269> were<00:03:29.329> continuous<00:03:29.629> axle<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:30.500> all

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
and there were continuous axle so all

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.089 
and there were continuous axle so all
the<00:03:30.950> wheels<00:03:31.160> turn<00:03:31.400> when<00:03:31.579> you<00:03:31.670> spin<00:03:31.879> them<00:03:32.060> the

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
the wheels turn when you spin them the

the wheels turn when you spin them the
steering<00:03:34.099> angle<00:03:34.459> is<00:03:34.670> reasonable<00:03:35.239> although<00:03:35.480> it

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
steering angle is reasonable although it

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.710 
steering angle is reasonable although it
does<00:03:35.959> foul<00:03:36.290> at<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.890> extremities<00:03:37.430> if<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.540> set

does foul at the extremities if you set

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.979 
does foul at the extremities if you set
the<00:03:38.840> steering<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:40.790> can<00:03:41.030> push<00:03:41.359> it<00:03:41.510> along<00:03:41.599> but

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
the steering you can push it along but

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.690 
the steering you can push it along but
the<00:03:42.319> wheels<00:03:42.500> keep<00:03:42.980> wanting<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.280> go<00:03:43.519> their<00:03:43.670> own

the<00:04:01.579> trailer<00:04:01.819> it's<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.269> fairly<00:04:02.870> basic<00:04:03.590> and

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
the trailer it's a fairly basic and

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.879 
the trailer it's a fairly basic and
simple<00:04:04.069> affair<00:04:04.549> Lee<00:04:05.349> wheels<00:04:06.349> turn<00:04:06.680> very

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:06.889 
simple affair Lee wheels turn very

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.289 
simple affair Lee wheels turn very
easily<00:04:07.010> there<00:04:07.459> on<00:04:07.810> common<00:04:08.810> axles<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:10.120> at<00:04:11.120> the

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
easily there on common axles and at the

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.449 
easily there on common axles and at the
front<00:04:11.569> you've<00:04:12.139> got<00:04:12.169> the<00:04:12.590> loading<00:04:12.980> ramps<00:04:13.280> which

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
front you've got the loading ramps which

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.339 
front you've got the loading ramps which
just<00:04:13.760> go<00:04:13.970> up<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.239> down<00:04:14.299> and<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.690> gooseneck<00:04:14.900> is

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
just go up and down and the gooseneck is

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.300 
just go up and down and the gooseneck is
also<00:04:15.970> hinged<00:04:16.970> with<00:04:17.090> quite<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.019> lot<00:04:18.169> of<00:04:18.310> movement

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
also hinged with quite a lot of movement

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.029 
also hinged with quite a lot of movement
possible<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:21.049> can<00:04:21.169> also<00:04:21.289> detach<00:04:21.859> the

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
possible and you can also detach the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.040 
possible and you can also detach the
gooseneck<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:23.330> way<00:04:23.449> to<00:04:23.510> do<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:23.870> is

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
gooseneck and the way to do that is

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.170 
gooseneck and the way to do that is
there's<00:04:24.229> a<00:04:24.260> kind<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.800> a<00:04:24.949> little<00:04:25.639> clip<00:04:25.910> that<00:04:25.940> you

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
there's a kind of a little clip that you

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.300 
there's a kind of a little clip that you
twist<00:04:26.479> and<00:04:26.810> then<00:04:27.560> you<00:04:27.650> have<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.889> push<00:04:28.070> through

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
twist and then you have to push through

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.250 
twist and then you have to push through
to<00:04:28.610> release<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:29.150> gooseneck<00:04:29.360> but<00:04:29.930> because<00:04:30.229> of

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
to release the gooseneck but because of

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.310 
to release the gooseneck but because of
I<00:04:30.590> think<00:04:30.860> paint<00:04:31.099> thicknesses<00:04:31.780> it's<00:04:32.780> very<00:04:33.050> very

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
I think paint thicknesses it's very very

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.439 
I think paint thicknesses it's very very
stiff<00:04:33.650> so<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.760> thing<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:34.970> do<00:04:35.030> is<00:04:35.090> just<00:04:35.270> to<00:04:35.330> put

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
stiff so the thing to do is just to put

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.390 
stiff so the thing to do is just to put
something<00:04:35.750> across<00:04:35.900> and<00:04:36.229> apply<00:04:37.070> some<00:04:37.099> pressure

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
something across and apply some pressure

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.250 
something across and apply some pressure
and<00:04:38.150> then<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.479> pops<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.740> gooseneck<00:04:39.949> off<00:04:40.340> and

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
and then that pops the gooseneck off and

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.589 
and then that pops the gooseneck off and
then<00:04:42.260> you've<00:04:42.380> got<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.620> trailer<00:04:43.010> ready<00:04:43.729> to<00:04:44.150> be

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
then you've got the trailer ready to be

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.379 
then you've got the trailer ready to be
loaded<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.440> can<00:04:45.620> just<00:04:45.800> load<00:04:45.949> the<00:04:46.389> ramps

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
loaded and you can just load the ramps

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.260 
loaded and you can just load the ramps
down<00:04:47.449> put<00:04:47.900> them<00:04:47.990> down<00:04:48.169> and<00:04:48.940> get<00:04:49.940> your<00:04:50.030> nearest

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270
