 new video and I'm with a new video 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.299
 of gta 5 a pretty good cliche 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.420
 pretty good that is to go through 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.509
 walls of a good local the local is 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.600

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.910
 from Michael's car park and good 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.220
 let's go there and now see you 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.220
 good kids once here you see that 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.970
 we are here in the same I show it in 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.100
 the map 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.600
 just in front of the parking lot in 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.879
 the opposite sidewalk, we'll see its 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.460
 local now I will show you and good as 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.589
 you see here the garage and we are in the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.530
 northern part of the map just let's say with 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:47.980
 the part of the center up and as 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.190
 you see here is the garage is worth 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.890
 good as now you will see is at 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.140
 right of michael's house as you see 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.750
 here is Michael's house and here it is 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.180
 the garage because right in front is worth and 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.030
 well the method to enter with them is 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.380
 can enter through this door here and 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.030
 through this door from here to the side 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.539
 and it's very simple we just have to 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.439
 get closer to square 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.570
 playstation and the X if I do not 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.370
 I'm wrong in xbox and good 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.320
 you will ask what we can do 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.960
 we can not be here inside 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.930
 you can do a lot but if you can 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.300
 enter with a motorbike then show 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.940
 the process and good to get out is what 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.670
 You have to jump and good by here 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.230
 it's very very very simple and to go back to 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.240
 enter the same thing all the time yes 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.190
 the other door, as you can teach 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.550
 now it's going to be just the same thing what 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.860
 only thing we have to do is jump and 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.800
 then jump back inside and it's 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.510
 then there is a method also that is this 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.420
 that you can also enter 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.150
 with the bikes that is good this part 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.680
 is here if it can be transferred or is it 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.450
 how to jump but you do not have to 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.820
 let's jump we just walk up 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.950
 here and boom we go out and to 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.680
 enter by the same we can enter 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.300
 inside maybe and good guys if 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.399
 you want to pass this as so 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.350
 you can transfer with a botillo and good 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.230
 power is doing virguerÃ­as by the 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.360
 motorcycle interval and that's all I hope that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.820
 you liked it like like favorites and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.820

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.820

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.680
