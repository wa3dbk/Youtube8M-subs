00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980 
been updated I think a little bit but
pretty<00:02:04.770> much<00:02:04.829> still<00:02:05.280> look<00:02:05.520> like<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.360> I

will<00:02:07.049> say<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:07.950> probably<00:02:08.099> one<00:02:08.310> of<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
will say this was probably one of the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.850 
will say this was probably one of the
most<00:02:08.670> dramatic<00:02:08.910> things<00:02:09.780> yeah<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> pickups

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
most dramatic things yeah the pickups

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.350 
most dramatic things yeah the pickups
were<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.039> big<00:02:11.220> change<00:02:11.459> but<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.879> way<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.180> it

that way when I break a string the
bridge<00:03:37.799> isn't<00:03:37.980> floating<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.639> it<00:03:38.730> doesn't<00:03:38.970> go

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
bridge isn't floating so it doesn't go

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.270

locking tuner idea you know you tighten
these<00:04:15.840> down<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.500> then<00:04:16.979> as<00:04:17.099> soon<00:04:17.130> as<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.609> start

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.820 
tuning it after like one or two turns it
actually<00:04:21.419> just<00:04:21.570> cuts<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.049> string<00:04:22.289> for<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.620> so

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
change the switch with time which is

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:57.239 
change the switch with time which is
really<00:04:55.749> an<00:04:55.990> easy<00:04:56.110> thing<00:04:56.379> to<00:04:56.529> do<00:04:56.650> they<00:04:56.919> go<00:04:57.069> bad

00:04:57.239 --> 00:04:57.249 
really an easy thing to do they go bad

00:04:57.249 --> 00:05:00.179

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.249 
over time and I have also changed all
the<00:05:00.279> potentiometers<00:05:01.029> in<00:05:01.180> here<00:05:01.419> but<00:05:02.020> you<00:05:02.139> know

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
the potentiometers in here but you know

the potentiometers in here but you know
like<00:05:03.009> I<00:05:03.159> was<00:05:03.279> saying<00:05:03.430> before<00:05:03.460> it's<00:05:03.849> really

easy<00:05:04.569> really<00:05:05.199> fun<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.099> what<00:05:06.250> you<00:05:06.340> end<00:05:06.370> up<00:05:06.610> with

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
easy really fun and what you end up with

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.179 
easy really fun and what you end up with
is<00:05:06.849> like<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.150> really<00:05:07.360> i<00:05:07.840> don't<00:05:08.830> know<00:05:08.919> sort<00:05:09.159> of

is like a really i don't know sort of
like<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.340> personal<00:05:09.909> connection<00:05:10.150> with<00:05:10.449> your

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:10.689 
like a personal connection with your

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.050 
like a personal connection with your
instrument<00:05:11.289> and<00:05:11.439> it<00:05:11.590> really<00:05:11.939> makes<00:05:12.939> a

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
instrument and it really makes a

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.029 
instrument and it really makes a
difference<00:05:13.090> when<00:05:13.659> i<00:05:13.689> play<00:05:13.990> this<00:05:14.349> guitar<00:05:14.560> I

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
difference when i play this guitar I

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.029 
difference when i play this guitar I
feel<00:05:15.759> something<00:05:16.029> different<00:05:16.569> I<00:05:16.779> love<00:05:17.560> metallic

a<00:05:34.389> really<00:05:34.539> fun<00:05:35.169> you<00:05:35.500> know<00:05:35.740> afternoon<00:05:36.400> project

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
a really fun you know afternoon project

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:39.390 
a really fun you know afternoon project
and<00:05:37.029> over<00:05:37.810> time<00:05:38.139> all<00:05:38.620> these<00:05:39.099> little

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
and over time all these little

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.149 
and over time all these little
differences<00:05:40.000> that<00:05:40.270> you<00:05:40.449> make<00:05:40.949> well<00:05:41.949> you<00:05:42.069> know

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
differences that you make well you know

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:43.950 
differences that you make well you know
the<00:05:42.279> compounding<00:05:42.849> factor<00:05:43.210> is<00:05:43.389> suddenly<00:05:43.750> you

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
the compounding factor is suddenly you

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.990 
the compounding factor is suddenly you
know<00:05:44.080> after<00:05:44.469> a<00:05:44.710> lot<00:05:45.129> of<00:05:45.250> time<00:05:45.430> of<00:05:45.610> changing

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
know after a lot of time of changing

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.279 
know after a lot of time of changing
stuff<00:05:46.210> there<00:05:46.659> will<00:05:46.839> be<00:05:46.870> a<00:05:47.020> dramatic

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
stuff there will be a dramatic

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.579 
stuff there will be a dramatic
difference<00:05:47.949> in<00:05:48.399> the<00:05:48.669> tone<00:05:49.289> now<00:05:50.289> all<00:05:50.529> that

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:50.589 
difference in the tone now all that

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:52.980 
difference in the tone now all that
being<00:05:51.550> said<00:05:51.699> if<00:05:52.210> you're<00:05:52.360> sort<00:05:52.659> of<00:05:52.719> just

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
being said if you're sort of just

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.179 
being said if you're sort of just
sitting<00:05:53.169> there<00:05:53.199> going<00:05:53.379> well<00:05:53.680> geez<00:05:53.919> I<00:05:54.039> don't

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:54.189 
sitting there going well geez I don't

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:56.579 
sitting there going well geez I don't
even<00:05:54.279> know<00:05:54.490> where<00:05:54.669> to<00:05:54.699> start<00:05:54.789> with<00:05:55.240> my<00:05:55.449> tone<00:05:55.750> or

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:56.589 
even know where to start with my tone or

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.079 
even know where to start with my tone or
if<00:05:56.800> you<00:05:56.919> don't<00:05:57.039> like<00:05:57.159> your<00:05:57.430> tone<00:05:57.460> if<00:05:57.759> you're

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:58.089 
if you don't like your tone if you're

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:59.279 
if you don't like your tone if you're
trying<00:05:58.240> to<00:05:58.330> figure<00:05:58.599> out<00:05:58.689> how<00:05:58.750> to<00:05:58.810> beef<00:05:59.050> it<00:05:59.259> up

00:05:59.279 --> 00:05:59.289 
trying to figure out how to beef it up

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.939 
trying to figure out how to beef it up
like<00:06:00.069> most<00:06:00.279> people<00:06:00.639> I<00:06:00.990> recommend<00:06:01.990> starting

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:02.949 
like most people I recommend starting

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.909 
like most people I recommend starting
with<00:06:03.129> changing<00:06:04.060> strings<00:06:04.569> use<00:06:05.409> a<00:06:05.439> heavier

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
with changing strings use a heavier

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.969 
with changing strings use a heavier
gauge<00:06:06.279> this<00:06:06.699> is<00:06:06.849> the<00:06:07.060> cheapest<00:06:07.839> easiest<00:06:08.080> way

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
gauge this is the cheapest easiest way

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.889 
gauge this is the cheapest easiest way
to<00:06:09.039> beef<00:06:09.310> up<00:06:09.460> your<00:06:09.520> tone<00:06:09.909> you<00:06:10.449> have<00:06:10.599> to<00:06:10.719> think

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:10.899 
to beef up your tone you have to think

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:12.329 
to beef up your tone you have to think
of<00:06:11.050> the<00:06:11.169> fact<00:06:11.319> that<00:06:11.500> you<00:06:11.680> know<00:06:11.710> all<00:06:12.009> these

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
of the fact that you know all these

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.339 
of the fact that you know all these
little<00:06:12.610> poles<00:06:12.909> on<00:06:13.210> these<00:06:13.479> pickups<00:06:13.930> are

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:14.349 
little poles on these pickups are

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:17.639 
little poles on these pickups are
emitting<00:06:14.919> a<00:06:15.009> small<00:06:15.399> magnetic<00:06:15.789> magnetic<00:06:16.649> field

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:17.649 
emitting a small magnetic magnetic field

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:20.730 
emitting a small magnetic magnetic field
so<00:06:18.370> if<00:06:18.580> you<00:06:18.759> put<00:06:19.270> on<00:06:19.389> bigger<00:06:19.719> strings<00:06:20.259> you<00:06:20.649> know

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
so if you put on bigger strings you know

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.980 
so if you put on bigger strings you know
heavier<00:06:21.069> strings<00:06:21.610> you<00:06:22.360> giving<00:06:22.839> those

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
heavier strings you giving those

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.990 
heavier strings you giving those
magnetic<00:06:23.649> fields<00:06:23.979> something<00:06:24.339> to<00:06:24.460> grab<00:06:24.639> on<00:06:24.939> to

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
magnetic fields something to grab on to

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.269 
magnetic fields something to grab on to
more<00:06:25.509> stuff<00:06:25.810> to<00:06:25.960> grab<00:06:26.139> on<00:06:26.319> to<00:06:26.500> you<00:06:26.649> so<00:06:26.830> you<00:06:26.889> get

00:06:27.269 --> 00:06:27.279 
more stuff to grab on to you so you get

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:29.490 
more stuff to grab on to you so you get
a<00:06:27.460> bigger<00:06:27.789> beefier<00:06:28.180> tone<00:06:28.689> like<00:06:29.229> if<00:06:29.319> you're<00:06:29.469> a

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
a bigger beefier tone like if you're a

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.040 
a bigger beefier tone like if you're a
Stevie<00:06:29.830> Ray<00:06:29.949> font<00:06:30.219> Stevie<00:06:30.909> Ray<00:06:31.120> Vaughan<00:06:31.449> fan

like I am he used 12 you know he's

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:37.110 
like I am he used 12 you know he's
twelves<00:06:35.860> on<00:06:35.979> his<00:06:36.099> guitars<00:06:36.459> if<00:06:36.879> you've<00:06:37.000> ever

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
played a strat with 12 on it it's like

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.600 
played a strat with 12 on it it's like
playing

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
playing

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.309 
playing
acoustic<00:06:40.030> guitar<00:06:40.060> with<00:06:40.479> heavy<00:06:40.750> strings<00:06:41.169> I

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
acoustic guitar with heavy strings I

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.290 
acoustic guitar with heavy strings I
mean<00:06:41.439> it's<00:06:41.560> a<00:06:41.650> really<00:06:41.860> challenging<00:06:42.639> thing<00:06:43.270> to

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
mean it's a really challenging thing to

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.070 
mean it's a really challenging thing to
do<00:06:43.509> but<00:06:43.689> that's<00:06:44.259> how<00:06:44.530> you<00:06:44.590> get<00:06:44.770> that<00:06:44.949> tone<00:06:46.080> all

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
do but that's how you get that tone all

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
pretty soon my taste has changed and my

style has changed a little bit and i

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.659 
style has changed a little bit and i
think<00:07:02.259> i'm<00:07:02.379> going<00:07:02.500> to<00:07:02.560> beef<00:07:02.770> it<00:07:02.919> up<00:07:03.009> but<00:07:03.550> yeah

just<00:07:03.909> changing<00:07:04.210> your<00:07:04.330> strengths<00:07:04.629> to<00:07:04.719> a

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:04.750 
just changing your strengths to a

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.050 
just changing your strengths to a
heavier<00:07:05.080> gauge<00:07:05.349> is<00:07:05.680> the<00:07:06.490> easiest<00:07:06.789> way<00:07:07.000> to

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:07.060 
heavier gauge is the easiest way to

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.499 
heavier gauge is the easiest way to
change<00:07:07.509> your<00:07:07.629> tone<00:07:07.860> so<00:07:08.860> um<00:07:09.189> i<00:07:10.030> think<00:07:10.150> that's
