00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
presented in groups of threes so I might

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.560 
presented in groups of threes so I might
put<00:00:51.989> three<00:00:52.590> daffodils<00:00:53.219> next<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.210> another

as I put them on a cake and I'm going to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
as I put them on a cake and I'm going to
use<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.270> fill<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:59.160> little

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
use it to fill in all of the little

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.779

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so that I don't see the part where it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.580 
so that I don't see the part where it
pierces<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> cake<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> other<00:01:07.020> side<00:01:07.409> I'll

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
try to arrange my tulips putting those

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.550 
try to arrange my tulips putting those
in<00:01:12.020> again<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.380> group<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.830> three<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.290> like

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
in again in a group of three and I like

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
in again in a group of three and I like
run<00:01:16.799> sugar<00:01:17.070> flowers<00:01:17.460> point<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.119> different

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
run sugar flowers point in different

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.760 
run sugar flowers point in different
directions<00:01:19.290> around<00:01:19.909> my<00:01:20.909> cake<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.869> way<00:01:22.200> when

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
directions around my cake this way when

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.179 
directions around my cake this way when
I<00:01:22.799> view<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.340> from<00:01:23.520> any<00:01:23.700> angle<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.860> see<00:01:25.860> all

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
I view it from any angle I can see all

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.190 
I view it from any angle I can see all
of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.549> different<00:01:26.970> flowers<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
of the different flowers we have a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
of the different flowers we have a
little<00:01:28.560> bit<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.770> flexibility<00:01:29.520> remember<00:01:30.060> when

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
little bit of flexibility remember when

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
little bit of flexibility remember when
we<00:01:30.360> were<00:01:30.479> creating<00:01:30.990> these<00:01:31.140> flowers<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
we were creating these flowers because a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.219 
we were creating these flowers because a
lot<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> these<00:01:32.909> petals<00:01:33.180> are<00:01:33.450> individually

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
lot of these petals are individually

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
lot of these petals are individually
wired<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> flexibility<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
wired so we do have the flexibility to

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.280 
wired so we do have the flexibility to
be<00:01:36.119> able<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.329> move<00:01:36.540> some<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> pieces

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
be able to move some of the pieces

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.920 
be able to move some of the pieces
around<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.369> need<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.640> now<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.540> all<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.810> the
