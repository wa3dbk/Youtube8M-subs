your entire head in small sections at a

your entire head in small sections at a
time

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.210 

like<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.510> said<00:02:11.570> I<00:02:11.780> usually<00:02:12.500> do<00:02:12.620> this<00:02:12.740> on<00:02:12.920> wet

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
like I said I usually do this on wet

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.650 
like I said I usually do this on wet
curly<00:02:13.670> hair<00:02:13.850> but<00:02:14.090> there's<00:02:14.270> definitely

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
curly hair but there's definitely

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.020 
curly hair but there's definitely
advantages<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.830> doing<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.340> dry<00:02:16.670> stretched

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
advantages to doing it on dry stretched

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.850 
advantages to doing it on dry stretched
hair<00:02:17.240> for<00:02:17.630> one<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.990> hair<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.260> completely

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
hair for one the hair is completely

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.770 
hair for one the hair is completely
stretched<00:02:19.190> so<00:02:19.670> you're<00:02:20.000> likely<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.420> cut<00:02:20.660> off

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
stretched so you're likely to cut off

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.690 
stretched so you're likely to cut off
less<00:02:21.080> hair<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.680> only<00:02:22.040> what's<00:02:22.220> needed

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
less hair and only what's needed

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.010 
less hair and only what's needed
whereas<00:02:23.060> with<00:02:23.210> wet<00:02:23.390> hair<00:02:23.570> you<00:02:23.750> might<00:02:23.900> be

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
whereas with wet hair you might be

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.050 
whereas with wet hair you might be
cutting<00:02:24.290> off<00:02:24.410> more<00:02:24.650> because<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.010> curls<00:02:25.520> also

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
cutting off more because it curls also

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.730 
cutting off more because it curls also
on<00:02:26.240> stretched<00:02:26.600> hair<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.990> damage<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.410> super

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
on stretched hair the damage is super

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.740 
on stretched hair the damage is super
visible<00:02:27.980> whereas<00:02:28.580> on<00:02:28.760> wet<00:02:29.000> hair<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.420> mostly

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
visible whereas on wet hair you mostly

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.870 
visible whereas on wet hair you mostly
go<00:02:29.990> by<00:02:30.020> feeling<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.710> damage<00:02:31.040> which<00:02:31.640> works

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
go by feeling the damage which works

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.450 
go by feeling the damage which works
well<00:02:32.150> but<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:32.660> great<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.290> feel<00:02:33.710> and<00:02:34.010> see<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
well but it's great to feel and see the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.760 
well but it's great to feel and see the
damage<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.940> you're<00:02:35.180> cutting<00:02:35.390> off<00:02:35.770> but

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
damage that you're cutting off but

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.680 
damage that you're cutting off but
cutting<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:37.160> wet<00:02:37.460> hair<00:02:37.490> is<00:02:38.030> also<00:02:38.270> great

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
cutting on wet hair is also great

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.930 
cutting on wet hair is also great
because<00:02:38.720> there's<00:02:39.470> no<00:02:39.560> heat<00:02:40.040> or<00:02:40.190> manipulation

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
because there's no heat or manipulation

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.580 
because there's no heat or manipulation
involved<00:02:41.570> so<00:02:41.810> they<00:02:42.050> both<00:02:42.170> have<00:02:42.410> their

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
involved so they both have their

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.770 
involved so they both have their
advantages<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:43.580> go<00:02:43.700> by<00:02:43.910> what<00:02:44.390> state<00:02:44.630> my

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
advantages I just go by what state my

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.260 
advantages I just go by what state my
hair<00:02:44.960> is<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.260> what<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.410> want<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.710> trim<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:45.950> so

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
hair is and what I want to trim it so

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.550 
hair is and what I want to trim it so
here's<00:02:47.270> a<00:02:47.330> quick<00:02:47.600> tip<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:47.870> getting<00:02:48.320> a<00:02:48.380> better

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
here's a quick tip to getting a better

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.560 
here's a quick tip to getting a better
angle<00:02:49.040> with<00:02:49.220> your<00:02:49.250> fingers<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:49.910> cut<00:02:50.210> your<00:02:50.420> hair

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
angle with your fingers to cut your hair

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.330 
angle with your fingers to cut your hair
in<00:02:50.660> layers<00:02:50.870> when<00:02:51.770> you're<00:02:51.890> combing<00:02:52.100> the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
in layers when you're combing the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.700 
in layers when you're combing the
section<00:02:52.760> comb<00:02:53.120> from<00:02:53.420> underneath<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.320> section

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
section comb from underneath the section

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.290 
section comb from underneath the section
so<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.070> the<00:02:55.250> hair<00:02:55.400> will<00:02:55.550> naturally<00:02:55.790> flip

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
so that the hair will naturally flip

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.060 
so that the hair will naturally flip
outward<00:02:56.750> into<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.260> right<00:02:57.410> direction

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
outward into the right direction

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.070 
outward into the right direction
with<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.460> hair<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.880> back<00:02:59.180> as<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.660> longest

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
with the hair in the back as the longest

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.050 
with the hair in the back as the longest
layers<00:03:00.320> if<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:00.920> comb<00:03:01.070> on<00:03:01.220> top<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.700> section

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
layers if you comb on top of the section

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.610 
layers if you comb on top of the section
rather<00:03:02.300> than<00:03:02.630> from<00:03:02.750> underneath<00:03:03.230> you're<00:03:03.530> gonna

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
rather than from underneath you're gonna

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.650 
rather than from underneath you're gonna
have<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.860> angle<00:03:04.220> your<00:03:04.250> hand<00:03:04.670> all<00:03:04.940> weirdly<00:03:05.540> to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
have to angle your hand all weirdly to

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.450 
have to angle your hand all weirdly to
get<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.900> angles<00:03:06.260> right<00:03:06.470> it's<00:03:06.890> just<00:03:07.070> easier<00:03:07.430> to

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
get the angles right it's just easier to

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.890 
get the angles right it's just easier to
comb<00:03:07.730> from<00:03:07.880> underneath<00:03:08.210> and<00:03:08.450> flip<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.780> hair

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
comb from underneath and flip the hair
