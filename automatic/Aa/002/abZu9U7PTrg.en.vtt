there's a 7 day supply there so that's

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.970

to<00:02:30.129> test<00:02:30.310> out<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.489> product<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.000> see<00:02:31.150> what<00:02:31.299> you

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
to test out a product and see what you

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.720 
to test out a product and see what you
think<00:02:31.569> I<00:02:32.129> wonder<00:02:33.129> how<00:02:33.250> much<00:02:33.370> some<00:02:33.579> of<00:02:33.670> these

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
think I wonder how much some of these

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.309 
think I wonder how much some of these
full-size<00:02:34.209> items<00:02:34.540> cost<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:34.989> bet<00:02:35.140> they're

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
full-size items cost I bet they're

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.280 
full-size items cost I bet they're
really<00:02:35.889> really<00:02:36.069> expensive<00:02:36.480> so<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:38.049> may<00:02:38.230> be

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
really really expensive so this may be

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.410 
really really expensive so this may be
the<00:02:38.439> only<00:02:38.590> time<00:02:38.980> I'd<00:02:39.099> ever<00:02:39.129> get<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:39.579> try<00:02:39.939> items

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
the only time I'd ever get to try items

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.319 
the only time I'd ever get to try items
that<00:02:40.599> are<00:02:40.689> dis<00:02:41.099> high-end<00:02:42.099> because<00:02:42.609> you<00:02:43.209> know

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
that are dis high-end because you know

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.990 
that are dis high-end because you know
if<00:02:43.420> some<00:02:43.599> of<00:02:43.629> these<00:02:43.750> are<00:02:43.930> $100<00:02:44.620> or<00:02:44.829> more<00:02:45.000> full

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
don't really need a whole lot so I

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:08.939 
don't really need a whole lot so I
should<00:04:07.239> think<00:04:07.479> I<00:04:07.599> should<00:04:07.810> be<00:04:08.409> able<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.680> use

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.499 
should think I should be able to use
this<00:04:09.099> for<00:04:09.280> at<00:04:09.340> least<00:04:09.430> a<00:04:09.579> few<00:04:09.609> weeks<00:04:09.849> and<00:04:10.329> get<00:04:10.479> a

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:10.509 
this for at least a few weeks and get a

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:13.710 
this for at least a few weeks and get a
good<00:04:10.870> idea<00:04:11.109> of<00:04:11.379> what<00:04:11.530> it's<00:04:11.680> like<00:04:11.919> and<00:04:12.720> then

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
good idea of what it's like and then

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.379 
good idea of what it's like and then
this<00:04:13.840> next<00:04:14.909> one<00:04:15.909> it<00:04:16.150> says<00:04:16.590> caviar<00:04:17.969> CC<00:04:18.969> cream

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
this next one it says caviar CC cream

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.909 
this next one it says caviar CC cream
but<00:04:19.719> actually<00:04:19.989> looks<00:04:20.109> like<00:04:20.200> it's<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.409> white<00:04:20.620> and

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
but actually looks like it's a white and

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.360 
but actually looks like it's a white and
I<00:04:21.099> always<00:04:21.459> think<00:04:21.760> of<00:04:21.820> CC

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
I always think of CC

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.850 
I always think of CC
as<00:04:22.550> being<00:04:22.790> kind<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:23.900> makeup<00:04:24.169> but<00:04:24.590> I<00:04:24.650> guess
