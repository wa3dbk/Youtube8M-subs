00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.000
 this new phenomenon came from Japan 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:51.870
 children would almost forget about it 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.300

 remember all the names of the characters 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:23.680
 to recognize we are going we would like 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.680
 see this in conjugation in mathematics 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.789
 on the suppliers' side we are rubbing 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.470
 hands

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.110
 maximum product availability have 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.429

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.610
 the most expensive at all 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.990
 in Japan where the game was born there are four 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.370
 years the phenomenon today takes a 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.500
 considerable magnitude 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.780

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.240
 to control the crowd 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.290
 today pokemon globally 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.340
 represents a global turnover 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.510
 $ 7 billion 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.870
 this turnover is growing 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.340
 constant since there is a launch in 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.920
