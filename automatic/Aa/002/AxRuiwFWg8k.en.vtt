00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.269
 in the chalk subtle touch I myself went 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.340
 banon interference in the long 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.440
 denied and difficult with the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.180
 old is more so old, little bit these 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.920
 cimed plays every day here with 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.080
 this heat you pay a high but it is a 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.400
 good football and I think the same pleasure 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.600

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.769

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.480
 people on television and today is here 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.710
 close but with the result that less 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.300
 I do not even think the important thing is 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.219
 to be here with the people to know 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.790
 cuiabá maiden island good come back here from 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.670
 new 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.770
 Gilmar, my son talks to you at 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 facebook spoke of the day eduardo grosso 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.420
 He has talked game April and spoke cuiabá 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.730
 He gave me a call, Father told me. 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 The sky has died or not father said that 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.079
 I just spoke with cornmeal and there's a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.840
 Damned joy as that to this day you 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.539
 they will say retired do not play anymore 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.039
 It's the cause of lyre in that faithful one is true. 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.079
 so that's what I got in the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.879
 corinthians has never been a technical player and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.920
 a player of skill but always 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.019
 I have shown races in being able to show 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.610
 net grandchild was eight times champion 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.500
 In the club, I think we'll score. 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.700
 for the fall but that treats everyone 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.159
 well so I think the whole side 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.110
 michael said just finishing this song 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.909
 go rest is the following we have to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.590
 our ctc fans will have 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.479
 opportunity in a moment and there 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.490
 participating in a barbecue received the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.950
 everybody's affection but it's a crowd 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.680
 which gathers 34 thousand fans in the big 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.049
 games you imagined that in the center west 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.090
 cuiabá a city that is not very 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.970
 broadcast in Brazil would have a 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.950
 faithful in this way I'm going to speak here 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.960
 I believe that I've been several place 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.970
 from brazil not only from brazil but from 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.140
 world around me I played several places and 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.729
 always Corinthian 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.520
 and here we that our Brazil is that the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.079
 corinthians speaks kaká family one 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.619
 but I think it has to do with 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.329
 new 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.740
 cornmeal just a little something I'm so happy 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.450
 that my granddaughter my children will 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.490
 Remember me the rest of my life. 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.409
 you'll be remembered for 30 million 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.000
 of Corintians were going to sleep happily all 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.740
 Night, thank God I always speak 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.180
 with my son I think what I did 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.950
 in the club the title to win no one 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.960
 takes're right there in the club's history so 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.000
 I think I quit but your son went 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.920
 a duty fulfilled I think the queue of 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.099
 Congratulations corinthians will convince 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.099
