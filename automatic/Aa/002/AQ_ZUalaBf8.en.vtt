primarily<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.620> do<00:02:20.890> full<00:02:21.430> X's<00:02:21.880> where<00:02:22.600> I'll<00:02:22.840> do

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
primarily I do full X's where I'll do

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.030 
primarily I do full X's where I'll do
the<00:02:24.840> one<00:02:25.840> direction<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:27.010> other
