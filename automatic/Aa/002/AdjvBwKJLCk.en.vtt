00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
to locate the pulse now this is not

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.560 
to locate the pulse now this is not
necessarily<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.100> easiest<00:00:50.670> place<00:00:51.090> especially

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
necessarily the easiest place especially

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.799 
necessarily the easiest place especially
on<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> larger<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:52.890> even<00:00:53.280> obese<00:00:53.579> animal<00:00:54.149> so

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
on a larger or even obese animal so

another place would be right up here on

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.780 
another place would be right up here on
the<00:00:57.690> wrist<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.800> run<00:00:59.040> your<00:00:59.190> fingers<00:00:59.520> right

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
up under that front dewclaw head you can

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.789 
up under that front dewclaw head you can
usually<00:01:02.040> feel<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.460> pulse<00:01:03.030> right<00:01:03.300> there<00:01:03.799> same
