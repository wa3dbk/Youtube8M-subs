00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
want to do so that's what we use for the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.820 
want to do so that's what we use for the
kit<00:03:04.330> we<00:03:04.420> didn't<00:03:04.660> buy<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.810> pulse<00:03:05.110> rifle<00:03:05.500> mainly

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
kit we didn't buy the pulse rifle mainly

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.530 
kit we didn't buy the pulse rifle mainly
because<00:03:05.950> it's<00:03:06.190> highly<00:03:06.459> overpriced<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.150> it

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
because it's highly overpriced and it

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.100 
because it's highly overpriced and it
uses<00:03:07.720> energy<00:03:08.110> as<00:03:08.530> well<00:03:08.950> as<00:03:09.130> ammunition<00:03:09.520> so<00:03:10.120> we

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
uses energy as well as ammunition so we

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.360 
uses energy as well as ammunition so we
