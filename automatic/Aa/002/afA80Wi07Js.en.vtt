 among them we speak with the Uruguayan 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.269

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:27.689
 5-pointers in puntocom sports against 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.780

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:39.490
 always with clear objectives and always 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.170

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.060
 day and nothing and sacrifice you will 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.890
 consider more a mixed flyer or a 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.860
 typical creation flyer 10 where 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.350
 he puts his teammates to play then I am 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 I am mixed but I like I liked it 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.290
 this play offensively so this one does not 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.270
 I started my career as 10 and then I 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.820
 I was rejecting a little but but nothing 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.860
 love that position so be nothing 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.750
 willing to carry it out you 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.620
 I asked during this weekend 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.840
 who is aware of the responsibility 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.880
 you have when a foreigner has 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.060
 that make a difference in another country yes yes 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.550
 Of course I know and this and nothing and I'm 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.810
 prepared to face it I know I know 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.300
 that the foreigner always everywhere 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.890
 It is viewed with other eyes and good 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.229
 nothing 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.750
 I know what it is I have played in other 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.170
 countries 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.180
 and nothing is'll deal with it as such 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.590
 Are you already hired or are you 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.850
 you have to wait to see what happened 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.130
 during the week to stamp the signature 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.600
 spoken , speak, speak, I already spoke with him 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.400
 no no career to anything important this 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.290

 Serrano is not yet known a proposal 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.019
 formal we talk to the 15 if the truth 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.140
 is that placing very well physically 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.810

 already ending the holidays and waiting 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.860
 look for a good option the possibility 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.680
 to stay 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.320
 as long as there is the possibility not always 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.010
 want to hope that you can get to 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.790
 an agreement and that one speaks specifically to a 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.790
 deal

 physical evaluation we did the tests of 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.000

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.880
 external 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.700
 and logically what is going to 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.579
 do basically is under arthroscopy 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.370
