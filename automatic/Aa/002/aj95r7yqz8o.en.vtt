looks once I cut the bottom of the

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.259 
looks once I cut the bottom of the
cover-up<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.489> just<00:03:50.489> keep<00:03:50.639> in<00:03:50.790> mind<00:03:50.819> that<00:03:51.090> this

cover-up and just keep in mind that this

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.559 
cover-up and just keep in mind that this
won't<00:03:51.690> be<00:03:52.019> perfect<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.980> that's<00:03:53.549> fine<00:03:53.940> don't

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
won't be perfect so that's fine don't

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.349 
won't be perfect so that's fine don't
stress<00:03:55.079> out<00:03:55.230> if<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:55.650> not<00:03:55.709> perfect<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.609> the

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
stress out if it's not perfect and the

going to be zooming you in so you guys
see<00:04:59.940> a<00:04:59.970> little<00:05:00.450> closer<00:05:00.780> this<00:05:01.260> is<00:05:01.380> how<00:05:01.440> it<00:05:01.590> looks

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
see a little closer this is how it looks

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.879 
see a little closer this is how it looks
I<00:05:01.979> didn't<00:05:02.250> cut<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.669> bottom<00:05:03.260> so<00:05:04.260> the<00:05:04.440> next<00:05:04.620> step

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
I didn't cut the bottom so the next step

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.330 
I didn't cut the bottom so the next step
is<00:05:05.160> that<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:06.090> am<00:05:06.270> going<00:05:06.300> to<00:05:06.810> be<00:05:07.139> doing<00:05:07.889> a<00:05:08.370> knot

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
is that I am going to be doing a knot

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.890 
is that I am going to be doing a knot
and<00:05:11.340> then<00:05:11.550> I'm<00:05:11.669> going<00:05:11.789> to<00:05:11.850> be<00:05:12.000> doing<00:05:12.180> your

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
and then I'm going to be doing your

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.890 
and then I'm going to be doing your
knots<00:05:16.970> and<00:05:17.970> I'm<00:05:18.060> going<00:05:18.180> to<00:05:18.240> make<00:05:18.360> another

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
knots and I'm going to make another

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.189 
knots and I'm going to make another
enough<00:05:19.789> just<00:05:20.789> to<00:05:20.970> seal<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.510> one<00:05:21.720> and<00:05:21.960> even

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
enough just to seal that one and even

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:28.180 
enough just to seal that one and even
more

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.290 

so<00:05:29.120> that's<00:05:29.360> what<00:05:29.690> not<00:05:30.670> and<00:05:31.670> I'm<00:05:31.970> going<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.180> do

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
so that's what not and I'm going to do

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:48.650 
so that's what not and I'm going to do
that

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.840 

this<00:05:49.660> is<00:05:49.810> how<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.110> looks<00:05:50.350> and<00:05:50.590> the<00:05:51.340> next<00:05:51.639> step

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
this is how it looks and the next step

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.710 
this is how it looks and the next step
is<00:05:52.060> to<00:05:52.570> actually<00:05:52.780> put<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:54.120> on<00:05:55.120> these<00:05:55.510> are

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
is to actually put the on these are

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.830 
is to actually put the on these are
wrong<00:05:55.900> to<00:05:56.560> see<00:05:56.770> how<00:05:57.070> much<00:05:57.250> of<00:05:57.310> this<00:05:57.760> you<00:05:58.300> need

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
wrong to see how much of this you need

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.890 
wrong to see how much of this you need
so<00:05:59.410> now<00:05:59.650> I<00:05:59.680> am<00:06:00.010> wearing<00:06:00.370> the<00:06:00.580> cover-up<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.510> the

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
so now I am wearing the cover-up and the

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.330 
so now I am wearing the cover-up and the
next<00:06:02.169> thing<00:06:02.380> to<00:06:02.620> do<00:06:02.860> is<00:06:03.100> to<00:06:03.400> attach<00:06:03.850> that<00:06:04.479> piece

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
next thing to do is to attach that piece

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.450 
next thing to do is to attach that piece
to<00:06:06.389> right<00:06:07.389> here<00:06:07.660> so<00:06:07.870> I<00:06:07.900> just<00:06:08.229> pinned<00:06:08.830> it<00:06:09.070> along

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
to right here so I just pinned it along

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.570 
to right here so I just pinned it along
so<00:06:09.850> so<00:06:10.840> you<00:06:10.930> just<00:06:11.199> put<00:06:11.470> it<00:06:11.560> in<00:06:11.800> the<00:06:11.979> back<00:06:12.190> and

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
so so you just put it in the back and

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.780 
so so you just put it in the back and
try<00:06:13.270> to<00:06:13.330> figure<00:06:13.630> out<00:06:13.960> where<00:06:14.350> this<00:06:14.710> piece<00:06:15.130> needs

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
try to figure out where this piece needs

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.550 
try to figure out where this piece needs
to<00:06:15.970> go<00:06:16.330> you<00:06:16.690> know<00:06:16.840> where<00:06:17.169> it's<00:06:17.320> going<00:06:17.470> to<00:06:17.500> be
