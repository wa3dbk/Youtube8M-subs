00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.280
 with the people that I am marcelo godoy 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:10.049
 this this assassin and infiniti gameplay 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:13.079
 normal 4 against 4 they wanted to talk a 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:16.650
 little about the subject a little I've seen 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:19.770
 that is fashionable between choosing 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.810
 cmr or the triple battle according to 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.000
 features what is best all the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.150
 I'll tell the world what is best for them if 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.070
 the bounce strategy I do not 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.020
 compared saying playing before another 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.949
 I just diego and everyone is good at 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.210
 its in your field in your field in your way in 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.600
 his style 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.980
 let's say the dmr for me or for the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.690
 others for you may be what 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.570
 want but for me it's good at 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.199
 long distances let's say it's a plan 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.540
 like precision but bad I do not say bad 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.420
 because it is bad but they took us 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.370
 same life is not the same let's say 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.070
 the first one is better that you give battle in 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.870
 long distances and could be employed 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.350
 I would recommend using it in fields 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.130
 How can you be as big as they can be? 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.330
 rationed good 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.330
 so he 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.710
 I believe the truth but it seems to me that 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.219
 is more life in distance or is removed 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.530
 many lives and you give the three shots that the 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:27.770
 cracked the three shots in the head that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.610
 the dmr and in medium distances I what 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.040
 I control better and I hope so 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.890
 people control it better in distances 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.110
 means because it seems easier to me 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.640
 employ the battles average distances 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.320
 that in long distances is much more 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.380
 comfortable the least long references 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.470
 that's why I tell you I would recommend that 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:52.240
 if today they are a big map and let yourself be tmr 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.190
 and if you choose, leave the battle 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.960
 you want a middle field we could even 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.740
 put the care is already in distances 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.030
 short would also be fine is not the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.710
 all bad for short distances but 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.270
 it is always less handled for 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.570
 short distances because that's what the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.140
 gun man is a gun one 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.640
 pistol to the classic then well then 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.260
 there's also the carbine that I'm leaving 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.270
 using in the video for me and the carbine 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.490
 it's another world is 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.860
 it's the perfect middle distance replay 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.980
 for me, I'm not going to compare with this 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.690
 because good is deep friends because it is 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.790
 better that comparing them with the rest of 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.650
 the details of the story because I 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.370
 I use the carbine because the carbine has 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.890
 very, very, very 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.989
 little cadence have the shots 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.819
 continuously followed are very fast 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.920
 they may take less life than that of 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.930
 m &amp; r but they are very followed and that is very 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.790
 good in case you want when I did not have 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.930
 shield the opponent of that is to throw shot 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.790
 in the head and failures of the first 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.099
 intellects there you have that the second the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.099
 third turn is life to kill him 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.430
 that's why I use the carbine we also have 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:07.220
 the rifle light the light rifle let's say it's 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:09.530
 a battle rifle for win 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.230
 and this recre seems to me that it's better than 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.920
 I have not put myself to compare millimeter to 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.170
 millimeter the accuracy of the damage but the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.840
 precision I have seen that it is a 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.060
 little I handle it worse than 30 I do not know anymore 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.700
 why it will be but to the management worse and I think 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.290
 I think it has more damage but they 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.760
 it did not matter 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.769
 it's not just the same as the size and 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.840
 that they prefer one you can press 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.280
 but simply I do not tell you that 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.650
 We are gay for the advice of the people 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.359
 they say this is best to choose what 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.959
 is the best to all, not just 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.739
 you get what you like if this is a game 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.359
 you do not have to catch and make it better 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.010
 just do good tricks there 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:54.019
 nothing that was my opinion I hope that the 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.829
 If you want to comment THINK in 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.959
 the comments 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.090
 and I hope you leave the favorite aris 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.170
 you write porfirio I leave you with the rest 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.819
 in clean and see if it is part 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.819
 interesting so see you later 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.240
 the winds 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.240
 Y 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.190
 i 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:53.349
 yes 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.139
 no no 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.100
 yes 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.960
 good 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.230
 but good victory 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.270
