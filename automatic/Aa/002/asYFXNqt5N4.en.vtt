an<00:00:53.160> adapter<00:00:54.530> there<00:00:55.530> are<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.829> many<00:00:55.920> different

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
an adapter there are so many different

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.250 
an adapter there are so many different
sizes<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.760> faucets<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.420> there<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.930> different

sizes of faucets out there and different

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.160 
sizes of faucets out there and different
types<00:00:58.469> there's<00:00:58.680> mail<00:00:58.890> there's<00:00:59.190> female<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.170> we

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
types there's mail there's female and we

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.750

really<00:01:01.410> can't<00:01:01.590> predict<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> different

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
really can't predict all the different

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.910 
really can't predict all the different
situations<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.329> there<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.559> may<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.799> to

work or have adapters that work between
your<00:01:12.270> faucet<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:12.869> diverter<00:01:13.170> valve<00:01:13.439> but

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
your faucet and your diverter valve but

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.929 
your faucet and your diverter valve but
it'll<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.280> on<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.520> that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
it'll go on like that

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.160

you<00:01:15.119> may<00:01:15.240> also<00:01:15.360> want<00:01:15.509> put<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.689> little<00:01:15.810> teflon

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
you may also want put a little teflon

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.270 
you may also want put a little teflon
tape<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.560> there<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> want<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> make<00:01:17.070> sure<00:01:17.100> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
tape in there so I want to make sure you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.170 
tape in there so I want to make sure you
got<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> watertight<00:01:17.670> seal

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
got a watertight seal

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.840 
got a watertight seal
but<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.869> should<00:01:18.990> be<00:01:19.049> pretty<00:01:19.170> simple<00:01:19.430> 95<00:01:20.430> 98

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
but it should be pretty simple 95 98

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.100 
but it should be pretty simple 95 98
percent<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.240> people<00:01:21.420> are<00:01:21.509> gonna<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.960> just

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
percent of people are gonna have it just

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.499 
percent of people are gonna have it just
like<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.320> did<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.640> take<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.360> end<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
like I did and then you take the end of

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.030 
like I did and then you take the end of
this<00:01:24.630> suit<00:01:24.869> tubing<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.799> there's<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
this suit tubing you see there's a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.300 
this suit tubing you see there's a
little<00:01:26.549> elbow<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.140> valve<00:01:28.380> adapter<00:01:28.890> thing

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
little elbow and a valve adapter thing

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.030 
little elbow and a valve adapter thing
on<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.840> that's<00:01:30.840> gonna<00:01:30.960> plug<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.380> directly

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
on there that's gonna plug in directly

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.640 
on there that's gonna plug in directly
to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.520> back<00:01:33.140> port<00:01:34.140> you'll<00:01:34.290> get<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.560> bit

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
to the back port you'll get a little bit

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.440 
to the back port you'll get a little bit
of<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> push<00:01:35.100> then<00:01:35.729> push<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.090> more<00:01:36.240> time<00:01:36.390> and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
of a push then push it one more time and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.090 
of a push then push it one more time and
it'll<00:01:36.750> seat<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.020> there<00:01:37.170> probably<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.070> a

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
it'll seat in there probably it's a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.160 
it'll seat in there probably it's a
compression<00:01:38.430> fitting<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.840> you

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
compression fitting so when it's in you

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.200 
compression fitting so when it's in you
cannot<00:01:40.409> pull<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> back<00:01:40.860> out<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.820> ever<00:01:41.939> do

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
cannot pull it back out if you ever do

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.700 
cannot pull it back out if you ever do

out<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.869> always<00:01:58.140> cut<00:01:58.590> take<00:01:58.770> this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
out there you can always cut take this

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.190 
out there you can always cut take this
apart<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.430> cut<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.030> fit<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.780> most<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.079> them

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
apart and cut it to fit but most of them

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200

before that usage will will get up to

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.290 
before that usage will will get up to
the<00:02:40.800> point<00:02:40.950> where<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.700> kind<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.060> stream
