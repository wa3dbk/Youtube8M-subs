00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.760

 in my skin frame is going to be a little bit 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.200
 difficult so nothing 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.290
 I have one in the palm of my hand 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.480
 I feel unsafe ugly and make-up from 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.520
 adolescence has had problems for 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.040
 contain my income but it really is 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.070
 something hormonal and how difficult to control them 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.770
 but here we are one of the reasons why 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.380
 the one that I returned to rd I want to find us 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.090
 many details because I was in a 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.340
 relationship was that it was convenient but 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.240
 We were going seriously in a laker 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.370
 all my electronic device have 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:37.610
 they have to be white 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.610
 I lost a friend or my friend 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.960
 more about the brief brief stories 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.570
 she summarized that he was for him to 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.280
 It consisted of a friend and she thought that I 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.650
 I flirted with the choir I did not want to go 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.210
 with him he just liked her 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.310
 end of story 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.310
 but the favorite in the whole world 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:03.369
 the most fun way to work in the 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.369
 radio is able to meet singers 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.499
 once when they see well and I was in 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.989
 form of flu and my friend omar took me 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:13.099
 three were crazy and in our 

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:15.979
 stories 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:19.219
 I put a lot of pressure on me as soon as 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.979
 work and education I try to learn what 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:24.529
 more than I can and take advantage of all 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:27.529
 opportunities that are presented to us use 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:29.749
 lenses and I see less of the subject as the 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:32.289
 least favorite part of my body are 

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:36.649
 my bubis I have the nose slightly 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:39.489
 Crappy Crappy apply crooked am 

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:39.489
 false eyelashes 

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:51.090
 good 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:54.720
 rock roll trust in procrastinate almost 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:58.850
 black like what's going off but I 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.850
 I distract too easy 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:07.590
 I am trip or phobic ok i do not feel 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:09.729
 real or something crazy in my mind but 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.670
 photos how are you 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.040
 it stirs me in the stomach 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.050
 I have flat feet , that is, not 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.180
 I have a bridge, which gives me pain 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:23.460
 back and it hinders me when using 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:25.470
 heels make me afraid to be for airbus 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.720
 and that gives me so much afraid of 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.070
 heights but not because type medium height 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.700
 environment the heights when I'm in 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:36.900
 balconies cliffs rocks et cetera no 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:41.600
 I'm afraid of the plane if it's on a boat 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:46.100
 well inside a closed building 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.100
 if we look down 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:55.180
 but when I really like the song it's 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.180
 much over and over and over again 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:07.440
 my first pets were few 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.860

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:14.189
