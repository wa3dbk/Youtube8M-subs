there<00:00:00.960> are<00:00:01.110> two<00:00:01.260> easy<00:00:01.439> action<00:00:01.800> script<00:00:02.280> actions

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
there are two easy action script actions

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.460 
there are two easy action script actions
that<00:00:02.879> we<00:00:02.970> can<00:00:03.149> add<00:00:03.360> that<00:00:03.959> will<00:00:04.080> move<00:00:04.259> the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
that we can add that will move the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.619 
that we can add that will move the
playback<00:00:04.859> head<00:00:04.890> one<00:00:05.370> frame<00:00:05.700> forward<00:00:06.029> or<00:00:06.330> one

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
playback head one frame forward or one

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.720 
playback head one frame forward or one
frame<00:00:06.930> backwards<00:00:07.500> we<00:00:08.099> can<00:00:08.220> take<00:00:08.370> some<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:08.639> the

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
frame backwards we can take some of the

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.669 
frame backwards we can take some of the
examples<00:00:08.970> we've<00:00:09.360> created<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.110> simply<00:00:10.530> add

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
examples we've created and simply add

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.030 
examples we've created and simply add
these<00:00:10.860> in<00:00:11.099> very<00:00:11.370> quickly<00:00:12.769> here<00:00:13.769> we<00:00:13.860> have<00:00:14.009> our

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
these in very quickly here we have our

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.519 
these in very quickly here we have our
starting<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.790> ending<00:00:15.000> example<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:16.379> they

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
starting and ending example and they

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.189 
starting and ending example and they
both<00:00:16.680> have<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.010> same<00:00:17.210> movie<00:00:18.210> clip<00:00:18.449> rotating

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
both have the same movie clip rotating

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.260 
both have the same movie clip rotating
in<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> center<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.830> they<00:00:20.609> both<00:00:20.760> have<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> play

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
in the center and they both have a play

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.509 
in the center and they both have a play
and<00:00:21.480> stop<00:00:21.720> button<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.980> finish<00:00:23.250> when<00:00:23.369> we're

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
and stop button the finish when we're

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.550 
and stop button the finish when we're
going<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.699> add<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.850> step<00:00:24.510> button<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:25.199> stepping

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
going to add a step button for stepping

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.320 
going to add a step button for stepping
back<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:26.010> frame<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.609> step<00:00:26.849> button<00:00:27.090> for

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
back one frame and a step button for

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.509 
back one frame and a step button for
stepping<00:00:27.689> forward<00:00:27.930> one<00:00:28.230> frame<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.800> that's

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
stepping forward one frame and that's

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.220 
stepping forward one frame and that's
the<00:00:29.670> difference<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.300> if<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.720> get<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.990> step

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the difference and if we get to step

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.139 
the difference and if we get to step
button<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:31.650> notice<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.219> move<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
button we notice we can move the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.360 
button we notice we can move the
animation<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:33.960> frame<00:00:34.230> at<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.440> time<00:00:34.469> forward<00:00:35.190> or

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
animation one frame at a time forward or

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.170 
animation one frame at a time forward or
one<00:00:35.730> frame<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.239> time<00:00:36.450> backwards<00:00:38.030> so<00:00:39.030> let's

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
one frame at the time backwards so let's

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.690 
one frame at the time backwards so let's
see<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.450> make<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:40.219> let's<00:00:41.219> open<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
see how we make this let's open up the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:51.009 
see how we make this let's open up the
starting<00:00:42.090> file

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:01:00.079 

and<00:00:52.019> we'll<00:00:52.199> save<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> under<00:00:53.190> another<00:00:53.579> name<00:00:59.089> and

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
and we'll save it under another name and

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.340 
and we'll save it under another name and
let's<00:01:00.269> take<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> quick<00:01:00.690> review<00:01:00.839> of<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.199> we

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
let's take a quick review of what we

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
let's take a quick review of what we
have<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.769> movie<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.000> four<00:01:03.210> items<00:01:03.359> in

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
have in the movie we have four items in

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.200 
have in the movie we have four items in
our<00:01:03.690> library<00:01:03.930> first<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> red<00:01:05.610> rectangle

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
our library first is the red rectangle

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.600 
our library first is the red rectangle
that<00:01:06.390> has<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.659> basic<00:01:07.470> rectangle<00:01:08.070> shape<00:01:08.280> in<00:01:08.490> it

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that has a basic rectangle shape in it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
that has a basic rectangle shape in it
and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> that's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> movie<00:01:10.560> clip

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and then we have and that's a movie clip

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.410 
and then we have and that's a movie clip
there's<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> red<00:01:11.310> rectangle<00:01:11.490> rotating

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
there's a red rectangle rotating

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.930 
there's a red rectangle rotating
clockwise<00:01:12.630> movie<00:01:13.259> clip<00:01:13.440> which<00:01:13.619> has<00:01:13.799> our<00:01:14.070> about

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
clockwise movie clip which has our about

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.560 
clockwise movie clip which has our about
120<00:01:15.509> frame<00:01:16.100> animation<00:01:17.100> for<00:01:17.250> rotating<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.000> we

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
120 frame animation for rotating and we

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.649 
120 frame animation for rotating and we
have<00:01:18.690> our<00:01:18.780> play<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.170> stop<00:01:19.350> button<00:01:20.509> we<00:01:21.509> get

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
have our play and stop button we get

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.740 
have our play and stop button we get
down<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.960> scene<00:01:22.259> 1<00:01:22.470> timeline<00:01:23.509> on<00:01:24.509> our

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
down to the scene 1 timeline on our

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.990 
down to the scene 1 timeline on our
bottom<00:01:25.560> layer<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.039> where<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
bottom layer is where we have the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.309 
bottom layer is where we have the
rotating<00:01:27.479> rectangle<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:29.250> has<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.399> name

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.319 
rotating rectangle and that has a name

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.749 
rotating rectangle and that has a name
rotation<00:01:31.319> underscore<00:01:31.920> MC<00:01:32.310> we'll<00:01:32.520> look<00:01:32.610> at

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
rotation underscore MC we'll look at

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.029 
rotation underscore MC we'll look at
that<00:01:32.789> in<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.090> code<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:34.020> we<00:01:34.590> also<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:35.009> our

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
that in the code and we also have our

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.040 
that in the code and we also have our
two<00:01:35.399> buttons<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:35.970> stop<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.450> play<00:01:36.569> button<00:01:36.899> on<00:01:37.020> a

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
two buttons or stop and play button on a

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.840 
two buttons or stop and play button on a
layer<00:01:37.289> color<00:01:37.590> control<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.190> let's<00:01:38.310> open<00:01:38.550> up<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
layer color control so let's open up the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.309 
layer color control so let's open up the
code<00:01:39.060> window<00:01:39.300> it'll<00:01:39.720> select<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> action

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
code window it'll select the action

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.130 
code window it'll select the action
script<00:01:40.770> layer<00:01:41.700> frame<00:01:42.149> 1<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.780> open<00:01:43.020> up<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
script layer frame 1 and open up the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.120 
script layer frame 1 and open up the
actions<00:01:43.619> window<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.619> see<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:46.979> we

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
actions window and we can see in here we

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.529 
actions window and we can see in here we
have<00:01:47.280> our<00:01:47.310> basic<00:01:47.670> actions<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.420> we've

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
have our basic actions that we've

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.039 
have our basic actions that we've
completed<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.259> previous<00:01:49.679> examples<00:01:50.720> so<00:01:51.720> let's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
completed in previous examples so let's

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.169 
completed in previous examples so let's
add<00:01:52.229> our<00:01:52.259> buttons<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.490> will<00:01:53.700> close<00:01:53.940> the

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
add our buttons and so will close the

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.060 
add our buttons and so will close the
actions<00:01:54.539> window<00:01:54.840> temporarily<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.799> we'll<00:01:55.920> go

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
actions window temporarily and we'll go

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.649 
actions window temporarily and we'll go
to<00:01:56.130> window<00:01:57.170> common<00:01:58.170> libraries<00:01:58.350> buttons<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
to window common libraries buttons and

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:09.100 
to window common libraries buttons and
we'll<00:02:00.659> open<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.350> classic<00:02:02.009> button<00:02:02.780> node

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.050 

and<00:02:09.590> under<00:02:09.979> there<00:02:10.130> are<00:02:10.250> some<00:02:10.399> circle<00:02:10.789> buttons

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060

let's move this over a little bit and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.100 
let's move this over a little bit and
they<00:02:16.340> have<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.550> button<00:02:17.030> called<00:02:17.060> step<00:02:17.600> ahead<00:02:17.750> and

they have a button called step ahead and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.020 
they have a button called step ahead and
step<00:02:18.290> back<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.160> we'll<00:02:19.250> take<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.580> step<00:02:19.820> back

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
step back so we'll take the step back

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.930

which<00:06:26.360> actually<00:06:26.540> stops<00:06:27.020> it<00:06:27.290> and<00:06:27.470> just<00:06:27.650> moves

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:27.920 
which actually stops it and just moves

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.300 
which actually stops it and just moves
at<00:06:28.070> one<00:06:28.220> frame<00:06:28.490> at<00:06:28.520> a<00:06:28.700> time<00:06:28.730> and<00:06:29.950> I<00:06:30.950> used<00:06:31.190> to

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
at one frame at a time and I used to

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.980 
at one frame at a time and I used to
step<00:06:31.550> forward<00:06:31.820> version<00:06:32.360> of<00:06:32.480> the<00:06:32.540> step<00:06:32.750> button

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
step forward version of the step button

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:38.160 
step forward version of the step button
and<00:06:33.290> then<00:06:33.410> there's<00:06:33.590> the<00:06:33.740> previous<00:06:34.190> version

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.450 

and<00:06:39.170> the<00:06:39.350> other<00:06:39.470> buttons<00:06:39.800> work<00:06:39.980> as<00:06:40.160> they<00:06:40.280> did

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
and the other buttons work as they did

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.970 
and the other buttons work as they did
before<00:06:40.780> let's<00:06:41.780> close<00:06:42.020> this<00:06:42.290> let's<00:06:42.560> try

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
before let's close this let's try

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.890 
before let's close this let's try
something<00:06:43.310> a<00:06:43.490> little<00:06:43.550> bit<00:06:43.880> different<00:06:44.750> will

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
something a little bit different will

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.700 
something a little bit different will
copy<00:06:45.500> this<00:06:45.880> rotating<00:06:47.140> underscore<00:06:48.140> MC<00:06:48.440> next

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
copy this rotating underscore MC next

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.580 
copy this rotating underscore MC next
frame<00:06:48.920> line<00:06:49.340> so<00:06:50.060> I'm<00:06:50.120> going<00:06:50.240> to<00:06:50.300> copy<00:06:50.510> it<00:06:50.780> use<00:06:51.560> a

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
frame line so I'm going to copy it use a

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.380 
frame line so I'm going to copy it use a
shortcut<00:06:51.950> key<00:06:52.250> and<00:06:52.400> a<00:06:52.550> paste<00:06:52.790> at<00:06:52.970> for<00:06:53.180> more

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 
shortcut key and a paste at for more

00:06:59.370 --> 00:06:59.380 
dimes 1 2 3 4 so this will have the

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.900 
dimes 1 2 3 4 so this will have the
button<00:07:00.380> move<00:07:00.590> as<00:07:00.740> ahead<00:07:01.010> five<00:07:01.310> frames<00:07:01.670> at<00:07:01.850> a

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
button move as ahead five frames at a

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.370 
button move as ahead five frames at a
time<00:07:02.120> now<00:07:02.390> if<00:07:02.480> you're<00:07:02.600> a<00:07:02.630> programmer<00:07:02.900> there

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:03.380 
time now if you're a programmer there

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.080 
time now if you're a programmer there
are<00:07:03.470> more<00:07:03.650> elegant<00:07:04.100> ways<00:07:04.250> to<00:07:04.550> do<00:07:04.670> this<00:07:04.700> with

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.090 
are more elegant ways to do this with

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.200 
are more elegant ways to do this with
loops<00:07:05.420> in<00:07:05.830> other<00:07:06.830> ways<00:07:07.070> that<00:07:07.550> might<00:07:08.030> require

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
loops in other ways that might require

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.360 
loops in other ways that might require
some<00:07:08.420> mathematical<00:07:09.290> formulas<00:07:09.890> but<00:07:10.100> this

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.370 
some mathematical formulas but this

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.790 
some mathematical formulas but this
works<00:07:10.610> great<00:07:10.760> for<00:07:10.940> beginning<00:07:11.660> and<00:07:11.990> we'll<00:07:12.590> try

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
works great for beginning and we'll try

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.910 
works great for beginning and we'll try
this<00:07:12.860> again<00:07:13.100> test<00:07:13.880> movie<00:07:14.440> and<00:07:15.440> we'll<00:07:15.740> start

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:15.920 
this again test movie and we'll start

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.530 
this again test movie and we'll start
playing<00:07:16.220> it<00:07:16.550> and<00:07:16.760> then<00:07:16.910> we<00:07:17.000> used<00:07:17.180> to<00:07:17.300> step

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:17.540 
playing it and then we used to step

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.060 
playing it and then we used to step
forward<00:07:17.840> button<00:07:18.290> and<00:07:18.470> you'll<00:07:18.620> notice<00:07:18.830> it's

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070 
forward button and you'll notice it's

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.100 
forward button and you'll notice it's
sort<00:07:19.340> of<00:07:19.460> jumping<00:07:19.880> a<00:07:20.090> lot<00:07:20.330> quicker<00:07:20.570> use<00:07:20.930> the

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.110 
sort of jumping a lot quicker use the

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.690 
sort of jumping a lot quicker use the
back<00:07:21.290> but<00:07:21.560> you<00:07:21.710> can<00:07:21.860> see<00:07:22.010> that's<00:07:22.250> a<00:07:22.370> little<00:07:22.580> bit

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.700 
back but you can see that's a little bit

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.850 
back but you can see that's a little bit
smaller<00:07:23.180> increment<00:07:23.780> and<00:07:23.900> the<00:07:24.440> step<00:07:24.680> forward

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 
smaller increment and the step forward

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.920 
smaller increment and the step forward
button<00:07:25.310> is<00:07:25.520> moving<00:07:25.970> at<00:07:26.060> five<00:07:26.300> frames<00:07:26.660> at<00:07:26.870> a

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
button is moving at five frames at a

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:33.970 
button is moving at five frames at a
time<00:07:29.500> all<00:07:30.500> right<00:07:30.650> I'm<00:07:30.800> just<00:07:31.040> undo<00:07:31.880> this<00:07:32.980> we

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:33.980 
time all right I'm just undo this we

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.500 
time all right I'm just undo this we
don't<00:07:34.100> want<00:07:34.340> these<00:07:34.460> four<00:07:34.760> lines<00:07:34.970> and<00:07:35.360> that's

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:35.510 
don't want these four lines and that's

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.140 
don't want these four lines and that's
our<00:07:35.720> completed<00:07:36.170> movie<00:07:36.620> and<00:07:37.160> run<00:07:37.580> tests<00:07:37.850> movie

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.150 
our completed movie and run tests movie

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.610 
our completed movie and run tests movie
one<00:07:38.300> more<00:07:38.510> time<00:07:40.840> and<00:07:41.840> there<00:07:42.350> you<00:07:42.470> have<00:07:42.500> it

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:42.620 
one more time and there you have it

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:48.370 
one more time and there you have it
that's<00:07:43.310> basically<00:07:43.790> what<00:07:44.000> we<00:07:44.090> wanted<00:07:44.330> to<00:07:44.390> do

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:48.380 

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.580 

okay<00:07:49.250> we<00:07:49.400> added<00:07:49.670> two<00:07:49.880> basic<00:07:50.480> playback<00:07:50.960> actions

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:51.590 
okay we added two basic playback actions

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.520 
okay we added two basic playback actions
pre<00:07:52.430> frame<00:07:52.760> and<00:07:53.030> next<00:07:53.270> frame<00:07:53.480> pre<00:07:53.780> frame<00:07:54.110> stops

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:54.530 
pre frame and next frame pre frame stops

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.170 
pre frame and next frame pre frame stops
the<00:07:54.740> playback<00:07:55.100> head<00:07:55.130> moves<00:07:55.610> your<00:07:55.760> head<00:07:55.880> or

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:56.180 
the playback head moves your head or

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.780 
the playback head moves your head or
moves<00:07:56.900> you<00:07:57.020> back<00:07:57.230> one<00:07:57.530> frame<00:07:57.860> a<00:07:58.130> next<00:07:58.550> frame

00:07:58.780 --> 00:07:58.790 
moves you back one frame a next frame

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.910 
moves you back one frame a next frame
stops<00:07:59.480> the<00:07:59.720> playback<00:08:00.050> head<00:08:00.080> moves<00:08:00.530> you<00:08:00.650> ahead

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:00.920 
stops the playback head moves you ahead

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.190 
stops the playback head moves you ahead
one<00:08:01.160> frame<00:08:01.520> you<00:08:02.270> can<00:08:02.480> increase<00:08:02.720> that<00:08:02.990> number

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:03.200 
one frame you can increase that number

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.840 
one frame you can increase that number
of<00:08:03.590> frames<00:08:03.770> by<00:08:04.010> just<00:08:04.190> duplicating<00:08:04.760> the

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:04.850 
of frames by just duplicating the

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.240 
of frames by just duplicating the
actions
