00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
probably going to paint it something

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.870 
probably going to paint it something
other<00:01:07.229> than<00:01:07.409> vintage<00:01:07.830> burgundy<00:01:08.400> because<00:01:08.790> i

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
other than vintage burgundy because i

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.800 
other than vintage burgundy because i
don't<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.060> care<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.479> has<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.780> original

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.690 
don't like care if it has the original
look<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:11.070> i'm<00:01:11.159> probably<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> do

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
look but i'm probably going to do

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.070 
look but i'm probably going to do
something<00:01:11.970> different<00:01:12.090> than<00:01:12.540> red<00:01:12.720> or<00:01:12.869> blue

something different than red or blue

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
something different than red or blue
because<00:01:13.439> those<00:01:13.830> colors<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.280> just<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.460> little

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
because those colors are just a little

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640 
because those colors are just a little
too<00:01:14.790> common<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.900> i<00:01:15.960> wanted<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
too common now i wanted to do some a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.770 
too common now i wanted to do some a
little<00:01:16.799> more<00:01:17.040> unique<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.640> purple<00:01:18.630> or

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
little more unique like purple or

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.850 
little more unique like purple or
something<00:01:19.200> maybe<00:01:19.350> i<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:21.650> here's<00:01:22.650> not

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
something maybe i don't know here's not

five a 200 straight-six which I guess is

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.710 
five a 200 straight-six which I guess is
kind<00:02:01.310> of<00:02:01.550> unique<00:02:01.640> since<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.240> seems<00:02:02.450> like

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
kind of unique since it seems like

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:20.520 
kind of unique since it seems like
everybody<00:02:03.200> has<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.380> 289

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530
