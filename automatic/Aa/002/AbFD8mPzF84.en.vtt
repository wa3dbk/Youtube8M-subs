hi<00:00:00.299> I'm<00:00:00.719> Dave<00:00:01.140> and<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:02.159> my<00:00:02.399> dog<00:00:02.639> watching

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
hi I'm Dave and this is my dog watching

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.960 
hi I'm Dave and this is my dog watching
laser<00:00:03.810> trip<00:00:04.259> wire<00:00:04.440> system<00:00:05.009> I've<00:00:05.759> got<00:00:05.940> a

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
laser trip wire system I've got a

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.360 
laser trip wire system I've got a
problem<00:00:06.210> where<00:00:06.569> when<00:00:07.049> we<00:00:07.140> go<00:00:07.319> away<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:08.189> dog

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
problem where when we go away the dog

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.890 
problem where when we go away the dog
gets<00:00:08.580> on<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.820> counter<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.300> get<00:00:09.389> sad<00:00:09.630> things

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
gets on the counter and get sad things

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.540 
gets on the counter and get sad things
may<00:00:10.110> be<00:00:10.170> stuff<00:00:10.469> that's<00:00:10.500> defrosting<00:00:11.309> or<00:00:11.429> other

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
may be stuff that's defrosting or other

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.530 
may be stuff that's defrosting or other
things<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.150> shouldn't<00:00:12.330> be<00:00:12.450> getting

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
things that you shouldn't be getting

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.980 
things that you shouldn't be getting
into<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.549> wanted<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.030> get<00:00:15.599> some<00:00:15.780> sort<00:00:15.929> of

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
into so we wanted to get some sort of

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.990 
into so we wanted to get some sort of
training<00:00:16.320> mechanism<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.250> would<00:00:17.369> stop<00:00:17.699> her

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
training mechanism that would stop her

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.519 
training mechanism that would stop her
or<00:00:18.029> at<00:00:18.210> least<00:00:18.420> give<00:00:18.930> her<00:00:19.050> some<00:00:19.260> sort<00:00:19.500> of

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
or at least give her some sort of

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.990 
or at least give her some sort of
negative<00:00:19.710> feedback<00:00:20.039> when<00:00:20.430> she<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
negative feedback when she is on the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.750 
negative feedback when she is on the
counter<00:00:21.210> today<00:00:21.930> then<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.439> built<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.980> system

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
counter today then we built a system

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.750 
counter today then we built a system
where<00:00:24.300> if<00:00:24.779> there<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> laser<00:00:25.949> that's<00:00:26.310> broken

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
where if there is a laser that's broken

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.500 
where if there is a laser that's broken
it<00:00:27.269> not<00:00:27.840> only<00:00:28.279> says<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> command<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.269> says<00:00:30.390> me

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
it not only says a command and says me

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.950 
it not only says a command and says me
going<00:00:30.750> hey<00:00:30.900> like<00:00:31.470> audio<00:00:31.980> thing<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:32.790> also<00:00:32.969> it

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
going hey like audio thing but also it

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.540 
going hey like audio thing but also it
takes<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.440> picture<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.800> her<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.219> can<00:00:35.309> see

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
takes a picture of her so we can see

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.069 
takes a picture of her so we can see
what's<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.090> or<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.510> I've<00:00:36.630> got<00:00:36.809> problems

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
what's going on or if I've got problems

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
what's going on or if I've got problems
with<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> system<00:00:37.910> anyways<00:00:38.910> I'm<00:00:39.090> going<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
with the system anyways I'm going to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.580 
with the system anyways I'm going to
show<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> individual<00:00:39.989> parts<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.410> then

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
show you the individual parts and then

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.240 
show you the individual parts and then
we<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.070> check<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.910> well<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> works

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
we can check out how well it works

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.560 
we can check out how well it works
here's<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> system<00:00:44.820> opened<00:00:45.180> up<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.450> can

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
here's the system opened up so you can

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.850 
here's the system opened up so you can
take<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> look<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.140> everything<00:00:46.320> we've<00:00:46.590> got<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
take a look at everything we've got the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.910 
take a look at everything we've got the
Raspberry<00:00:47.250> Pi<00:00:47.280> -<00:00:47.719> connected<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.350> camera

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
Raspberry Pi - connected to the camera

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.000

here<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:51.480> speaker<00:00:51.899> into<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.530> 3.5

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
here and a speaker into the 3.5

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.439 
here and a speaker into the 3.5
millimeter<00:00:53.430> jack<00:00:53.460> pretty<00:00:53.910> standard<00:00:54.270> setup

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
millimeter jack pretty standard setup

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.250 
millimeter jack pretty standard setup
there<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.250> laser<00:00:57.180> tripwires<00:00:57.570> system

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there this is the laser tripwires system

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.200 
there this is the laser tripwires system
the<00:00:58.379> hardware<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> circuit<00:00:59.219> that's<00:00:59.370> defining

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the hardware the circuit that's defining

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.670 
the hardware the circuit that's defining
the<00:01:00.300> schematic<00:01:00.750> attached<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> article

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the schematic attached to the article

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.250 
the schematic attached to the article
and<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.539> calibration<00:01:03.870> knob

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and then here is the calibration knob

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.160 
and then here is the calibration knob
and<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.010> enable<00:01:05.369> switch<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> that's<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and the enable switch so that's the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.050 
and the enable switch so that's the
system<00:01:07.950> kind<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> opened<00:01:08.729> up

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
system kind of opened up

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.330 
system kind of opened up
let's<00:01:09.299> close<00:01:10.020> back<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.650> see<00:01:10.979> how<00:01:11.189> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
let's close back up and see how it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:02:21.520 
let's close back up and see how it
performs<00:01:11.700> with<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> dog

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:31.699 

you

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.530 

so<00:02:32.709> there<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:32.980> is<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:33.459> worked<00:02:33.730> she<00:02:33.939> got<00:02:34.060> busted

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
so there it is it worked she got busted

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.179 
so there it is it worked she got busted
and<00:02:34.689> then<00:02:34.780> ran<00:02:34.989> back<00:02:35.019> outside<00:02:35.409> I'm<00:02:35.799> not<00:02:35.950> sure

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
and then ran back outside I'm not sure

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.559 
and then ran back outside I'm not sure
if<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.400> she<00:02:36.700> ran<00:02:36.879> outside<00:02:37.060> because<00:02:37.480> she

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
if it she ran outside because she

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.600 
if it she ran outside because she
thought<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.780> was<00:02:37.989> coming<00:02:38.230> home<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.620> when<00:02:39.400> she

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
thought I was coming home and when she

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.069 
thought I was coming home and when she
heard<00:02:39.700> my<00:02:39.879> voice<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.269> was<00:02:40.390> going<00:02:40.599> on<00:02:40.720> but<00:02:40.900> still

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
heard my voice I was going on but still

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.740 
heard my voice I was going on but still
the<00:02:41.860> treats<00:02:42.129> were<00:02:42.280> there<00:02:42.489> when<00:02:42.939> I<00:02:42.970> got<00:02:43.180> back<00:02:43.450> I

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
the treats were there when I got back I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.750 
the treats were there when I got back I
don't<00:02:44.439> know<00:02:44.620> if<00:02:44.709> this<00:02:45.159> is<00:02:45.189> going<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.579> work

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
don't know if this is going to work

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.729 
don't know if this is going to work
forever<00:02:46.209> or<00:02:46.629> if<00:02:46.810> she'll<00:02:47.019> eventually<00:02:47.379> realize

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
forever or if she'll eventually realize

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.289 
forever or if she'll eventually realize
that<00:02:48.069> hey<00:02:48.220> that's<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:48.549> recording<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.180> can

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
that hey that's just recording and I can

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.649 
that hey that's just recording and I can
eat<00:02:49.390> whatever<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.720> want<00:02:49.959> but<00:02:50.560> for<00:02:51.489> now<00:02:51.659> it's

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
eat whatever I want but for now it's

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.140 
eat whatever I want but for now it's
gone<00:02:53.049> well<00:02:53.290> I'm<00:02:53.950> gonna<00:02:54.069> keep<00:02:54.489> trying<00:02:54.939> it<00:02:55.060> out

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
gone well I'm gonna keep trying it out

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.179 
gone well I'm gonna keep trying it out
and<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.689> hope<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.989> build<00:02:56.200> one<00:02:56.319> yourself<00:02:56.379> if<00:02:57.040> you

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
and I hope you build one yourself if you
