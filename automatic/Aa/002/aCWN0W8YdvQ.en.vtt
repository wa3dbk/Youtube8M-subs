pretty<00:00:51.030> much<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.210> exact<00:00:51.570> same<00:00:51.780> thing<00:00:52.050> there

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
pretty much the exact same thing there

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
pretty much the exact same thing there
are<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> handful<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.760> other<00:00:53.969> comic<00:00:54.270> readers<00:00:54.570> on

are a handful of other comic readers on

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.209 
are a handful of other comic readers on
here<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.079> may<00:00:55.230> look<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.440> those<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.770> later<00:00:55.949> weeks

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
here we may look at those in later weeks

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.069 
here we may look at those in later weeks
but<00:00:56.430> right<00:00:56.579> now<00:00:56.760> i<00:00:56.969> think<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.600> best<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.930> them

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
but right now i think the best of them

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.810 
but right now i think the best of them
is<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> comiXology<00:00:59.010> reader<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.460> way<00:00:59.579> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
is the comiXology reader the way that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.439 
is the comiXology reader the way that
you<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.510> tap<00:01:01.550> back<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.760> forth<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.239> turn<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
you be tap back and forth and turn the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.170 
you be tap back and forth and turn the
pages<00:01:03.690> i<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.250> animation<00:01:05.670> i<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
pages i like that animation i like I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.230 
pages i like that animation i like I
think<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:07.950> most<00:01:08.580> closely

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
think that's what most closely

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.240 
think that's what most closely
approximates<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> reading<00:01:10.560> experience<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
approximates the reading experience to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.380 
approximates the reading experience to
me<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.670> yeah<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.970> definitely<00:01:12.180> recommend

Galactus<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:47.170> organization<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.190> is

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
Galactus this organization that is

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.550 
Galactus this organization that is
defended<00:03:48.730> the<00:03:48.820> universe<00:03:49.150> throughout<00:03:49.420> time<00:03:49.750> so

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
defended the universe throughout time so

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.410 
defended the universe throughout time so
this<00:03:50.740> is<00:03:50.800> very<00:03:51.160> much<00:03:51.490> taking<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:51.910> concept<00:03:52.240> in

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
this is very much taking the concept in

turning in sonnets here it is probably

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.070 
turning in sonnets here it is probably
the<00:03:54.700> most<00:03:54.760> different<00:03:55.510> from<00:03:55.690> expectations

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
the most different from expectations
