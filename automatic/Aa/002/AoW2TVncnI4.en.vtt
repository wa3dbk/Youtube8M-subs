00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.249 
and I figured it's 4:50 a.m. right now
so<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.520> figured<00:01:23.820> about<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> nine<00:01:24.210> o'clock<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.810> have

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.580 
so I figured about a nine o'clock I have
some<00:01:25.439> more<00:01:25.560> eggs<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:27.240> basically<00:01:27.960> did<00:01:28.170> 25

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
minutes of weight training with a 25

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.200 
minutes of weight training with a 25
pound<00:01:32.189> dumbbell<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.829> I<00:01:34.829> also<00:01:34.979> walked<00:01:35.909> on<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
pound dumbbell and I also walked on the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.499 
pound dumbbell and I also walked on the
Riverwalk<00:01:36.630> yesterday<00:01:37.880> for<00:01:38.880> about<00:01:39.060> half<00:01:39.270> hour

walking<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.470> well<00:01:49.500> because<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:51.030> walk<00:01:51.180> into

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450

considered<00:06:13.529> low<00:06:13.740> carbohydrates<00:06:14.550> for<00:06:14.669> the

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:14.819 
considered low carbohydrates for the

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.100 
considered low carbohydrates for the
date<00:06:14.999> because<00:06:15.270> I<00:06:15.419> was<00:06:15.569> food<00:06:15.810> shopping

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
date because I was food shopping

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.980 
date because I was food shopping
yesterday<00:06:16.379> and<00:06:16.860> I<00:06:17.490> was<00:06:17.639> looking<00:06:17.969> and<00:06:18.210> like

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
yesterday and I was looking and like

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.709 
yesterday and I was looking and like
some<00:06:19.259> of<00:06:19.289> the<00:06:19.409> things<00:06:19.650> had<00:06:19.830> like<00:06:20.009> 70<00:06:20.879> grams<00:06:21.300> of

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
some of the things had like 70 grams of

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:23.360 
some of the things had like 70 grams of
carbohydrates<00:06:22.469> in<00:06:22.589> them<00:06:22.770> and<00:06:22.949> I'm<00:06:23.039> like<00:06:23.219> I'm

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
carbohydrates in them and I'm like I'm

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.850 
carbohydrates in them and I'm like I'm
almost<00:06:23.669> 70<00:06:24.060> grams<00:06:24.300> translates<00:06:24.870> to<00:06:25.080> but<00:06:25.710> some

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
almost 70 grams translates to but some

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.189 
almost 70 grams translates to but some
have<00:06:26.039> zero<00:06:26.310> grams<00:06:26.610> like<00:06:27.509> for<00:06:27.689> example<00:06:27.749> the

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
have zero grams like for example the

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.839 
have zero grams like for example the
bowl<00:06:28.379> of<00:06:28.589> cereal<00:06:28.830> I<00:06:29.099> just<00:06:29.310> ate<00:06:29.430> probably<00:06:29.610> had

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
bowl of cereal I just ate probably had

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:32.570 
bowl of cereal I just ate probably had
41<00:06:30.180> grams<00:06:30.599> of<00:06:30.719> carbohydrates<00:06:31.439> but<00:06:32.219> it<00:06:32.460> was

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
41 grams of carbohydrates but it was

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.040 
41 grams of carbohydrates but it was
high<00:06:32.729> in<00:06:32.849> fiber<00:06:33.089> so<00:06:33.300> I<00:06:33.360> decided<00:06:33.659> to<00:06:33.810> eat<00:06:33.870> it

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
high in fiber so I decided to eat it

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.679 
high in fiber so I decided to eat it
anyway<00:06:34.490> I<00:06:35.490> didn't<00:06:35.909> bother<00:06:35.999> to<00:06:36.240> look<00:06:36.389> what<00:06:36.569> the

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:36.689 
anyway I didn't bother to look what the

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.230 
anyway I didn't bother to look what the
milk<00:06:36.899> had<00:06:37.110> so<00:06:37.949> uh<00:06:37.979> I<00:06:38.370> guess<00:06:38.699> I<00:06:38.849> had<00:06:38.939> to<00:06:39.059> consider

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
milk had so uh I guess I had to consider

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.969 
milk had so uh I guess I had to consider
drinking<00:06:39.749> a<00:06:39.809> glass<00:06:39.960> of<00:06:40.199> milk<00:06:40.439> with<00:06:40.529> the<00:06:40.740> bowl

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 
drinking a glass of milk with the bowl

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:45.800 
drinking a glass of milk with the bowl
of<00:06:41.129> cereal<00:06:43.159> but<00:06:44.159> if<00:06:44.339> the<00:06:44.639> milks<00:06:44.939> super<00:06:45.509> super

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
of cereal but if the milks super super

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.209 
of cereal but if the milks super super
bad<00:06:45.960> I<00:06:45.990> could<00:06:46.349> always<00:06:46.469> just<00:06:46.740> throw<00:06:46.889> the<00:06:47.009> milk

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:47.219 
bad I could always just throw the milk

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.399 
bad I could always just throw the milk
away<00:06:47.339> after<00:06:47.879> eating<00:06:48.089> the<00:06:48.270> cereal<00:06:48.479> later<00:06:48.839> on<00:06:49.080> I

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 
away after eating the cereal later on I

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.260 
away after eating the cereal later on I
don't<00:06:50.279> know<00:06:50.430> I<00:06:50.669> don't<00:06:50.879> know<00:06:50.969> what<00:06:51.089> the<00:06:51.149> best

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
don't know I don't know what the best

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.519 
don't know I don't know what the best
