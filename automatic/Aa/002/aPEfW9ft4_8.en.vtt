00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hard disk during the installation of 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.920
 completely overwrite windows 7 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.140
 want and not just the partition 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.230
 delete and restore the table 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 then you want to do the following and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.120
 although I start here now at the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.370
 installation 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.619
 I have male system but that the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.390
 steps should be the same on 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.900
 in which I start here now 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.279
 to accept the license agreement 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.439
 and then in the next step the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.599
 custom installation 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.070
 select 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.769
 I'll do it this way and now we will 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.570
 my available partition on the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.380
 hard disk is displayed there is a small one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.730
 partition up to 100 megabytes in size 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.590
 We are not interested in that at first 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.140
 one for system management windows 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.750
 and then there is a second partition 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.320
 that's a lot bigger that's the primary 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.780
 partition there is also behind here 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.399
 treasury thus primarily it about 60 gb 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.860
 Big is maybe different with you 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.329
 but the distance is so similar 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.680
 So a relatively large one relatively 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.800
 small partitions on the course 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.969
 big partition means that this one 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.660
 are in principle all personal 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.680
 data on it 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.570
 and now there is the possibility 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.189
 here this siehts now be seen from 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.470
 already selected and here too 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.350
 format to press 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.360
 then in principle but only the file 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.920
 assignment table deleted and not the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.500
 actual data on the hard disk 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.700
 they are still there if you are now 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.170
 want to be sure of number and all 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.909
 data completely down then want 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.210
 does not help you this format option 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.320
 Next I want to leave here now you have to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.790
 do the following now and then 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.939
 hard disk to format completely and 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.689
 Although now presses on his keyboard 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:40.920
 shift and f10 then you go one like that 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.270
 command line and then had to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.170
 actually only following steps I do 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.700
 do not go on now 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.590
 individual commands but how 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.119
 perform simple now at or 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 until now so you now 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.390
 first the program diskpart on call 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:00.119
 you just enter it and move center 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.700
 the couple and then we are in this 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.560
 part in it is also displayed here now 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.399
 how the computer got hot and now 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.009
 Here's another commando 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.450
 input line we do now and then 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.330
 actually only the following and indeed choose 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.350
 we now first the hard drive out 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.130
 you 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.450
 will perform actions so 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.770
 now we have to format 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.450
 first watch what hard drives have 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:26.800
 I ever had to and now 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:29.470
 lets enter the center then is now 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.270
 here a hard disk disc 0 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.190
 that means also with this one 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.980
 Blank is there again 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.569
 overall size it is now from the 60 and 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.450
 we have to pick that one now and that 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.860
 Let's just type in now 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.930
 select and now the name of zero so 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.280
 also with the distance here exactly the name 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.170
 who in principle you stand he could at 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.300
 you also be different but that is in 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.720
 principle exactly this name so cellectis 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.400
 Knoll should enter then he stands here too 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.340
 now is zero is an electrician 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.260
 was selected now and on the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.670
 hard disk, there are now these two 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.590
 Partitions we also nonsense and with 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.060
 have seen the other window and there 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.350
 we must now look again and 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.580
 check how hot and though 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.400
 have to enter now once 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:18.489
 the part of exactly this command as well 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.130
 he there is the technology center now 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.410
 we come to a few values un-specified 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.150
 But what is crucial here in this 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.440
 this table these two details here 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:33.180
 and that there are now only two 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.100
 we want in 21 and volume 2 and indeed 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.980
 in the view just graphic 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.540
 100 megabytes and 59 works and we 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.630
 I want to join the big coalition now 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.890
 that means with the 59 gigabytes 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.239
 tradition and we have to do that now 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.670
 Again we take that is one 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.470
 principle browsing the markets and 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.480
 this name what now here volume 2 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.290
 and then we just do it the following 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.980
 and we give a select william 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.320
 Take care so that you are with the two 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.959
 So the larger league-wide sizes will suit us 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.720
 not give with 100 megabytes but the 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.220
 59 is here in two could at 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.019
 you also change your name but 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.850
 should actually follow two or one 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.260
 Anyway, stay in the right direction 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.090
 electron at 2 under new 2 is the 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.159
 selective so was selected 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.720
 so now we are basically on exactly 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:25.720
 They want that means all of you 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.470
 work and we format the data 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.570
 now and make true 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.360
 the following now we give one 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.380
 blank format 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.100
 it stands 5 1 system so file system is 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.670
 ntfs ntfs is the type of 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.420
 file system so n tv system is called that 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.570
 blank and then we can now 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.560
 one more designation given 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.870
 that is the name as well as the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.520
 example in a drive c or web.de 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.500
 or walk still have names 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.600
 windows 7 or what you can do there now 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.860
 a give label is the same 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.630
 quotes above 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.090
 and now you can use the name 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:11.110
 I call that windows now 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.780
 just more signs and that was it 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.110
 bp must now be a type format 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.330
 final fs equals ntfs blank 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.860
 label is the same as quotes above 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.580
 then the name can blank as well 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.270
 then be in it 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.060
 and again blank and right there 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.210
 must stand in quotation marks yes 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.980
 and then just press enter and 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.290
 then the formatting is quasi 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.150
 and that is not done now 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.410
 just pressed the file assignment table 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.770
 deleted but the complete 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:49.290
 hard disk is overwritten with zeros 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:51.100
 and exactly and is in principle a kind 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.140
 and I want me right now 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.790
 time runs now through this 6% now 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.710
 finished I'll get the same again 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.990
 if there are fans now jump 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.190
 forward so so I have now 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.250
 have the time had the time now 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.600
 once played and that is the 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.200
 formatting already at 95 percent 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.850
 that means this completed and me 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.400
 showed just the rest 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:18.580
 steps still to be done to 100 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.229
 percent finished so that is now 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.100
 down here on the park the polyphone 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:25.200
 volume so that's the part 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.280
 completed 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.650
 then you can now basically just 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.419
 close the window 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.380
 So I know over here that means we 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.770
 just do not have to do that now 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.180
 experts on the small but that goes 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.460
 also to now again and again at the 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.280
 where we were before and now 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.830
 must update the once here 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.190
 or press refresh then it takes 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.190
 one moment 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.879
 so and now you are in principle 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.680
 still these two partition 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.389
 displayed on the size has changed 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.710
 Of course, nothing changes what you are now 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:18.590
 probably have changed 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.000
 could be the partition 2 is called now 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.259
 in principle, windows I have with yes 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.900
 specified this formatting step 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:25.280
 as a label so I said the same label 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.150
 quotes windows 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.370
 quotation marks 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.590
 that's how the name is now and now 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.860
 is that formatted that is this 60 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.810
 gigabyte petition was now in principle 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.300
 completely overwritten and is now in 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.009
 principle that is the complicated that 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.029
 install operating system and now 

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:44.710
 it simply lacks this principle 

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:48.139
 position here and keep pushing 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:50.270
 and can with the rest of the installation 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:54.879
 then proceed as normal as that 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:57.529
 otherwise it would have been the case 

00:07:54.879 --> 00:08:00.050
 I hope that was understandable if you 

00:07:57.529 --> 00:08:01.909
 you can ask the comments 

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.050
 like to write something and otherwise 

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:05.050
 I wish you much fun
