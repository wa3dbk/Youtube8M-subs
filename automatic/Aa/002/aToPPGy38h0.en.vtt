00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
it if I want to but I don't I don't use

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.790 
it if I want to but I don't I don't use
it<00:00:39.540> much<00:00:39.690> now<00:00:39.899> because<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> royal

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800

it much now because I have the royal
version<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.300> came<00:00:42.540> missing<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> cover

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
version this one came missing the cover

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.670 
version this one came missing the cover
as<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.430> often<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.329> belt<00:00:45.510> cover<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.410> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
as they often do the belt cover so this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.959 
as they often do the belt cover so this
actually<00:00:47.010> belongs<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.700> Dirt<00:00:47.940> Devil

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
version but I'm just kind of sharing

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.830 
version but I'm just kind of sharing
them<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:50.969> use<00:00:51.180> them<00:00:51.329> both<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.629> same

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.979 
them I don't use them both at the same
time<00:00:51.870> anyway<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.640> haven't<00:00:54.239> purchased<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
time anyway and so I haven't purchased a
new<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.289> yet<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.500> right<00:00:56.100> now<00:00:56.399> they're<00:00:56.579> just

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
gonna share by very similar machines as

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.450 
gonna share by very similar machines as
far<00:01:00.329> as<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> form<00:01:00.780> factor<00:01:00.989> goes<00:01:01.399> of<00:01:02.399> course

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
far as the form factor goes of course

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
it sounds better it's just a more

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.020 
it sounds better it's just a more
quality<00:01:06.750> feel<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.290> older<00:01:07.700> this<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:08.909> it's

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
quality feel it's older this one it's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.609 
quality feel it's older this one it's
sold<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.570> even<00:01:09.780> has<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.290> port

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
sold that it even has the little port

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.320 
sold that it even has the little port
for<00:01:10.830> oiling<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.400> unscrew<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.939> screw<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
for oiling if you unscrew that screw you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.640 
for oiling if you unscrew that screw you
can<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.570> add<00:01:12.810> oil<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> motor<00:01:13.470> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
can actually add oil to the motor and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.750 
can actually add oil to the motor and
there's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> place<00:01:14.010> inside<00:01:14.340> where<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.610> do

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
there's a place inside where you can do

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.539 
there's a place inside where you can do
that<00:01:14.880> as<00:01:15.000> well<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:16.350> bag<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.979> kind<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.310> old

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
that as well but this bag is kind of old

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.460 
that as well but this bag is kind of old
so<00:01:17.970> it'll<00:01:18.180> it'll<00:01:18.479> leak<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.780> dust<00:01:18.990> whenever<00:01:19.409> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
so it'll it'll leak and dust whenever I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.370 
so it'll it'll leak and dust whenever I
turn<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.220> get<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:20.700> poof<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
turn it on I get a little poof but the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
turn it on I get a little poof but the
switch<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:23.070> both<00:01:23.220> machines<00:01:23.630> the<00:01:24.630> bag

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
switch is here on both machines the bag

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
switch is here on both machines the bag
is<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> shake<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.380> bag<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.770> both<00:01:25.890> machines<00:01:26.250> so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
is a shake up bag on both machines so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.270 
is a shake up bag on both machines so
you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.850> paper<00:01:27.060> kits<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.659> them<00:01:28.280> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you can get paper kits for them the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.950 
you can get paper kits for them the
brushroll<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.850> very<00:01:30.180> similar<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.750> both

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
brushroll is very similar on both

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.359 
brushroll is very similar on both
machines<00:01:33.020> let's<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
machines let's see if I can just kind of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.580 
machines let's see if I can just kind of
compare<00:01:35.729> these<00:01:35.880> two<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.049> does<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.380> have

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
compare these two this one does not have

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.069 
compare these two this one does not have
the<00:01:37.740> full<00:01:37.920> guard<00:01:38.369> on<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> bottom<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.180> don't

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
the full guard on the bottom I don't

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.929 
the full guard on the bottom I don't
like<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.470> because<00:01:40.650> sometimes<00:01:40.979> it'll<00:01:41.310> kind

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
like that because sometimes it'll kind

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.600 
like that because sometimes it'll kind
of<00:01:42.000> stick<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> surface<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:43.649> kind<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.130> drags<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
of stick to a surface it kind of drags a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.789 
of stick to a surface it kind of drags a
little<00:01:44.820> bit<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.689> easy<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.960> push

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
little bit so it's not as easy to push

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
little bit so it's not as easy to push
as<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.159> would<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.340> if<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:48.119> didn't<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.540> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
as it would be if it didn't have that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.950 
as it would be if it didn't have that
but<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> other<00:01:51.210> oil<00:01:51.390> port<00:01:51.869> I

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
but I think that's the other oil port I

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.270 
but I think that's the other oil port I
think<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> over<00:01:52.740> well<00:01:52.860> there<00:01:53.040> when<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
think I get it over well there when I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
think I get it over well there when I
bought<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.450> had<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.750> very<00:01:54.930> long

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
bought it but I'm not had it very long

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.179 
bought it but I'm not had it very long
but<00:01:56.009> these<00:01:56.219> are<00:01:56.340> both<00:01:56.490> fun<00:01:56.759> vacuums<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.409> use

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
but these are both fun vacuums and I use

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.740 
but these are both fun vacuums and I use
them<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.850> cat<00:02:00.090> hair<00:02:00.270> off<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
them just to get cat hair off of the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.569 
them just to get cat hair off of the
different<00:02:01.380> surfaces<00:02:01.560> like<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> chair<00:02:02.399> or<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
different surfaces like the chair or the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.300 
different surfaces like the chair or the
couch<00:02:02.850> or<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.450> ottoman<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.100> are<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> lot

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
couch or the ottoman and there are a lot

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.340 
couch or the ottoman and there are a lot
of<00:02:05.340> fun<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.820> play<00:02:05.939> with<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.869> there's<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.140> lot<00:02:07.259> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
of fun to play with if there's a lot of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.719 
of fun to play with if there's a lot of
sand<00:02:07.590> they'll<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.099> kick<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> dirt

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
sand they'll actually kick the dirt

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.940 
sand they'll actually kick the dirt
around<00:02:09.000> because<00:02:09.420> they<00:02:10.140> have<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> fan<00:02:10.649> first

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
around because they have a fan first

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.240 
around because they have a fan first
system<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.550> can<00:02:11.670> see<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> fan<00:02:12.150> in

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
system you can see the fan in

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.000 
system you can see the fan in
you<00:02:14.030> know<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.569> so<00:02:15.170> they'll<00:02:15.470> kick<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.860> dirt

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
you know and so they'll kick the dirt

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.490 
you know and so they'll kick the dirt
around<00:02:16.310> if<00:02:16.489> it's<00:02:16.670> very<00:02:16.940> sandy<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.840> tried<00:02:18.349> to

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
around if it's very sandy I tried to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.229 
around if it's very sandy I tried to
vacuum<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.950> car<00:02:19.340> out<00:02:19.459> one<00:02:19.610> time<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:19.970> had<00:02:20.060> been

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.259 
on they're so tight that when you pull
it<00:03:46.010> it'll<00:03:46.250> rip<00:03:46.489> right<00:03:46.730> here<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.060> I've<00:03:47.120> already

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
machines because it was cheaper to do

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.240 
machines because it was cheaper to do
that<00:03:50.959> than<00:03:51.110> buying<00:03:51.440> a<00:03:51.530> whole<00:03:51.650> new<00:03:51.680> bag<00:03:51.920> off<00:03:52.129> the
