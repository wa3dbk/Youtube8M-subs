00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.150
 and good morning everyone 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.260
 find for a new video so 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.140
 today I presented you a basic 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.520
 hd for hdv 7.2 farm so a base of 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.350
 farm to complete this already what he 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.789
 must know the dixie tank in black 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.560
 centered so that's really very very 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.760
 important then know morty 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.230
 cover a wide I looked at myself the 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.789
 placement of mortars makes that one covers 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.440
 the whole base so that's really 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.690
 very interesting with our three mortars 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.879
 so this is an investment that is 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.410
 relatively interesting and look into 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.760
 done from the top ie between them 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.170
 somehow an open base 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.370
 so basically with my two rounds of 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.329
 wizard when troops to what there is 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.829
 will have a lot of groups that have arrived 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.610
 from the top when you are arriving 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.620
 the exit towers will be able to 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.270
 recover everything that happens and destroy 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.320
 a lot easier and then I 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.730
 so placed cannons that are at 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.780
 the outside is actually the advantage of 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.280
 these cannons know that it will allow to 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.360
 divert the giants so this is the 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.010
 giants who come in a year or that we 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.450
 place by the high side in paris if they 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.950
 will take the trap traps 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.850
 springs that are on the sides and one 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.320
 know they'll do it all the way 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.520
 dabaaz looked at and bypassed they 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.600
 do not even get his share by this little 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.930
 path is still resumes 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.940
 trap 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.210
 so that's with troops of the type 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.439
 giant they will bypass the base without 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.640
 tackle the inside and 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.299
 the interior is where we find 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.650
 all resources 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.930
 so that's why this base is 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.040
 relatively interesting so what we 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.750
 can also say on this basis is that 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.070
 castle of clans and castle of time and 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.630
 center and so that is to say that for 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.490
 to get out the troops that has in it 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.330
 is very complicated we will talk about it 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.520
 will be going out so 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.960
 conventional so here are prepared 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.040
 a few more troops to do them 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.390
 to get out of others in general when you are 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.520
 attack fit and instead preferred 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.420
 attack the city hall rather than 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.610
 tackle your base 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.990
 so me it's the one I created and 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.130
 I lost very few resources with 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.240
 so it's a base in all a few 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.549
 month I recommend you if you want 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.439
 close in hd v7 our friends all from 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.640
 following with a small replay of attac that 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.439
 I had against this base so there 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.909
 I still did not have my king world 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.560
 wake up but it's true that I'm getting 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.780
 almost attack and that my hotel's 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.829
 city so it's true that I have 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.990
 not many confess presence of more 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.159
 so again we have seen that they have tried 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.180
 to go out finds her other cat 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.590
 plans now they can not anymore 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.790
 can not do it anymore because 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.259
 I like is able even and four 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.909
 workers huts so this place is 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.869
 So stuck watching it failed to 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.369
 get the troops out of the castle 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.079
 clan he caught the spring trap 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.159
 as you explain so with all 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.810
 my castle troops of clans who are 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.039
 behind I weight very destroy 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.929
 easily never looked at the bomb 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.189
 thrown damage she did on all her 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.939
 group two giants so even though he's at 

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.560
 100 hours of care 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.999
 I have all my troops from the castle of 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.940
 clans that are on it and so it's going 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:20.010
 very easily destroy these giants 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.900
 so that's really a base that's 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.160
 relatively effective since redemption 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.780
 everything concentrated it's true that until 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.550
 hd if it's impossible to protect his 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.080
 castle of clans and here we arrive in hd 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.400
 v7 with a bass which is a castle of 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.690
 in this center is so I had 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.710
 a lot of writing black and I 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.170
 managed to keep it to be able to 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.980
 recover my king so in any case me 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.230
 it is a basis that I recommend 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.460
 so there is no longer a single giant in 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.630
 the opposing troops I have more than 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.280
 troops in the clan castle but that 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.960
 it's not a problem but look at it 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.800
 he remains more than a few wizard he 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.270
 attack my castle clans at 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.380
 final look at the resources to fly 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.450
 my fly than 10000 gold and 5000 elixir 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.520
 while there was potential and who 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.800
 is the money superior to steal so in 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.850
 any case that's for this replay me in 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.560
 Anyway I hope that this base you 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.100
 will please for those who are hdv 7 and who 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.380
 want to train 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.820
 she is really very efficient so we 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.350
 go this game you leave it on it actually 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.760
 it's going to be long, we're finishing on a 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.590
 speedboat so as usual if you 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.090
 are interested in this base you 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.860
 you can copy it at the same time 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.940
 that I realize it for you and then we 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.770
 just end up at the end of the video 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.100

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.100
 see you soon 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.960
 So here we finished for this base 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.950
 from farm to activate this I hope that 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.820
