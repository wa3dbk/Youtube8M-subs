00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:07.649
 here is the first video and the for 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.870
 all the people who have had the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.130
 kindness to write to us on facebook 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.490
 and it is for them that I will try to 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.690
 speak 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.320
 that's why I'm going to try 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.910
 to intervene to let them know a little 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:26.789
 what I feel after so many years 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:30.500
 of exercise of classical medicine the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.930
 journey was happy the world 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.430
 academic two years of teaching 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.070
 at the faculty of medicine and of course a 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.550
 installation where I practiced the orl in 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.440
 as doctors and surgeons 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.260
 I was very very happy with what I 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 did and for me everything could be 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.140
 cured and cured by chemistry by 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.870
 tablets until we have 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.640
 started to find that in some 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.160
 case and of which a lot of cases that does not 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.649
 did not work and I started well 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.390
 sure to try to see s who did not have 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.070
 something else that has been used elsewhere 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.030
 and there by chance 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.369
 there was a course on culture made 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.619
 by the teacher of arras and this 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.509
 goes back more than thirty years 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.080
 assisted in this training 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.270
 I was very interested at the time but 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.000
 of course saw my training I was not 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.189
 inclined to practice acupuncture because 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.890
 that from time to time it happened to me 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.700
 when it did not work in the case of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.040
 classical music 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.110
 I'm trying some needles at 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.700
 the ear or sometimes at the body level 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.770
 was giving results sometimes it's not 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.659
 no and gradually I came across 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.399
 what's called chromotherapy the 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.979
 color therapy so that was it 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.780
 there on the sight of a book and when I 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.100
 saw the author I phoned the author 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.899
 to tell him but how can you 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.299
 to treat with color is not 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.909
 believable that and even manu told me you 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.540
 Just come to see Paris I am 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.240
 party in paris 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.130
 actually I did a training of 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.810
 chromotherapy, that is tera 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.580
 feet by the color and I had 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.500
 the opportunity to practice in the office so 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.400
 I include them in my practice 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.959
 daily 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.810
 let's do classical medicine which I 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.180
 continues prescribed drugs and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.909
 from time to time when the cases were 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.829
 a bit very particular using the 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.450
 color we could have very good 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.280
 results 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.129
 so my mind starts to be attracting 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.959
 more and more towards these trades that we 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.890
 call alternative medicine trades 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.909
 complementary alternative medicines 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.590
 currently a few years after I 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.810
 got to find out what's called 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.170
 the subject in the subject how open a 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.599
 door 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.239
 extraordinary is the project the 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.659
 johan term professor he's I the 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.739
 thanks for the quality of his training 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.109
 with all the people who will have 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.409
 the occasion that under the wish will be 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.049
 train I would tell them where 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.959
 address 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.450
 I had results absolutely 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.620
 wonderful in cases where really 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.920
 everything I knew did not work 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.959
 after the the subject therapy he gets 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.579
 always presented cases where the 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.829
 nobody 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.290
 despite everything we had done despite 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.720
 all the treatments she had taken 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.040
 despite everything the surroundings of others 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.060
 alternative medicine it did not work 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.829
 not and there was a need to address a 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.409
 higher level of consciousness to know 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.120
 that it was necessary to address the body 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.819
 subtle of the person what are the 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.729
 subtle bodies you have to know that 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.479
 parallel to our material body there 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:47.340
 to energy fields that are at 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:50.269
 the interest of the body and outside the 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.010
 gold body these energetic fields 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.379
 drive electronic currents to 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.959
 the surface and the interest of the body and 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.569
 if there are blockages at these level 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.400
 electronic circuits 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.129
 it's going to translate into symptoms that 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.790
 feels the patient and if you 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:11.549
 do not take action on these blockages 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.760
 the person will keep his pain will keep 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.549
 his symptom so by working on these 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.779
 energy fields 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.340
 we could even distance from the body 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.510
 to get sent thanks by 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.960
 via the 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.930
 and singing a teammate man's hands 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.560
 an energy an energy full of 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.030
 vitality 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:39.120
 what's called bio vital energy that 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.880
 helps clean up the congestions that has 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.640
 at the level of the energy field of a 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.240
 person and replace it with a singing 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.710
 of vitality quite fresh and new 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.720
 which is available just 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.080
 to learn to connect to this 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.260
 energy there and the person as per 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.240
 miracle she sees her pain fades 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.100
 and and sometimes even and often 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.870
 disappear 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.930
 so when we see that for the first time 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.220
 we say to each other but what is this? 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.070
 that we missed a lot of 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.720
 things in actually does us 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.910
 let's miss out on a lot of things 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.250
 wonderful ones that are part of the body 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.940
 human the human body is a wonder 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.830
 and it's time now to lean 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.260
 on these different ways of 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.200
 operate to better understand it 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.440
 better communicate with him it does not matter 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:35.630
 not always to interfere or act on 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:39.660
 the symptom by pushing the body to 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.170
 react inappropriately because the 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.270
 symptom 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.880
 he's here to teach us something 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.350
 thing often the symptom is there for 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.340
 tell us that we are not on 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:54.090
 our way are the way of our soul and 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.800
 correcting only the symptom or 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.700
 by attenuating it, we let it evolve 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.930
 some things 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:03.720
 on the other hand by acting within the framework of 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.360
 the intelligence of the body one surrenders 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.670
 account that the body a lot of things 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.540
 to tell us that ultimately this is 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.520
 that a rape 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.270
 in fact the diseases what we always have 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.580
 called disease are just a dialogue of the 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.920
 body and the times we change from 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.980
 way to see the body and it's time 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.890
 we have a new air called 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.620
 a new paradigm in fact it's a 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:31.350
 other level of consciousness that makes that 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.600
 the body is currently considered 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.190
 like a wonder all the works 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.249
 currently underway scientists 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.979
 converge in this direction 

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:42.679
 a lot of books are written by 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.809
 different authors from different countries and 

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:47.779
 all converge to say that he is 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:51.169
 now to believe that we can 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:53.989
 to cure nothing with chemistry and that he 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:56.509
 is time to understand that chemistry does not 

00:06:53.989 --> 00:06:58.969
 only one part of the body to know 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:01.939
 the material body and that the nine 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:04.869
 tenths of the body are body 

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:07.909
 invisible and that they are the responsibility 

00:07:04.869 --> 00:07:12.849
 other therapeutic techniques and to 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:12.849
 soon for the next session
