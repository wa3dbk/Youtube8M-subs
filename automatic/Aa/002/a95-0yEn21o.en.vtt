00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
able to go into Mali or another country

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.280 
able to go into Mali or another country
to<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> level<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.710> French<00:02:04.890> did<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
to the level that the French did and

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.479 
to the level that the French did and
we've<00:02:07.290> been<00:02:07.469> talking<00:02:07.799> about<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.069> rapid

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
we've been talking about a rapid

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.580 
we've been talking about a rapid
deployment<00:02:08.610> force<00:02:09.209> for<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> long<00:02:09.660> time<00:02:09.929> but<00:02:10.560> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
deployment force for a long time but I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.440 
deployment force for a long time but I
guess<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> situation<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.790> Mali<00:02:11.940> has<00:02:12.270> put

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
guess that the situation in Mali has put

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.890 
guess that the situation in Mali has put
it<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.690> that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it on that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.800 
it on that
of<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.200> agenda<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:13.799> and<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:15.030> guess<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.480> we

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
of the agenda now and I guess that we

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.509 
of the agenda now and I guess that we
are<00:02:15.870> prioritizing<00:02:16.079> that<00:02:16.709> as<00:02:16.980> an<00:02:17.129> issue<00:02:17.280> we

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
are prioritizing that as an issue we

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.420 
are prioritizing that as an issue we
need<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.730> deal<00:02:18.000> with<00:02:18.269> continent-wide<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.650> so

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
need to deal with continent-wide and so

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.509 
need to deal with continent-wide and so
there's<00:02:21.269> going<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.450> be<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.599> meeting<00:02:21.870> shortly<00:02:22.769> to

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
there's going to be a meeting shortly to

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.699 
there's going to be a meeting shortly to
discuss<00:02:24.329> putting<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:25.019> place<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.290> rapid

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
discuss putting in place a rapid

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.559 
discuss putting in place a rapid
deployment<00:02:25.829> force<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.549> be<00:02:26.640> able<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.909> do<00:02:27.060> the

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
deployment force to be able to do the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.059 
deployment force to be able to do the
kind<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.930> rapid<00:02:28.290> intervention<00:02:28.829> that<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
kind of rapid intervention that the

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.089 
kind of rapid intervention that the
French<00:02:29.370> did<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.480> certainly<00:02:30.810> all<00:02:31.099> countries

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
French did but certainly all countries

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.789 
French did but certainly all countries
are<00:02:32.310> committed<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.970> contributing<00:02:33.930> troops<00:02:34.590> in

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
are committed to contributing troops in

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.160 
are committed to contributing troops in
case<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.549> emergency<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.420> often<00:02:36.689> you<00:02:36.840> need<00:02:37.109> a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
case of emergency but often you need a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.710 
case of emergency but often you need a
fast<00:02:37.879> interventionist<00:02:38.879> force<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.480> know<00:02:39.659> to

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
fast interventionist force you know to

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.809 
fast interventionist force you know to
stabilize<00:02:40.409> the<00:02:40.560> situation<00:02:41.099> before<00:02:41.609> you

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
stabilize the situation before you

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.640 
stabilize the situation before you
inject<00:02:42.239> troops<00:02:42.510> molly<00:02:42.810> was<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.079> successful

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
inject troops molly was a successful

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.500 
inject troops molly was a successful
operation<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:44.459> we're<00:02:44.849> going<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.090> look<00:02:45.180> at<00:02:45.329> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
operation and we're going to look at the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.149 
operation and we're going to look at the
experience<00:02:46.139> gathered<00:02:46.440> from<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.859> and

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
experience gathered from that and

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.430 
experience gathered from that and
probably<00:02:47.459> apply<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.299> other<00:02:48.420> theatres<00:02:48.959> but

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
probably apply it in other theatres but

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.490 
probably apply it in other theatres but
I<00:02:49.500> believe<00:02:49.799> that<00:02:49.829> over<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.370> years<00:02:50.760> Africa<00:02:51.500> has

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
I believe that over the years Africa has

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.750 
I believe that over the years Africa has
been<00:02:52.709> looked<00:02:53.129> as<00:02:53.400> as<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.629> continent<00:02:55.590> where<00:02:55.829> you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
been looked as as a continent where you

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.580 
been looked as as a continent where you
know<00:02:56.909> nothing<00:02:57.480> good<00:02:57.659> can<00:02:57.810> come<00:02:57.870> out<00:02:58.049> of<00:02:58.170> and

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
know nothing good can come out of and

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.300 
know nothing good can come out of and
this<00:02:59.519> perception<00:03:00.480> has<00:03:00.689> been<00:03:01.250> reinforced<00:03:02.250> by

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
this perception has been reinforced by

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.250 
this perception has been reinforced by
the<00:03:02.459> kinds<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.060> images<00:03:03.599> that<00:03:03.629> are<00:03:03.870> shown<00:03:04.079> on

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
the kinds of images that are shown on

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.740 
the kinds of images that are shown on
the<00:03:04.379> international<00:03:05.000> networks<00:03:06.000> you<00:03:06.599> know

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
the international networks you know

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.860 
the international networks you know
showing<00:03:07.489> children<00:03:08.489> starving<00:03:08.909> you<00:03:09.720> know

showing children starving you know
showing<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:11.159> continent<00:03:11.909> wracked<00:03:12.299> by<00:03:12.420> hiv/aids

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
showing a continent wracked by hiv/aids

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.190 
showing a continent wracked by hiv/aids
you<00:03:14.040> know<00:03:14.189> showing<00:03:14.870> economies<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.139> are

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
you know showing economies that are

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.520 
you know showing economies that are
stagnated<00:03:17.099> or<00:03:17.540> contracting<00:03:18.540> but<00:03:19.139> I<00:03:19.199> believe

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
stagnated or contracting but I believe

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.960 
stagnated or contracting but I believe
there's<00:03:19.949> something<00:03:20.129> new<00:03:20.430> happening<00:03:20.459> in

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
Africa and the international media need

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.530 
Africa and the international media need
to<00:03:24.569> showcase<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:25.260> but<00:03:25.799> there<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.940> category

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
to showcase that but there is a category

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.520 
to showcase that but there is a category
of<00:03:28.400> organizations<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.760> drive<00:03:30.389> on<00:03:30.720> showing

these kinds of images because they raise

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.860 
these kinds of images because they raise

continent is moving on Africa is in need

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.270 
continent is moving on Africa is in need
of<00:03:54.479> opportunities<00:03:55.260> Africa<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:55.829> standing<00:03:56.190> on

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
of opportunities Africa is standing on

of opportunities Africa is standing on
its<00:03:56.489> feet<00:03:56.699> there<00:03:57.090> are<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.209> lot<00:03:57.359> of<00:03:57.389> success

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
its feet there are a lot of success

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.569 
its feet there are a lot of success
stories<00:03:57.930> coming<00:03:58.470> out<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.829> the<00:03:58.919> continent<00:03:59.370> and
