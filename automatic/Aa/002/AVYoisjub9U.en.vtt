sync all events and I think that's about

sync all events and I think that's about
it<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.520> then<00:03:28.150> inside<00:03:28.570> a<00:03:28.630> message<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:30.459> want<00:03:30.670> to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
it and then inside a message you want to

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.340 
it and then inside a message you want to
go<00:03:30.880> ahead<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.300> you<00:03:31.360> know<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:31.780> turn<00:03:31.989> on<00:03:32.170> a

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
go ahead and you know and turn on a

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.150 
go ahead and you know and turn on a
message<00:03:33.390> send<00:03:34.390> as<00:03:34.600> SMS<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.709> want<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:35.950> turn<00:03:36.130> off

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
message send as SMS you want to turn off

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.660 
message send as SMS you want to turn off
the<00:03:36.400> group<00:03:36.550> messaging<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:39.190> want<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.459> turn

the group messaging and you want to turn
on<00:03:39.700> character<00:03:40.420> count<00:03:42.330> and<00:03:43.330> I<00:03:44.140> think<00:03:44.500> that's

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
on character count and I think that's

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.640 
on character count and I think that's
about<00:03:44.920> it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
about it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.690
