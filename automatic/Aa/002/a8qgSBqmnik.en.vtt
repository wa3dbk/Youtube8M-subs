00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
going across and trying to cut off that

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369 
going across and trying to cut off that
return<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.940> serve<00:00:48.120> I've<00:00:48.390> often<00:00:48.930> heard<00:00:49.260> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
return of serve I've often heard it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
return of serve I've often heard it
suggested<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.129> should<00:00:50.160> time<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.789> with

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
suggested that you should time that with

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.360 
suggested that you should time that with
the<00:00:51.239> bounce<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.870> serve<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.980> service

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the bounce of the serve in the service

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.510 
the bounce of the serve in the service
box<00:00:53.809> now<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.590> important<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.039> point<00:00:56.129> out<00:00:56.370> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
box now it's important to point out that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.990 
box now it's important to point out that
that<00:00:57.030> could<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.870> great<00:00:58.590> time<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:59.219> but<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
that could be a great time to go but the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
that could be a great time to go but the
problem<00:01:00.480> with<00:01:00.629> using<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.079> suggestion<00:01:01.710> is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
problem with using that suggestion is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.850 
problem with using that suggestion is
that<00:01:02.340> it's<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.420> completely<00:01:04.140> change

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that it's going to completely change

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.460 
that it's going to completely change
depending<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.939> how<00:01:06.210> fast<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.930> serve<00:01:07.170> your

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
depending on how fast of a serve your

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.340 
depending on how fast of a serve your
partner<00:01:07.799> has<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.909> have<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> slower<00:01:09.720> serve

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
partner has if they have a slower serve

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.740 
partner has if they have a slower serve
maybe<00:01:11.189> even<00:01:11.490> especially<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.970> second<00:01:12.510> serve

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
maybe even especially a second serve

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.420 
maybe even especially a second serve
they're<00:01:13.290> taking<00:01:13.710> some<00:01:13.920> off<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.130> they're

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
they're taking some off and they're

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.219 
they're taking some off and they're
really<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:15.000> trying<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> put<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.750> play<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
really just trying to put it in play and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.050 
really just trying to put it in play and
you're<00:01:16.770> looking<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.189> make<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> move<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.909> be

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
you're looking to make a move and be

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.469 
you're looking to make a move and be
aggressive<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:19.590> means<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.909> opponent

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
aggressive that means that the opponent

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.270 
aggressive that means that the opponent
the<00:01:21.750> returner<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.009> much<00:01:23.220> more

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the returner is going to have much more

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520 
the returner is going to have much more
time<00:01:23.850> between<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> ball<00:01:24.869> bounces<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
time between when the ball bounces and

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.990 
time between when the ball bounces and
when<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.770> actually<00:01:26.159> gets<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> their<00:01:26.610> racket

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
when it actually gets to their racket

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.569 
when it actually gets to their racket
and<00:01:27.119> they're<00:01:27.240> making<00:01:27.390> contact<00:01:28.460> they're<00:01:29.460> going

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and they're making contact they're going

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.950 
and they're making contact they're going
to<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> lot<00:01:29.939> more<00:01:29.970> time<00:01:30.390> if<00:01:30.750> your

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
to have a lot more time if your

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.830 
to have a lot more time if your
partner's<00:01:31.740> serve<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.430> slower<00:01:32.909> which<00:01:33.509> means

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
partner's serve is slower which means

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.410 
partner's serve is slower which means
that<00:01:34.110> if<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.350> time<00:01:34.680> your<00:01:34.710> poach<00:01:35.280> move<00:01:35.729> with

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that if you time your poach move with

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.990 
that if you time your poach move with
when<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.810> ball<00:01:36.990> lands<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> box<00:01:38.159> your

when the ball lands in the box your

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.609 
when the ball lands in the box your
opponent<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.540> returner<00:01:39.900> will<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.290> all

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.560 
the alley now again if your opponent has
I'm<00:01:46.710> sorry<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.250> partner<00:01:47.579> has<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> really

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
I'm sorry if your partner has a really

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.980 
I'm sorry if your partner has a really
nice<00:01:48.840> aggressive<00:01:49.790> confident<00:01:50.790> serve<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
nice aggressive confident serve then it

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.649 
nice aggressive confident serve then it
could<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.579> timing<00:01:54.090> would<00:01:54.210> work

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
could be that that timing would work

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.840 
could be that that timing would work
great<00:01:55.140> but<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.829> for<00:01:56.009> whatever<00:01:56.130> reason<00:01:56.369> their

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
great but if for whatever reason their

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.270 
great but if for whatever reason their
serve<00:01:57.090> slows<00:01:57.570> down<00:01:57.899> maybe<00:01:58.590> over<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.070> course

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
serve slows down maybe over the course

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.100 
serve slows down maybe over the course
of<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> match<00:01:59.700> or<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.450> said<00:02:00.509> before<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:01.079> a

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
of the match or as I said before with a

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.289 
of the match or as I said before with a
second<00:02:01.500> serve<00:02:01.680> it'll<00:02:02.219> totally<00:02:02.430> throw<00:02:02.880> off<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
second serve it'll totally throw off the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.270 
second serve it'll totally throw off the
timing<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.899> rhythm<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.770> were<00:02:04.890> working

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
timing and rhythm that you were working

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.740 
timing and rhythm that you were working
with<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.579> try<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.820> catch<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.360> returner

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
with to try to catch this returner

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.960 
with to try to catch this returner
off-guard<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.099> reason<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.489> don't

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
off-guard so for that reason I don't

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.510 
off-guard so for that reason I don't
like<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.599> general<00:02:10.080> suggestion<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.830> going

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
like the general suggestion of going

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.770 
like the general suggestion of going
with<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> balance<00:02:12.209> of<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> ball<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
with the balance of the ball in the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.760 
with the balance of the ball in the
service<00:02:13.080> box

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
service box

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.490 
service box
what<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.010> do<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.870> timing<00:02:15.870> your<00:02:15.990> movement

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
what I do like is timing your movement

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.710 
what I do like is timing your movement
with<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:18.150> initiation<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.230> forward<00:02:20.010> swing

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
with the initiation of the forward swing

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.050 
with the initiation of the forward swing
from<00:02:21.720> your<00:02:22.170> opponent<00:02:22.920> who's<00:02:23.070> returning<00:02:23.580> so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
from your opponent who's returning so

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.240 
from your opponent who's returning so
just<00:02:24.780> imagine<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.500> ball<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.710> bouncing

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
just imagine that the ball is bouncing

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.700 
just imagine that the ball is bouncing
in<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.370> box<00:02:26.640> your<00:02:27.420> opponent<00:02:28.020> is<00:02:28.080> identifying

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
in the box your opponent is identifying

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.200 
in the box your opponent is identifying
whether<00:02:28.950> or<00:02:29.040> not<00:02:29.130> it's<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.700> forehand<00:02:30.150> or

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
whether or not it's a forehand or

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.270 
whether or not it's a forehand or
backhand<00:02:30.540> they're<00:02:31.170> making<00:02:31.560> their<00:02:31.710> turn<00:02:31.980> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
backhand they're making their turn to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.710 
backhand they're making their turn to
that<00:02:32.430> side<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.850> their<00:02:33.000> body<00:02:33.120> they're<00:02:33.420> getting

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
that side of their body they're getting

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.780 
that side of their body they're getting
the<00:02:33.780> racket<00:02:34.110> set<00:02:34.290> up<00:02:34.440> what<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.430> would<00:02:35.610> suggest

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
the racket set up what I would suggest

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.490 
the racket set up what I would suggest
to<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.210> is<00:02:36.360> probably<00:02:36.810> being<00:02:37.020> the<00:02:37.110> best

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
to you is probably being the best

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.790 
to you is probably being the best
general<00:02:38.310> rule<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.580> thumb<00:02:38.960> for<00:02:39.960> timing<00:02:40.560> your

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
general rule of thumb for timing your

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.890 
general rule of thumb for timing your
poach<00:02:41.010> would<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.880> racket<00:02:42.270> starts<00:02:42.690> to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
poach would be as the racket starts to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.560 
poach would be as the racket starts to
drop<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.500> they<00:02:43.830> begin<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:44.370> make<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:45.030> forward

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
drop and they begin to make that forward

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.960 
drop and they begin to make that forward
swing<00:02:45.810> towards<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.260> ball<00:02:46.460> so<00:02:47.460> you've<00:02:47.640> got<00:02:47.820> the

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
swing towards the ball so you've got the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.790 
swing towards the ball so you've got the
amount<00:02:48.210> of<00:02:48.300> time<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.780> takes<00:02:48.930> takes<00:02:49.500> for

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
amount of time that it takes takes for

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.770 
amount of time that it takes takes for
them<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.340> drop<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.760> racket<00:02:51.120> get<00:02:51.330> get<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
them to drop the racket get get the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.720 
them to drop the racket get get the
racket<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.170> contact<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.920> then<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.400> course<00:02:53.430> the

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
racket to contact and then of course the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.070 
racket to contact and then of course the
amount<00:02:53.910> of<00:02:53.970> time<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.300> takes<00:02:54.420> for<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.750> racket

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
amount of time it takes for the racket

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.800 
amount of time it takes for the racket
to<00:02:55.170> come<00:02:55.440> I'm<00:02:56.340> sorry<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.850> takes<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.300> ball<00:02:57.570> to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
to come I'm sorry it takes the ball to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.560 
to come I'm sorry it takes the ball to
come<00:02:57.900> off<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.350> racket<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.240> actually<00:03:00.240> strike

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
come off the racket and actually strike

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.330 
come off the racket and actually strike
the<00:03:00.720> ball<00:03:00.840> across<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.650> where<00:03:01.770> you're<00:03:01.980> poaching

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
the ball across to where you're poaching

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.830 
the ball across to where you're poaching
and<00:03:02.700> making<00:03:02.940> your<00:03:03.030> move<00:03:03.210> to<00:03:03.360> try<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:03.570> cut<00:03:03.810> off

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
and making your move to try to cut off

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.380 
and making your move to try to cut off
that<00:03:04.110> return<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.560> serve<00:03:04.770> I<00:03:05.040> like<00:03:05.850> that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
that return of serve I like that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.890 
that return of serve I like that
time<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:08.310> make<00:03:08.430> your<00:03:08.610> move<00:03:08.670> because<00:03:09.270> at<00:03:09.630> that

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
time to make your move because at that

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.020 
time to make your move because at that
moment<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.470> time<00:03:10.500> your<00:03:10.860> opponent<00:03:11.070> has<00:03:11.460> already

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
moment in time your opponent has already

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.240 
moment in time your opponent has already
made<00:03:12.420> some<00:03:12.960> kind<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.260> commitment<00:03:13.560> as<00:03:13.890> far<00:03:14.130> as

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
made some kind of commitment as far as

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.860 
made some kind of commitment as far as
where<00:03:14.460> they<00:03:14.640> want<00:03:14.910> to<00:03:15.090> try<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.390> hit<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.690> ball

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
where they want to try to hit the ball

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.010 
where they want to try to hit the ball
so<00:03:16.760> we're<00:03:17.760> waiting<00:03:18.000> for<00:03:18.330> them<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.600> hopefully

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
so we're waiting for them to hopefully

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.840 
so we're waiting for them to hopefully
commit<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.710> a<00:03:19.740> target<00:03:20.250> before<00:03:20.370> we<00:03:20.700> make

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
commit and have a target before we make

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.760 
commit and have a target before we make
our<00:03:20.880> move<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:21.660> we're<00:03:21.780> not<00:03:21.900> waiting<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.470> long

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
our move but we're not waiting so long

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.880 
our move but we're not waiting so long
that<00:03:23.490> the<00:03:23.820> ball<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.060> already<00:03:24.720> past<00:03:25.080> you<00:03:25.350> by<00:03:25.800> the

that the ball is already past you by the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
time you make your move so you don't

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
because it's going to change depending

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.260 
because it's going to change depending
on<00:03:48.750> how<00:03:49.740> confident<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.400> returner<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:51.000> and

commitment of the swing from your
opponent<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.400> returner<00:04:23.790> but<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.690> could<00:04:24.900> be

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
opponent the returner but it could be

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.470 
opponent the returner but it could be
that<00:04:25.200> changing<00:04:26.100> it<00:04:26.220> up<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.400> little<00:04:26.580> bit<00:04:26.850> either

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
that changing it up a little bit either

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.390 
that changing it up a little bit either
earlier<00:04:27.720> or<00:04:27.900> later<00:04:27.930> could<00:04:28.710> work<00:04:28.920> really

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
earlier or later could work really

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.540 
earlier or later could work really
really<00:04:29.550> well<00:04:29.820> against<00:04:30.450> specific<00:04:30.780> opponents
