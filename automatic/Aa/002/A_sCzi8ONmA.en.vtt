truvativ and it's got ten degrees of
back<00:00:17.580> sweep<00:00:17.880> which<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> flat<00:00:18.869> bar

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
back sweep which is for a flat bar

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.380 
back sweep which is for a flat bar
flatcar<00:00:19.680> bovar<00:00:19.949> it's<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> most<00:00:20.490> back<00:00:21.090> sweet

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
flatcar bovar it's the most back sweet

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.210 
flatcar bovar it's the most back sweet
that<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.689> can<00:00:21.869> get<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.410> quite<00:00:22.680> wide<00:00:22.920> as

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
that you can get and it's quite wide as

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.990 
that you can get and it's quite wide as
well<00:00:23.510> this<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.779> comes<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.320> 700<00:00:26.279> I've<00:00:26.490> cut<00:00:26.849> it

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
well this it comes in 700 I've cut it

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.240 
well this it comes in 700 I've cut it
down<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.420> slightly<00:00:27.800> and<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> reason<00:00:29.220> for

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
down just slightly and the reason for

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.490 
down just slightly and the reason for
that<00:00:29.400> for<00:00:29.910> me<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.300> endurance<00:00:30.630> racing<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.289> the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that for me for endurance racing is the

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.170 
that for me for endurance racing is the
comfort<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.189> your<00:00:32.309> hands<00:00:32.550> don't<00:00:32.759> fall<00:00:33.030> asleep

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
comfort so your hands don't fall asleep

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.810 
comfort so your hands don't fall asleep
and<00:00:33.719> that's<00:00:34.140> been<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> really<00:00:34.620> great<00:00:35.250> change<00:00:35.670> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and that's been a really great change in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.979 
and that's been a really great change in
a<00:00:35.910> cockpit<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.480> I've<00:00:36.570> been<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.840> excited

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
a cockpit that I've been really excited

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.470 
a cockpit that I've been really excited
about<00:00:37.410> I'm<00:00:37.829> running<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.520> buy<00:00:38.820> 10<00:00:39.059> right<00:00:39.329> now

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
about I'm running to buy 10 right now

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.150 
about I'm running to buy 10 right now
and<00:00:39.719> I'm<00:00:39.809> experimenting<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.770> course

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
and I'm experimenting on this course

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.119 
and I'm experimenting on this course
whether<00:00:41.910> I'm<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.300> run<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:43.760> 24<00:00:44.760> 38<00:00:45.300> or<00:00:45.690> a

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
whether I'm going to run a 24 38 or a

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.860 
whether I'm going to run a 24 38 or a
2639<00:00:47.129> because<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.629> unique

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
2639 because this is a really unique

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.290 
2639 because this is a really unique
course<00:00:49.379> where<00:00:49.680> you've<00:00:50.309> got<00:00:50.430> very<00:00:50.789> very<00:00:50.969> steep

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
course where you've got very very steep

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.350 
course where you've got very very steep
hills<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.050> flat<00:00:53.010> fast<00:00:53.489> rohde<00:00:53.820> sections

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
hills and then flat fast rohde sections

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.660 
hills and then flat fast rohde sections
so<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.320> need<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> best<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.129> both<00:00:56.219> worlds

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
so you you need the best of both worlds

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.490 
so you you need the best of both worlds
in<00:00:56.789> your<00:00:56.910> gearing<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:58.260> at<00:00:58.379> high

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
in your gearing and it's at high

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.740 
in your gearing and it's at high
altitude<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.460> need<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.059> out<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.390> try<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
altitude so I need to go out and try and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.779 
altitude so I need to go out and try and
see<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.170> gears<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.649> push<00:01:01.829> what's<00:01:02.640> going

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
see what gears I can push what's going

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.549 
see what gears I can push what's going
to<00:01:02.850> work<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.059> me<00:01:03.359> I'll<00:01:03.690> probably<00:01:04.019> run<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to work for me I'll probably run the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.710 
to work for me I'll probably run the
fast<00:01:04.799> track<00:01:05.040> tires<00:01:05.339> which<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.180> what<00:01:06.330> I've<00:01:06.450> run

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
fast track tires which is what I've run

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
fast track tires which is what I've run
the<00:01:06.750> last<00:01:07.049> couple<00:01:07.530> years<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.950> well<00:01:08.420> pretty

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
the last couple years as well pretty

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.570 
the last couple years as well pretty
fast<00:01:09.720> rolling<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:10.290> again<00:01:10.860> like<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.250> said<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
fast rolling but again like I said the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
fast rolling but again like I said the
fire<00:01:12.030> roads<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.510> descending<00:01:12.869> or<00:01:13.080> some

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
fire roads in the descending or some

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.230 
fire roads in the descending or some
really<00:01:13.590> loose<00:01:13.770> corners<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.580> don't<00:01:15.000> want<00:01:15.180> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
really loose corners so I don't want to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.760 
really loose corners so I don't want to
go<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> super<00:01:15.930> slick<00:01:16.170> tyre<00:01:16.409> because<00:01:16.710> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
go with a super slick tyre because I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
go with a super slick tyre because I
feel<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.180> you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.330> definitely<00:01:18.450> end<00:01:18.750> your

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
feel like you can definitely end your

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
feel like you can definitely end your
race<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.350> some<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> those<00:01:19.710> corners<00:01:20.130> you're<00:01:20.310> not

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
race on some of those corners you're not

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.070 
race on some of those corners you're not
going<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.670> make<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.030> huge<00:01:21.299> time<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.930> can

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
going to make a huge time but you can

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.719 
going to make a huge time but you can
definitely<00:01:22.290> lose<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> ton<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.220> time<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
definitely lose a ton of time if you

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.660 
definitely lose a ton of time if you
wash<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.020> for<00:01:25.409> me<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.400> little

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
wash out so for me it's I like a little

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.219 
wash out so for me it's I like a little
bit<00:01:26.939> more<00:01:27.060> trout<00:01:27.299> on<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.600> course<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.049> for

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
bit more trout on this course just for

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.990 
bit more trout on this course just for
kind<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> safety<00:01:28.770> aspect<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.759> then<00:01:29.939> I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
kind of the safety aspect and then I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.080 
kind of the safety aspect and then I
also<00:01:30.119> run<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.479> BG<00:01:31.310> grips<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.549> specialized

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
also run the BG grips from specialized

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.899 
also run the BG grips from specialized
which<00:01:33.450> also<00:01:34.079> support<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:34.950> ulnar<00:01:35.310> nerve<00:01:35.549> so

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
which also support the ulnar nerve so

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.069 
which also support the ulnar nerve so
that<00:01:36.030> you're<00:01:36.150> not<00:01:36.180> getting<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.720> falling

women-specific<00:01:59.640> but<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.240> find<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.719> there's<00:02:01.049> so

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290

women-specific but I find it there's so
much<00:02:01.320> adjustability<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.189> exactly<00:02:02.729> where<00:02:02.939> you

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
much adjustability and exactly where you
