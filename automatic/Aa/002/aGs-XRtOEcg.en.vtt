00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
there's basically two different kind of

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.440 
there's basically two different kind of
skills<00:04:35.960> some<00:04:36.950> skills<00:04:37.250> like<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:37.670> leader<00:04:38.030> is

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
skills some skills like this leader is

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.950 
skills some skills like this leader is
passive<00:04:38.990> so<00:04:39.320> it's<00:04:39.560> in<00:04:39.860> effect<00:04:40.310> all<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.670> time

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
passive so it's in effect all the time

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.590 
passive so it's in effect all the time
but<00:04:41.960> other<00:04:42.200> skills<00:04:42.590> are<00:04:42.830> acting<00:04:43.250> like<00:04:43.330> far<00:04:44.330> sub

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
but other skills are acting like far sub

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.830 
but other skills are acting like far sub
here<00:04:45.220> so<00:04:46.220> when<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.610> activate<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.150> my<00:04:47.510> cannon

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
here so when I activate it my cannon

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.710 
here so when I activate it my cannon
balls<00:04:48.050> will<00:04:48.290> fly<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.770> bit<00:04:49.190> further<00:04:49.430> but<00:04:50.419> only

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
balls will fly a bit further but only

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.310 
balls will fly a bit further but only
for<00:04:50.870> the<00:04:50.900> duration<00:04:51.230> which<00:04:51.680> is<00:04:51.860> 10<00:04:52.100> seconds<00:04:52.550> I

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
for the duration which is 10 seconds I

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.590 
for the duration which is 10 seconds I
activated<00:04:54.320> it<00:04:55.060> fire<00:04:56.060> that<00:04:56.419> enemy<00:04:56.810> here<00:04:57.110> and

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
activated it fire that enemy here and

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.830 
activated it fire that enemy here and
when<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.630> duration<00:05:00.140> is<00:05:00.230> over<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:01.480> have<00:05:02.480> to<00:05:02.630> wait

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
when the duration is over I have to wait

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.800 
when the duration is over I have to wait
on<00:05:03.470> it<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.919> cooldown<00:05:04.340> time<00:05:04.610> is<00:05:04.910> over<00:05:05.360> which<00:05:05.630> is

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
on it the cooldown time is over which is

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.060 
on it the cooldown time is over which is
25<00:05:06.200> seconds<00:05:06.500> for<00:05:06.650> this<00:05:06.770> skill<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:09.080> commanders

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
25 seconds for this skill so commanders

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.920 
25 seconds for this skill so commanders
can<00:05:10.490> make<00:05:10.820> really<00:05:11.360> a<00:05:11.390> difference<00:05:11.780> in<00:05:11.870> the

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930
