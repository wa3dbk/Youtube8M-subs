00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.760
 yes i am a child right away 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.860
 grown up because my father also one 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:23.320
 carpentry already has with them because they are not 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.880
 six years as elementary school age have 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.340
 I just got the small workshop and 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.500
 also worked in it and there it was 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.340
 actually already realize that I am 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 later on too 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.760
 So what in any case is so this 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.280
 Atmosphere you have under the 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.680
 employees and also this work 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.260
 a fresh air that is has 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.229
 also the disadvantage that it sometimes very 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.769
 hot or very cold but you come 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:52.769
 hold me clear 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.920
 the job is definitely versatile 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.239
 because that's what we saw today 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.670
 that was there only is only the area 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:09.969
 roof and there are still many many 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.829
 other areas such as drywall 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:16.149
 that means interior regens walls and 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.590
 So that's all, that's really it 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.090
 damn versatile also carports and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.270
 others made of wood or even made 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.170
 other materials that makes you and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.500
 is not always the same in any case 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:34.030
 that we put it on every day so 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.530
 I was in my senior little late 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.890
 because I only had one before 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.289
 to do something else but I have them 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.100
 then, in the end, still get that was 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.980
 not easy because while shortly before 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.660
 august already and 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.930
 I phoned a bit around there 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.860
 because only three canceled and then cashed 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.870
 Called and then he said you 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.470
 I could come over immediately 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.570
 submit my application 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.720
 yes then I'm to the interview 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:11.160
 came and had immediately on the day 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:15.090
 Already promised in any case one 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.770
 certain degree of physical fitness yes 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.030
 if you're a little stouter it's from 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.190
 disadvantage you can get on the roof 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.840
 not moving so well 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.490
 Generally , yes, sometimes too 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.590
 flat roofs there must crawl around and 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.960
 if then I do not move so well 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.730
 can that be of disadvantage 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.420
 and in any case a bit 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.790
 more more brains than some others 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.100
 Professions Waltz has this area foundation 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.200
 3d thinking gives and that's why 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.950
 you also need a bit 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:51.840
 understood for the morning after ours 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.010
 ship and then said it comes up 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.400
 a water and say what we do 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.950
 have to 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.130
 it may be that we like today in the 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.110
 Roof-rooms have to be woods 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.810
 because not yet cut just 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.380
 Rough on length are you and there must 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.080
 These woods are more or less according to the plan of 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.070
 our boss must work out and 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.900
 then yes as here now they will be 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.900
 set up by another troop 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.390
 yes I think that's normal that one 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.790
 that sometimes has some work is yes 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.370
 then somehow a bit 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.650
 frustrating or boring monotonous there 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.140
 If one thinks then also time does not work 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.840
 But that's what I think in every job 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.550
 so and 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.440
 that's why you can live with it but it 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.490
 is still that is varied 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.490
 which days are rare 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.540
 my goal is definitely to 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.330
 operation of my father sometime too 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.070
 I take over and I need it 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.630
 either the master title would have to be 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.070
 I go to the master school and the 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:04.650
 make and second option would be one 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.670
 training in trainerbereich holzbau yes me 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.950
 I'll think for that 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.959
 and then decide not to 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.450
 directly into my father's company 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.010
 but first in others 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.010
 operated a bit of experience collecting
