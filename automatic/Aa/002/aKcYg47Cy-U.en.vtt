okay<00:00:01.740> we're<00:00:02.129> going<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.520> graft<00:00:02.879> two<00:00:03.419> pieces<00:00:03.840> of

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
okay we're going to graft two pieces of

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.070 
okay we're going to graft two pieces of
2x2<00:00:04.470> ribbing<00:00:04.910> using<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.089> duplicate<00:00:06.930> stitch

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
2x2 ribbing using the duplicate stitch

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.230 
2x2 ribbing using the duplicate stitch
method<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:07.859> two<00:00:08.069> contrasting<00:00:08.790> colors<00:00:09.090> of

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
method and two contrasting colors of

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.249 
method and two contrasting colors of
waste<00:00:09.480> yarn<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:10.650> will<00:00:11.059> graft<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.360> columns

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
waste yarn this will graft the columns

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.230 
waste yarn this will graft the columns
of<00:00:13.380> ribbing<00:00:13.740> perfectly<00:00:14.340> if<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> two<00:00:14.910> pieces

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
of ribbing perfectly if the two pieces

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.670 
of ribbing perfectly if the two pieces
of<00:00:15.389> knitting<00:00:15.839> are<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> same

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
of knitting are going in the same

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.830 
of knitting are going in the same
direction<00:00:16.970> you<00:00:17.970> can<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.570> they're<00:00:18.720> going

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
direction you can see that they're going

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.170 
direction you can see that they're going
in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> same<00:00:19.230> direction<00:00:19.289> because<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.970> knit

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
in the same direction because the knit

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.439 
in the same direction because the knit
stitches<00:00:21.480> form<00:00:21.900> V's<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.740> both<00:00:23.070> pieces<00:00:23.449> and

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
stitches form V's on both pieces and

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.849 
stitches form V's on both pieces and
this<00:00:24.660> would<00:00:24.840> be<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> case<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.769> instance

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
this would be the case if for instance

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.269 
this would be the case if for instance
you<00:00:26.369> were<00:00:26.519> doing<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.029> sideways<00:00:27.660> cowl<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.560> you

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
you were doing a sideways cowl and you

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.849 
you were doing a sideways cowl and you
wanted<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.699> graph<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.240> ends<00:00:30.390> invisibly<00:00:31.170> it

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
wanted to graph the ends invisibly it

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.860 
wanted to graph the ends invisibly it
will<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.219> work<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.820> instance<00:00:33.059> if<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.660> are

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
will not work for instance if you are

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.540 
will not work for instance if you are
doing<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> toe<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.680> sock<00:00:34.710> where<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> two

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
doing the toe of a sock where the two

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.540 
doing the toe of a sock where the two
pieces<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.000> knitting<00:00:36.480> are<00:00:37.100> going<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.280> two

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
pieces of knitting are going in two

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.600 
pieces of knitting are going in two
different<00:00:38.730> directions<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.559> we<00:00:40.890> begin<00:00:41.340> by

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
different directions so we begin by

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.450 
different directions so we begin by
using<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.239> waste<00:00:42.480> yarn<00:00:42.920> casting<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
using a waste yarn casting on and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.510 
using a waste yarn casting on and
working<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.910> row<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.420> then<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:45.989> switch<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.469> our

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
working a row and then we switch to our

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.590 
working a row and then we switch to our
contrasting<00:00:47.520> waste<00:00:48.300> yarn<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.020> work<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:49.980> row

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
contrasting waste yarn and work one row

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.470 
contrasting waste yarn and work one row
then<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.780> go<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> our<00:00:52.199> main<00:00:52.680> yarn<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.550> work<00:00:54.270> our

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
then we go to our main yarn and work our

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.790 
then we go to our main yarn and work our
pattern<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.570> case<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:58.350> you're<00:00:58.620> doing

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
pattern and in this case if you're doing

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.430 
pattern and in this case if you're doing
a<00:00:58.920> cow<00:00:59.129> for<00:00:59.190> instance<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.629> would<00:01:00.780> knit<00:01:01.199> your

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a cow for instance you would knit your

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.709 
a cow for instance you would knit your
cow<00:01:01.620> around<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.579> then<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.910> come<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.570> this

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
cow around and then you come up and this

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.329 
cow around and then you come up and this
is<00:01:03.870> where<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.320> finished<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.189> you're

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
is where you have finished so you're

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.240 
is where you have finished so you're
finishing<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.540> main<00:01:06.689> yarn<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:08.010> break

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
finishing with your main yarn you break

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.429 
finishing with your main yarn you break
the<00:01:08.460> main<00:01:08.670> yarn<00:01:09.030> leaving<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.600> long<00:01:09.780> tail<00:01:10.170> for

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the main yarn leaving a long tail for

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.429 
the main yarn leaving a long tail for
grafting<00:01:10.979> join<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.119> contrasting<00:01:12.810> waste<00:01:13.080> yarn

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
grafting join the contrasting waste yarn

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.800 
grafting join the contrasting waste yarn
you<00:01:13.890> want<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> contrasting<00:01:15.299> color<00:01:15.540> so

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
you want it to be a contrasting color so

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.350 
you want it to be a contrasting color so
the<00:01:15.930> path<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.350> very<00:01:16.619> easy<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> follow<00:01:17.369> that's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the path is very easy to follow that's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.700 
the path is very easy to follow that's
why<00:01:18.540> it's<00:01:18.689> called<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.020> duplicate<00:01:19.530> stitch

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
why it's called the duplicate stitch

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
why it's called the duplicate stitch
method<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.790> we're<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> duplicate

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
method because we're going to duplicate

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.950 
method because we're going to duplicate
stitch<00:01:22.140> over<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:23.070> contrasting<00:01:23.939> row<00:01:24.600> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
stitch over this contrasting row and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.289 
stitch over this contrasting row and
then<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> couple<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.610> rows<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
then you do a couple of rows of the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.530 
then you do a couple of rows of the
regular<00:01:27.689> waste<00:01:27.960> yarn<00:01:28.430> to<00:01:29.430> hold<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.090> dupe<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
regular waste yarn to hold the dupe the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.039 
regular waste yarn to hold the dupe the
contrasting<00:01:31.470> stitches<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.009> place<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:33.049> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
contrasting stitches in place and to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.469 
contrasting stitches in place and to
make<00:01:34.079> them<00:01:34.350> stand<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.799> clearly

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
make them stand out clearly

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.800 
make them stand out clearly
so<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.570> begin<00:01:37.020> we'll<00:01:37.829> take<00:01:38.100> our<00:01:38.540> grafting<00:01:39.540> yarn

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so to begin we'll take our grafting yarn

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.219 
so to begin we'll take our grafting yarn
and<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:41.369> yarn<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> funny<00:01:42.390> thing<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
and the yarn is a funny thing on the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.410 
and the yarn is a funny thing on the
edge<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.700> slipped<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.299> edge

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
edge here we have not slipped the edge

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.840 
edge here we have not slipped the edge
stitches<00:01:45.899> we've<00:01:46.110> worked<00:01:46.380> every<00:01:46.710> stitch<00:01:47.040> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
stitches we've worked every stitch so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.670 
stitches we've worked every stitch so
the<00:01:48.000> yarn<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> funny<00:01:48.810> thing<00:01:49.110> where<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.380> loops

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
the yarn is a funny thing where it loops

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.880 
the yarn is a funny thing where it loops
around<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.790> stitch<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.680> goes

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
around this stitch here and then it goes

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
around this stitch here and then it goes
through<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.310> stitch<00:01:53.610> once<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.600> that's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
through this stitch once so that's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.170 
through this stitch once so that's
exactly<00:01:55.140> what<00:01:55.439> we're<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.180> we're

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
exactly what we're going to do we're

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.399 
exactly what we're going to do we're
going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.450> put<00:01:58.350> our<00:01:59.869> grafting<00:02:00.869> yarn<00:02:01.079> through

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
going to put our grafting yarn through

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.800 
going to put our grafting yarn through
there<00:02:01.969> I'm<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.149> pull<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.450> fairly<00:02:03.689> tight

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
there I'm going to pull it fairly tight

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.990 
there I'm going to pull it fairly tight
because<00:02:04.380> once<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.770> loop<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.159> over<00:02:05.250> itself<00:02:05.700> it's

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
because once we loop it over itself it's

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.449 
because once we loop it over itself it's
going<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.420> tend<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> lock<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.829> place<00:02:08.099> and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
going to tend to lock it in place and

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.619 
going to tend to lock it in place and
then<00:02:08.670> we're<00:02:08.789> going<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.030> follow<00:02:09.330> that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
then we're going to follow that

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.310 
then we're going to follow that
contrasting<00:02:10.470> yarn<00:02:10.709> right<00:02:11.610> through<00:02:11.940> this

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.490 

and<00:02:15.320> there<00:02:15.650> we<00:02:15.800> go

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
and there we go

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.570 
and there we go
just<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:18.710> tension<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.340> little<00:02:19.490> bit<00:02:19.640> better

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
just that tension a little bit better

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.360 
just that tension a little bit better
okay<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:23.480> then<00:02:23.750> I'm<00:02:24.680> going<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.980> go<00:02:25.070> back<00:02:25.340> to

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
okay and then I'm going to go back to

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.570 
okay and then I'm going to go back to
our<00:02:25.820> bottom<00:02:26.270> piece<00:02:26.740> now<00:02:27.740> in<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.980> bottom<00:02:28.190> piece

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
our bottom piece now in the bottom piece

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.580 
our bottom piece now in the bottom piece
you'll<00:02:28.790> always<00:02:28.970> follow<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.080> bottom

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
you'll always follow just the bottom

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.970 
you'll always follow just the bottom
loop<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.310> waste<00:02:31.520> yarn<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:33.380> we're<00:02:33.590> gonna<00:02:33.710> go

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
loop of the waste yarn so we're gonna go

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.100 
loop of the waste yarn so we're gonna go
right<00:02:34.250> like<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:35.170> following<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.470> path<00:02:38.110> I'm

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
right like that following that path I'm

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.370 
right like that following that path I'm
gonna<00:02:39.290> go<00:02:39.500> back<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.830> the<00:02:40.220> top<00:02:40.930> follow<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.320> the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
gonna go back to the top follow just the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.250 
gonna go back to the top follow just the
top<00:02:42.680> loop<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.370> waste<00:02:43.580> yarn<00:02:44.140> now<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.230> just

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
top loop of the waste yarn now it just

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.020 
top loop of the waste yarn now it just
looks<00:02:45.470> like<00:02:45.710> a<00:02:45.740> simple<00:02:46.070> knit<00:02:46.430> stitch<00:02:46.730> there

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
looks like a simple knit stitch there

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.520 
looks like a simple knit stitch there
because<00:02:47.390> that's<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.780> end<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:48.080> our<00:02:48.200> knit

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
because that's the end of our knit

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.900 
because that's the end of our knit
collar<00:02:49.720> so<00:02:50.720> when<00:02:50.870> we<00:02:50.960> get<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.260> the<00:02:51.380> bottom

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
collar so when we get to the bottom

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.280 
collar so when we get to the bottom
since<00:02:52.910> we're<00:02:53.120> really<00:02:53.300> following<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:55.130> yarn

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
since we're really following the yarn

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.660 
since we're really following the yarn
these<00:02:57.290> loops<00:02:57.620> are<00:02:57.860> really<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.220> loops<00:02:58.460> that

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
these loops are really the loops that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.420 
these loops are really the loops that
are<00:02:58.760> in<00:02:58.910> between<00:02:59.060> stitches<00:02:59.960> so<00:03:00.680> that's<00:03:00.890> why<00:03:01.130> we

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
are in between stitches so that's why we

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.690 
are in between stitches so that's why we
have<00:03:01.550> half<00:03:01.880> of<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.210> knit<00:03:02.420> stitch<00:03:03.250> so<00:03:04.250> we<00:03:04.370> follow

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
have half of a knit stitch so we follow

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.740 
have half of a knit stitch so we follow
the<00:03:04.820> path<00:03:05.150> of<00:03:05.330> that<00:03:05.540> yarn<00:03:05.840> there<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:08.450> then<00:03:08.630> we

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
the path of that yarn there and then we

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.040 
the path of that yarn there and then we
have<00:03:08.780> half<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.380> a<00:03:09.530> purl<00:03:09.800> stitch<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.690> we<00:03:11.720> follow

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
have half of a purl stitch so we follow

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.590 
have half of a purl stitch so we follow
the<00:03:12.260> path<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.830> yarn<00:03:15.160> okay<00:03:16.270> you<00:03:17.270> don't<00:03:17.450> want

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
the path of the yarn okay you don't want

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.240 
the path of the yarn okay you don't want
to<00:03:17.690> pull<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.870> too<00:03:18.020> tight<00:03:18.170> try<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.770> match<00:03:19.040> the

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
to pull it too tight try to match the

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.760 
to pull it too tight try to match the
tension<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.820> the<00:03:19.910> stitches<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:21.290> now<00:03:21.410> if<00:03:21.560> we<00:03:21.650> go

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
tension of the stitches so now if we go

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.390 
tension of the stitches so now if we go
to<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:22.040> top<00:03:23.200> we<00:03:24.200> see<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:24.530> on<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.800> top<00:03:25.040> it's

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
to the top we see that on the top it's

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.340 
to the top we see that on the top it's
actually<00:03:25.550> just<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:26.000> simple<00:03:26.390> purl<00:03:26.630> stitch<00:03:27.050> so

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
actually just a simple purl stitch so

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.960 
actually just a simple purl stitch so
we're<00:03:27.500> going<00:03:27.620> to<00:03:27.709> follow<00:03:27.950> that<00:03:28.340> waste<00:03:28.670> yarn

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
we're going to follow that waste yarn

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.490 
we're going to follow that waste yarn
once<00:03:29.300> again<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.720> light-colored<00:03:30.140> one<00:03:32.500> keep

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
once again the light-colored one keep

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.840 
once again the light-colored one keep
following<00:03:34.070> it<00:03:35.260> now<00:03:36.260> we're<00:03:36.470> going<00:03:36.620> to<00:03:36.850> avoid

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
following it now we're going to avoid

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.910 
following it now we're going to avoid
catching<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.690> other<00:03:38.840> color<00:03:39.200> of<00:03:39.380> waste<00:03:39.620> yarn

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
catching the other color of waste yarn

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.390 
catching the other color of waste yarn
the<00:03:40.160> brown<00:03:40.430> yarn<00:03:40.880> in<00:03:41.600> our<00:03:42.260> stitches<00:03:42.800> because

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the brown yarn in our stitches because

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.010 
the brown yarn in our stitches because
what<00:03:43.610> we're<00:03:43.760> going<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:44.060> do<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.390> cut<00:03:44.810> the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
what we're going to do is cut the

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.350 
what we're going to do is cut the
contrasting<00:03:45.860> waste<00:03:46.130> yarn<00:03:46.430> loose<00:03:46.820> when<00:03:47.209> we're

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
contrasting waste yarn loose when we're

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.470 
contrasting waste yarn loose when we're
done<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.920> if<00:03:49.070> we<00:03:49.220> pass<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.880> main<00:03:50.090> yarn

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
done and if we pass the main yarn

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.270 
done and if we pass the main yarn
through<00:03:50.810> both<00:03:51.020> colors<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:51.620> waster<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.070> we'll

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
through both colors of waster and we'll

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.820 
through both colors of waster and we'll
have<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.550> cut<00:03:52.760> both<00:03:53.239> of<00:03:53.450> those<00:03:53.830> different

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
have to cut both of those different

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.760 
have to cut both of those different
colors<00:03:55.010> free<00:03:56.830> okay<00:03:59.230> and<00:04:00.230> now<00:04:00.380> we're<00:04:00.530> going<00:04:00.680> to

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
colors free okay and now we're going to

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.840 
colors free okay and now we're going to
go<00:04:00.950> back<00:04:01.160> up<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.640> top<00:04:03.400> we<00:04:04.400> have<00:04:04.580> another

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
go back up to the top we have another

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.150 
go back up to the top we have another
purl<00:04:05.239> stitch<00:04:05.690> you<00:04:06.290> can<00:04:06.320> pull<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.860> knitting

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
purl stitch you can pull the knitting

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.010 
purl stitch you can pull the knitting
apart<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.700> little<00:04:07.820> bit<00:04:08.090> so<00:04:08.270> you<00:04:08.360> can<00:04:08.420> see<00:04:08.810> more

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
apart a little bit so you can see more

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.180 
apart a little bit so you can see more
clearly<00:04:09.350> what<00:04:09.590> you're<00:04:09.860> doing<00:04:11.739> so<00:04:12.739> that<00:04:12.770> goes

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
clearly what you're doing so that goes

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.420 
clearly what you're doing so that goes
through<00:04:13.550> there<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:15.470> now<00:04:15.739> we're<00:04:15.980> back<00:04:16.130> at<00:04:16.190> our

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
through there and now we're back at our
