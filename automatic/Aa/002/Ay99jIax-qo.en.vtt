00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello, we continue to talk about knives 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.350
 Now let 's talk about two Chinese who 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.610
 Well here we have presented itself here 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 such models I think that such 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.269
 grandparents we all know well 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.280
 at least visually it may not be 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.690
 everyone understands everything by name honestly 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.859
 saying I do not remember the name of the original 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.730
 but you have this coffee here with a smiley 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.410
 logo view 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.449
 Well, I would say that it is more 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:31.009
 on your mind and a copy of a knife like mine 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.450
 brief delta juice for execution 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.160
 the Chinese have learned how to do it and why 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.440
 do apparently pretty well then 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.969
 have these knives held in your hands held in 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.800
 hands in different executions from different 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.410
 manufacturers there is a wild boar 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.270
 his collection is kevin john is helped 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.500
 someone else has this blood type 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.719
 addition in this case it is with us that 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.840
 wash team 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.800
 no good good kevin john type yes 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.300
 interesting in general kept them different i am so 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.590
 I think that honestly is not going to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.129
 somewhere around one factory 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.110
 or 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.760
 parts orders in the same place 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.220
 and then manually perry is going 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.380
 further debug with the mechanic 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.820
 Most of the quality is pleasant but of course 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.380
 there are certain diseases that 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.030
 also manifest minute the world are you on this 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.420
 the knife now we will try it 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.220
 to talk 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.250
 let's start the whole you traffic from them 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.990
 bench it looks like this 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.400
 have this such a pretty massive knife in 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.780
 hand judging by the geometry originally resa 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.700
 such a knife should be in principle 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.130
 not bad but because if pretty 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.810
 thick blade and mine would be like that 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.329
 a thickish connection that is to say 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.060
 here somewhere probably 08 09 and here not 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.790
 more harm this post will cut also 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.340
 good as the original about your own 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.110
 Ideally one knife on quality assembled 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.490
 pretty good and as far as i know him 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.920
 the price varies in the area then for something 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.390
 one and a half thousand rubles 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.359
 therefore it is generally very permissible for 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.600
 their money to get such a knife 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:59.670
 good centering with acceptable 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.439
 build quality that is the principle of someone 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.649
 much to find fault even of course 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.770
 here but if tue and there is ice to the transverse 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.000
 so longitudinally if transverse we still 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.860
 how can we cure yes that is 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.500
 the main spurs the axial screw not 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.370
 fact it can be done without prejudice 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.980
 blade smoothness 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.440
 but here is the backlash is not longitudinal 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.360
 backlash it can not be eliminated or only 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.760
 If the freeze plate and spoon nickname 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.010
 beam that CPR and chicken can 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.440
 Immediately here see a little bong not 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.420
 I know whether it will be visible on the phone here in 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.660
 dies are separated from liner lenar points 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.650
 ie the distance but as it fixes 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.390
 inside it was all done well and I 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.190
 even honestly I do not know this knife is worth 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.780
 recommend because there is basically 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.870
 such can already be said that the Chinese 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.740
 branded items for example from the same hanza 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.640
 which is 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.140
 Well, follow the quality captive way 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.750
 absolutely no worse than himself is in 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.880
 build plan is worth it as i understand 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.300
 a little cheaper but keep in mind that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.980
 this principle also has a torch for 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.840
 notch 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.690
 heard a big gavalda let's go 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.850
 throw the delta with us it is interesting 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.160
 kind of caught apparently so that is 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.500
 was worn on the pocket it completely 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.360
 titanium design there is also a spacer 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.960
 titan and save beautifully she tree 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.960
 on blue light 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.420
 clip as I understand it was selected 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.560
 before so I think everyone who sasha principle 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.240
 held this let's say 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.130
 last then here models about mikro te 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.380
 who knows that the clip is so much that is 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.180
 the feeling that the constructor is standing here itself 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.860
 tasks here is a knife that did not work 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.810
 Well, that's how it will ruin something 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.100
 there is such a thing 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.260
 know how here is a designer specifically 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.000
 makes his masterpieces a certain mistake 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.040
 so that it immediately to the buyer or 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.170
 The customer could have managed it. 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.150
 with the most avoid most disputes over 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.710
 some other aspect is already an instant 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.230
 the feeling that here is the same but 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.940
 10 of the cop that I think that the Martians already 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.400
 many times already received this clip 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.290
 because changed and is going to 300 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.130
 miles from a mechanic as you can see 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.610
 fine knife bearing assembled 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:15.090
 ok backlash here at the moment yes 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.530
 but what we understand if axial 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.799
 the screw becomes loose then it will be very 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.450
 hard tried here need 2 bits 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.100
 in order for that knife to take apart one of 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.320
 them under axial and 2 respectively 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.220
 other types of attack construction 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.490
 repeats completely 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.370
 actually original here 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.569
 you can probably say that's better 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.559
 Mike Artek 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:39.960
 made for the money which is worth the Chinese 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:42.869
 knife I think it's worth four extremely 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.879
 hundreds of thousands of rubles, well, that's why 

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:48.959
 if someone wants such well you can become 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:50.189
 what do you know what i would call this knife in 

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:53.699
 English is such a thing 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:55.649
 wannabe, that is, I want to be, I want to be 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.199
 to the table here I would call this this knife 

00:04:55.649 --> 00:05:01.110
 this way and in this case if 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.759
 you want to want to be a caste you will guess 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.369
 it will be quite a good option here you 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.939
 nice grint and basically not bad 

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:10.469
 mixing 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:11.909
 for think so confusing 0 6 well, and such here 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.469
 horrible things including 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.959
 present which of course adds 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:18.330
 no one charm but point of view 

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:20.669
 utilitarian it looks like it will be surplus 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.459
 some centering is a beautiful frame , 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.219
 my beginning we actually fly perfectly 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:31.039
 your money will predict this hope 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:31.039
 he was interesting to go on
