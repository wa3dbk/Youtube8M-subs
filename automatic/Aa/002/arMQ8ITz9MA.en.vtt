00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 only street presents a problem that I 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.099
 I have here with the contract I do not 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.370
 getting part he's with the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.219
 Initial settings fÃ¡bio already it 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.460
 I was already using a dive 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.500
 professional engaged in the engine cleanliness 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.310
 did all carburetor cleaning 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.500
 he already has a high needle and with 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.140
 four laps distance 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:36.360
 the collaborative internal gameplay around 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:39.239
 of 1 mm and the light pine tree noted 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.670
 is associated with the participation of 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.850
 According to the requesting manual 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.770
 own account that I can not get 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.760
 with neither stage it is only with this configuration 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.910
 basically the only way I 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.059
 part is that the carburetor gets 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.559
 open at or below this position and 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.340
 almost 50% open so if you go see 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.010
 I'll show 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.689
 and something else I do not know if it's normal not 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.189
 could be running 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.720
 if I take take here a filter 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.590
 attorney he's been waiting for 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.960
 Water 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.259
 the suction in the carburetor is correct 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.869
 then he pulls up until he feels he is 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:28.860
 continue here 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:31.079
 The filter rt rt correct such novinho 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.630
 There is nothing specific with him 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:40.799
 fuel is new veto to new vai 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.600
 call here show you and 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.479
 call I'll call, I'll try 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.149
 first down in the configuration 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.479
 should be asked to reduce 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.479
 little 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.190
 The driver was tired but he 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:06.800
 I'm going to have to move one 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.800
 Little here for him to leave. 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.160
 this is the only form of motor torque 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.160
 How are you? 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:31.269
 Shutting down 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.370
 on the way back you see he has to 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.439
 stay open enough to be able to leave 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.200
 Can you reduce it a little bit? 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.969
 careful maximum in control clock 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.459
 can be reduced more or less to the 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:47.290
 text after the kitano takeshi motor 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.620
 all connections are correct 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.750
 Attorney already already knows the cast 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.510
 felipe motor does not have nothing 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.049
 locking the embellishing effect here 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.359
 I did not want to, or I did not want to 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.099
 point by zero for him to stay 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.629
 fully open wanted to try to understand 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.970
 what is going on and see if he can 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.970
 go to a meeting with that, thanks
