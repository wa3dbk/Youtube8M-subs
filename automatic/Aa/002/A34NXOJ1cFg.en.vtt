00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.420
 good I'm warcraft stimulus for 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.490
 explain how to make ps with the hunter 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.830
 and his specialization of beasts with almost 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.470
 an old button almost a button because yes 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.900
 I said only one I'm lying are two 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.439
 buttons and two other casual and one 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.270
 optional 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.680
 Then I'll explain what's obscene 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.250
 make it clear that this is to do 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.840
 pspv is worth to pvp and nobody is going 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.050
 to leave quietly rotation 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.359
 in pvp it is very difficult and above all this 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.390
 is designed for people who with the 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.940
 passions has caught a hunter who just 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.800
 went up to level 90 and entered played 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.650
 never has 10 million buttons 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.470
 new and it's very difficult being new 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.570
 do ps and survive at the same time and this 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.339
 macro are helped to be able to paste while 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.989
 we learn to see character once 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.460
 that we know how to handle, we can already 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.870
 start doing the rotations more 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.850
 old people with the bad little buttons like 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.290
 play and we are already giving a joke to 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.360
 that the macros work we are going to 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.790
 need some obligated talents that 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.159
 they are the fearsome beast the flock of 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.570
 crows and bind witch is very 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.460
 advisable to take the glyph of 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.560
 redirect if we go alone and go in 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.740
 group in band we will remove it if 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.479
 we have beads 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.189
 a use put it in the top hole of 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.799
 the beads for the macros to 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.990
 use themselves and solidity until the trinket 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.759
 and on the bar to do damage 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.070
 we will take what I call macro 1 which is 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.409
 the icon of the serpent bite the 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.649
 macro 2 which is the icon of the beast 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.840
 fearsome the macro 3 that is the the icon 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.509
 of the shot of cobra then the skill 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.970
 of the deadly shot and we can also 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.710
 put the arcane shot in the bar 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.539
 because when we are gathered unto the beast 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.280
 fearsome with the anger of the beasts or 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.590
 to have two fish with logical actions 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.420
 we will have an excess of focus that we can 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.209
 seize to throw one or two shots 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.490
 to the canon or easier parce either to the 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:51.530
 blame for doing harm is also 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.720
 interesting to put them on the bars for 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.429
 see the reuse that they have left that 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.409
 it would be in the flock of crows the fire 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.590
 fast and the stampede with these macros 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.360
 pets will always attack the one 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.700
 attack with the macros will always go ja 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.709
 because we are hitting ourselves already 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.380
 time to use them first I will explain 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.720
 with blame 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.730
 just as difficult that we feel so 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.900
 simply when we start to paste it 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.330
 to a bowl if we want to throw all 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.460
 tried to start using the macro 1 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.680
 that of the snake bite and not 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.990
 we will stop pressing it until we see 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.330
 that we use the stampede let's listen to the 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.340
 let's see what 's in the pile of 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.360
 pets or let's see what it gets in 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.800
 reuse 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.020
 then as a priority if it turns on 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.690
 deadly shot deadly shot we do not know 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.640
 the fatal shot if then the macro 2 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.560
 which is that of the fearsome beast our 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.990
 reuse or the skill that is in 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.360
 we will use its place high priority one 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.600
 using the wicker beast macro 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.970
 the more we hurry the cool down more than 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.030
 we will think and if they are reuse the 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.370
 macro of the fearsome beast we will use the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.620
 macro shot of cobra until we can 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.150
 use again be fearsome or the shot 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.150
 deadly is that sting all the time 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.250
 until we get the stampede then the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 fatal shot if it turns on that is a 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.690
 less than 20 percent the macro of the 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.120
 fearsome beast as long as we have a 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.150
 ability to use and if not then 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.600
 we have done all previous 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.660
 to the shot of cobra 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.310
 and they will only use everything and the truth that 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.020
 it does its damage quite well 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.640
 pretty good the focus minus the moment 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.950
 that I told you every minute if you do 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.600
 well the anger of the beasts will come together 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.950
 with the fearsome beast and you will have a 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.050
 small excess of focus and you can 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.690
 Take advantage if you want is not required 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.880
 you do not lose a lot of dps 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.740
 doing that and then it's already for the 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.730
 normal bugs is the same but if not 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.920
 is for piss the snake bite 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.020
 you have one is once the bite of 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.060
 snake put it on and already shot 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.310
 mortal when you can be fearsome beast 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.920
 you can always give and the shot of 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.450
 charge and so on until he dies in 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.010
 description of the video I leave the three 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.710
 macros that you used to remember that are three 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.930
 macros and then two skills shot 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.150
 of arcane if you want and the deadly shot 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.770
 in the macros when you create the macro 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.350
 you just have to copy from the 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.560
 soult pad and to redirect 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.450
 what is between parentheses of 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.440
 macro 1 the one of the sting that does not 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.440
 copy 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.709
 I hope you try it if you try them 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.709
 you like them serve and tomorrow until tomorrow
