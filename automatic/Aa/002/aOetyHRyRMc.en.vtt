the rest of this look I'm just going to

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.370 
the rest of this look I'm just going to
go<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.160> with<00:03:44.340> peaches<00:03:44.700> by<00:03:45.120> Mac<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.720> obviously

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
go in with peaches by Mac and obviously

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.400 
go in with peaches by Mac and obviously
it's<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:46.770> peach<00:03:46.980> color<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:48.020> it<00:03:49.020> has<00:03:49.200> that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
it's a peach color and it has that

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.980 
it's a peach color and it has that
orange<00:03:49.890> hint<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.430> it<00:03:50.610> so<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:50.940> always<00:03:51.300> think<00:03:51.750> that

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
orange hint to it so I always think that

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.440 
orange hint to it so I always think that
teal<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.530> orange<00:03:52.740> they<00:03:53.700> pretty<00:03:53.970> much<00:03:54.180> go

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
teal and orange they pretty much go

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.650 
teal and orange they pretty much go
together<00:03:55.130> like<00:03:56.130> pickles<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:56.970> Burgers
