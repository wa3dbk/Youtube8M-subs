now I'm very aware that the bullet Club

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.229 
now I'm very aware that the bullet Club
asked<00:02:45.440> for<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.099> rematch<00:02:46.340> because<00:02:46.879> they<00:02:47.030> said

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
asked for this rematch because they said

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.140 
asked for this rematch because they said
we<00:02:47.390> used<00:02:47.629> underhanded<00:02:48.590> tactics<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.340> win<00:02:49.579> but<00:02:50.120> I

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
we used underhanded tactics to win but I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.120 
we used underhanded tactics to win but I
guess<00:02:50.359> they<00:02:50.540> fail<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.810> realize<00:02:51.109> that<00:02:51.950> they
