00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
there's blade plate because I can't do

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.560

anything<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.610> pivot<00:01:59.909> screw<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.380> yeah<00:02:01.619> but

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
anything with pivot screw so yeah but

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.130

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
sharpness wise

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.540 
sharpness wise
serrations<00:02:04.950> are<00:02:05.070> pretty<00:02:05.250> sharp<00:02:05.549> blade<00:02:06.210> itself

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
serrations are pretty sharp blade itself

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.309 
serrations are pretty sharp blade itself
that's<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.729> fault

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
that's my fault

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.440 
that's my fault
I<00:02:10.730> guess<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.909> the<00:02:12.000> sharpening<00:02:13.849> so<00:02:14.849> yeah<00:02:15.060> I

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
I guess in the sharpening so yeah I

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.910 
I guess in the sharpening so yeah I
definitely<00:02:15.959> have<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.439> give<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.859> a<00:02:16.890> little

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
definitely have to give that a little

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.030 
definitely have to give that a little
sharpen<00:02:18.170> with<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.349> serrations<00:02:19.620> are<00:02:19.950> good

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
sharpen with the serrations are good

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.470 
sharpen with the serrations are good
enough<00:02:20.189> that<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> carry<00:02:21.000> this<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.329> so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
enough that I have a carry this and so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.030 
enough that I have a carry this and so
long<00:02:21.659> so<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.840> didn't<00:02:22.079> know<00:02:22.170> need<00:02:22.409> to<00:02:22.560> be<00:02:22.680> sharpen

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
finger ramp here kind of pinky kind of

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.589 
finger ramp here kind of pinky kind of
just<00:02:35.849> hangs<00:02:36.060> off<00:02:36.359> here<00:02:37.220> no<00:02:38.220> jimping<00:02:38.760> so<00:02:39.090> but

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
just hangs off here no jimping so but

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.179 
just hangs off here no jimping so but
being<00:02:40.109> that<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.439> small<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.739> could<00:02:40.920> put<00:02:41.040> mine

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
being that so small I could put mine

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.009 
being that so small I could put mine
that<00:02:41.400> I<00:02:41.549> could<00:02:41.730> put<00:02:41.879> my<00:02:41.969> hand<00:02:42.209> like<00:02:42.299> here<00:02:42.720> and

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
that I could put my hand like here and

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.190 
that I could put my hand like here and
slice<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:43.950> do<00:02:44.099> something<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.609> that

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
slice to do something like that

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.640 
slice to do something like that
so<00:02:47.810> there's<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.870> plastic<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.349> really<00:02:49.530> say

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
so there's a plastic can really say

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.890 
so there's a plastic can really say
about<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.950> same<00:02:50.099> value<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:53.480> really<00:02:54.480> recommend

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
about the same value I really recommend

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.729 
about the same value I really recommend
it<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.769> honest<00:02:56.419> unless<00:02:57.419> I<00:02:57.689> just<00:02:57.720> got<00:02:58.049> not

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
it to be honest unless I just got not
