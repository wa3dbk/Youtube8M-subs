little bit different is we have a cam
adjustment<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.489> go<00:02:33.640> from<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.000> traditional<00:02:34.630> to

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
adjustment to go from a traditional to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.660 
adjustment to go from a traditional to
an<00:02:34.870> offset<00:02:34.989> cam<00:02:35.470> on<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.010> block<00:02:36.430> she<00:02:38.670> literally

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
an offset cam on the block she literally

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.080 
an offset cam on the block she literally
do<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.440> loosen<00:02:41.440> up<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.650> pivot<00:02:41.950> point<00:02:42.220> adjusted

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
do it loosen up the pivot point adjusted

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.020 
do it loosen up the pivot point adjusted
to<00:02:43.180> put<00:02:43.330> it<00:02:43.450> back<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:45.160> actually<00:02:45.310> opens<00:02:45.910> up

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
to put it back so it actually opens up

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.509 
to put it back so it actually opens up
the<00:02:46.180> cam<00:02:46.420> internally<00:02:47.170> rather<00:02:47.769> than<00:02:47.980> having<00:02:48.220> to

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
the cam internally rather than having to

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.940 
the cam internally rather than having to
take<00:02:48.880> apart<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:49.540> put<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:50.019> new<00:02:50.170> piece<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.800> do

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
take apart and put a new piece in to do

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.070 
take apart and put a new piece in to do
it<00:02:51.099> and<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.700> virtual<00:02:52.269> adjustment<00:02:52.780> season

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
it and it's virtual adjustment season

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.350 
it and it's virtual adjustment season
adjusted<00:02:53.620> lock<00:02:54.069> it<00:02:54.250> in<00:02:54.400> adjustment<00:02:55.090> lock<00:02:55.209> it

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
adjusted lock it in adjustment lock it

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.119 
adjusted lock it in adjustment lock it
that<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:58.720> Coleman<00:02:58.989> it's<00:02:59.620> Haley

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
that is so Coleman it's Haley

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.069 
that is so Coleman it's Haley
much<00:03:01.670> less<00:03:01.939> than<00:03:02.239> its<00:03:02.390> normal<00:03:02.749> people<00:03:03.019> the

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
much less than its normal people the

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.569 
much less than its normal people the
composition<00:03:03.739> of<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:03.890> market<00:03:04.249> the<00:03:04.400> same
