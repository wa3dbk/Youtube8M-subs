going to bend our knees down add to lift

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.570 
going to bend our knees down add to lift
up<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.559> bring<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.860> ball<00:00:38.979> into<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:39.519> air<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.430> as

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
up and bring the ball into the air so as

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.579 
up and bring the ball into the air so as
soon<00:00:42.699> as<00:00:42.760> we<00:00:43.000> release<00:00:43.150> the<00:00:43.449> ball<00:00:43.600> we<00:00:44.260> use<00:00:44.440> the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
soon as we release the ball we use the

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.950 
soon as we release the ball we use the
momentum<00:00:44.860> from<00:00:45.369> our<00:00:45.519> knees<00:00:45.729> to<00:00:46.330> another<00:00:46.690> third

momentum from our knees to another third
into<00:00:47.409> the<00:00:47.500> AK<00:00:47.650> then<00:00:48.430> our<00:00:48.549> foot<00:00:48.790> is<00:00:48.970> going<00:00:49.089> to<00:00:49.150> go

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
into the AK then our foot is going to go

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.780 
into the AK then our foot is going to go
up<00:00:49.570> oh<00:00:49.780> that<00:00:50.260> round<00:00:50.769> there<00:00:51.100> make<00:00:51.580> sure<00:00:51.610> you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
up oh that round there make sure you

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.399 
up oh that round there make sure you
don't<00:00:51.909> lift<00:00:52.119> up<00:00:52.299> too<00:00:52.659> high<00:00:52.869> because<00:00:53.110> it's

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
don't lift up too high because it's

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.930 
don't lift up too high because it's
gonna<00:00:53.559> make<00:00:53.650> hard<00:00:54.010> for<00:00:54.250> our<00:00:54.309> legs<00:00:54.519> go<00:00:54.670> around

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
gonna make hard for our legs go around

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.579 
gonna make hard for our legs go around
the<00:00:55.000> ball<00:00:55.150> as<00:00:55.510> our<00:00:55.780> leg<00:00:56.019> is<00:00:56.170> nearly<00:00:56.350> finished

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
the ball as our leg is nearly finished

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.250 
the ball as our leg is nearly finished
the<00:00:57.070> revolution<00:00:57.640> of<00:00:57.699> for<00:00:58.030> our<00:00:58.600> other<00:00:58.780> leg<00:00:59.110> is

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
the revolution of for our other leg is

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.750 
the revolution of for our other leg is
in<00:00:59.409> the<00:00:59.439> land<00:00:59.680> and<00:00:59.949> it's<00:01:00.100> gonna<00:01:00.189> stay<00:01:00.430> planted

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
in the land and it's gonna stay planted

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.450 
in the land and it's gonna stay planted
on<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.510> floor<00:01:01.750> which<00:01:02.619> allows<00:01:02.920> us<00:01:03.159> to<00:01:03.189> be<00:01:03.339> able

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
on the floor which allows us to be able

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:12.390 
on the floor which allows us to be able
to<00:01:03.610> hit<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.879> ball<00:01:04.030> back<00:01:04.180> up<00:01:04.420> with<00:01:04.720> our<00:01:04.900> firm

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.649 

once<00:01:13.400> we've<00:01:13.580> completed<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.060> revolution

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
once we've completed the revolution

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.450 
once we've completed the revolution
we're<00:01:14.960> going<00:01:15.110> to<00:01:15.170> flick<00:01:15.350> our<00:01:15.500> toes<00:01:15.710> out<00:01:15.979> it's<00:01:16.370> a

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
we're going to flick our toes out it's a

bull come directly back up our body

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.950 
bull come directly back up our body
should<00:01:19.250> be<00:01:19.460> stable<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.120> balanced<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:20.840> we

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
should be stable and balanced and we

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.150 
should be stable and balanced and we

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
should be able to continue juggle them

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.680 
should be able to continue juggle them
thing<00:01:22.460> this<00:01:22.580> is<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.850> best<00:01:23.030> way<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.210> learn<00:01:23.540> the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
thing this is the best way to learn the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.649 
thing this is the best way to learn the
whole<00:01:23.780> blog<00:01:24.080> two<00:01:24.740> reasons<00:01:25.160> reason<00:01:25.940> one<00:01:26.119> by

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
whole blog two reasons reason one by

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.510 
whole blog two reasons reason one by
doing<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.020> foot<00:01:27.200> stall<00:01:27.470> gives<00:01:28.040> us<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.280> lot<00:01:28.430> of

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
doing the foot stall gives us a lot of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.070 
doing the foot stall gives us a lot of
time<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:29.030> think<00:01:29.240> about<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.540> trick<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:29.960> our

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
time to think about the trick in our

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.230 
time to think about the trick in our
mind<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.590> then<00:01:30.710> go<00:01:30.890> ahead<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.160> execute<00:01:31.580> it<00:01:31.820> if

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
mind and then go ahead and execute it if

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.940 
mind and then go ahead and execute it if
you're<00:01:32.479> juggling<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:33.200> may<00:01:33.350> feel<00:01:33.590> pressured

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
you're juggling you may feel pressured

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.980 
you're juggling you may feel pressured
into<00:01:34.190> doing<00:01:34.310> it<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.880> then<00:01:35.090> end<00:01:35.360> up<00:01:35.479> rushing

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
into doing it and then end up rushing

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.140 
into doing it and then end up rushing
the<00:01:36.080> trick<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.770> then<00:01:36.979> found<00:01:37.190> reason<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.640> by

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
the trick and then found reason to by

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.969 
the trick and then found reason to by
doing<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.509> first<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:38.869> all<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.440> helps<00:01:39.590> us<00:01:39.860> get

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
doing the first of all it helps us get

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.710 
doing the first of all it helps us get
used<00:01:40.220> to<00:01:40.340> doing<00:01:40.490> that<00:01:40.640> hub<00:01:40.880> demotion<00:01:41.390> which

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
used to doing that hub demotion which

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.180 
used to doing that hub demotion which
makes<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.110> trick<00:01:42.320> look<00:01:42.500> good<00:01:42.680> so<00:01:42.920> once<00:01:43.070> you

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
makes the trick look good so once you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.740 
makes the trick look good so once you
use<00:01:43.400> the<00:01:43.550> dealer<00:01:43.729> hopped<00:01:44.000> away<00:01:44.149> from<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:44.509> foot

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
use the dealer hopped away from the foot

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.810 
use the dealer hopped away from the foot
stall<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.470> can<00:01:45.619> now<00:01:45.740> try<00:01:46.039> from<00:01:46.220> juggling

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.190 

pretty<00:01:49.820> important<00:01:50.270> job<00:01:50.300> with<00:01:50.600> both<00:01:50.750> feet<00:01:51.020> and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
pretty important job with both feet and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.900 
pretty important job with both feet and
land<00:01:51.380> this<00:01:51.560> trick<00:01:51.619> because<00:01:52.130> if<00:01:52.550> you<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:52.820> use

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
land this trick because if you just use

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.760 
land this trick because if you just use
the<00:01:53.149> one<00:01:53.300> foot<00:01:53.539> maybe<00:01:53.690> start<00:01:54.080> with<00:01:54.140> your<00:01:54.590> other

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
the one foot maybe start with your other

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.350 
the one foot maybe start with your other
foot<00:01:55.039> is<00:01:55.220> going<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.430> come<00:01:55.580> stuck<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.270> the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
foot is going to come stuck to the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.999
