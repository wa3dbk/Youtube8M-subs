the melted candy melt or chocolate if

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.999 
the melted candy melt or chocolate if
you're<00:01:12.689> using<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.289> then<00:01:13.710> stick<00:01:13.979> your

cookies back together

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.139 
cookies back together
I<00:01:15.689> then<00:01:16.200> find<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> lot<00:01:17.340> faster<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.850> put

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
I then find it's a lot faster to put

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.580 
I then find it's a lot faster to put
those<00:01:18.299> into<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.719> fridge<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.140> put<00:01:19.350> them<00:01:19.409> onto

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
those into the fridge so put them onto

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.649 
those into the fridge so put them onto
like<00:01:19.859> a<00:01:19.890> cutting<00:01:20.340> board<00:01:20.520> or<00:01:20.789> a<00:01:20.880> flat<00:01:21.270> plate<00:01:21.630> or

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
like a cutting board or a flat plate or

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.270 
like a cutting board or a flat plate or
something<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.289> going<00:01:22.469> to<00:01:22.590> keep<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.979> flat

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
something that's going to keep that flat

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.410 
something that's going to keep that flat
and<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.549> shape<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.000> don't<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.299> move

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
and in shape because you don't to move

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.999 
and in shape because you don't to move
them<00:01:24.600> around<00:01:24.689> too<00:01:25.020> much<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.710> they<00:01:25.859> just

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
them around too much because they just

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.560 
them around too much because they just
slide<00:01:26.340> everywhere<00:01:26.609> so<00:01:27.149> put<00:01:27.329> them<00:01:27.420> onto

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
slide everywhere so put them onto

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.569 
slide everywhere so put them onto
something<00:01:28.020> flat<00:01:28.289> pop<00:01:28.619> them<00:01:28.890> into<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> fridge

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
something flat pop them into the fridge

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.880 
something flat pop them into the fridge
and<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.880> will<00:01:30.060> set<00:01:30.390> them<00:01:30.570> nice<00:01:30.929> and<00:01:31.259> firm<00:01:31.560> so

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
and that will set them nice and firm so

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.179 
and that will set them nice and firm so
that<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.969> with<00:01:33.149> your<00:01:33.570> dipping

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.379 
chocolate because then it will set these
will<00:03:15.269> sort<00:03:15.870> of<00:03:16.250> blob<00:03:17.250> around<00:03:17.609> a<00:03:17.909> little<00:03:18.150> bit

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
will sort of blob around a little bit

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.430 
will sort of blob around a little bit
and<00:03:18.569> you've<00:03:18.659> got<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.840> be<00:03:18.900> careful<00:03:19.079> where<00:03:19.349> you

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and you've got to be careful where you

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.689 
and you've got to be careful where you
put<00:03:19.560> your<00:03:19.680> blobs<00:03:19.949> and<00:03:20.190> where<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.400> pull<00:03:20.579> it

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
put your blobs and where you pull it

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:21.890 
put your blobs and where you pull it
because<00:03:20.970> then<00:03:21.120> it'll<00:03:21.329> just<00:03:21.359> drip<00:03:21.690> down<00:03:21.840> the

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
because then it'll just drip down the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.439 
because then it'll just drip down the
side<00:03:22.199> so<00:03:22.769> at<00:03:22.919> my<00:03:23.099> advice<00:03:23.459> if<00:03:23.819> you're<00:03:24.030> doing<00:03:24.239> it

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
side so at my advice if you're doing it

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.170 
side so at my advice if you're doing it
is<00:03:24.569> use<00:03:24.750> dark<00:03:24.989> chocolate<00:03:25.379> it's<00:03:25.709> a<00:03:25.799> lot<00:03:25.949> easier

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
is use dark chocolate it's a lot easier

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.939 
is use dark chocolate it's a lot easier
but<00:03:27.180> for<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.479> mouth<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.900> don't<00:03:28.229> want<00:03:28.470> such<00:03:28.739> a

but for the mouth I don't want such a

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.460 
but for the mouth I don't want such a
large<00:03:29.220> tip<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.819> because<00:03:30.419> I'm<00:03:30.569> just<00:03:30.810> using<00:03:31.109> the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
large tip and because I'm just using the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.379 
large tip and because I'm just using the
black<00:03:31.769> sparkle<00:03:32.250> gel<00:03:32.430> again<00:03:32.579> I<00:03:32.879> have<00:03:33.030> put<00:03:33.269> it

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
black sparkle gel again I have put it

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.839

into<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> ziplock<00:03:34.439> bag<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.919> I'm<00:03:35.010> going<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.370> snip

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
into a ziplock bag and I'm going to snip

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.119 
into a ziplock bag and I'm going to snip
off<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.269> very<00:03:36.659> end<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.139> make<00:03:37.319> it<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.590> fine<00:03:37.889> tip

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
off the very end to make it a fine tip

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.349 
off the very end to make it a fine tip
again<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.519> that's<00:03:38.639> just<00:03:38.849> going<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.030> give<00:03:39.180> me<00:03:39.329> a

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
again and that's just going to give me a

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.229 
again and that's just going to give me a
smaller<00:03:40.189> strand<00:03:41.189> for<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.639> mouth<00:03:41.849> because<00:03:42.180> I
