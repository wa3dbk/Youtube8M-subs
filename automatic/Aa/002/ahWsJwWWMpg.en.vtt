00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
there are two things that I actually in

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.450 
there are two things that I actually in
terms<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.590> game<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.039> whole<00:00:17.220> universe

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
couldn't do it but this time around we

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
couldn't do it but this time around we

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
want to approach it a little bit

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.289 
want to approach it a little bit
differently<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> way<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.340> there's<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
differently in a way that there's a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.000 
differently in a way that there's a
whole<00:01:09.570> world<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:10.140> want<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> explore<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
whole world that we want to explore and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.130 
whole world that we want to explore and
there's<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.420> much<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.930> put<00:01:13.110> in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
there's just so much that you can put in

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.200 
there's just so much that you can put in
a<00:01:13.290> video<00:01:13.409> game<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.340> we're<00:01:14.430> gonna<00:01:14.520> expand<00:01:15.000> on

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
a video game so we're gonna expand on

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600 
a video game so we're gonna expand on
that<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.900> many<00:01:16.320> many<00:01:16.530> ways<00:01:16.680> whether

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
that you know in many many ways whether

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
that you know in many many ways whether
his<00:01:17.790> next<00:01:18.119> gen<00:01:18.299> open<00:01:18.570> up<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> guys<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
his next gen open up for you guys and

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.969 
his next gen open up for you guys and
expanding<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.400> world<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:22.860> hit

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
expanding that world so I think we hit

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.249 
expanding that world so I think we hit
the<00:01:23.189> jackpot<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.450> sweet<00:01:24.689> spot<00:01:24.900> actually

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the jackpot the sweet spot actually

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.800 
the jackpot the sweet spot actually
because<00:01:25.590> obviously<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:27.000> started<00:01:27.299> as<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> pc

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
because obviously we started as a pc

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.499 
because obviously we started as a pc
game<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.350> Witcher<00:01:28.650> 2<00:01:28.890> came<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> xbox<00:01:29.700> 360

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
game then Witcher 2 came for a xbox 360

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.780 
game then Witcher 2 came for a xbox 360
and<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.799> couldn't<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.520> PS

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and was really we couldn't do it on PS

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.260 
and was really we couldn't do it on PS
PS<00:01:33.150> free<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.840> various<00:01:34.170> reasons<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:35.270> but

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
PS free for various reasons and but

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.810 
PS free for various reasons and but
right<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.630> ps4<00:01:37.290> xbox<00:01:37.770> one<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.700> know

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
right now ps4 xbox one and then you know

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.960 
right now ps4 xbox one and then you know
pcs<00:01:39.540> they're<00:01:40.439> basically<00:01:40.710> similar<00:01:41.549> enact

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
pcs they're basically similar enact

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.679 
pcs they're basically similar enact
architecture<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.689> it's

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
architecture and so we can actually it's

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.380 
architecture and so we can actually it's
so<00:01:45.990> much<00:01:46.320> easier<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.369> easy<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.270> much

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
so much easier it's not easy but so much

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.600 
so much easier it's not easy but so much
easier<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:49.049> actually<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.799> know<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:50.100> into<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
easier to actually you know go into the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.660 
easier to actually you know go into the
next<00:01:51.000> gen<00:01:51.240> territory<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:52.049> do

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
next gen territory and do

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.510 
next gen territory and do
whole<00:01:53.330> communities<00:01:53.509> open<00:01:54.500> world<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:55.130> huge

for<00:02:36.110> garel<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:37.510> because<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.690> we<00:02:39.110> had<00:02:39.500> to

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
for garel and because of that we had to

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.100 
for garel and because of that we had to
answer<00:02:40.250> all<00:02:40.940> those<00:02:41.090> questions<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:41.989> know

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
answer all those questions that you know

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.809 
answer all those questions that you know
came<00:02:42.440> up<00:02:42.620> over<00:02:42.950> which<00:02:43.190> are<00:02:43.340> one<00:02:43.459> in<00:02:43.640> which<00:02:43.790> you

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
came up over which are one in which you

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.460 
came up over which are one in which you
too<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:46.100> was<00:02:46.250> very<00:02:46.310> challenging<00:02:47.319> again<00:02:48.319> we

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
too so it was very challenging again we

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.979 
too so it was very challenging again we
had<00:02:48.590> open<00:02:48.920> world<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.819> know<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.330> great

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
had open world and you know a great

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.660 
had open world and you know a great
story<00:02:51.319> they<00:02:51.410> wanted<00:02:51.709> to<00:02:51.830> tell<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.549> was

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
story they wanted to tell so that was

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.970 
story they wanted to tell so that was
very<00:02:52.730> challenging<00:02:53.090> but<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.110> think<00:02:54.440> we<00:02:54.799> nailed

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
very challenging but I think we nailed

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.370 
very challenging but I think we nailed
it<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:55.940> really<00:02:56.480> done<00:02:56.750> really<00:02:57.019> well<00:02:57.170> from

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
it and it's really done really well from

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.319 
it and it's really done really well from
my<00:02:57.530> perspective<00:02:57.709> it<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.579> I<00:02:58.970> think<00:02:59.180> people

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
my perspective it and I think people

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.990 
my perspective it and I think people
will<00:02:59.540> love<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.950> what's<00:03:00.950> your<00:03:01.850> guys

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
will love it what's your guys

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.759 
will love it what's your guys
perspective<00:03:02.570> when<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.079> comes<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.470> creating

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
perspective when it comes to creating

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.229 
perspective when it comes to creating
something<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.310> does<00:03:04.549> have<00:03:04.730> that<00:03:04.850> driving

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
something that does have that driving

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.550 
something that does have that driving
story<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:05.750> there's<00:03:05.900> open<00:03:06.170> enough<00:03:06.260> that

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
story but there's open enough that

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.810 
story but there's open enough that
people<00:03:06.590> can<00:03:06.980> go<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.160> do<00:03:07.370> what<00:03:07.489> they<00:03:07.609> want

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
people can go and do what they want

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.440 
people can go and do what they want
along<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.269> way<00:03:08.299> I<00:03:08.920> think<00:03:09.920> we<00:03:10.850> tried<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.299> keep

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
along the way I think we tried to keep

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.120 
along the way I think we tried to keep
it<00:03:11.570> balanced<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.440> way<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:12.620> for<00:03:13.250> example<00:03:13.340> we

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
it balanced in a way so for example we

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.890 
it balanced in a way so for example we
do<00:03:16.130> have<00:03:16.760> something<00:03:17.030> that<00:03:17.269> we<00:03:17.359> call<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.720> main

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
do have something that we call the main

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.449 
do have something that we call the main
storyline<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:18.320> it's<00:03:18.560> not<00:03:18.799> really<00:03:19.040> mine<00:03:19.280> sir

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
storyline but it's not really mine sir

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.580 
storyline but it's not really mine sir
line<00:03:19.670> because<00:03:20.030> all<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.780> quests<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.320> I<00:03:21.380> think

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
line because all the quests and I think

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.410 
line because all the quests and I think
it<00:03:21.680> mix<00:03:21.950> just<00:03:22.160> like<00:03:22.370> in<00:03:22.489> real<00:03:22.519> life<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:23.150> cannot

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
it mix just like in real life you cannot

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.240 
it mix just like in real life you cannot
distinguish<00:03:24.019> like<00:03:24.200> okay<00:03:24.650> this<00:03:24.799> is<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:25.070> path

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
distinguish like okay this is the path

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.949 
distinguish like okay this is the path
that<00:03:25.280> I'm<00:03:25.519> taking<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.090> other<00:03:26.420> things<00:03:26.810> that

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
that I'm taking and other things that

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.810 
that I'm taking and other things that
are<00:03:27.140> not<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.859> main<00:03:28.100> path<00:03:28.310> we<00:03:28.519> don't<00:03:28.700> do

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
are not in the main path we don't do

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.479 
are not in the main path we don't do
over<00:03:29.030> something<00:03:29.420> so<00:03:29.630> everything<00:03:30.620> merges

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
over something so everything merges

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:32.830 
over something so everything merges
together<00:03:31.940> because<00:03:32.329> that's<00:03:32.510> your<00:03:32.690> whole

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
together because that's your whole

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.080 
together because that's your whole
experience<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.500> if<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.280> turn<00:03:34.489> somebody<00:03:34.730> down

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
experience so if you turn somebody down

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.530 
experience so if you turn somebody down
maybe<00:03:36.079> you<00:03:36.230> will<00:03:36.319> patch<00:03:36.560> when<00:03:36.769> yes<00:03:37.069> if<00:03:37.910> if<00:03:38.390> you

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
maybe you will patch when yes if if you

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.559 
maybe you will patch when yes if if you
don't<00:03:38.750> do<00:03:38.989> something<00:03:39.069> then<00:03:40.069> maybe<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:41.420> know

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
don't do something then maybe you know

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.479 
don't do something then maybe you know
there<00:03:42.290> was<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.440> village<00:03:42.799> somebody<00:03:43.130> asks<00:03:43.459> you

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
there was a village somebody asks you
