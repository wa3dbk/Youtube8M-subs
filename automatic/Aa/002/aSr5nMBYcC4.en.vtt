00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.120

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.550
 as he drove almost 100 thousand 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.829
 kilometers how did he feel and how 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.059
 Now he himself feels as important 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.059
 how much pleasure gives 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.100
 what is dear friends is my favorite 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.290
 daughter call me eric davidovich for my 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:17.680
 back BMW x5 m this car drove 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:23.050
 95,000 kilometers this car is not 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.330
 just bmw this car is the strongest 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.030
 car in my opinion from the fact that on 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.030
 offer on the market today 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.740
 than he is so good you get great 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.960
 pleasure on the track 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.970
 you get great pleasure on 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.190
 track you get huge 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.490
 curbing pleasure you 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.560
 get great pleasure from 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.450
 music from how this car behaves 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.760
 on how fast it is 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.740
 how comfortable she is and reasoning 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.930
 that breaks more that breaks less 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.060
 this is complete bullshit in general because 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.460
 say what mercedes reliable audi 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.750
 or audi break more and than bmw it on 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.840
 really absolute nonsense 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.640
 all cars break down depending on 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.270
 In addition, as far as you competently 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.270
 use 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.470
 this is unlikely 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.470
 in brilliance 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.260
 very competently using his 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.959
 vehicle so i always 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.650
 in the trunk there is when from the spare because 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.170
 what on obama x5m is it really a disease 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.510
 the disease they break they break constantly 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.599
 and it doesn't matter if we have tyunyachka or 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.120
 There is absolutely no stock car 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.560
 able to break a year for example tone 23 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.780
 drive to that weaknesses let's 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400
 Weak places go through but their weak 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.830
 places brake system 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.810
 Well, not so much as weak as it hits 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.890
 you can afford only 6 constantly 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:25.040
 constantly goes costs to big by 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.870
 pads on the brake disc is enough 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.819
 seriously and all tires 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.549
 tires despite the fact that all-wheel drive 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.599
 constantly have to change and do and 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.599
 often enough 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.260
 racks 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.150
 suspension of questions at all to these 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.299
 positions no well, just by definition 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.489
 because these things don't break well not 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.349
 break down here the car drove 95,000 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.239
 kilometers on the suspension did not change not 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.940
 one rack is not front and back all 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.989
 super exhaust system was completely 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.519
 redone redid collector removed 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.829
 catalyst and knocked them out 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.220
 mean pixel downpipe they set yes 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.500
 that is, just stood cut out now 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.030
 I'll tell you the flame arresters cut off well and 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.920
 accordingly with the resonator yes that is 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.880
 And when they sawed, they stuck the same bank 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.560
 the back banks left stock nice 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.130
 sound like nothing more basically 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.130
 minutes 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:40.740
 for someone the car is just a friend for 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:43.880
 someone car just a piece of iron for 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.930
