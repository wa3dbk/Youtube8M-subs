racing was really not on anybody's radar
screen<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:51.830> so<00:01:52.040> if<00:01:52.130> i<00:01:52.220> was<00:01:52.369> going<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.549> really

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
screen and so if i was going to really

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.219 
screen and so if i was going to really
have<00:01:52.970> a<00:01:53.000> career<00:01:53.330> and<00:01:53.390> continue<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.080> have<00:01:54.200> a

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
have a career and continue to have a

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.740 
have a career and continue to have a
career<00:01:54.560> I<00:01:54.619> had<00:01:54.950> to<00:01:55.040> look<00:01:55.159> elsewhere<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.820> NASCAR

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
career I had to look elsewhere to NASCAR

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.120 
career I had to look elsewhere to NASCAR
was<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:56.960> first<00:01:57.140> thing<00:01:57.320> I<00:01:57.409> looked<00:01:57.619> at<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.040> I

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
was the first thing I looked at and I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.859 
was the first thing I looked at and I
couldn't<00:01:58.400> get<00:01:58.549> anybody<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:59.030> listen<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.509> me<00:01:59.630> and

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
couldn't get anybody to listen to me and

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.899 
couldn't get anybody to listen to me and
so<00:02:00.290> then<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.710> thought<00:02:00.740> about<00:02:01.130> doing<00:02:01.340> Indy<00:02:01.700> cars

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
so then I thought about doing Indy cars

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.219 
so then I thought about doing Indy cars
but<00:02:02.150> I<00:02:02.180> didn't<00:02:02.450> know<00:02:02.509> how<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.659> get<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.869> open

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
but I didn't know how to get to open

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.780 
but I didn't know how to get to open
wheel<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:03.979> thought<00:02:04.189> if<00:02:04.369> I<00:02:04.460> could<00:02:04.520> go<00:02:04.759> to

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
wheel so I thought if I could go to

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.179 
wheel so I thought if I could go to
Talladega<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.600> set<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.869> record<00:02:06.159> with<00:02:07.159> a

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
Talladega and set a record with a

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.190 
Talladega and set a record with a
turbocharged<00:02:07.939> four-cylinder<00:02:08.689> engine<00:02:09.049> which

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
turbocharged four-cylinder engine which

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.869 
turbocharged four-cylinder engine which
I<00:02:09.349> currently<00:02:09.619> was<00:02:09.979> racing<00:02:10.369> with<00:02:10.399> ford<00:02:10.700> motor

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
I currently was racing with ford motor

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.399 
I currently was racing with ford motor
company<00:02:11.329> that<00:02:11.779> would<00:02:11.900> give<00:02:12.049> me<00:02:12.200> turbo

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
company that would give me turbo

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:13.400 
company that would give me turbo
