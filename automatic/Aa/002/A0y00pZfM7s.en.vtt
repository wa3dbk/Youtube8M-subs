00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
that's why I have to do in a couple of

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.300 
that's why I have to do in a couple of
these<00:02:45.660> things<00:02:45.900> because<00:02:46.440> they<00:02:46.740> weren't<00:02:46.950> prove

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
these things because they weren't prove

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.680 
these things because they weren't prove
it<00:02:47.460> 4.2<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:50.160> if<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.610> go<00:02:50.760> all<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.480> way<00:02:51.510> down

you'll see windows shatter so you just

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.270 
you'll see windows shatter so you just
install<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.650> in<00:02:55.980> there<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.930> then<00:02:57.930> they'll

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
install that in there and then they'll

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.880 
install that in there and then they'll
just<00:02:59.280> go<00:02:59.460> back<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.700> go<00:03:00.090> into<00:03:00.330> settings<00:03:00.890> then
