00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.719
 to make a pole position of high pole the 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.380
 chest the first thing we have to do 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.140
 is to fix the hip 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.100
 the following adjust the cushions to the 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.100
 height of our legs 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.660
 grab the mensura somewhat higher than the 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.110
 width of the shoulders and pronation 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.330
 with palms facing forward 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.130
 we started the movement 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.990
 lowering the bar in a controlled manner 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.220
 up to the sternum 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:39.040
 and stretching completely up is very 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:43.300
 important as you see here keep a 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 Straight back at all times and perform 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.040
 a full range of movement 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.340
 some of the most common mistakes can 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.630
 occur when we try to load in 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.630
 excess pulley 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.210
 to three goods put all machine 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.300
 and to look extends 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.500
 effectively backwards 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.560
 keep your 'not white 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.570
 so we can injure ourselves 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.360
 another common mistake that occurs when 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.710
 we have a loading process 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.530
 AndrÃ© of great mind the whole machine 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.119
 I can easily pull otherwise look has 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.220
 lost the lumbar curvature 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.890
 completely 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.940
 this error is increasingly dangerous that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.860
 the previous one 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.160
 two other common mistakes that we have 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.730
 that trying to avoid is to maintain a 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.430
 continuous and by extension techniques this 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.400
 is when andres produces the extension 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.240
 we arrive should re-launch a head 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.380
 so look at trend simply 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.440
 they contain cervical hyperextension 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.440
 to allow the bar to Navarre 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.330
 is 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.159
 when we raise the bar do not do it 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.370
 controlled form 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.640
 this is a total risk of choice for 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.450
 we have to control that movement 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.450
 nothing 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.980
 ah 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.750
 nothing
