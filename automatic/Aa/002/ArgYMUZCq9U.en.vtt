00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.949
 Holy shit !! 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.920
 The range of 4000rpm-5000rpm is different from CBR250R. I feel one cylinder more. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.060
 Really ugly. interesting. pleasant. 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.560
 The CBR 250R is fun at 6000 rpm-7000 rpm. 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.240
 There is room in engine power. It accelerates even at 3000 rpm. 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.930
 wakabalife and sivava's MC19 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.090
 In the case of a four-cylinder CBR 250R, it is necessary to increase the engine speed. 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.150
 You can not get acceleration unless you keep high speed. 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.310
 I want to avoid hitting the wind jammer. But it does not go well. 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.780
 I want to go home before it gets dark. 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.230
 It is 3:54 now. 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.910
 Windy! Windy! Very windy. 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.590
 The wind that is different from the wind that a motorbike raises strikes me. 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.220
 wow !! BINASU is anchored. 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.080
 It's windy. 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.080
 It is likely to be blown away. 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.410
 BINASU anchored there, 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.880
 I got on when I and Mr. TONO went to Hokkaido. 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.870
 The sea is great. 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.690
 White waves are standing. 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.200
 Does the front truck stop? Show me your will !! 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.200
 I found a Ninja 1000 and others bike. And I was about to fall in the sand. 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.409
 Are you going to Hokkaido now? 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:18.969
 I was about to fall in the sand. 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:25.219
 It slides when it runs on the gravel. 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.129
 This bike is not my bike. 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:34.129
 My brother's bike 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.729
 This bike is easy to bounce when you get over an obstacle. 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.999
 It is difficult to express. 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.289
 My vocabulary is small. 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:52.629
 This bike is good. 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.339
 I wanted to talk to the previous rider. However, I ran out of amazement because I was about to fall. 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:59.619
 I have a business to go out. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.779
 Will the ninja with two mufflers be 1000cc? 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.269
 There is a lack of knowledge about Ninja. 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:12.249
 Before this, I thought that I wanted you to see the Ninja 1000 displayed in a motorcycle shop. 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:19.249
 Pressing the button changes the angle of the windscreen. 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.619
 The XT250 is also a fun bike. 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.500
 But if you go far, this bike is good. 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:50.809
 xt250 has been customized for long distance travel. 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.919
 Shit The wind is intense. 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.949
 But my nose still bears pollen. 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.019
 I want to go home by six o'clock. 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:19.239
 Let's travel one hour one way. 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:28.359
 Is this scenery beautiful? 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.259
 Wind blows from the right 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:51.259
 The bike is blown by the wind. It's like a highway. 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.539
 Run prefectural road No. 2 and go to Kanagi? 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.120
 The wind is strong enough to feel death. 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.540
 Bikes with large cowls are vulnerable to crosswinds. 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.729
 I'm driving while leaning to the right. 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.770
 There is nothing to shut the wind around. 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.219
 Signboard of Seikan Tunnel Memorial Hall 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:19.219
 An accident occurred today at the Seikan Tunnel. 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.020
 The front viaduct is from the Shinkansen. 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.419
 There should be little wind in the mountains. 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:53.370
 I failed, and I got pollen even though I was wearing a mask. 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:00.370
 If there are oncoming vehicles, the road will be open. 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.979
 From this point on, I give priority to the engine sound of the bike over my narration. 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:10.649
 Not everyone is expecting narration.
