pianos<00:02:07.700> as<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.270> said<00:02:08.540> Santa<00:02:08.869> has<00:02:09.080> made<00:02:09.200> an

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
pianos as I said Santa has made an

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.920 
pianos as I said Santa has made an
effort<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:10.010> make<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.760> Kenobi's<00:02:11.270> sound<00:02:11.690> more

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930
