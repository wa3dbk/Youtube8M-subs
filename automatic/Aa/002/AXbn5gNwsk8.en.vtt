00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.860
 If we welcome Germany now 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.450
 most successful kickboxer dr christine 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.660
 Theiss and catch them with a small 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.660
 applause 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.369
 yes hello hearty person we are here 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.679
 on the ifa that's not exactly one 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.410
 sports fair we know technical fair here 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.119
 it's about vertebrae around fitness trekkers 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.950
 and these devices I see there too 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:40.309
 what do not you use the advantage 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.860
 actually uses that of epson and 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.809
 why am I doing this because he is not just 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.760
 the movement must have motion sensors 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.230
 but actually measures the pulse 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.940
 so the device cheats all this 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.469
 things that used to exist so speak 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.059
 when movement was measured I had 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.559
 For example, often the problem or the 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.660
 I've counted one step 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.949
 hour worked on Saturday again 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.719
 Overpowered really have it going 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.980
 I say white hour lying around 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.230
 and have not moved or walked 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:11.360
 only 5 and since no discreetly prescribed before 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.210
 and the device measures here directly pulse 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.130
 that I did not actually use it 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.229
 you're a professional athlete so 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.119
 First of all there are these devices 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.710
 Well, as long as she does not enter yet 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.909
 two years since she really makes sense 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.880
 are connect to the smartphone 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.950
 and transferring data what do you need 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.540
 as a pro and what maybe needs yes 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.470
 normal human that says I do 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.670
 actually only a normal one 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.380
 endurance training and wants so 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.110
 So control me a bit 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.340
 in fact for professionals, I think 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.979
 do not even decide so there is 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.869
 other models still much 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.420
 are more accurate and then with clock 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.189
 riding or other league still in 150 hp 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.570
 where you can record exactly how 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.280
 I had been jogging for a long time , for example 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.079
 where did I have which speeds 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.610
 this is actually here now 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.439
 housewife bracelet that's what I call now 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.600
 and I am also now a Sun 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.250
 to say i am your sport retiree and 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.560
 That's why I'm not going to exactly 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.360
 the target group that means I want to fit in 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.180
 everyday stay put in everyday life 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.280
 that I move more and I know 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.380
 So if I then read the number on 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.140
 my iphone or whatever 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.170
 and I see now I still have 5000 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.640
 to take steps today 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.250
 I'm so a few feels 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.410
 thus incited and motivated and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.209
 then I take the stairs and not 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.370
 the elevator or park the car two 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.980
 roads continue to run so things where you 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.599
 automatically the movement starts in 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.959
 everyday life with single was not comparable 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.430
 That sometimes with so when you supermarket 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.620
 goes and so heart gets depending on 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.910
 income is just as heartening and heartfelt 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.380
 Here I just saw steps and 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.910
 Movements and I find a helpful one 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.550
 instrument to motivate them 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.440
 Now we'll talk about steps then 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.550
 Pulse values ​​will be available in the future 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.260
 maybe you can do much more 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.970
 you can measure blood pressure and so on 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.680
 how useful is this or up to one 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.299
 up to which straight it makes sense 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.830
 for the housewife we ​​say quiet 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.519
 sometimes and where will maybe even one 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.140
 a little too much 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.019
 I think everyone has to do that for themselves 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.340
 so i decide to as we do 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.130
 example , you can also in the app 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.280
 enter what you ate how much 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.049
 Calorie you already crap out how much 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.549
 calories consumed when you go to 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.230
 example wants to lose weight very much 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.580
 meaningful not only how much 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.440
 one has consumed, but above all how 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.609
 many you can eat then you can 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.620
 you eat your food that is for 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.780
 For example, a point which I do not do 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.609
 that I do not have to lose weight that and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.470
 So that's exactly why I let myself 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.609
 I just leave the point me 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.900
 everyone has to think for themselves 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.209
 decide if someone for example 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.500
 problems with the blood pressure that would have been 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.260
 future music that one with such a 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.970
 but small device can measure then 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.769
 is that interesting for someone so 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.970
 I have to do that for everyone 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.430
 Just like me, for example 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.109
 Switch off gps function because I think 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.549
 that nobody cares 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.780
 or if you are from the treadmill or 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.400
 that's the way it should be 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.440
 not the distance but the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.459
 calories or just in consumption 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.320
 Now they are saying that is possible 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.459
 no one what on where is the limit 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.350
 you have to be careful too 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.090
 one this data so we know that 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.650
 facebook because someone has a great 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.609
 run and that is me 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.239
 have so many miles today 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.680
 ran 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.030
 that can, of course, cheer you on 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.590
 but it can also motivate you 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.200
 be a bit too much that the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.510
 companies say health insurance companies for example or 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.190
 I would like to have this data 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.959
 be careful and how it works 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.400
 this app for example as i think 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.470
 That must be back for everyone 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.030
 decide for yourself that is the same if 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.039
 For example, I have a payback card 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.390
 I do not have them because I do not have them 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.030
 Matching advertising at home in the mailbox 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.440
 to have 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.000
 but many people are always forgetting 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.680
 must decide for yourself how 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.580
 I go far how far I give things 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.080
 Price and I think if you look for 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.580
 Him as a mature citizen himself 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.550
 decided that I have the ins 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.050
 so I would like to ask internet 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.639
 even for example, use the app only 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.710
 for myself against your none 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.790
 community pure but I'm interested 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.050
 me only for myself as for 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.419
 How much do I have in the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.710
 slept that last night 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.419
 Example to see very interesting 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.430
 Although I have already slept but only 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.810
 So seven was seven hours 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.160
 of it a light sleep in this 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.350
 a bit deep that explains why 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.700
 I am totally destroyed and these are things 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.320
 which personally interest me but 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.730
 I do not share that with anyone else 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.960
 some people have to do it differently 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.280
 Everyone will decide for themselves 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.750
 but this would be synonymous everything or 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.130
 can measure it and then you can do it yourself 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.040
 decide what Herr I want to find 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.419
 even very good there is a function there 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.300
 You give one up to when you are at the latest 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.550
 wake up and then the clock is the 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.550
 sleep phases and wake you up very gently 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.260
 integrate at a moment where I already am 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.729
 a wake up phase because often is like that 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.900
 that you have different phases and 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.900
 then the alarm clock rings man is just 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.050
 shredded and I find it a lot 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.850
 pleasant wake up they threw 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.250
 pleasant on them are no fun at all 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.260
 question you are highly motivated and now 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.520
 There are photos of them in a big one 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.380
 I would like German male magazine 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.940
 say how did the playboy motivate her? 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.700
 I think he has tried for many years 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.810
 that said now yes I 'll do it 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.539
 have done it where are the photos 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.460
 The photos were taken at the beginning 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.200
 august on mallorca is shot though 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.370
 relatively spontaneous so i believe in july 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.780
 but rather people approached me 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.700
 actually for many many years 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.990
 but for me it has in the years 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.520
 before 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.260
 made no sense I had ever 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.640
 Maxime I was a professional athlete 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.740
 nothing had changed for me was 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.570
 I do not have that for myself either 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.280
 Really why I want it again 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.540
 which should do is it was beautiful 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.160
 pictures that must be enough 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.510
 but i have been since my very end 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.130
 my sport career since december 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.130
 just changed last year 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:25.090
 from my behavior help female 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:28.090
 become of the yes of the fitness 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:29.350
 Behavior during the day by the figure of the 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.990
 Whole attitude I feel 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.460
 just perfect and it has as you 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.350
 then asked me it was correct 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.140
 Now I'm ready now I am 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.610
 yes and yes, but I am also someone now 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.560
 different and I am completely satisfied with 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.340
 the way it is and the shooting 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.660
 was 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.160
 I'm so glad that it did it 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.900
 Alone from the people in the 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.130
 shooting was so much fun that was 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.570
 just great i just had it right 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.530
 lust are really great too 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.990
 aesthetic pictures 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.550
 last question as not profi more 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.350
 nowadays how much do they still train 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:58.150
 during the week 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.350
 how much more is this compared to 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.720
 a normal person I say 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.060
 maybe doing sport three times a week 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.620
 Here we come, I'll do it myself 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.300
 not so much i actually do 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.220
 every day only 15 minutes 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.200
 I have a small one for myself 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.120
 compile the circle I make for myself 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.720
 where I once makes the body completely 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.190
 legs belly arms back and 15 minutes 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.780
 You can do it everywhere but I am yes 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.980
 also constantly traveling then you create 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.860
 the steps also not always and for it 

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.510
 But you can do it in general or from time to time 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.270
 if the time is still running and that 

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.650
 It was more fun and top fit 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.120
