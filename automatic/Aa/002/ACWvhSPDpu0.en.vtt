00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.029 
of a cool idea and over here we got the
sports<00:00:45.899> car<00:00:46.110> which<00:00:46.289> seems<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.920> have

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
fireplace here did not melt anything

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.460 
fireplace here did not melt anything
because<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.970> made<00:01:42.299> sure<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.750> check<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:42.990> before

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
because I made sure to check that before

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.219 
because I made sure to check that before
I<00:01:43.500> came<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.729> oh<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.450> god<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.659> love<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.110> this

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.630 
I came in but oh my god I love this this
is<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> interior<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:46.979> isn't<00:01:47.310> too<00:01:47.490> all

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
is the interior on this isn't too all

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160 
is the interior on this isn't too all
amazing<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.060> bought<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.390> long<00:01:48.570> time<00:01:48.600> ago<00:01:48.990> so

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
amazing I bought this a long time ago so

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.600 
amazing I bought this a long time ago so
I've<00:01:49.409> obviously<00:01:49.560> improved<00:01:50.100> since<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.430> but

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
I've obviously improved since then but

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.160 
I've obviously improved since then but
at<00:01:50.939> least<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.329> bushes<00:01:51.600> are<00:01:51.720> still<00:01:51.930> moving

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
at least the bushes are still moving

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.020 
at least the bushes are still moving
like<00:01:52.350> there's<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.829> guess<00:01:52.860> yeah<00:01:53.579> why<00:01:53.729> would<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
like there's I guess yeah why would the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.399 
like there's I guess yeah why would the
I<00:01:54.210> guess<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> doors<00:01:54.720> opens<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.110> guess<00:01:55.229> there's

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
I guess the doors opens I guess there's

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.630 
I guess the doors opens I guess there's
some<00:01:55.439> wind<00:01:55.680> blowing<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.310> guess<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.579> we

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
some wind blowing in so I guess that we

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.370 
some wind blowing in so I guess that we
can<00:01:56.729> explain<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.659> here's<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
can explain it like that but here's the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.410 
can explain it like that but here's the
outside<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:59.280> back<00:01:59.759> up<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.180> log

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
outside here back up like a little log

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.719 
outside here back up like a little log
cabin<00:02:01.009> over<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.250> got<00:02:02.369> some<00:02:02.549> barstools

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
cabin over here we got some barstools

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.420 
cabin over here we got some barstools
which<00:02:03.329> looks<00:02:03.540> great<00:02:03.600> here<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> pool<00:02:04.619> which

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
which looks great here is the pool which

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.770 
which looks great here is the pool which
of<00:02:05.610> course<00:02:05.640> looks<00:02:06.000> over<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.270> endless<00:02:06.570> abyss

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
of course looks over the endless abyss

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.800 
of course looks over the endless abyss

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
them in the rudos anyway let's go ahead

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.080 
them in the rudos anyway let's go ahead
and<00:05:53.240> do<00:05:53.360> route<00:05:54.260> of<00:05:54.410> play<00:05:54.590> shaders<00:05:55.250> and<00:05:55.610> let's

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
and do route of play shaders and let's

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.540 
and do route of play shaders and let's
see<00:05:56.210> what<00:05:56.330> it<00:05:56.419> looks<00:05:56.570> like<00:05:56.740> so<00:05:57.740> actually<00:05:58.520> that

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550
