00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.900
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.740
 research in outdoor live or other side 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.710
 the enlightenment broadcast from another 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.550
 view human being about human life 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.199
 my name is marchand milan again per 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.430
 one is currently a profession people 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.160
 focus communication continues why 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.989
 from person to person because I have none 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.010
 to lead the city, I'm not 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.100
 chairwoman 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.680
 I do not have a large group to manage 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.969
 I do not even have science 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.870
 studies psychology 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.300
 but I have since since I can think about 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.329
 studied all the logic of life and it 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.270
 is a logic but the logic of 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.300
 To understand one's life requires another 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.799
 take a view 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.990
 We are looking all understand after happiness 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.810
 and then luckily I have the most 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.450
 Maybe love found a relationship 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.060
 I have a roof over that 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.540
 head best a house i have one 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:24.979
 job and I have quotas yet that is 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.979
 I just quite fulfill that is 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.329
 being happy involves me 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.090
 fulfillment of the demands, however, that 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.320
 luck and the beautiful is the truth 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.200
 for the country band take away yet 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.210
 can you lose her 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.579
 now that's supposed to make life wonderful 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.079
 Business provided but 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:56.579
 why did it most do not and 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:58.950
 Let's take a look at this because 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.219
 we he can not see not 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.600
 know that it exists 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.369
 I was such a one 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.569
 but did not know it at all 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.700
 there and then there are people who 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.130
 Let's take a look at what is here now 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.030
 the fulfillment that is life 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.310
 provides and there is 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.150
 People who see that they see the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.190
 fulfillment but you can not do it 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.420
 grab or she can not pick herself up 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.230
 Euro can not pick it up because they 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.360
 have driven and if we do not know 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.550
 what captivates us then we can 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.100
 Do not get rid of it and for that 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.310
 is pimp up your life 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.890
 how that affects us on the outside and how 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:53.370
 but we still get rid of it 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.680
 important to say is the fulfillment of the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.290
 is not the fulfillment out there 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.680
 is in there and if you have the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.480
 fulfillment of one has found then 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.340
 one trades with the heart 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.860
 Talk live is on it with five 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.299
 categories series that means we have 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.959
 people system 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:19.140
 we have spiritual values 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.690
 spiritual concept where it is known 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.400
 we are being of light is in all 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.340
 the moor fisherman connected with each other 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.950
 it is burning field and many 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.930
 Express more for a layman 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.049
 or sometimes not even for a relative 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.790
 difficult to understand yourself 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.500
 to introduce anything under it 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.090
 then we are the ones and despite 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.640
 votes from the folk because I am happy 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.829
 already on a male that 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.640
 who also tells us succinctly 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:51.480
 why when me it is more then 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.840
 We have the shipment concentration in 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.019
 the conflict culture therefore 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.120
 I know that he brings in what 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.890
 there I will be in there 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.260
 looking for our life the desire has one 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.900
 pilot project based on the 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.120
 new conflict culture and failures 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.120
 what can i do as a little human for 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.890
 the values these shipments are all short 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.640
 and flush and logically understandable 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.489
 built up 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.850
 I think that said a few times ago 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.720
 15 minutes at the very most can also 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.639
 be shorter 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.910
 Definitely so you put them in the 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.860
 coffee break could see 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:32.389
 dunlop incomprehensible I work with 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.930
 metaphors and images and graphics and 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:39.200
 like every show has on my show 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.630
 effect but only a turnaround short 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.729
 advertising stands for the 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.240
 Recovery of the potential of the 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.240
 People 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.750
 that was unreal short long standing 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.850
 stayed there with our five categories 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.940
 we had themes we have how can 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.610
 To be ten percent stronger means to 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.950
 sexuality nature and environment the benefits 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.090
 of an aware human being the two 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.700
 things and strengthen our brain and 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:24.230

 flush only 27 pages I 've heard one 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.280
 half an hour reading time but the 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.870
 impoverishment processing time but something 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.210
 longer 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:05.210
