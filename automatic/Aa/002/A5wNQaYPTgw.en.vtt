very<00:01:31.350> well<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.829> actually<00:01:32.280> ended<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.790> just

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
very well I actually ended up just

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.460 
very well I actually ended up just
loving<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.479> thing<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.960> use<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.229> all<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
loving this thing and I use it all the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.499 
loving this thing and I use it all the
time<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.189> been<00:01:35.460> great<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.880> me<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
time so it's been great for me the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.030 
time so it's been great for me the
problem<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.380> has<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> tendency<00:01:37.770> to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
problem is that it has a tendency to

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.859 
problem is that it has a tendency to
slide<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.240> if<00:01:39.329> you're<00:01:39.450> standing<00:01:39.810> up

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
