00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
personal recommendation though is try to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.000 
personal recommendation though is try to
get<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.510> your<00:01:21.659> equipment<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.320> much<00:01:22.650> as<00:01:22.860> you

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
can I would definitely recommend it a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
can I would definitely recommend it a
full-frame<00:01:25.650> sensor<00:01:26.010> camera<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.550> good<00:01:27.030> lens

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
full-frame sensor camera a good lens

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.360 
full-frame sensor camera a good lens
which<00:01:27.510> is<00:01:27.540> at<00:01:27.810> least<00:01:27.840> 2.8<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.710> aperture<00:01:29.130> so

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
which is at least 2.8 in aperture so

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.830 
which is at least 2.8 in aperture so
that<00:01:29.610> will<00:01:29.760> give<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.120> low-light<00:01:30.630> good

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that will give you a low-light good

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.660 
that will give you a low-light good
result<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> basically<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.640> be

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
result and basically this is would be

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.280 
result and basically this is would be
the<00:01:32.880> minimum<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.450> more<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.719> spend<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the minimum the more you spend the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.050 
the minimum the more you spend the
better<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.619> gonna<00:01:34.829> get<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.549> what<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.850> pay

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
better is gonna get you get what you pay

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.700 
better is gonna get you get what you pay
for<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.570> definitely<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.439> wish<00:01:37.680> to

catch up with the professional in my

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.149 
catch up with the professional in my
experience<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.840> full-frame<00:01:52.320> sensor<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
experience a full-frame sensor is the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.190 
experience a full-frame sensor is the
minimum<00:01:53.520> however<00:01:53.700> after<00:01:54.539> so<00:01:54.719> many<00:01:54.840> years<00:01:55.049> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
minimum however after so many years of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.749 
minimum however after so many years of
shooting<00:01:55.590> light<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.950> believe<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.609> actually

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
shooting light I believe I can actually

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.940 
shooting light I believe I can actually
deliver<00:01:57.149> with<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.630> lesser<00:01:57.930> camera<00:01:58.380> probably

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
deliver with the lesser camera probably

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.740 
deliver with the lesser camera probably
less<00:01:59.130> than<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.399> full-frame<00:01:59.729> sensor<00:02:00.210> because

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
less than a full-frame sensor because

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.260 
less than a full-frame sensor because
I'm<00:02:00.899> Ken<00:02:01.109> I<00:02:01.289> would<00:02:01.469> probably<00:02:01.859> go<00:02:02.009> with<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.270> 660

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
I'm Ken I would probably go with the 660

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.899 
I'm Ken I would probably go with the 660
D<00:02:03.420> 60<00:02:03.960> or<00:02:04.079> 70<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.829> would<00:02:05.369> finish<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.759> job

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
D 60 or 70 I would finish the job

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.760 
D 60 or 70 I would finish the job
properly<00:02:06.359> and<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.990> client<00:02:07.439> wouldn't<00:02:07.619> even

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
properly and the client wouldn't even

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.190 
properly and the client wouldn't even
notice<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.550> remember<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.600> because<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.020> see

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
notice but remember just because you see

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.890 
purchasing a full-frame sensor camera
remember<00:02:17.490> one<00:02:17.640> thing<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.090> good<00:02:18.360> quality<00:02:18.690> image

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
remember one thing a good quality image

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.080 
remember one thing a good quality image
is<00:02:19.290> given<00:02:19.650> by<00:02:19.770> three<00:02:20.010> elements<00:02:20.520> one<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
is given by three elements one is the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.380 
is given by three elements one is the
sensor<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:22.110> gives<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.370> quality<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.240> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
sensor that gives you the quality of the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.510 
sensor that gives you the quality of the
picture<00:02:24.810> basically<00:02:25.590> that's<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> value<00:02:26.400> of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
picture basically that's the value of

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.460 
picture basically that's the value of
your<00:02:26.610> camera<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.480> other<00:02:27.630> one<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> lens

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
your camera the other one is the lens

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.800 
your camera the other one is the lens
how<00:02:29.070> sharp<00:02:29.490> your<00:02:29.670> lens<00:02:29.880> is<00:02:30.060> gonna<00:02:30.300> project<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
how sharp your lens is gonna project the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.110 
how sharp your lens is gonna project the
image<00:02:31.080> onto<00:02:31.200> your<00:02:31.500> sensor<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.190> third<00:02:32.820> of<00:02:32.940> all

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
image onto your sensor and third of all

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.720 
image onto your sensor and third of all
will<00:02:33.750> be<00:02:33.780> your<00:02:34.110> skill<00:02:34.409> three<00:02:34.830> elements<00:02:35.400> if<00:02:35.550> you

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
will be your skill three elements if you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.230 
will be your skill three elements if you
miss<00:02:35.940> one<00:02:35.970> you're<00:02:36.480> not<00:02:36.599> going<00:02:36.780> to

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
miss one you're not going to

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.880 
miss one you're not going to
so<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.630> have<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.990> put<00:02:38.170> all<00:02:38.410> these<00:02:38.650> elements

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
so you have to put all these elements

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.920 
so you have to put all these elements
together<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:39.850> conclusion<00:02:40.060> there<00:02:40.660> is<00:02:40.750> no

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
together so in conclusion there is no

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.720 
together so in conclusion there is no
clear<00:02:41.200> answer<00:02:41.260> or<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.950> limitation<00:02:42.460> what's

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
clear answer or the limitation what's

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.370 
clear answer or the limitation what's
