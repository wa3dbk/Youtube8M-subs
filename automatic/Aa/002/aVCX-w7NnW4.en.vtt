00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
okay this evening I'm testing the net

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.870 
okay this evening I'm testing the net

there is where i had the net left when I
was<00:01:50.970> testing<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> standard<00:01:52.079> cam<00:01:53.149> and<00:01:54.350> about<00:01:55.350> 4

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
was testing a standard cam and about 4

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.920 
was testing a standard cam and about 4
24<00:01:56.969> 25<00:01:57.540> was<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:59.490> net<00:01:59.759> lift<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.360> got<00:02:00.719> off

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
24 25 was the net lift that I got off

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.440 
24 25 was the net lift that I got off
the<00:02:01.320> standard<00:02:01.740> cam<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:05.240> second<00:02:06.240> version

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the standard cam with a a second version

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.510 
the standard cam with a a second version
of<00:02:06.960> change<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> rocker<00:02:08.429> arm<00:02:09.830> well<00:02:10.830> 30

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
of change on the rocker arm well 30

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:22.690 
of change on the rocker arm well 30
40<00:02:14.050> or<00:02:15.050> 50<00:02:15.860> or<00:02:19.510> 455<00:02:20.510> there<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.020> peak<00:02:21.700> will

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
40 or 50 or 455 there is the peak will

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.630 
40 or 50 or 455 there is the peak will
fit<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.890> 5.45<00:02:24.890> 5<00:02:25.430> or<00:02:25.640> 455<00:02:26.510> thousands<00:02:27.640> yeah

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
fit to 5.45 5 or 455 thousands yeah

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.970 
fit to 5.45 5 or 455 thousands yeah
those<00:02:28.850> are<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.030> people<00:02:29.150> 55<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:32.980> packed

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
those are the people 55 and packed

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:42.190 
those are the people 55 and packed
around<00:02:34.220> 20<00:02:34.700> again<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:36.970> using<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.120> arcam<00:02:41.200> we

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
around 20 again so using the arcam we

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.300 
around 20 again so using the arcam we
moved<00:02:42.500> it<00:02:42.680> up<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> nice<00:02:43.670> bit<00:02:44.000> there<00:02:44.980> d<00:02:45.980> looks

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
moved it up a nice bit there d looks

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.100 
moved it up a nice bit there d looks
like<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.640> gain<00:02:46.850> over<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.360> arcam<00:02:47.840> which

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
like the gain over the arcam which

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.229 
like the gain over the arcam which
normally<00:02:49.010> they<00:02:49.100> come<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.430> around<00:02:49.610> both<00:02:49.940> point

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
normally they come in around both point

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.520 
normally they come in around both point
375<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:52.310> here<00:02:52.700> at<00:02:53.319> 4.45<00:02:54.319> 5<00:02:54.799> we've<00:02:55.040> got<00:02:55.330> about

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
375 so here at 4.45 5 we've got about

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.400 
375 so here at 4.45 5 we've got about
Bernie<00:02:57.530> thousands<00:02:58.190> gained<00:02:58.430> over<00:02:59.299> a<00:02:59.930> standard

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
Bernie thousands gained over a standard

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.059 
Bernie thousands gained over a standard
or<00:03:00.769> one<00:03:01.069> cam<00:03:01.340> or<00:03:01.610> two<00:03:02.150> cam<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:03.040> over<00:03:04.040> a

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
or one cam or two cam and over a

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.610 
or one cam or two cam and over a
standard<00:03:04.580> cam<00:03:04.819> itself<00:03:05.269> if<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.989> was<00:03:06.170> the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
standard cam itself if that was the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.460 
standard cam itself if that was the
candles<00:03:07.310> in<00:03:07.459> it<00:03:07.489> we<00:03:07.670> would<00:03:07.850> have<00:03:08.440> over<00:03:09.440> a

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
candles in it we would have over a

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.430 
candles in it we would have over a
little<00:03:10.280> over<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.489> hundred<00:03:10.610> thousands<00:03:11.269> gain<00:03:11.510> on

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
little over a hundred thousands gain on

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.430 
little over a hundred thousands gain on
on<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.220> static<00:03:13.640> cam<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.660> I'm<00:03:14.750> real<00:03:14.959> pleased<00:03:15.170> with

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
on a static cam so I'm real pleased with

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.920 
on a static cam so I'm real pleased with
this<00:03:15.640> improvement<00:03:16.640> in<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.209> ability<00:03:17.570> of<00:03:17.600> the
