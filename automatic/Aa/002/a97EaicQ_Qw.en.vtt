that I want the spine to be if you want
something<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.320> larger<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.010> scale<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
something to be larger you just scale it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.540 
something to be larger you just scale it
with<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.489> mouse<00:00:53.670> wheel<00:00:55.250> if<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.370> want<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
with the mouse wheel if you want to

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.860 
with the mouse wheel if you want to
replace<00:00:56.820> something<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.390> stop<00:00:57.690> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
replace something you can just stop it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.380 
replace something you can just stop it
and<00:00:58.350> there's<00:00:59.219> about<00:00:59.280> 400<00:00:59.609> parts<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and there's about 400 parts in the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.209 
and there's about 400 parts in the
editor<00:01:00.690> base<00:01:00.870> pass<00:01:01.140> which<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:01.859> big

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
editor base pass which is a really big

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.439 
editor base pass which is a really big
number<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> start<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.090> they<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.270> have

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
number to start with but they all have

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.030 
number to start with but they all have
different<00:01:03.480> morphs<00:01:04.049> channels<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:04.890> these

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
different morphs channels and all these

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.020 
different morphs channels and all these
more<00:01:05.250> channels<00:01:05.580> meaning<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.850> there's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
more channels meaning that there's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.880 
more channels meaning that there's
actually<00:01:06.420> virtually<00:01:06.900> an<00:01:07.140> infinite<00:01:07.560> amount<00:01:07.650> of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
actually virtually an infinite amount of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.050 
actually virtually an infinite amount of
content<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.670> there<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:08.880> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
content you can get in there because you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.310 
content you can get in there because you
can<00:01:09.180> put<00:01:09.330> these<00:01:09.420> parts<00:01:09.750> wherever<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.110> like

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
can put these parts wherever you like

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.929 
can put these parts wherever you like
you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.680> scale<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.250> move<00:01:11.369> them<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.850> know

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
you can scale and move them you know

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.670 
you can scale and move them you know
rotate<00:01:12.330> them<00:01:12.570> morph<00:01:13.170> them<00:01:13.320> all<00:01:13.439> over<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
rotate them morph them all over the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.580 
rotate them morph them all over the
place<00:01:14.180> what<00:01:15.180> other<00:01:15.330> cool<00:01:15.479> thing<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.930> lots<00:01:16.530> of

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
place what other cool thing is lots of

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.740 
place what other cool thing is lots of
games<00:01:16.830> make<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> player<00:01:17.340> feel<00:01:17.580> stupid<00:01:17.880> they

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
basically say here's the right way to

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.920 
basically say here's the right way to
play<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.390> don't<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.810> exactly

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
play it and if you don't do it exactly
