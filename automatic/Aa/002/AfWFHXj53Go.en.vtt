00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
game and because it was so good I think

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.380 
game and because it was so good I think
the<00:03:12.840> anticipation<00:03:13.050> is<00:03:13.880> I'm<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.910> bit<00:03:15.120> more<00:03:15.270> of<00:03:15.330> a

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
the anticipation is I'm a bit more of a

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.210 
the anticipation is I'm a bit more of a
traditionalist<00:03:15.930> yeah<00:03:16.140> if<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.470> push<00:03:16.950> comes<00:03:17.160> to

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
traditionalist yeah if you push comes to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.590 
traditionalist yeah if you push comes to
shove<00:03:18.950> stuff<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.580> know<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.910> love<00:03:21.420> give

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
this a go and see how he holds my

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.310 
this a go and see how he holds my
attention<00:03:23.430> for<00:03:24.000> but<00:03:24.240> I've<00:03:24.300> got<00:03:24.420> two<00:03:24.600> sons<00:03:24.870> like

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
attention for but I've got two sons like

22<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.860> 19<00:03:25.950> who<00:03:26.370> constantly<00:03:26.880> play<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:28.080> when<00:03:28.170> I

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
22 and 19 who constantly play and when I

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.630 
22 and 19 who constantly play and when I
say<00:03:28.380> consonant<00:03:28.920> they're<00:03:29.010> on<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.220> all<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> time
