transmission<00:01:35.509> bracket<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
transmission bracket and this is the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.550 
transmission bracket and this is the
automatic<00:01:38.700> transmission<00:01:39.409> bracket<00:01:42.409> you<00:01:43.409> can

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
automatic transmission bracket you can

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.410 
automatic transmission bracket you can
see<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:45.659> bolt<00:01:46.080> pattern<00:01:46.319> is<00:01:47.420> different

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
see the the bolt pattern is different

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.600 
see the the bolt pattern is different
between<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.780> two

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
between the two

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.040 
between the two
but<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.729> mounting<00:01:51.090> pattern<00:01:51.450> between<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.840> two

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
but the mounting pattern between the two

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.620 
but the mounting pattern between the two
transmissions<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.890> exactly<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> same<00:01:53.670> it's

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
transmissions is exactly the same it's

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.310 
transmissions is exactly the same it's
just<00:01:54.719> the<00:01:54.869> ends<00:01:55.200> are<00:01:55.320> different<00:01:56.180> we<00:01:57.180> got<00:01:57.329> side

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
just the ends are different we got side

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.990 
just the ends are different we got side
by<00:01:58.500> side<00:01:58.770> bolts<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.520> manual<00:01:59.820> transmission

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
by side bolts on the manual transmission

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.580 
by side bolts on the manual transmission
and<00:02:00.899> offset<00:02:01.649> bolts<00:02:02.600> these<00:02:03.600> are<00:02:03.780> elongated<00:02:04.289> for

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and offset bolts these are elongated for

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.330 
and offset bolts these are elongated for
adjustment<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:06.450> other<00:02:06.570> sides<00:02:06.810> are<00:02:07.020> not

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
adjustment the other sides are not

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.220 
adjustment the other sides are not
straight<00:02:08.340> circles<00:02:08.929> so<00:02:10.790> there<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:11.940> it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
straight circles so there you have it

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.640 
straight circles so there you have it
automatic<00:02:13.230> transmission<00:02:13.799> is<00:02:15.650> underneath

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
automatic transmission is underneath

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.210 
automatic transmission is underneath
success<00:02:17.280> video<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:20.100> was<00:02:20.480> no<00:02:21.480> fun<00:02:22.220> my

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
success video that was no fun my

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.949 
success video that was no fun my
recommendation<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.150> buy<00:02:25.079> a<00:02:25.109> manual<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:26.959> enjoy

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959
