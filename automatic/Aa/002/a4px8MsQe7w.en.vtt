00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.620
 it is rare that a manufacturer will design 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.389
 from a blank sheet 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.520
 it's just not profitable to 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.139
 do it but when they do it they have 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.119
 the freedom to create everything they 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.830
 want the cvr 650 f is one of those cases 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.380
 rare although they were born from the line 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.839
 legendary of this cbr cbr completely 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.849
 nine tuner to the ats that first thing 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.740

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.460
 that you can not ignore and the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.290
 awesome style of the cbr 650 f 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.570
 let's go back and forth shapes 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.309
 angular and a floating fairing a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.410
 exhaust fights a mudguard 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.300
 from our backs and a taillight and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.140
 the d sitting at the top of the huge tire 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.870
 back of 180 mm you spoke they 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.010
 We are listening to you 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.629
 this is the kind of style that the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.629
 engines continued for years 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.160
 and he stores the engine the new one in 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.309
 line of honda 4 and it was created 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.809
 specifically for the cvr 650 m the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.460
 people always want the best of 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.180
 two worlds and the engines are not 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.620
 different 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.170
 we want a sporting performance 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.060
 a power and horsepower superior 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.130
 and we want the engine to be 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.950
 usable and easy to mount in 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.900
 all situations in the past you 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.400
 had been forced to choose you have 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 chose your age is based on 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.830
 which of those things you were 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.540
 ready to sacrifice 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.310
 remember what I said to 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.170
 about the freedom to create what 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.240
 you want well here's what the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.550

 double camshaft that valves by 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.620
 cylinder that employs actuation of 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.380
 direct cam is needed to provide a 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.050
 high torque below 4000 harper m 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.570
 translation easy driving off 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.180
 in departure or in traffic power 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.390

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.270

 tilted forward 30 degrees with 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.500
 a low center of gravity allows a 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.720
 easier handling 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.640

 swingarm is actually the costs a 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.000
 240 mm rear disc and two discs

 bigger than the double r assistant and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.599
