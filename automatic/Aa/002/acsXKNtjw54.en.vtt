video<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.109> later<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.680> now<00:00:58.829> we're

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
video on that later but now we're

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.200 
video on that later but now we're
focused<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.579> Sub<00:00:59.879> Zero<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.300> let's<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
focused on Sub Zero so let's get to it

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.450 
focused on Sub Zero so let's get to it
so<00:01:03.210> sub<00:01:03.539> zero's<00:01:03.960> basically<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.129> control

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
so sub zero's basically you can control

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.750 
so sub zero's basically you can control
the<00:01:05.580> ice<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.299> basically<00:01:07.260> anything<00:01:07.710> cold<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.729> I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the ice and basically anything cold so I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760 
the ice and basically anything cold so I
gave<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.240> icy<00:01:09.750> cold<00:01:09.990> touch<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.619> it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
gave it the icy cold touch to it

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.210 
gave it the icy cold touch to it
everything's<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.640> snow<00:01:12.200> with<00:01:13.200> ice<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
can see I did a good job look at this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.570 
can see I did a good job look at this

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
and up here we have sub-zero's training

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.080 
and up here we have sub-zero's training
hall

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hall

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.289 
hall
where<00:01:24.299> he<00:01:24.420> trained<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.080> quites<00:01:25.580> by<00:01:26.580> himself<00:01:27.000> i

where he trained and quites by himself i

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.960 
where he trained and quites by himself i
guess<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:28.290> don't<00:01:28.500> know<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.640> let's<00:01:29.820> go

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
guess really don't know so let's go

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.039 
guess really don't know so let's go
inside<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.979> had<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.040> 2-iron<00:01:32.610> pleasure<00:01:33.049> pleasure

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
inside I had a 2-iron pleasure pleasure

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.340 
inside I had a 2-iron pleasure pleasure
I<00:01:34.290> said<00:01:34.560> kosher<00:01:35.159> pressure<00:01:35.790> plates<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:37.049> ensure

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
I said kosher pressure plates to ensure

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.289 
I said kosher pressure plates to ensure
security<00:01:37.770> make<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.220> look<00:01:38.310> realistic<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.119> not

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
security make it look realistic and not

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
security make it look realistic and not
the<00:01:39.810> traditional<00:01:40.470> doors<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the traditional doors and this is a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.030 
the traditional doors and this is a
texture<00:01:42.420> pack<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:43.259> makes<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.680> iron<00:01:43.860> doors

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
texture pack which makes the iron doors

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.370 
texture pack which makes the iron doors
look<00:01:44.250> like<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.110> two

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
look like that so here we have two

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.100 
look like that so here we have two
little<00:01:46.710> waterways<00:01:47.399> going<00:01:48.240> down<00:01:48.450> with<00:01:48.899> snow

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
mountains glass displays this is I guess

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:02.359 
mountains glass displays this is I guess
the<00:01:55.250> main<00:01:56.250> hallway<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.990> ice<00:01:58.640> and<00:02:01.070> as<00:02:02.070> we
