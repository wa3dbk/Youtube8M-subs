a kind of a bright warm pink I'm not

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.500 
a kind of a bright warm pink I'm not
really<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.690> fan<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.140> pink<00:00:55.920> lipstick<00:00:56.460> but<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.300> I

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
really a fan of pink lipstick but then I

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.420 
really a fan of pink lipstick but then I
really<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.829> matte

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
really do like this this is a matte

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.049 
really do like this this is a matte
finish<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.870> be<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.350> bit<00:01:02.070> drying<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.879> if

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
finish so it can be a bit drying but if

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.230 
finish so it can be a bit drying but if
you<00:01:03.180> apply<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.860> chapstick<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.549> think<00:01:06.150> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you apply a chapstick and I think it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.469 
you apply a chapstick and I think it
will<00:01:06.330> be<00:01:06.479> perfectly<00:01:07.020> fine<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.850> also<00:01:08.850> decided<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
will be perfectly fine I also decided to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.330 
will be perfectly fine I also decided to
clean<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> edges<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.890> same<00:01:11.130> lip

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
clean up the edges with this same lip

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.100 
clean up the edges with this same lip
pen<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:11.939> optional<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.869> just

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
pen so this is optional but I just

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.510 
pen so this is optional but I just
decided<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.560> do<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.159> think<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
decided to do it but I think this is a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.760 
decided to do it but I think this is a
really<00:01:14.820> gorgeous<00:01:15.330> shade<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.170> summer<00:01:16.560> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
really gorgeous shade for summer and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.320 
really gorgeous shade for summer and
considering<00:01:17.280> I'm<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.909> fan<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> pink

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
considering I'm not really a fan of pink

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.600 
considering I'm not really a fan of pink
lipstick<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.580> I

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
lipstick I really do like this and I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.880 
lipstick I really do like this and I
think<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.060> complement<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:21.720> only<00:01:21.990> deep<00:01:22.290> medium

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
think we complement not only deep medium

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.640 
think we complement not only deep medium
to<00:01:23.100> deep<00:01:23.280> skin<00:01:23.520> tones<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:23.880> also<00:01:24.619> every<00:01:25.619> other

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
to deep skin tones but also every other

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.530 
to deep skin tones but also every other
skin<00:01:26.040> tone<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.790> next<00:01:32.850> shade<00:01:33.299> I'm

sometimes<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.770> doesn't<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.460> today<00:01:56.640> I

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
sometimes it doesn't but for today I

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.720 
sometimes it doesn't but for today I
thought<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.180> looked<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.420> good

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
thought it looked really good

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.960 
thought it looked really good
does<00:01:58.880> take<00:01:59.120> a<00:01:59.300> couple<00:02:00.220> seconds<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:01.370> it<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.520> dry

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
does take a couple seconds for it to dry

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.970 
does take a couple seconds for it to dry
completely<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.840> again<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.320> mainly<00:02:03.530> use<00:02:03.710> a

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
completely and again you mainly use a

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.640 
completely and again you mainly use a
chapstick<00:02:04.520> because<00:02:04.940> this<00:02:05.660> will<00:02:05.930> dry<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.350> hell

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
chapstick because this will dry the hell

gorgeous shape and I think I'll flatter

darker kind of burgundy shade I feel

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.450 
darker kind of burgundy shade I feel
like<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.630> although<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.470> may<00:02:38.950> not<00:02:39.070> be<00:02:39.190> bold

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
like this although it may not be bold

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.250 
like this although it may not be bold
for<00:02:39.640> others<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.090> definitely<00:02:40.300> feel<00:02:40.600> it's<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.900> bold

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260

for others I definitely feel it's a bold
color<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:41.830> five<00:02:42.100> subtle<00:02:42.580> at<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.760> same<00:02:42.970> time

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
color but five subtle at the same time

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.090 
color but five subtle at the same time
if<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.420> makes<00:02:43.720> sense<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:44.260> I've<00:02:44.770> liked<00:02:44.980> this

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
if that makes sense but I've liked this

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.000 
if that makes sense but I've liked this

the<00:03:15.220> shade<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.430> mystic<00:03:15.940> which<00:03:16.570> is<00:03:16.690> more<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:17.020> a<00:03:17.230> I

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
the shade a mystic which is more of a I

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.930 
the shade a mystic which is more of a I
guess<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.860> magenta<00:03:18.370> shade<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.850> it's

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
guess the magenta shade and it's

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.460 
guess the magenta shade and it's
actually<00:03:19.240> probably<00:03:19.390> one<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.720> my<00:03:19.900> favorites

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
actually probably one of my favorites

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.900 
actually probably one of my favorites
and<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.160> one<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.490> get<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.790> most

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
and the one that I get the most

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.670 
and the one that I get the most
compliments<00:03:22.450> on<00:03:22.570> when<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.780> wear<00:03:23.020> it<00:03:23.050> in<00:03:23.260> videos

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
compliments on when I wear it in videos

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.830 
compliments on when I wear it in videos
and<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:24.460> find<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:24.910> although<00:03:25.330> it's<00:03:25.540> kind<00:03:25.810> of

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
and I find that although it's kind of

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.720 
and I find that although it's kind of
bright<00:03:26.140> it's<00:03:26.410> not<00:03:26.590> too<00:03:26.890> bright<00:03:27.130> as<00:03:27.280> quiet

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
bright it's not too bright as quiet

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.990 
bright it's not too bright as quiet
I<00:03:27.880> guess<00:03:28.510> somewhat<00:03:29.050> subtle<00:03:29.770> that<00:03:30.610> makes<00:03:30.790> sense

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
I guess somewhat subtle that makes sense

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.020 
I guess somewhat subtle that makes sense
I<00:03:31.120> don't<00:03:31.270> even<00:03:31.360> know<00:03:31.570> but<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:32.740> really<00:03:33.640> like<00:03:33.880> this

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.690 
I don't even know but I really like this
shade<00:03:34.270> and<00:03:34.600> again<00:03:35.530> will<00:03:35.710> complement<00:03:36.100> all<00:03:36.430> skin

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700

just like the ryoshu red it takes a few
seconds<00:04:14.710> for<00:04:14.800> it<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.010> dry<00:04:15.340> but<00:04:15.520> once<00:04:15.700> it's

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
seconds for it to dry but once it's

dark purple I will say that this

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.280 
dark purple I will say that this
lipstick<00:04:52.420> of<00:04:52.680> applies<00:04:53.680> quite<00:04:54.610> patchy<00:04:55.140> and<00:04:56.140> I

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
lipstick of applies quite patchy and I

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.350 
lipstick of applies quite patchy and I
had<00:04:56.440> to<00:04:56.590> go<00:04:56.740> over<00:04:56.770> it<00:04:57.190> quite<00:04:57.430> a<00:04:57.460> few<00:04:57.550> times<00:04:57.760> to

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
had to go over it quite a few times to

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.820 
had to go over it quite a few times to
get<00:04:58.540> it<00:04:58.600> I<00:04:58.990> guess

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
get it I guess

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.550 
get it I guess
somewhat<00:05:00.370> wearable<00:05:00.970> but<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.840> believe<00:05:02.410> the

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
somewhat wearable but I believe the

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.470 
somewhat wearable but I believe the
revlon<00:05:02.919> has<00:05:03.160> a<00:05:03.190> shade<00:05:03.669> that's<00:05:03.700> quite<00:05:04.180> similar

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
revlon has a shade that's quite similar

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.230 
revlon has a shade that's quite similar
to<00:05:04.570> this<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.140> if<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.310> know<00:05:06.460> that<00:05:06.669> shaved

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
to this so if you know that shaved

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.180 
to this so if you know that shaved
I<00:05:07.360> guess<00:05:07.870> comp<00:05:08.169> that<00:05:08.350> down<00:05:08.530> below<00:05:08.680> so<00:05:08.890> I<00:05:08.950> really

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
I guess comp that down below so I really

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.260 
I guess comp that down below so I really
want<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.400> try<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.580> I<00:05:09.790> just<00:05:09.850> don't<00:05:10.150> know<00:05:10.210> the

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
want to try it I just don't know the

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.330 
want to try it I just don't know the
name<00:05:10.419> of<00:05:10.450> it<00:05:10.750> but<00:05:10.780> this<00:05:11.380> again<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:12.040> really

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
name of it but this again a really

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.620 
name of it but this again a really
really<00:05:12.640> British<00:05:12.970> shade<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.450> that<00:05:13.540> will

really British shade and that will

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.450

compliment<00:05:13.960> all<00:05:14.260> skin<00:05:14.500> tones<00:05:17.220> so<00:05:18.220> for<00:05:18.370> this
