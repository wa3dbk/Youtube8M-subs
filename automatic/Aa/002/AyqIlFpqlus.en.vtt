and nice but when I got them done the
second<00:00:42.120> time<00:00:42.180> I've<00:00:42.510> ever<00:00:42.540> done<00:00:42.810> my<00:00:43.050> eyebrows

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
second time I've ever done my eyebrows

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.970 
second time I've ever done my eyebrows
the<00:00:44.640> lady<00:00:44.960> completely<00:00:45.960> didn't<00:00:46.260> listen<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.710> me

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
the lady completely didn't listen to me

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.569 
the lady completely didn't listen to me
and<00:00:47.220> she<00:00:47.790> just<00:00:48.170> waxed<00:00:49.170> them<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.560> it<00:00:50.010> was<00:00:50.280> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and she just waxed them and it was to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.280 
and she just waxed them and it was to
the<00:00:50.670> point<00:00:50.910> where<00:00:51.090> they<00:00:51.210> were<00:00:51.270> painfully<00:00:52.020> thin

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
the point where they were painfully thin

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.580 
the point where they were painfully thin
and<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:53.640> gave<00:00:53.790> me<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.090> complex<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.110> try<00:00:55.380> not

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and it gave me a complex but I try not

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.950 
and it gave me a complex but I try not
to<00:00:55.649> let<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> me<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:57.210> until<00:00:57.780> probably

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
to let it get to me up until probably

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.010 
to let it get to me up until probably
two<00:00:58.470> three<00:00:58.680> years<00:00:58.890> ago<00:00:59.570> they<00:01:00.570> were<00:01:00.630> a<00:01:00.750> little

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
two three years ago they were a little

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.590 
two three years ago they were a little
more<00:01:01.260> fuller<00:01:01.710> than<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.760> painfully<00:01:03.329> thinness

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
more fuller than the painfully thinness

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.139 
more fuller than the painfully thinness
but<00:01:04.320> still<00:01:04.589> way<00:01:04.949> too<00:01:04.979> thin<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.489> me<00:01:05.939> especially

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
but still way too thin for me especially

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.450 
but still way too thin for me especially
because<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.960> round<00:01:07.350> kind<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> face<00:01:08.070> so

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
because I have a round kind of face so

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.690 
because I have a round kind of face so
it<00:01:08.670> just<00:01:08.880> kind<00:01:09.120> of<00:01:09.150> looked<00:01:09.890> fast<00:01:10.890> forward<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it just kind of looked fast forward to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.399 
it just kind of looked fast forward to
this<00:01:12.000> year<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.790> wanted<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.850> grow<00:01:15.180> them<00:01:15.420> out<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:15.990> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
this year I wanted to grow them out so I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.740 
this year I wanted to grow them out so I
was<00:01:17.190> trying<00:01:17.490> everything<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.450> they<00:01:18.570> weren't

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
was trying everything like they weren't

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.719 
was trying everything like they weren't
they<00:01:19.110> still<00:01:19.320> weren't<00:01:19.440> painfully<00:01:20.280> thin<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.640> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
they still weren't painfully thin like I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.820 
they still weren't painfully thin like I
would<00:01:20.909> let<00:01:21.150> them<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.720> instead<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.560> doing

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
would let them like instead of doing

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.289 
would let them like instead of doing
them<00:01:22.950> every<00:01:23.190> two<00:01:23.369> weeks<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.880> would<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.150> them

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
them every two weeks I would do them

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.440 
them every two weeks I would do them
every<00:01:24.600> month<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.760> were<00:01:26.820> thin<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:27.420> they

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
every month so they were thin but they

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.930 
every month so they were thin but they
were<00:01:27.570> growing<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.590> looked<00:01:28.860> nice<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.820> me

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
were growing and they looked nice for me

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.550 
were growing and they looked nice for me
I<00:01:29.970> don't<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.450> how<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.690> fill<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:30.990> my<00:01:31.140> eyebrows

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
I don't know how to fill in my eyebrows

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.719 
I don't know how to fill in my eyebrows
so<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.970> can't<00:01:33.810> stay<00:01:34.110> here<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.500> tell<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.460> oh<00:01:35.490> you

so I can't stay here and tell you oh you
can<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.510> mean<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:37.439> me<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> didn't<00:01:38.220> know<00:01:38.280> how

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
can just I mean for me I didn't know how

to<00:01:38.610> sew<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.580> was<00:01:41.760> really<00:01:42.150> really

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
to sew so don't so it was really really

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.469 
to sew so don't so it was really really
hard<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:44.070> just<00:01:44.280> let<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> month

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
hard to just let it go for like a month

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.800 
hard to just let it go for like a month
without<00:01:45.840> doing<00:01:46.229> them<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:47.600> seeing<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
without doing them but seeing the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.719 
without doing them but seeing the
results<00:01:49.290> they<00:01:49.380> were<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:49.680> more<00:01:50.009> thicker<00:01:50.310> here

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
results they were like more thicker here

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.310 
results they were like more thicker here
they<00:01:50.880> still<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:51.210> thin<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.170> they<00:01:52.259> were

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
they still would thin here but they were

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
they still would thin here but they were
thick<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.670> really<00:01:54.030> liked<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
thick here and I really liked it and it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.440 
thick here and I really liked it and it
gave<00:01:54.869> me<00:01:55.080> a<00:01:55.110> shape<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.990> fast<00:01:57.990> forward<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
gave me a shape and fast forward to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.109
