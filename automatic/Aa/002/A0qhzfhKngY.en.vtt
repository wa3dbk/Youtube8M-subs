00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 I finally came back a whole month 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.049
 from the last video there is a month nothing 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.030
 new did not fill the fu shame you for sure 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.190
 I have been cheated with other bloggers 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.370
 I see in your eyes how you have watched others 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.870
 until my videos came out on the other 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.870
 I probably deserve it 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.770
 all health for the past month I flew 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.770
 to England 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.000
 need to 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120
 we 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.129
 noire all and why did you fly to england it 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.110
 pretty interesting stories I want you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.420
 now tell her start with 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.390
 started when i lived in england i have there 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.330
 was well understandably bank account on 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.399
 which salary did not come and when I 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.159
 I opened this account automatically 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.280
 set every month to me with 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.680
 my main savings account 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.330
 account sent 30 seconds yes yes I am 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.049
 I understand this information is not that very 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.240
 interesting but because of her I basically and 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.880
 flew to you now tell you everything when i 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.880
 I decided to move back to Latvia 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.770
 his stupidity did not close his bank account 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.399
 Understandably on it with time money 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.819
 run out 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.619
 but a function that sends 30 points 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.899
 glorious account and savings 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.569
 it remains to send 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.259
 nothing and therefore every month my bill 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:58.020
 amused ie central from blank 0 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.030
 bills 30 of existing pounds to 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.700
 drawn on savings and then 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.330
 wrote that the error is nothing 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.800
 forward 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.379
 and you had to pay for this mistake 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.300
 commission and smash everything was eight pound 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.769
 everything would be nothing if this is not 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.480
 lasted more than a year that is 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.209
 Imagine every month my account 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.410
 the bank ran so takes 30 pounds with 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.450
 forward shield to forward to 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.050
 savings writes error nothing 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.019
 forward 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.739
 here you are a fine of 8 euros for that so every 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:28.590
 month and in the end I had a debt in 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.840
 Bank in the English Bank for a hundred pounds 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.900
 and I'm tired of this very recently and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.110
 when I found out I thought it was like a pancake 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.569
 I don't want to have in my foreign country 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.420
 which account I do not use was a pancake 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.330
 100 pounds fucking debt and a hundred pounds 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.860
 It is a lot of it count somewhere around 150 euros 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.590
 I already wanted to pay my debt 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.840
 via the internet but when suddenly my 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.580
 English account they closed it to me very much 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.340
 I liked it because I was closed 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.709
 access to my account but account continue 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.180
 live your life and where did debt come from 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.040
 I did not know at that time that is 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.440
 the prospect of being in another country 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.920
 debt in my name grows and I ca n't 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.380
 cover me 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.349
 didn't really like it in the end i was going 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.480
 and flew to england i flew to england and 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.959
 right there you can tell from the airport went 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.480
 to the bank 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.160
 where I was stalking for more than an hour and for this 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.470
 hour I learned a lot of new 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.110
 for example, I actually learned how this 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.390
 debt I learned about this story when the bank 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.850
 I amused myself throwing 30 pounds back and forth I 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.560
 I learned that thank God the debt did not grow after 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.600
 of having blocked my account that is 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.840
 pay turned out to be much less than me 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.400
 I was expecting somewhere pounds 200 already but 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.980
 good left the same 100 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.800
 but here's a snag on england is the company 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.400
 that buys closed accounts from banks 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.260
 and guess what she bought my account 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.810
 so my bank was open 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.180
 my account no longer had to 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.819
 that is why I had to 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.540
 specifically recognize the number of this company 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.030
 and call them personally, I called them 20 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.739
 minutes talked with them on the phone 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.500
 figured out how not to pay this bill what am I 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.290
 generally do but in the end it was all over 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.200
 ok I agreed with them I paid 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.269
 This debt therefore thank God more have 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.060
 I have a long time in another country 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.340
 the company bought my bank account and 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.590
 so I can not rotate to the bank 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.630
 I can refer to this company but all 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.270
 okay, well, I end up 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.479
 I paid my debt is repaid with friends I 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.570
 got a cold 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.100
 overall had a great time here i am 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.650
 I don’t know why I’m talking about it 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.900
 telling but the situation is pretty funny 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.520
 so why not share it 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.930
 but for today everything if you liked it 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.520
