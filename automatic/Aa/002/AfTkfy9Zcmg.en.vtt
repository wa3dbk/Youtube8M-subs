when<00:00:56.320> we<00:00:56.410> come<00:00:56.590> over<00:00:56.739> to

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.950 

on<00:01:00.969> this<00:01:01.149> side<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:02.500> is<00:01:02.559> also<00:01:02.980> glass<00:01:03.879> and<00:01:04.360> its

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
on this side this is also glass and its

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.320 
on this side this is also glass and its
casted<00:01:05.560> in<00:01:06.100> sand<00:01:06.700> a<00:01:07.119> sand<00:01:07.900> because<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:10.090> which

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
casted in sand a sand because in which

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:18.749 
casted in sand a sand because in which
there<00:01:10.689> is<00:01:12.149> to<00:01:13.149> say<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:15.270> am<00:01:16.270> iron<00:01:17.080> oxide<00:01:17.590> so<00:01:18.549> the

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
there is to say I am iron oxide so the

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.440 
there is to say I am iron oxide so the
sand<00:01:19.030> and<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.420> iron<00:01:19.780> oxide<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:21.420> sticking<00:01:22.420> to

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
sand and the iron oxide is sticking to

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.859 
sand and the iron oxide is sticking to
the<00:01:22.690> glass<00:01:22.930> during<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.830> process<00:01:24.369> and<00:01:24.789> then<00:01:25.750> I

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
the glass during the process and then I

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.649 
the glass during the process and then I
polished<00:01:26.380> all<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.830> dots<00:01:27.399> so<00:01:27.759> you<00:01:28.299> get<00:01:28.570> the

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
polished all the dots so you get the

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.469 
polished all the dots so you get the
contrast<00:01:29.229> from<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:29.740> shiny<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.210> matte

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
contrast from the shiny to the matte

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.950 
contrast from the shiny to the matte
surface<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:34.830> patterns

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
surface and patterns

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.030 
surface and patterns
in<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.620> in<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.190> pan

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
in the in the pan

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.970 
in the in the pan
so<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.700> can<00:01:40.000> see<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.360> shadows<00:01:40.870> from<00:01:41.680> the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
so you can see the shadows from the

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.370 
so you can see the shadows from the
console<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.580> hazard<00:01:42.970> panels<00:01:43.480> on<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:44.170> wall

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
console of hazard panels on the wall

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.090 
console of hazard panels on the wall
behind<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.720> shadows<00:01:47.230> are<00:01:47.650> as

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
behind so that the shadows are as

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.770 
behind so that the shadows are as
important<00:01:48.940> as<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.240> wall<00:01:50.020> piece<00:01:50.290> itself

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.180 

here<00:01:55.700> I'll<00:01:56.700> go<00:01:56.880> down<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.409> classic

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
here I'll go down here we have a classic

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.750 
here I'll go down here we have a classic
piece<00:01:59.570> it's<00:02:00.570> called<00:02:00.900> beginning<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.680> see<00:02:02.580> this

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
piece it's called beginning I see this

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.370 
piece it's called beginning I see this
piece<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.020> style<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.710> universe

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
piece as the style of the universe

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.370 
piece as the style of the universe
it's<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.710> round<00:02:07.979> piece<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.240> has<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> kind<00:02:10.200> of

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
it's a round piece and it has a kind of

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.000 
it's a round piece and it has a kind of
wave<00:02:10.740> going<00:02:11.220> from<00:02:11.610> inside<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.510> outside<00:02:13.010> so

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
wave going from inside to the outside so

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.460 
wave going from inside to the outside so
I<00:02:14.040> see<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.550> universe<00:02:15.030> start<00:02:15.569> starting<00:02:16.260> there

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
I see the universe start starting there

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:27.660 
I see the universe start starting there
and<00:02:16.739> universe<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.700> still<00:02:17.970> expanding
