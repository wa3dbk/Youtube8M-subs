00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
okay so today this is a good very quick

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.019 
okay so today this is a good very quick
quick<00:00:04.650> video<00:00:05.009> about<00:00:05.250> how<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.609> set<00:00:05.879> up<00:00:05.910> the

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
quick video about how to set up the

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.270 
quick video about how to set up the
telemetry<00:00:06.470> the<00:00:07.470> first<00:00:07.680> thing<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.890> need<00:00:07.980> to<00:00:08.040> do

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
telemetry the first thing you need to do

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.540 
telemetry the first thing you need to do
is<00:00:08.519> plug<00:00:08.760> into<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.590> air<00:00:10.590> module<00:00:11.099> into<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
is plug into the air module into the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.230 
is plug into the air module into the
Arctic<00:00:12.269> autopilot<00:00:13.009> it's<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.280> one<00:00:14.490> obviously

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
Arctic autopilot it's this one obviously

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.210 
Arctic autopilot it's this one obviously
you<00:00:15.599> know<00:00:15.719> pretty<00:00:16.109> different<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.650> has<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> USB

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
you know pretty different this has a USB

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.730 
you know pretty different this has a USB
port<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.210> has<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> little<00:00:19.320> bitty

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
port and this just has a little bitty

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.679 
port and this just has a little bitty
wire<00:00:20.010> port<00:00:20.250> um<00:00:20.960> make<00:00:21.960> sure<00:00:21.990> your<00:00:23.300> wires<00:00:24.300> are

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
wire port um make sure your wires are

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.400 
wire port um make sure your wires are
black<00:00:25.590> skip<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.000> then<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:27.900> green

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
black skip one and then it's green

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.860 
black skip one and then it's green
yellow<00:00:29.010> red<00:00:29.570> make<00:00:30.570> sure<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.050> skip<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
yellow red make sure you do skip one and

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.870 
yellow red make sure you do skip one and
one<00:00:33.870> thing<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.500> need<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> know<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.309> TX

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
one thing you need to know is the TX

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.060 
one thing you need to know is the TX
from<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.420> board<00:00:36.690> has<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> rx<00:00:37.800> from

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
from this board has to go to rx from

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.069 
from this board has to go to rx from
that<00:00:38.250> word<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.670> vice<00:00:39.270> versa<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.870> other

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that word and vice versa for the other

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.860 
that word and vice versa for the other
way<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.700> shows<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> same<00:00:42.300> thing<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
way so it shows the same thing for the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
way so it shows the same thing for the
GPS<00:00:43.320> um<00:00:43.649> TX<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> RX<00:00:44.969> &amp;<00:00:45.210> RX<00:00:46.079> from<00:00:46.320> GPS<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
GPS um TX is the RX &amp; RX from GPS to the

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.119 
GPS um TX is the RX &amp; RX from GPS to the
TX<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> autopilot<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:49.170> also<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
TX to the autopilot you also have to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.310 
TX to the autopilot you also have to
change<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:50.730> kind<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.719> doesn't<00:00:52.199> make

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
change it because kind of doesn't make

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.950 
change it because kind of doesn't make
sense<00:00:52.590> though

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
sense though

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.119 
sense though
now<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.199> anything<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.680> need<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:55.980> if

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
now what anything you do need to know if

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.049 
now what anything you do need to know if
you're<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> download<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> firmware

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
you're going to download the firmware

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.510 
you're going to download the firmware
you<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.559> USB<00:00:58.800> port<00:00:59.190> which<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you have to use the USB port which is a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.450 
you have to use the USB port which is a
micro<00:00:59.940> USB<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:02.160> hard<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
micro USB and it's not really hard to

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.119 
micro USB and it's not really hard to
use<00:01:02.609> but<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.960> have<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.320> down<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:04.890> you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
use but I think you have to down if you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.740 
use but I think you have to down if you
have<00:01:05.640> Windows<00:01:06.180> 7<00:01:06.689> or<00:01:06.869> less<00:01:07.140> or<00:01:07.530> dumbing<00:01:08.400> down

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
have Windows 7 or less or dumbing down

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.820 
have Windows 7 or less or dumbing down
you<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.900> since<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.369> get<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
you have since you know get the and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.080 
you have since you know get the and
install<00:01:13.830> firmware<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:14.369> something<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
install firmware or something for the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.120 
install firmware or something for the
board<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.259> Windows<00:01:16.650> 8<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
board but if you have Windows 8 and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.399 
board but if you have Windows 8 and
above<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.210> don't<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.840> plug<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.229> in

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
above you just don't you just plug it in

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.469 
above you just don't you just plug it in
and<00:01:19.680> stock<00:01:19.860> where<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.210> are<00:01:21.270> going<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and stock where you if you are going to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.469 
and stock where you if you are going to
GPS<00:01:21.960> um<00:01:22.290> it's<00:01:23.189> pretty<00:01:23.460> much<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.880> same<00:01:23.909> way<00:01:24.299> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
GPS um it's pretty much the same way of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.789 
GPS um it's pretty much the same way of
wires<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.380> side<00:01:25.680> same<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.460> side

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
wires on that side same on this side

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.670 
wires on that side same on this side
make<00:01:28.799> sure<00:01:28.979> when<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.369> plug<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.820> in<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.869> you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
make sure when you plug this in that you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.800 
make sure when you plug this in that you
have<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.860> antenna<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:33.060> map<00:01:33.360> centered<00:01:33.720> on

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
have the antenna on you map centered on

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.190 
have the antenna on you map centered on
this<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.200> too<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.729> same<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:36.329> fpv<00:01:36.900> if

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
this one too because same like fpv if

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.719 
this one too because same like fpv if
you<00:01:37.409> don't<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> antenna<00:01:38.070> on<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.430> turn

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you don't have the antenna on you turn

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.940 
you don't have the antenna on you turn
on<00:01:38.970> your<00:01:40.100> TX<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:42.119> will<00:01:42.299> burn<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.590> all

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
on your TX it will burn it because all

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.069 
on your TX it will burn it because all
that's<00:01:44.130> wattage<00:01:45.119> needs<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.570> go<00:01:45.689> somewhere

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
that's wattage needs to go somewhere

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.170 
that's wattage needs to go somewhere
because<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.740> 100<00:01:47.310> milliwatts<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.970> I've

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
because this is 100 milliwatts and I've

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.770 
because this is 100 milliwatts and I've
heard<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:49.290> can<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> mile<00:01:50.750> order<00:01:51.750> I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
heard this can go up to a mile order I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.420 
heard this can go up to a mile order I
think<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.140> was<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.470> kilometer<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.159> don't<00:01:53.340> know

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
think it was one kilometer I don't know

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.819 
think it was one kilometer I don't know
but<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.149> it's<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> lot<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.619> don't<00:01:55.740> have

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
but I know it's a lot so you don't have

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.209 
but I know it's a lot so you don't have
to<00:01:55.920> worry<00:01:56.040> about<00:01:56.100> range<00:01:57.500> and<00:01:58.500> it's<00:01:59.009> just

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
to worry about range and it's just
