00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.560
 I noticed that the conservatories are the schools 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:36.960
 of music they have more and more systems 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:40.590
 complicated with different levels and here yes 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.720
 he risks everything we talk about music from 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.090
 morning to evening 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.760
 I think it is very important to have a 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.290
 environment a space so open this 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.760
 obligation 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.750
 the museums where there are original instruments 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.860
 are increasingly more 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.170
 last longer 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.770
 closed you can no longer play 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.700
 tools because you have to understand that for 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.210
 future generations must keep 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.760
 however it is very important for a young person 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.979
 who cares about having ancient music 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.620
 at least once in his life 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.990
 the opportunity to play an instrument 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.260
 original because they are the ones there 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.870
 they show the right path 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.670
 and then of course also important 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.670
 see the couples why 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.360
 each the instrument that can 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.290
 possibly buy buy will be a 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.110
 copy a facsimile naturally 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.979
 and here is the possibility for every age 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:55.689
 of the repertoire to find almost it 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.870
 right tool and that is a luxury that 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.880
 you can afford very few 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.619
 the students therefore 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.380
 sincerely it is a plus apart from the masters 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.170
 above all it is a very argument 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.209
 positive for the young people who come 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.680
 it is necessary to know that in the orchestra 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:25.230
 the most numerous instruments are the violins and 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:29.010
 therefore it is necessary to open the mind more 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:33.500
 of violinists who sometimes having a 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:38.450
 very already very clean repertoire e 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:42.269
 bigger and more job opportunities 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.390
 down spaces of those of the cep list a 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.930
 bass player of course is a little more 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:54.209
 difficult to have enough leolini in 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.340
 course so you will need to open more to 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.880
 this tool according to me and then 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.590
 choose what type of orchestra you are 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.989
 wants to make both an orchestra the baroque 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.040
 classic romantic because here you can 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.610
 do many things 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:16.010
 but I think at least for the beginning 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:20.680
 you need to choose a repertoire a little 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:24.760
 tighter to work more 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.760
 intensely above 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:39.110
