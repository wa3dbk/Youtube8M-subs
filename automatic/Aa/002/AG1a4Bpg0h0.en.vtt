00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
today I'm going to show you how to tune

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.940 
today I'm going to show you how to tune
a<00:00:05.910> ski<00:00:06.150> with<00:00:06.359> your<00:00:06.540> rapid<00:00:06.810> edge<00:00:06.930> tuner<00:00:07.350> but

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
a ski with your rapid edge tuner but

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.950 
a ski with your rapid edge tuner but
before<00:00:08.280> we<00:00:08.400> actually<00:00:08.550> do<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:08.940> tuning<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.599> want

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
before we actually do the tuning I want

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.360 
before we actually do the tuning I want
to<00:00:10.050> talk<00:00:10.200> about<00:00:10.349> appropriate<00:00:10.679> breathing

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
to talk about appropriate breathing

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.680 
to talk about appropriate breathing
protection<00:00:12.290> the<00:00:13.290> tuner<00:00:13.590> best<00:00:13.830> produced<00:00:14.160> dust

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
protection the tuner best produced dust

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.150 
protection the tuner best produced dust
very<00:00:15.690> fine<00:00:16.020> dust<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.560> need<00:00:16.710> something<00:00:17.070> to

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
very fine dust so you need something to

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.429 
very fine dust so you need something to
keep<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.490> out<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.730> your<00:00:17.789> lungs<00:00:18.020> this<00:00:19.020> sort<00:00:19.380> of

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
keep that out of your lungs this sort of

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.130 
keep that out of your lungs this sort of
a<00:00:19.529> mass<00:00:19.740> with<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> rubbery<00:00:20.880> area<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.840> fits

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
a mass with a rubbery area that fits

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.660 
a mass with a rubbery area that fits
well<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.560> your<00:00:22.800> face<00:00:23.359> and<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.539> has<00:00:25.670> replaceable

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
well on your face and it has replaceable

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.359 
well on your face and it has replaceable
filters<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> has<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> little<00:00:28.769> valve<00:00:29.010> in

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
filters and it has a little valve in

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.939 
filters and it has a little valve in
here<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:29.939> when<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.330> breathe<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.619> comes

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
here so when you breathe out it comes

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.950 
here so when you breathe out it comes
out<00:00:32.099> through<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.550> separate<00:00:33.420> separate

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
out through the separate separate

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.799 
out through the separate separate
opening<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.120> that<00:00:36.120> mask<00:00:36.390> doesn't<00:00:36.630> get

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
opening here so that mask doesn't get

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.540 
opening here so that mask doesn't get
pushed<00:00:37.050> off<00:00:37.200> your<00:00:37.380> face<00:00:37.559> these<00:00:38.129> come<00:00:38.399> in

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
pushed off your face these come in

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.060 
pushed off your face these come in
different<00:00:38.579> sizes<00:00:39.090> go<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.140> local<00:00:40.290> paint

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
different sizes go to your local paint

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.850 
different sizes go to your local paint
or<00:00:41.309> hardware<00:00:41.700> store<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.420> they've<00:00:42.570> got

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
or hardware store see what they've got

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.650 
or hardware store see what they've got
and<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.010> something<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:45.000> fits<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.450> up

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
and get something that that fits you up

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.119 
and get something that that fits you up
but<00:00:46.379> because<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:46.829> doing<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.399> demo<00:00:48.680> video<00:00:49.680> here

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
but because I'm doing a demo video here

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.069 
but because I'm doing a demo video here
you<00:00:50.760> need<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.940> hear<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.360> I'm<00:00:51.449> saying<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you need to hear what I'm saying and you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.389 
you need to hear what I'm saying and you
can't<00:00:52.320> hear<00:00:52.440> through<00:00:52.680> those<00:00:52.770> masks<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.309> I'm

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
can't hear through those masks so I'm

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.520 
can't hear through those masks so I'm
going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> use<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.059> rudimentary<00:00:54.840> dust<00:00:55.110> mask<00:00:55.379> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
going to use a rudimentary dust mask it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.610 
going to use a rudimentary dust mask it
does<00:00:55.680> give<00:00:55.829> some<00:00:56.039> protection<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:58.260> also

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
does give some protection and also

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.270 
does give some protection and also
before<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.039> actually<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> tune<00:01:01.100> we'll<00:01:02.100> talk

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
before I actually do the tune we'll talk

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.229 
before I actually do the tune we'll talk
about<00:01:02.399> what<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.090> prepare

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
about what you have to do to prepare

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
about what you have to do to prepare
who's<00:01:03.570> he<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.860> make<00:01:04.979> sure<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
who's he you want to make sure that the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.920 
who's he you want to make sure that the
base<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.580> flat<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.240> free<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.540> any<00:01:06.600> little

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
base is flat and free of any little

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.880 
base is flat and free of any little
Nick's<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.350> things<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.650> you're<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
take a sharp scraper pass along the ski

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.980 
take a sharp scraper pass along the ski
make<00:01:11.760> sure<00:01:11.939> there's<00:01:12.150> no<00:01:12.270> there<00:01:12.570> no<00:01:12.689> next

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
make sure there's no there no next

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.590 
make sure there's no there no next
that's<00:01:13.350> good<00:01:13.740> there<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:15.030> also<00:01:15.060> want<00:01:15.540> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that's good there and you also want to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.530 
that's good there and you also want to
have<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:16.250> sidewall<00:01:17.250> cut<00:01:18.000> back<00:01:18.210> very

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
have your sidewall cut back very

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.960 
have your sidewall cut back very
slightly<00:01:18.930> from<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> edge<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> tuners<00:01:20.790> not

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
slightly from the edge so the tuners not

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
slightly from the edge so the tuners not
having<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> try<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.540> remove<00:01:21.810> plastic<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:22.860> well

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
having to try to remove plastic as well

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.179 
having to try to remove plastic as well
as<00:01:23.130> steel<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.990> tutor<00:01:25.200> will<00:01:25.470> cut<00:01:25.770> through<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
as steel the tutor will cut through that

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.859 
as steel the tutor will cut through that
but<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.729> makes<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.150> much<00:01:27.299> slower<00:01:27.540> task

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
but it just makes it a much slower task

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.080 
but it just makes it a much slower task
make<00:01:28.680> sure<00:01:28.890> when<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.189> do<00:01:29.369> cut<00:01:29.729> back<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
make sure when you do cut back the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.120 
make sure when you do cut back the
sidewall<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.630> don't<00:01:30.810> cut<00:01:30.990> back<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.409> cut<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
sidewall you don't cut back it cut it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.640 
sidewall you don't cut back it cut it
back<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.579> far<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.850> you're<00:01:33.150> undercutting<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
back so far that you're undercutting the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.499 
back so far that you're undercutting the
edge<00:01:34.799> that's<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.549> sidewall<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.030> important

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
edge that's the sidewall is important

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.030 
edge that's the sidewall is important
for<00:01:36.630> transmitting<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> loads<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> edge

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
for transmitting the loads from the edge

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.569 
for transmitting the loads from the edge
through<00:01:38.490> into<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> cordless<00:01:39.390> key

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
through into the cordless key

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.490 
through into the cordless key
okay<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:41.970> let<00:01:42.509> me<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.750> my<00:01:42.840> dust<00:01:43.079> mask<00:01:43.290> on

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
okay so now let me get my dust mask on

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.550 
okay so now let me get my dust mask on
here<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.579> tutor

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.469 

here<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.860> tuner<00:01:54.220> you<00:01:54.460> want<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.090> make<00:01:55.210> sure

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
here is the tuner you want to make sure

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.389 
here is the tuner you want to make sure
that<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:55.840> edge<00:01:56.049> and<00:01:56.350> angle<00:01:56.619> is<00:01:56.740> properly<00:01:57.100> set

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
that the edge and angle is properly set

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:58.980 
that the edge and angle is properly set
these<00:01:57.759> are<00:01:57.909> race<00:01:58.090> keys<00:01:58.390> so<00:01:58.630> we've<00:01:58.750> got<00:01:58.899> the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
these are race keys so we've got the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.179 
these are race keys so we've got the

tuning<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.720> would<00:02:22.870> recommend<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.560> do<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:23.860> on<00:02:24.010> an

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
tuning I would recommend you do it on an

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.940 
tuning I would recommend you do it on an
old<00:02:24.400> ski<00:02:24.840> don't<00:02:25.840> do<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.140> on<00:02:26.230> your<00:02:26.319> best<00:02:26.530> ski

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
old ski don't do it on your best ski

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.320 
old ski don't do it on your best ski
because<00:02:27.160> you're<00:02:27.400> going<00:02:27.580> to<00:02:27.670> want<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.120> learn

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
because you're going to want to learn

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.650 
because you're going to want to learn
how<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.540> use<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:28.989> tool<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:31.239> I<00:02:31.330> also

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
how to use this tool and I also

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.080 
how to use this tool and I also
recommend<00:02:31.959> doing<00:02:32.560> dry<00:02:32.920> runs<00:02:33.370> before<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:34.000> have

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
recommend doing dry runs before you have

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.330 
recommend doing dry runs before you have
to<00:02:34.239> start<00:02:34.450> running<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.780> with<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.019> motor<00:02:35.340> no

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
to start running it with the motor no

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.820 
to start running it with the motor no
I'm<00:02:36.640> gonna<00:02:36.730> sharp<00:02:37.030> at<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.299> edge<00:02:37.480> here<00:02:37.830> and

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
I'm gonna sharp at this edge here and

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.259 
I'm gonna sharp at this edge here and
we're<00:02:38.950> gonna<00:02:39.010> start<00:02:39.370> up<00:02:39.489> at<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.640> tip<00:02:39.819> and<00:02:40.030> head

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
we're gonna start up at the tip and head

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.830 
we're gonna start up at the tip and head
for<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.510> tail<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:42.459> when<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:42.730> start<00:02:43.030> up<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.750> the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
for the tail so when you start up to the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.839 
for the tail so when you start up to the
point<00:02:44.110> where<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.319> want<00:02:44.470> you've<00:02:44.860> got<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.250> the

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
point where you want you've got the the

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.789 
point where you want you've got the the
most<00:02:46.030> likelihood<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:47.019> not<00:02:47.380> getting<00:02:47.709> the

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
most likelihood of of not getting the

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.170 
most likelihood of of not getting the
edge<00:02:47.890> perfect<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:48.489> we<00:02:48.580> want<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.819> make<00:02:48.940> sure

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
edge perfect so we want to make sure

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.630 
edge perfect so we want to make sure
that<00:02:49.390> when<00:02:49.569> we<00:02:49.690> contact<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.260> ski<00:02:50.470> first<00:02:50.739> we<00:02:51.489> do

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
that when we contact the ski first we do

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.250 
that when we contact the ski first we do
it<00:02:51.730> with<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:51.940> back<00:02:52.090> edge<00:02:52.360> here<00:02:52.630> another<00:02:52.989> part

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
it with the back edge here another part

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.949 
it with the back edge here another part
of<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.410> ski<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.680> don't<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:55.030> don't<00:02:55.180> actually

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
of the ski you don't you don't actually

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:56.610 
of the ski you don't you don't actually
ski<00:02:56.230> on

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
ski on

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.410 
ski on
so<00:02:57.040> you'll<00:02:57.190> touch<00:02:57.370> back<00:02:57.670> there<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.120> then<00:02:58.209> roll

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
so you'll touch back there and then roll

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.840 
so you'll touch back there and then roll
it<00:02:58.600> squarely<00:02:58.989> on<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> edge<00:02:59.620> and<00:03:00.519> start

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
it squarely on to the edge and start

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.150 
it squarely on to the edge and start
moving<00:03:01.209> down<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.540> ski<00:03:01.900> now<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.769> don't<00:03:02.950> want

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
moving down the ski now you don't want

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.310 
moving down the ski now you don't want
the<00:03:03.310> tool<00:03:03.519> tipping<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:04.450> need<00:03:04.600> some<00:03:04.959> gentle

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
the tool tipping so you need some gentle

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.020 
the tool tipping so you need some gentle
pressure<00:03:05.500> down<00:03:05.829> here<00:03:05.859> to<00:03:06.280> keep<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.549> balanced

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
pressure down here to keep it balanced

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.120 
pressure down here to keep it balanced
this<00:03:07.840> hand<00:03:08.140> over<00:03:08.410> here<00:03:08.590> provides<00:03:08.980> the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
this hand over here provides the

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.220 
this hand over here provides the
pressure<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:10.239> gives<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.600> the<00:03:10.690> cutting<00:03:10.959> it

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
pressure that gives you the cutting it

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.960 
pressure that gives you the cutting it
also<00:03:11.440> keeps<00:03:11.799> things<00:03:12.100> square<00:03:12.579> on<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.850> edge

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
also keeps things square on the edge

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.330 
also keeps things square on the edge
because<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.780> don't<00:03:14.019> want<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.500> plow<00:03:14.890> like

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
because you don't want it to plow like

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.059 
because you don't want it to plow like
going<00:03:15.609> at<00:03:15.700> an<00:03:15.790> angle<00:03:16.060> like<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.590> or<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.799> trail

neither<00:03:20.500> one<00:03:20.769> of<00:03:20.799> those<00:03:21.010> will<00:03:21.250> give<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.489> the

go<00:03:34.510> down<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.810> ski<00:03:35.079> right<00:03:35.950> through<00:03:36.220> are<00:03:36.340> those

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
go down the ski right through are those

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.610 
go down the ski right through are those
two<00:03:36.730> back<00:03:37.920> now<00:03:38.920> some<00:03:39.280> tuners<00:03:39.870> have<00:03:40.870> found<00:03:41.139> that

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
two back now some tuners have found that

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.080 
two back now some tuners have found that
they<00:03:41.739> like<00:03:41.889> to<00:03:42.040> do<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.250> on<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.489> opposite<00:03:42.880> side

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
they like to do it on the opposite side

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.460 
they like to do it on the opposite side
of<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.269> ski<00:03:43.510> they're<00:03:43.750> more<00:03:43.900> comfortable<00:03:44.139> that

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
of the ski they're more comfortable that

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.080 
of the ski they're more comfortable that
and<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:44.889> important<00:03:45.280> thing<00:03:45.430> here<00:03:45.459> is<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:45.790> find

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
and the important thing here is you find

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.180 
and the important thing here is you find
a<00:03:46.180> technique<00:03:46.540> that<00:03:47.290> you're<00:03:47.470> comfortable<00:03:47.829> with

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
a technique that you're comfortable with

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.670 
a technique that you're comfortable with
so<00:03:49.060> again<00:03:49.329> you<00:03:49.510> start<00:03:49.870> with<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.290> back<00:03:50.440> edge

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
so again you start with the back edge

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.819 
so again you start with the back edge
first<00:03:51.389> roll<00:03:52.389> it<00:03:52.569> on<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:53.380> then<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:53.530> move

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
first roll it on and then you move

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.170 
first roll it on and then you move
through<00:03:54.160> pressure<00:03:54.730> again<00:03:55.150> coming<00:03:55.389> down

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
through pressure again coming down

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.220 
through pressure again coming down
be<00:03:56.570> careful<00:03:56.960> not<00:03:57.050> to<00:03:57.110> jiggle<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:58.960> you<00:03:59.960> can<00:04:00.140> be

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
be careful not to jiggle it you can be

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:01.860 
be careful not to jiggle it you can be
right<00:04:00.590> through<00:04:00.740> this<00:04:00.920> way

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
right through this way

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.000 
right through this way
now<00:04:02.870> there's<00:04:03.050> number<00:04:03.260> tuners<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:03.800> if<00:04:03.860> they're

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
now there's number tuners so if they're

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.250 
now there's number tuners so if they're
using<00:04:04.190> this<00:04:04.400> this<00:04:05.300> tool<00:04:05.570> that's<00:04:05.870> fine<00:04:06.080> they

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
using this this tool that's fine they

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.190 
using this this tool that's fine they
like<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.560> push<00:04:06.830> with<00:04:07.070> it<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:08.390> again<00:04:08.480> you're

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
like to push with it so again you're

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.700 
like to push with it so again you're
going<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:09.380> contact<00:04:10.010> this<00:04:10.400> side<00:04:10.670> first<00:04:11.590> we<00:04:12.590> roll

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
going to contact this side first we roll

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:20.320 
going to contact this side first we roll
on<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.700> then<00:04:13.820> you<00:04:13.940> push<00:04:14.150> through<00:04:19.330> and

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
on and then you push through and

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.360 
on and then you push through and
something<00:04:20.780> like<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.140> go<00:04:21.290> left<00:04:21.560> to<00:04:21.770> right<00:04:21.950> so

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
something like the go left to right so

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.090 
something like the go left to right so
you<00:04:22.460> find<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.300> way<00:04:23.450> that<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:23.900> like<00:04:24.140> yourself<00:04:24.890> if

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
you find a way that you like yourself if

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.100 
you find a way that you like yourself if
you're<00:04:25.280> comfortable<00:04:25.490> with<00:04:25.850> now<00:04:26.600> to<00:04:26.720> turn<00:04:26.900> the

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
you're comfortable with now to turn the

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.160 
you're comfortable with now to turn the
tool<00:04:27.320> on<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:28.550> a<00:04:28.640> slide<00:04:28.970> switch<00:04:29.180> so<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:29.870> slides

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
tool on it's a slide switch so it slides

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.440 
tool on it's a slide switch so it slides
down<00:04:30.320> this<00:04:30.680> way<00:04:30.920> in<00:04:31.550> this<00:04:31.670> direction<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:32.270> turn

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
down this way in this direction to turn

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:51.420 
down this way in this direction to turn
it<00:04:32.600> on

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:03.380 

one<00:04:52.120> more<00:04:52.330> press

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:35.720 

right<00:05:04.390> so<00:05:04.780> here

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.370 

it's<00:05:36.730> important<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.360> you<00:05:37.660> use<00:05:37.690> a<00:05:37.900> smooth

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
it's important that you use a smooth

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.630 
it's important that you use a smooth
pass<00:05:39.300> so<00:05:40.300> if<00:05:40.360> you<00:05:40.480> starts<00:05:40.780> if<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.200> stop

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
pass so if you starts if you stop

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.920 
pass so if you starts if you stop
because<00:05:42.640> like<00:05:43.000> unsteadily<00:05:43.420> and<00:05:43.690> you're<00:05:43.810> going

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
because like unsteadily and you're going

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.990 
because like unsteadily and you're going
slow<00:05:44.230> and<00:05:44.440> then<00:05:44.530> fast<00:05:44.560> for<00:05:45.100> stopping<00:05:45.550> you're

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
slow and then fast for stopping you're

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.630 
slow and then fast for stopping you're
going<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.240> overheat<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.630> edge<00:05:46.870> and<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:48.490> can

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
going to overheat the edge and you can

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.280 
going to overheat the edge and you can
tell<00:05:48.850> when<00:05:49.240> you<00:05:49.360> have<00:05:49.390> done<00:05:49.720> your<00:05:49.840> pass<00:05:50.050> you

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
tell when you have done your pass you

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.200 
tell when you have done your pass you
can<00:05:50.440> run<00:05:50.560> your<00:05:50.650> hand<00:05:50.920> along<00:05:51.070> feel<00:05:51.640> the<00:05:51.850> edge<00:05:51.940> to

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
can run your hand along feel the edge to

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.510 
can run your hand along feel the edge to
see<00:05:52.360> if<00:05:52.450> there's<00:05:52.630> any<00:05:52.780> hot<00:05:52.930> spots<00:05:53.230> and<00:05:53.770> then

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
see if there's any hot spots and then

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.070 
see if there's any hot spots and then
risk<00:05:54.760> of<00:05:54.940> overheating<00:05:55.180> the<00:05:55.450> edge<00:05:55.570> is<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.870> same

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
risk of overheating the edge is the same

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.720 
risk of overheating the edge is the same
as<00:05:56.260> getting<00:05:56.530> their<00:05:56.740> speed<00:05:57.100> too<00:05:57.280> hot<00:05:57.520> when

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
as getting their speed too hot when

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.380 
as getting their speed too hot when
you're<00:05:57.820> hot<00:05:58.000> waxing<00:05:58.480> you<00:05:58.600> can<00:05:58.750> damage<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.080> ski

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
you're hot waxing you can damage the ski

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:06.870 
you're hot waxing you can damage the ski
so<00:06:01.390> this<00:06:01.570> ski<00:06:01.840> now<00:06:02.080> is<00:06:02.970> all<00:06:03.970> ready<00:06:05.040> to<00:06:06.040> go<00:06:06.220> the

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
so this ski now is all ready to go the

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.250 
so this ski now is all ready to go the
edge<00:06:07.000> there's<00:06:07.420> a<00:06:07.480> little<00:06:07.750> barrier<00:06:08.020> you<00:06:08.110> can

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
edge there's a little barrier you can

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.750 
edge there's a little barrier you can
feel<00:06:08.470> it<00:06:08.590> by<00:06:08.710> running<00:06:08.920> your<00:06:09.070> hand<00:06:09.250> downwards

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
over the edge you can feel the bird so

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.090 
over the edge you can feel the bird so
you<00:06:11.650> know<00:06:11.770> that's<00:06:11.950> all<00:06:12.700> nicely<00:06:13.090> sharpened
