my<00:00:22.570> first<00:00:22.930> instinct<00:00:23.470> is<00:00:23.560> always<00:00:23.800> to<00:00:24.390> set<00:00:25.390> up

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
my first instinct is always to set up

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.750 
my first instinct is always to set up
the<00:00:25.570> telescope<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:26.170> go<00:00:26.350> you<00:00:26.410> look<00:00:26.680> first<00:00:26.950> so

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
the telescope and go you look first so

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.250 
the telescope and go you look first so
when<00:00:27.970> Google<00:00:28.060> Plus<00:00:28.390> came<00:00:28.600> out<00:00:28.779> I<00:00:28.990> thought

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
when Google Plus came out I thought

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.510 
when Google Plus came out I thought
wouldn't<00:00:29.439> it<00:00:29.529> be<00:00:29.590> cool<00:00:29.680> if<00:00:30.070> we<00:00:30.100> could<00:00:30.220> get<00:00:30.490> a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
wouldn't it be cool if we could get a

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.720 
wouldn't it be cool if we could get a
telescope<00:00:31.500> streaming<00:00:32.500> an<00:00:32.619> image<00:00:32.950> right<00:00:33.430> into

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
telescope streaming an image right into
