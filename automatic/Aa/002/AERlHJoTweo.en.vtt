on so I guess we'll start off normal and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.910 
on so I guess we'll start off normal and
then<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.520> guess<00:00:41.700> I'll<00:00:41.850> go<00:00:41.940> super<00:00:42.210> saiyan<00:00:42.360> maybe

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
don't I don't want to say citta because

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
don't I don't want to say citta because
that's<00:00:51.570> what<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:51.750> always<00:00:51.899> play<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.350> uh<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that's what they always play but uh it

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.040 
that's what they always play but uh it
kind<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.570> best<00:00:54.719> mass<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.989> the
