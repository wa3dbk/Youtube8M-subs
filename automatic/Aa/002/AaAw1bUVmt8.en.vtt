00:00:00.387 --> 00:00:09.514
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection Department announced on its website on August 3 that Vice President of Jilin University, Wang Guanjun, is investigated for alleged serious violations of discipline and law.

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:17.083
Wang Guanjun has been the president of Norman Bethune Health Science Center of Jilin University since December 2004.

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:24.885
But, as early as 2006, an underground organ transplant center in the hospital was exposed participating in multiple kidney transplants from unknown sources.

00:00:26.354 --> 00:00:31.035
Wang Guanjun is a member of the Party Standing Committee of Jilin University.

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:36.421
As a medical doctor, he is in charge of medical education, medical services and public health management.

00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:49.714
The investigation by Minghui.org found the First Hospital of Jilin University has engaged in the forced, live organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners with both Wang Guanjun and Fu Yaowen, current director of the Urology Center, heavily involved in the crime.

00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:59.109
Huge profits from transplantation enabled the First Hospital to set up a transplant center in early 2006.

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:03.463
Fu Yaowen and many other medical staff were introduced into the center.

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:11.866
The hospital claimed that Fu Yaowen has completed more than 2,600 cases of kidney transplant, and more than 20 cases of autologous renal transplantation.

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:20.764
Minghui.org reported on Aug. 18, 2006 that Fu Yaowen's wife, Sun Suping, is president of the Court of Technology and Economic Development Zone in Changchun City, Jilin Province.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:27.364
Her deep relationship with the judiciary allows her control of many organ sources.

00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:34.074
Fu Yaowen also monopolizes the organ transplant market in Jilin Province due to his wife.

00:01:34.174 --> 00:01:40.862
In the 2,600 surgeries he has conducted, the origins of the majority of the organs are unknown.

00:01:41.544 --> 00:01:52.774
China's official media reported that since the voluntary organ donation pilot work started in March 2010, only 1,000 citizens signed up for donation.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:06.330
Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas revealed in a seminar in San Francisco on July 29 that an attending physician was arrested by the regime a week ago on charges of "abuse
of organ transplantation."

00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:10.820
This doctor has been in organ transplantation for many years and published many papers.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.091
He had admitted he took part in transplant surgery using organs of Falun Gong practitioners.

00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:22.294
Peng Zhenhe, a resident in Jilin City, Jilin Province, indicates that the CCP appears to recognize "live organ harvesting".

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:26.502
Peng Zhenhe: "It looks like it. It refused to admit it, but it looks like it does exist.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.350
This is the Chinese Communist Party. 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.719
They would not admit it at first, but, later they admit it little by little.

00:02:31.898 --> 00:02:37.861
That's a good thing, because it means Jiang Zemin is soon finished."

00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:48.450
On November 13, 2006, Sound of Hope Radio International reporter found that the kidney transplant center was located in the dark basement of the First Hospital of Jilin University.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:03:00.478
When the reporter asked Wang Gang, director of kidney transplants, why an important department such as the organ transplant center was located in a place not seeing the sunlight, Wang Gang replied: "It has nothing to do with you, there is no need to tell you."

00:03:00.578 --> 00:03:05.915
A hospital nurse also told the reporter the source of kidneys are enough to sustain more than 20 surgery cases each month.

00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:10.109
The organs were fresh from the donors between a few hours to less than 20 hours.

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:13.820
Peng Zhenhe condemns the acts of moral turpitude of the CCP.

00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:17.496
Peng Zhenhe: "This is a serious violation of human rights. It is too cruel.

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:22.433
Not to mention about the human rights in China, the ruling party has no morality.

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:25.294
The repression of dissidents is too cruel.

00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:31.509
I really hope China will quickly turn to democracy, the rule of law, social freedom and human rights."

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:45.448
In the interview, Sound of Hope also found that after a number of witnesses exposed the CCP's live organ harvesting of Falun Gong practitioners in March 2006, major transplant centers increased transplant operations and worked overtime in April.

00:03:45.776 --> 00:04:00.099
Coincidentally, the Organ Transplant Center at Jilin University First Hospital was officially established in April by Fuyao Wen along with head nurse and doctors from his original transplant department.

00:04:00.503 --> 00:04:05.370
Shandong human rights lawyer Li Xiangyang: "Live organ harvesting is an evil act against humanity.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.136
Any life deserves to be respected.

00:04:11.236 --> 00:04:17.722
But, they ignore the rights of the living, ignore the morality of all mankind.

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:23.696
This organ harvesting from living people is an afront to both God and man."

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:35.653
March 31, 2006, a veteran military doctor of Shenyang Military Region wrote to the Epoch Times and revealed the presence of 36 concentration camps to detain Falun Gong practitioners.

00:04:35.753 --> 00:04:39.857
Jilin concentration camp was said to hold the most victims.

00:04:39.957 --> 00:04:46.356
While Changchun City of Jilin Province has the most Falun Gong practitioners and is the most severely persecuted area.

00:04:46.456 --> 00:04:47.356
