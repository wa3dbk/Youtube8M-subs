00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
confident on it it's quite hard to know

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.919 
confident on it it's quite hard to know
when<00:02:08.830> it's<00:02:08.979> right<00:02:09.310> but<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:10.149> sort<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.720> get<00:02:10.869> that

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
when it's right but you sort of get that

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.589 
when it's right but you sort of get that
feeling<00:02:11.319> you<00:02:12.010> just<00:02:12.280> know<00:02:12.459> you<00:02:12.519> know<00:02:12.849> nine

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
feeling you just know you know nine

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.970 
feeling you just know you know nine
times<00:02:13.630> out<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.080> ten<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.349> don't<00:02:14.560> really<00:02:14.890> have

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
times out of ten you don't really have

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.770 
times out of ten you don't really have
the<00:02:15.160> way<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.519> long<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:16.030> it's<00:02:16.330> normally

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
the way that long is it's normally

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.040 
the way that long is it's normally
instant<00:02:17.349> and<00:02:17.620> then<00:02:17.769> you<00:02:17.890> look<00:02:18.099> one<00:02:19.050> and

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
instant and then you look one and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.890 
instant and then you look one and
hopefully<00:02:20.319> get<00:02:20.769> it<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.160> net<00:02:24.540> just<00:02:25.540> get<00:02:25.750> it

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
hopefully get it in the net just get it

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.490 
hopefully get it in the net just get it
down<00:02:25.989> there<00:02:26.470> just<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.890> front<00:02:27.069> of<00:02:27.190> me
