00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
leave the field now this is my theory

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.300 
leave the field now this is my theory
because<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> lot<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.350> y'all<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:40.770> crazy

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
because a lot of y'all are crazy

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.160 
because a lot of y'all are crazy
but<00:01:41.670> oh<00:01:41.850> my<00:01:42.000> god<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.630> two<00:01:42.689> still<00:01:42.990> off<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
but oh my god you see two still off the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.899 
but oh my god you see two still off the
beat<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.890> off<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> field<00:01:44.310> yes<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.729> is

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
beat it's not off the field yes it is

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.319 
beat it's not off the field yes it is
exceeds<00:01:45.630> material<00:01:46.610> it's<00:01:47.610> like<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> condition

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
exceeds material it's like the condition

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.410 
exceeds material it's like the condition
it's<00:01:48.750> gone<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.640> exceed<00:01:50.970> something

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it's gone so if you exceed something

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.179 
it's gone so if you exceed something
your<00:01:51.840> monster<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.259> technically<00:01:52.799> not<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
your monster is technically not on the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.859 
your monster is technically not on the
field<00:01:53.369> because<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.939> material<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.750> like

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
field because it is material just like

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.749 
field because it is material just like

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
think the power relays soul is but I

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.060 
think the power relays soul is but I
don't<00:03:12.690> know<00:03:12.870> people<00:03:13.080> really<00:03:13.290> gonna<00:03:13.560> use<00:03:13.769> relay
