00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.389
 guest jean dujardin become a few 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.099
 years one of the French actors the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.420
 most popular 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.130
 adapt a comic strip also known 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.809
 it's a difficult challenge but the film is 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.060
 managed to avoid the pitfalls 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.410
 eric cornet and alexandre dupont is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.180
 the one I'm asking you to restore 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 order 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.960
 adapt lucky luke to the cinema of 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.519
 directors including rnd if there are 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.399
 broke the web teeth 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.350
 so to avoid the pitfalls of risk 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.180
 to miss the purists the director has 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.760
 invented to poor lone cowboy a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.350
 passed a childhood injury that serves as a 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.030
 starting point to the story we were going 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.480
 create a story that is stretched 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.920
 of any album we could take from those of 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.719
 this bias there a lot a lot 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.030
 of full elements of different albums 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.710
 so if the dalton and rantanplan are 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.180
 absent from the casting we find the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.550
 most legends of the west who 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.590
 punctuate the luxury adventures of having 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.020
 a slab of calamity jane at billy the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.969
 kid going through jesse james 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.170

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:12.329
 this pact to bazire abed 6 characters 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.270
 it was a great actor jesse what is it 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.679
 tes and sarah bernhardt are points 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.090
 even if it's big bandits and 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.539
 that they are a priori the enemies of 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.979
 lucky Luke 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.020
 they all come touching even billy 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.609
 the kid who is played by a michael youn 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.740
 at first we say but wait for this dirty 

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:27.390
 kid really it is possible that there 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.500
 have volume and two plated in bed then 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.359
 that in fact after a while we say 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.709
 he is charming he is touching he a 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.000
 ready with his parents to finally settle to 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.960
 side but a little deep enough 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.880
 finally every day the characters 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.010
 also touching lucky duty luke melt 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.420
 before a beautiful lounge is the star 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.850
 chief to transform the hero almost 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.240
 asexual not very glamorous from the comic in real life 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.770
 movie hero his love story 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.420
 she and I love it because she wants 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.460
 I find it super funny I admit that 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.920
 it is at 1 it is a man who finds himself 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.909
 with a friend with tits does not know 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.100
 too much for your regionalization at once 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.810
 western comedy and adventure the one who 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.590
 fight version 2009 is faithful to 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.659
 the spirit of the comic 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.659
 only the public will judge
