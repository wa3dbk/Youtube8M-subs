00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello sand presentation 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.660
 turntables we will need a pattern of it 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.410
 easy to draw on checkered paper with 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.760
 using improvised means respecting 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:28.010
 a certain proportion of our petal 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:28.010
 exactly the size 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.620
 we put it out of paper or mine 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.710
 the subject is circled and brought to the right 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.710
 sizes 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.680
 take a brass sheet of copper or iron and 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.680
 using the template draw the contour 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.940
 sheet thickness 0508 millimeters easy 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.940
 cut ordinary scissors 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.440
 the resulting billet is processed on 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.000
 sandpaper 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:48.710
 file or in a vice we get here 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.450
 so we need zagotovochku sizes 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.370
 Now you need to throw on the subject or 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.500
 can be in something else for example in the grip 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.010
 we take the portal of God 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.790
 we need the diameter and start 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.790
 tapping 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:22.110
 we get here is such a petal garbage 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.110
 and sat on the firmament and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.060
 holes with a diameter of 22 and a half 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.120
 it will be enough meters like this 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:41.100
 petal here it is put 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:45.780
 here on this work is lure and fine 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.520
 works according to those sizes 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.410
 who you need maybe you are the length 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:56.750
 and smaller is narrower than the petal will be wider 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.750
 the greater the resistance in the water 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.260
 for making petals for trophim 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.990
 sky spinners 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:12.060
 also to do such a template but the essence 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.130
 In fact that he has such points to bends 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:21.300
 should be the same way you face 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:25.820
 on with badges or something else and we get 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:29.480
 Here the sand here is such a form and 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:33.230
 sizes this koneva spoon is such 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.230
 sky trofim subtype 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.569
 It is worth noting that in the manufacture 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:52.590
 maybe all sorts of nuances and in the subsequent 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:57.110
 when you put the petal on the spoon 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.909
 and you can test it 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.230
 small fit to 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:06.000
 the petal rotates easily and how can 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.569
 less resistance in water 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.140
 to sleep was got part 1 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.140
 suspender 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:20.090
 Thank you for your attention 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.090
 good date fishing
