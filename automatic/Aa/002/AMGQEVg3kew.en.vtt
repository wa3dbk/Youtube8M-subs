00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 because the catania is almost a tent o 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.840
 a large parade of de santis and a pole 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.030
 Yup 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.010
 thanks to a great performance 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.960
 improved search performance 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.240
 quality of participation by 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.980
 all was the song that should 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.689
 in dealing with this race as 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.420
 just in front of the world you are looking to play 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.100
 quickly which it is what governments 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.720
 the medium in the note in the sense that 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.580
 however in the final we have perhaps 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.160
 owner to win the race 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.600
 in the final minutes and this makes merit 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.580
 that of these guys who have been 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.770
 very good while another had 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.210
 renounced one of the counties someone 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.070
 the beauty had said a little choice 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.360
 trivial in this situation but then 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.140
 he was right also because his 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:46.579
 team did not lose but did not lose the 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.590
 tall head then in that moment due 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.170
 take away players they are doing 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.840
 well and breeder on very strong like 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.870
 this is why I am sorry but there is 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.340
 the foundation g 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.910
 likewise defender who came out right 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.040
 after the hike anyone dares evening 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.320
 the car then everyone is doing 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.670
 all, however, they tell me is young 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.810
 he studies in one 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.810
 I wanted to know how much he has 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.340
 that influenced this match 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.380
 arbitration decision which in my opinion a 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.210
 right decision in the sense that then you 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.710
 you have closed all the spaces that 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.630
 always represent to play had one 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.310
 team that was 9 players behind the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.630
 ball line 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.060
 but now that I have conditioned to play 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.220
 an inter part in numerical inferiority 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.740
 it is not a simple touch like 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.360
 we have done with great order with 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.640
 a spirit made itself a big one 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.070
 Team spirit is remarkable this has 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.810
 made a little more to solve his own 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.509
 performance 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.090
 in short, we do not passive the morning 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.860
 final seems to be looking for the goal over 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.200
 an opportunity motivates you very close 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.670
 thanks to say poured a woman team 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.759
 the Neapolitans thank you then after two 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.830
 minutes you thought it's done though 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.149
 unconsciously silver to which we have 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.860
 found in front of a catania that 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.530
 they all defended at the behest of 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.479
 Palm still leaving many a 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.220
 quality players maybe we have 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.060
 risked too much being minds us 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.380
 we have created little in quotation marks 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.269
 this does not resize yours 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.530
 receive this year very different from 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.780
 those of past years 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.519
 no absolutely not equalized in a 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.360
 very difficult field while a team 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.130
 which has defended itself exceptional goals 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.959
 risking among other things there is not 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.370
 we risked it but I think it was 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.010
 just so because also try 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.380
 win then we have been a reach 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.610
 but lucky with the pole but it is part of the 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.680
 football 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.319
 the president of Lazio is in the studio 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.599
 lotito that will be according to you I can 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.019
 opponent and Wednesday at the San stadium 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.420
 Paul 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.670
 in short, those who are more fans and naples the Lazio 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.820
 given that the Milanese slow down the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.350
 lazio roma who will be the anti I heard 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.150
 first the president who said that 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.900
 they do not rightly protect them from themselves 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.640
 this is what I believe it is 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.930
 the anti like best why do the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.030
 chasing others is never good 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.709
 one must focus only on oneself is 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.260
 lazio a napoli have the qualities to 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.299
 being elena president fears a napoli 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.500
 angry like that in the evening san paolo 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.079
 after this draw that in short 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.730
 someone clearly says if they see 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.890
 several obtained with a superiority 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.920
 numeric and 78 more than one missed opportunity 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.540
 naples is a great team put in 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.280
 camp has excellent players so 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.930
 always fearsome regardless of 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.640
 result of the condominiums 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.109
 we know that we go in against one 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.099
 great team we need to talk big 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.079
 performance 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.079
 thanks thanks to paolo cannavaro thanks
