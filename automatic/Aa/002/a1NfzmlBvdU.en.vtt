00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.219
 creep the skin so you care 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.280
 they started some way in 2003 a 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.100
 we are just novices right from the start 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.160
 extraordinary results and have books 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.930
 difficult the one that will go the most has done 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.600
 fatigue but andrea believed in the project 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.789
 in 2003 he joined us have it 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.410
 escorted very difficult and three together 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.440
 but this year has already given us two 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.899
 podiums and therefore is our pilot more 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.350
 absolute strong and for me it is great 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.890
 joy to be able to communicate here that andrea 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.840

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.570

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.860
 a lot we have already seen this year i 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:45.330
 improvements if you want to make two podiums e 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.160

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.140
 new project that had Easter that 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.200
