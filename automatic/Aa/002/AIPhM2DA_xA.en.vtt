and<00:00:18.990> fuel<00:00:19.680> pump<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.340> definitely<00:00:20.850> need<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
and fuel pump you definitely need to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.050 
and fuel pump you definitely need to
take<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.449> out<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.720> there<00:00:22.279> this<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> 95

all right here at the rear passenger
strut<00:00:35.340> tower

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.710 

as<00:00:41.930> you<00:00:42.770> can<00:00:42.920> see<00:00:43.100> here<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.610> hit<00:00:44.120> as<00:00:44.270> simple<00:00:44.630> as

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
as you can see here a hit as simple as

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.530 
as you can see here a hit as simple as
this<00:00:45.020> is<00:00:45.260> enough<00:00:46.040> to<00:00:46.730> immobilize<00:00:46.970> your<00:00:47.420> car

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
this is enough to immobilize your car

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.880 
this is enough to immobilize your car
now<00:00:50.540> you<00:00:50.600> see<00:00:50.870> with<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.110> engine<00:00:51.410> running<00:00:51.440> the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
now you see with the engine running the

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.830 
now you see with the engine running the
button<00:00:52.250> will<00:00:52.370> pop<00:00:52.400> cut<00:00:52.970> power<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.510> fuel

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
button will pop cut power to the fuel

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.220 
button will pop cut power to the fuel
pump<00:00:54.110> and<00:00:54.260> kill<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.100> engine<00:00:58.780> one<00:00:59.780> hit<00:00:59.989> with

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
pump and kill the engine one hit with

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.460 
pump and kill the engine one hit with
them

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.770 

so<00:01:03.470> do<00:01:03.620> immobilize<00:01:04.190> this<00:01:04.460> switch<00:01:04.820> you<00:01:05.509> need<00:01:05.660> to

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
so do immobilize this switch you need to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.980 
so do immobilize this switch you need to
cut<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.170> wires

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.039 

and<00:01:10.220> then<00:01:11.220> join<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.640> blue<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.840> black

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and then join the blue and the black

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.800 
and then join the blue and the black
wire<00:01:13.380> together<00:01:13.939> those<00:01:14.939> colors<00:01:15.390> will<00:01:15.570> vary

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
wire together those colors will vary

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.649 
wire together those colors will vary
from<00:01:16.020> car<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> car<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.369> real<00:01:17.610> easy<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
from car to car and it's real easy to

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.710 
from car to car and it's real easy to
figure<00:01:18.990> out<00:01:19.110> which<00:01:19.530> wires<00:01:20.189> need<00:01:21.149> to<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.420> joined

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
figure out which wires need to be joined

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.960 
figure out which wires need to be joined
together<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.920> troubleshoot<00:01:23.610> really

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
together you just troubleshoot really

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.830 
together you just troubleshoot really
you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.860> but<00:01:25.860> there's<00:01:26.520> normally<00:01:27.000> three<00:01:27.509> wires

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you can but there's normally three wires

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.830 
you can but there's normally three wires
and<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.070> them's<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.369> smaller<00:01:29.700> diameter<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
and one of them's a smaller diameter you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.690 
and one of them's a smaller diameter you
just<00:01:31.020> join<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.500> two<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:32.009> are<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.250> larger

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
just join the two that are the larger

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.300 
just join the two that are the larger
ones<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.960> normally<00:01:34.470> works<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.039> me<00:01:35.189> I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
ones that normally works for me I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.389 
ones that normally works for me I
haven't<00:01:36.149> I<00:01:36.840> can't<00:01:37.439> think<00:01:37.679> of<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.860> time<00:01:37.890> where

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
haven't I can't think of a time where

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.889 
haven't I can't think of a time where
that<00:01:38.549> didn't<00:01:38.820> work<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.210> me<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:40.080> um<00:01:41.630> 95s<00:01:42.630> cord

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
that didn't work for me but um 95s cord

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.949 
that didn't work for me but um 95s cord
anyways<00:01:43.200> blue<00:01:43.979> wire<00:01:44.250> black<00:01:45.179> wire<00:01:45.450> run<00:01:45.840> them

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:45.959 
anyways blue wire black wire run them

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.930 
anyways blue wire black wire run them
together<00:01:48.020> right<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.740> try<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.100> start<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.580> up

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
together right you try to start it up

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.600 
together right you try to start it up
any<00:01:51.600> time<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.140> any<00:01:52.319> sort<00:01:52.830> of<00:01:52.950> wiring<00:01:53.220> on

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
any time you do any sort of wiring on

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.669 
any time you do any sort of wiring on
these<00:01:53.789> cars<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.420> want<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.750> make<00:01:55.380> sure<00:01:55.409> it

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
these cars you want to make sure it

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:58.309 
these cars you want to make sure it
starts<00:01:56.039> after<00:01:56.280> you're<00:01:56.459> done<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.990> need<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> make

00:01:58.309 --> 00:01:58.319 
starts after you're done I need to make

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.880 
starts after you're done I need to make
sure<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.159> hooked<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.729> right<00:01:59.880> wires<00:02:00.890> if

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
sure that I hooked up the right wires if

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.240 
sure that I hooked up the right wires if
it<00:02:02.280> starts<00:02:02.670> up<00:02:02.819> and<00:02:03.439> runs<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.799> stays<00:02:05.009> running

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it starts up and runs and stays running

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.660 
it starts up and runs and stays running
then<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.240> did<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.420> right<00:02:06.950> if<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.190> didn't<00:02:08.459> do<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
then I did it right if I didn't do it

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.120 
then I did it right if I didn't do it
right<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.149> starter<00:02:09.509> will<00:02:09.690> engage<00:02:10.009> but<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
right the starter will engage but the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:44.680 
right the starter will engage but the
engine<00:02:11.430> won't<00:02:11.580> fire

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:54.200 

good<00:02:46.100> good<00:02:47.100> deal<00:02:52.790> all<00:02:53.790> right

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
good good deal all right

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.690 
good good deal all right
so<00:02:54.570> find<00:02:54.900> out<00:02:55.020> if<00:02:55.260> your<00:02:55.380> car<00:02:55.590> has<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> fuel<00:02:56.520> pump
