00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
hey guys today we're going to make a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.410 
hey guys today we're going to make a
spring<00:00:12.769> snap<00:00:13.070> and<00:00:13.309> originally<00:00:14.000> this<00:00:14.179> was<00:00:14.240> a

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:14.420 
spring snap and originally this was a

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.419 
spring snap and originally this was a
trail<00:00:14.990> snare<00:00:15.349> but<00:00:15.679> I<00:00:15.710> turned<00:00:15.920> it<00:00:16.279> into

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:16.429 
trail snare but I turned it into

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.630 
trail snare but I turned it into
something<00:00:16.699> different<00:00:16.970> so<00:00:17.599> stay<00:00:18.079> with<00:00:18.259> me<00:00:18.640> so

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
something different so stay with me so

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.489 
something different so stay with me so
this<00:00:19.819> is<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.060> poplar<00:00:20.449> tree<00:00:20.659> and<00:00:20.900> it's<00:00:21.289> quite

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:21.499 
this is the poplar tree and it's quite

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:23.319 
this is the poplar tree and it's quite
high<00:00:21.710> but<00:00:22.279> they<00:00:22.400> drop<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.759> branches<00:00:23.179> like

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:23.329 
high but they drop the branches like

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.679 
high but they drop the branches like
crazy<00:00:23.659> and<00:00:24.109> as<00:00:24.319> you<00:00:24.409> can<00:00:24.529> see<00:00:24.649> right<00:00:24.800> there

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
crazy and as you can see right there

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.210 
crazy and as you can see right there
there's<00:00:26.689> something<00:00:26.869> part<00:00:27.229> we<00:00:27.380> need<00:00:27.560> we<00:00:28.039> need<00:00:28.069> a

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
there's something part we need we need a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:50.200 
there's something part we need we need a
fork<00:00:28.609> a<00:00:28.849> stick<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:29.630> I'm<00:00:29.720> gonna<00:00:29.869> use<00:00:30.109> this<00:00:30.289> one

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.700 

now<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> next<00:00:51.629> part<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.989> need<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> straight

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
now the next part we need is a straight

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.259 
now the next part we need is a straight
branch<00:00:53.040> but<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.400> has<00:00:53.519> to<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.760> very<00:00:53.970> solid

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
branch but it has to be very solid

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.420 
branch but it has to be very solid
because<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.900> tensions<00:00:55.470> of<00:00:55.589> the<00:00:55.949> springy

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
because all the tensions of the springy

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.509 
because all the tensions of the springy
branch<00:00:56.730> will<00:00:56.970> be<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.480> part<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.519> look

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
branch will be on this part so look

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:06.950 
branch will be on this part so look
forth<00:00:59.820> like<00:01:00.540> a<00:01:00.900> thumb<00:01:01.730> thickness<00:01:05.630> now<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.690> are

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
forth like a thumb thickness now we are

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.510 
forth like a thumb thickness now we are
still<00:01:07.259> looking<00:01:07.409> for<00:01:07.770> another<00:01:07.800> piece<00:01:08.280> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
still looking for another piece and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.670 
still looking for another piece and
basically<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.240> need<00:01:09.360> two<00:01:09.750> parts<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.410> need<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
basically I need two parts I need a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.219 
basically I need two parts I need a
straight<00:01:11.550> stick<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.270> need<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.539> toggle<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
straight stick and I need to toggle and

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.820 
straight stick and I need to toggle and
what<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.009> use<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.399> dogwood<00:01:15.830> so

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
what I'm going to use this dogwood so

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.650 
what I'm going to use this dogwood so
just<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.160> quick<00:01:17.340> tip<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:17.759> you're<00:01:18.030> looking<00:01:18.509> for

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
just a quick tip if you're looking for

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.480 
just a quick tip if you're looking for
dog<00:01:18.840> food<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.380> cannot<00:01:19.649> recognize<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
dog food and you cannot recognize it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.320 
dog food and you cannot recognize it
just<00:01:20.700> basically<00:01:21.590> get<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> leaf<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.210> pull<00:01:24.210> it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
just basically get a leaf and pull it

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.410 
just basically get a leaf and pull it
apart<00:01:26.030> like<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:28.100> as<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.190> can<00:01:29.280> see<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.759> hangs<00:01:30.030> on

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
apart like so as you can see it hangs on

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:42.810 
apart like so as you can see it hangs on
these<00:01:31.229> lines<00:01:31.560> right<00:01:31.890> here

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.760 

so<00:01:43.820> this<00:01:44.000> trip<00:01:44.270> consists<00:01:44.900> of<00:01:44.990> five<00:01:45.200> parts<00:01:45.500> so

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
so this trip consists of five parts so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.620 
so this trip consists of five parts so
what<00:01:45.920> we<00:01:46.040> collected<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:46.640> two<00:01:46.880> four<00:01:47.180> sticks

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
what we collected is two four sticks

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
what we collected is two four sticks
like<00:01:48.500> this<00:01:48.560> one<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.900> solid<00:01:50.900> straight<00:01:51.170> branch

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:04.490 

a<00:01:55.740> thinner<00:01:56.580> branch<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:59.060> a<00:02:00.060> long<00:02:00.360> toggle<00:02:03.500> so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
a thinner branch and a long toggle so

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.930 
a thinner branch and a long toggle so
now<00:02:04.650> we're<00:02:04.860> looking<00:02:04.950> for<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.310> springy<00:02:05.640> branch

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
now we're looking for a springy branch

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.300 
now we're looking for a springy branch
and<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> good<00:02:06.420> choice<00:02:06.660> would<00:02:07.320> be<00:02:07.380> hazel<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.130> my

and a good choice would be hazel in my
opinion<00:02:08.729> will<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> best<00:02:09.800> because<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
opinion will be the best because the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.000 
opinion will be the best because the
branch<00:02:11.730> is<00:02:11.910> like<00:02:12.060> just<00:02:12.240> awesome<00:02:12.660> there<00:02:13.560> are<00:02:13.740> no

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
branch is like just awesome there are no

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.030 
branch is like just awesome there are no
hazel<00:02:14.430> trees<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.880> this<00:02:14.970> area<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.830> I'm<00:02:16.830> gonna

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
hazel trees in this area so I'm gonna

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.000 
hazel trees in this area so I'm gonna
continue<00:02:17.490> my<00:02:17.520> search<00:02:18.620> there<00:02:19.620> are<00:02:19.740> really<00:02:19.890> a

continue my search there are really a
lot<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.250> trees<00:02:20.580> around<00:02:20.850> here<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.240> is<00:02:21.390> the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
lot of trees around here this is the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.830 
lot of trees around here this is the
older<00:02:21.840> tree<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.150> bigger<00:02:24.360> one<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.720> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
older tree and the bigger one is the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.260 
older tree and the bigger one is the
poplar<00:02:25.170> tree<00:02:25.410> next<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.250> it<00:02:26.370> it's<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.700> small<00:02:26.850> oak

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
poplar tree next to it it's a small oak

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.850 
poplar tree next to it it's a small oak
tree<00:02:27.630> as<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.320> can<00:02:28.440> see<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.910> elderberry

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
tree as you can see this is elderberry

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.180 
tree as you can see this is elderberry
here<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.130> four<00:02:32.370> thorn<00:02:33.890> next<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.100> this

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
here we have four thorn next to it this

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.449 
here we have four thorn next to it this
dogwood<00:02:36.320> okay<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:37.380> here<00:02:37.680> we<00:02:37.709> have<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.160> hazel

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
dogwood okay so here we have it hazel

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.680 
dogwood okay so here we have it hazel
and<00:02:39.680> needs<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.890> springy<00:02:41.340> branch<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.540> look

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
and needs a springy branch and just look

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.949 
and needs a springy branch and just look
at<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.640> pulling<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.880> down<00:02:45.060> up<00:02:47.660> that's<00:02:48.660> what<00:02:48.840> you

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
at it pulling it down up that's what you

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:58.130 
at it pulling it down up that's what you
want<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.890> now<00:02:50.040> I'm<00:02:50.160> measuring<00:02:50.370> depending

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.720 

I'm<00:02:59.140> gonna<00:02:59.350> place<00:02:59.710> this<00:02:59.920> fall<00:03:00.160> at<00:03:00.340> stake<00:03:00.580> in

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
I'm gonna place this fall at stake in

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.270 
I'm gonna place this fall at stake in
front<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.330> measure<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.980> other<00:03:02.980> place

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
front of it to measure the other place

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.710 
front of it to measure the other place
of<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.580> fork<00:03:03.850> stick<00:03:04.150> right<00:03:04.840> here<00:03:09.420> I'm<00:03:10.420> pulling

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
of the fork stick right here I'm pulling

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.390 
of the fork stick right here I'm pulling
the<00:03:10.930> springy<00:03:11.230> branch<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.770> I'm<00:03:11.890> locking<00:03:12.130> it

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
the springy branch and I'm locking it

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.830 
the springy branch and I'm locking it
under<00:03:13.330> my<00:03:13.450> armpit<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.760> then<00:03:16.600> I'm

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
under my armpit like so and then I'm

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:25.260 
under my armpit like so and then I'm
going<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.140> tie<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.650> constrictor<00:03:18.220> knot<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:25.150> the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
going to tie a constrictor knot so the

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.790 
going to tie a constrictor knot so the
next<00:03:25.480> step<00:03:25.690> you're<00:03:25.900> going<00:03:26.050> to<00:03:26.260> put<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.560> solid

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
next step you're going to put the solid

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.360 
next step you're going to put the solid
sticks<00:03:27.250> up<00:03:27.930> then<00:03:28.930> with<00:03:29.110> toggle<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.710> go<00:03:29.860> over

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
sticks up then with toggle you go over

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.839 
sticks up then with toggle you go over
and<00:03:30.780> under<00:03:32.820> then

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.520 

we're<00:03:38.390> gonna<00:03:38.540> pull<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:38.840> back<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:40.120> jam<00:03:41.530> that

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
we're gonna pull that back and jam that

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.959 
we're gonna pull that back and jam that
other<00:03:42.769> stick<00:03:43.930> like<00:03:44.930> so<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:46.430> this<00:03:46.579> will<00:03:46.760> be<00:03:46.879> your

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:46.969 
other stick like so so this will be your

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:50.289 
other stick like so so this will be your
trigger<00:03:47.239> system<00:03:47.680> if<00:03:48.680> you<00:03:48.890> touch<00:03:49.189> it<00:03:49.219> it<00:03:50.180> will

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
trigger system if you touch it it will

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.959 
trigger system if you touch it it will
go<00:03:50.450> off<00:03:50.629> and<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:52.099> next<00:03:52.310> step<00:03:52.459> is<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.700> attach

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:52.969 
go off and the next step is to attach

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.229 
go off and the next step is to attach
the<00:03:53.000> snare<00:03:53.390> loop<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:55.430> what<00:03:55.549> I<00:03:55.640> just<00:03:55.849> did<00:03:56.030> I

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
the snare loop so what I just did I

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.420 
the snare loop so what I just did I
collected<00:03:56.689> some<00:03:56.720> dog<00:03:57.140> food<00:03:57.379> and<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.920> basically

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
collected some dog food and I basically

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.729 
collected some dog food and I basically
split<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.909> at<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.239> top<00:03:59.480> so<00:03:59.989> you<00:04:00.019> can<00:04:00.140> open<00:04:00.439> your

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
split it at the top so you can open your

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.369 
split it at the top so you can open your
snare<00:04:01.010> loop<00:04:01.220> with<00:04:01.400> this<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:02.450> reason<00:04:02.720> why<00:04:03.079> I

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:03.379 
snare loop with this the reason why I

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.520 
snare loop with this the reason why I
put<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:04.730> loop<00:04:04.939> behind<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.840> toggle<00:04:06.349> is

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
put the loop behind the toggle is

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.349 
put the loop behind the toggle is
because<00:04:06.859> basically<00:04:07.099> then<00:04:07.969> there's<00:04:08.239> no

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
because basically then there's no

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.009 
because basically then there's no
possibility<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.620> it<00:04:09.769> jams<00:04:10.659> so<00:04:11.659> the<00:04:11.780> first

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
possibility that it jams so the first

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.569 
possibility that it jams so the first
thing<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.290> will<00:04:12.560> flip<00:04:12.799> right<00:04:13.010> now<00:04:13.220> is<00:04:13.430> the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
thing that will flip right now is the

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.729 
thing that will flip right now is the
toggle<00:04:13.849> and<00:04:14.120> it<00:04:14.180> will<00:04:14.329> flip<00:04:14.629> upwards<00:04:15.139> so<00:04:15.620> it

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
toggle and it will flip upwards so it

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.560 
toggle and it will flip upwards so it
doesn't<00:04:16.099> Jam<00:04:16.430> in<00:04:17.299> the<00:04:17.539> snare<00:04:17.780> loop<00:04:19.509> okay<00:04:20.509> so

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
doesn't Jam in the snare loop okay so

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.420 
doesn't Jam in the snare loop okay so
the<00:04:20.810> next<00:04:20.959> step<00:04:21.139> what<00:04:21.440> I'm<00:04:21.530> going<00:04:21.709> to<00:04:21.799> do<00:04:21.979> I'm

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
the next step what I'm going to do I'm

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:35.720 
the next step what I'm going to do I'm
gonna<00:04:22.880> put<00:04:22.970> small<00:04:23.419> sticks<00:04:23.750> all<00:04:24.020> around<00:04:24.380> it
