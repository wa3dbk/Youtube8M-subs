and not your back typically for this
exercise<00:03:02.230> what<00:03:02.560> you're<00:03:02.680> doing<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.040> you're

stress on our on our front delts and we

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.390 
stress on our on our front delts and we
get<00:03:17.049> a<00:03:17.079> lot<00:03:17.470> of<00:03:17.500> work<00:03:17.739> through<00:03:18.010> our<00:03:18.040> front
