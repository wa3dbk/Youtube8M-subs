00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.649 
started out with a Styrofoam wreath from
Joanne's<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.400> around<00:01:17.610> $5<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.450> just

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
Joanne's I think it was around $5 I just

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.960 
Joanne's I think it was around $5 I just
got<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> biggest<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.430> had<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
got the biggest one that they had and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.590 
got the biggest one that they had and
then<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.170> decided<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.890> wanted<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.880> spring

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
then I decided I wanted to do a spring

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.640 
then I decided I wanted to do a spring
slash<00:01:24.990> Easter<00:01:25.619> kind<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.640> wreath<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.320> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
slash Easter kind of wreath and so I

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
picked out four fabrics that I thought

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.210 
picked out four fabrics that I thought
were<00:01:32.340> pretty<00:01:33.979> eastery<00:01:34.979> springy<00:01:35.750> colors<00:01:37.220> easy

enough and I just got a half yard of
each<00:01:40.799> which<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:41.729> Sarah<00:01:42.060> had<00:01:42.680> suggested

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
each which is what Sarah had suggested

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.370

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
cut it this is just

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.500 
cut it this is just
what<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.220> had<00:02:14.489> leftover<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:16.290> put<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.709> fold

what I had leftover and I put the fold
on<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.410> end<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.069> had<00:02:20.190> all<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.370> my<00:02:20.519> fabric

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
on the end here and had all of my fabric

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.940 
on the end here and had all of my fabric
just<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.420> fold<00:02:21.629> that<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.050> comes<00:02:22.739> off<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.269> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
just the fold that it comes off of the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.080 
just the fold that it comes off of the
I'm<00:02:25.950> not<00:02:26.129> gonna<00:02:26.340> be<00:02:26.519> able<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.730> think<00:02:26.879> of<00:02:26.970> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
I'm not gonna be able to think of the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.780 
I'm not gonna be able to think of the
word<00:02:27.269> not<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.260> spool<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:29.040> essentially<00:02:29.610> this

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
word not the spool but essentially this

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.050 
word not the spool but essentially this
fool<00:02:30.120> had<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.319> fold<00:02:31.860> over<00:02:32.160> on<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.519> side<00:02:32.580> and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
fool had the fold over on this side and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.210 
fool had the fold over on this side and
had<00:02:33.330> all<00:02:33.450> my<00:02:33.569> fabric<00:02:33.959> stretching<00:02:34.380> out<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.830> as

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
had all my fabric stretching out and as

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.180 
had all my fabric stretching out and as
she<00:02:35.580> had<00:02:35.819> suggested<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.480> just<00:02:36.810> kept<00:02:37.620> folding<00:02:38.069> it

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
she had suggested I just kept folding it

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.940 
she had suggested I just kept folding it
up<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.640> halves<00:02:39.180> until<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.170> got<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.590> about<00:02:40.709> this

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
up in halves until I got to about this

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.559 
up in halves until I got to about this
size<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.849> then<00:02:42.269> took<00:02:42.599> my<00:02:42.810> scissors<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.590> cut

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
size and then took my scissors and cut

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.990 
size and then took my scissors and cut
strips<00:02:45.569> about<00:02:46.349> an<00:02:46.560> inch<00:02:46.950> maybe<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.370> little<00:02:47.549> over

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
strips about an inch maybe a little over

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.440 
strips about an inch maybe a little over
an<00:02:48.239> inch<00:02:48.420> wide<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.799> guess<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.790> can<00:02:50.940> kind<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.269> do

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
an inch wide I guess you can kind of do

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.550 
an inch wide I guess you can kind of do
whatever<00:02:51.720> size<00:02:52.049> you<00:02:52.349> really<00:02:52.799> want<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.700> do<00:02:53.880> and

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
whatever size you really want to do and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.890 
whatever size you really want to do and
when<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.680> unfold<00:02:55.860> after<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.849> cut<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.780> right

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
when you unfold after you cut it right

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.240 
when you unfold after you cut it right
here<00:02:58.140> when<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.319> unfold<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.739> you'll<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:59.069> two

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
here when you unfold it you'll have two

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.280 
here when you unfold it you'll have two
strips<00:02:59.610> and<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.720> just<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.930> quicker<00:03:01.170> way

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
strips and it's just a quicker way

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.900 
strips and it's just a quicker way
rather<00:03:01.680> than<00:03:01.799> going<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.280> whole<00:03:02.459> length<00:03:02.730> of

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
rather than going the whole length of

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.690 
rather than going the whole length of
the<00:03:02.970> fabric<00:03:03.150> cutting<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.930> line<00:03:04.349> by<00:03:05.099> folding<00:03:05.489> it

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the fabric cutting a line by folding it

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.789 
the fabric cutting a line by folding it
you<00:03:05.880> have<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.269> very<00:03:06.510> short<00:03:06.750> distance<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.290> go<00:03:07.500> and

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
you have a very short distance to go and

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.670 
you have a very short distance to go and
you<00:03:08.010> get<00:03:08.160> your<00:03:08.310> strips<00:03:08.579> a<00:03:08.670> lot<00:03:08.819> faster<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:10.200> my

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
you get your strips a lot faster so my

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.970 
you get your strips a lot faster so my
strips<00:03:11.010> were<00:03:11.329> about<00:03:12.329> like<00:03:12.599> this<00:03:12.920> these<00:03:13.920> are

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
strips were about like this these are

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.970 
strips were about like this these are
just<00:03:14.130> some<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.579> ones<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.910> had<00:03:15.090> leftover<00:03:15.980> so

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
just some of the ones I had leftover so

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.000 
just some of the ones I had leftover so
I<00:03:17.010> cut<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.239> was<00:03:18.450> what<00:03:18.630> was<00:03:18.750> left<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.470> my<00:03:19.769> half

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
I cut this was what was left of my half

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.160 
I cut this was what was left of my half
yard<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.389> turned<00:03:21.630> out<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.959> be<00:03:21.989> about

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
yard and it turned out to be about

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.150 
yard and it turned out to be about
perfect<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:23.069> had<00:03:24.000> maybe<00:03:24.269> one<00:03:24.420> or<00:03:24.690> two<00:03:25.160> strips

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
perfect I had maybe one or two strips

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.140 
perfect I had maybe one or two strips
leftover<00:03:26.700> of<00:03:26.730> my<00:03:27.230> fabric<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.459> size<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.940> was

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
leftover of my fabric so the size I was

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.080 
leftover of my fabric so the size I was
going<00:03:31.079> and<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.350> tied<00:03:31.650> mine<00:03:32.010> very<00:03:32.430> very<00:03:32.730> tightly

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
going and I tied mine very very tightly

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.319 
going and I tied mine very very tightly
on<00:03:33.590> my<00:03:34.590> wreath<00:03:34.799> I<00:03:35.040> say<00:03:35.190> tightly<00:03:35.670> meaning<00:03:36.090> very

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
on my wreath I say tightly meaning very

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.520 
on my wreath I say tightly meaning very
close<00:03:36.900> together

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
close together

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.910 
close together
I<00:03:37.880> kept<00:03:38.880> squishing<00:03:39.510> them<00:03:39.630> around<00:03:40.049> and<00:03:40.440> like

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
I kept squishing them around and like

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.610 
I kept squishing them around and like
you<00:03:41.160> know<00:03:41.280> pulling<00:03:41.730> them<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.540> pushing<00:03:43.350> them

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
you know pulling them and pushing them

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.990 
you know pulling them and pushing them
together<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:44.160> get<00:03:44.250> them<00:03:44.430> as<00:03:44.549> tight<00:03:44.819> as

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
together to get them as tight as

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.509 
together to get them as tight as
possible<00:03:45.569> you<00:03:45.720> can<00:03:45.750> see<00:03:46.139> on<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:47.280> back

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
possible you can see on the the back

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.900 
possible you can see on the the back
here<00:03:47.970> it's<00:03:48.980> completely<00:03:49.980> covered<00:03:50.250> and<00:03:50.700> they're

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
here it's completely covered and they're

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.910 
here it's completely covered and they're
overlapping<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.959> I<00:03:52.019> just<00:03:52.230> kept<00:03:52.410> pushing<00:03:52.590> so

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
overlapping and I just kept pushing so

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.670 
overlapping and I just kept pushing so
that<00:03:53.069> none<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.970> styrofoam<00:03:54.440> would<00:03:55.440> show

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
that none of the styrofoam would show

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.460 
that none of the styrofoam would show
through<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:57.480> see<00:03:57.630> here's<00:03:57.900> even<00:03:58.200> some<00:03:58.380> I

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
through and see here's even some I

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.009 
through and see here's even some I
haven't<00:03:58.650> even<00:03:58.799> turned<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.400> over<00:03:59.700> really<00:04:00.019> after

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
haven't even turned it over really after

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.240 
haven't even turned it over really after
I<00:04:02.630> after<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.660> had<00:04:04.049> finished<00:04:04.290> tying<00:04:04.739> all<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.130> them

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
I after I had finished tying all of them

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.339 
I after I had finished tying all of them
on<00:04:05.370> there<00:04:05.549> and<00:04:05.670> felt<00:04:06.269> that<00:04:06.359> I<00:04:06.599> was<00:04:06.750> finished<00:04:07.170> I

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
on there and felt that I was finished I

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.830 
on there and felt that I was finished I
started<00:04:07.769> trimming<00:04:08.670> them<00:04:09.239> because<00:04:09.630> they<00:04:09.780> were

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
started trimming them because they were

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.659 
started trimming them because they were
a<00:04:09.930> little<00:04:10.230> long<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.739> wanted<00:04:11.040> them<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.370> have

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
a little long and I wanted them to have

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:15.680 
a little long and I wanted them to have
more<00:04:12.239> of<00:04:12.769> an<00:04:13.769> angled<00:04:14.310> cut<00:04:14.549> at<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.269> end<00:04:15.450> and

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
more of an angled cut at the end and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.360 
more of an angled cut at the end and
they<00:04:15.750> were<00:04:15.870> just<00:04:16.019> too<00:04:16.709> long<00:04:16.889> so<00:04:17.160> I<00:04:17.220> just

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
they were just too long so I just

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.969 
they were just too long so I just
started<00:04:17.579> pulling<00:04:17.789> them<00:04:18.120> up<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.979> snipping

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
started pulling them up and snipping

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.330 
started pulling them up and snipping
away<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:21.660> just<00:04:22.409> have<00:04:22.560> continued<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.190> do<00:04:23.310> that

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
away and just have continued to do that

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.730 
away and just have continued to do that
as<00:04:23.700> I've<00:04:23.880> messed<00:04:24.180> around<00:04:24.330> with<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.810> I've<00:04:25.680> found

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
as I've messed around with it I've found

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.560 
as I've messed around with it I've found
some<00:04:26.310> longer<00:04:26.610> pieces<00:04:27.090> and

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
some longer pieces and

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.840 
some longer pieces and
what<00:04:27.840> not<00:04:27.990> again<00:04:28.170> but<00:04:28.890> it<00:04:29.220> was<00:04:29.340> too<00:04:29.550> much<00:04:29.640> of<00:04:29.700> a

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
what not again but it was too much of a

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.270 
what not again but it was too much of a
hassle<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.240> do<00:04:30.450> that<00:04:30.630> kind<00:04:30.960> of<00:04:31.050> as<00:04:31.170> I<00:04:31.320> went<00:04:31.530> for

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
hassle to do that kind of as I went for

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.660 
hassle to do that kind of as I went for
me<00:04:32.690> maybe<00:04:33.690> that's<00:04:33.960> something<00:04:34.290> that<00:04:34.710> somebody

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
me maybe that's something that somebody

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.280 
me maybe that's something that somebody
else<00:04:35.760> would<00:04:36.030> find<00:04:36.270> helpful<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.870> do<00:04:36.990> as<00:04:37.140> you

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
else would find helpful to do as you

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.020 
else would find helpful to do as you
went<00:04:37.500> but<00:04:37.740> I<00:04:37.950> figured<00:04:38.460> if<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.640> did<00:04:38.790> it<00:04:38.910> at<00:04:38.970> the

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
went but I figured if I did it at the

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.400 
went but I figured if I did it at the
end<00:04:39.120> they<00:04:39.390> would<00:04:39.510> all<00:04:39.630> be<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.930> same<00:04:39.960> size

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
end they would all be the same size

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.520 
end they would all be the same size
because<00:04:41.250> I<00:04:41.730> would<00:04:42.450> it's<00:04:42.720> not<00:04:42.810> given<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.170> haircut

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
because I would it's not given a haircut

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.720 
because I would it's not given a haircut
I'll<00:04:43.620> not<00:04:43.860> cut<00:04:44.040> a<00:04:44.070> little<00:04:44.250> here<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.610> then

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
I'll not cut a little here and then

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.550 
I'll not cut a little here and then
later<00:04:44.880> two<00:04:45.600> days<00:04:45.750> later<00:04:45.960> come<00:04:46.140> over<00:04:46.290> here<00:04:46.470> and

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
later two days later come over here and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.260 
later two days later come over here and
cut<00:04:46.710> some<00:04:46.920> I<00:04:47.040> want<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.280> do<00:04:47.370> it<00:04:47.490> all<00:04:47.640> at<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.090> same

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
cut some I want to do it all at the same

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.780 
cut some I want to do it all at the same
time<00:04:48.540> so<00:04:48.810> I<00:04:48.840> remember<00:04:49.320> what<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.740> length<00:04:49.950> was

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
time so I remember what the length was

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.370 
time so I remember what the length was
um<00:04:51.320> so<00:04:52.320> anyway<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:53.070> just<00:04:53.910> tied<00:04:54.390> it<00:04:54.420> like<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:55.140> went

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
um so anyway I just tied it like I went

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.410 
um so anyway I just tied it like I went
in<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.650> pattern<00:04:56.040> she<00:04:56.310> said<00:04:56.550> that<00:04:56.730> she<00:04:56.910> also<00:04:57.060> went

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
in a pattern she said that she also went

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.450 
in a pattern she said that she also went
in<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.600> pattern<00:04:57.840> so<00:04:58.290> I<00:04:58.320> just<00:04:58.650> kept<00:04:58.890> going<00:04:58.950> the

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
in a pattern so I just kept going the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.060 
in a pattern so I just kept going the
same<00:04:59.700> pattern<00:05:00.210> all<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.390> way<00:05:00.480> around<00:05:01.070> adding

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
same pattern all the way around adding

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.090 
same pattern all the way around adding
less<00:05:02.310> tool<00:05:02.730> I<00:05:03.240> mean<00:05:03.810> I<00:05:03.840> had<00:05:03.990> tool<00:05:04.200> at<00:05:04.800> the<00:05:04.950> end

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
less tool I mean I had tool at the end

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.370 
less tool I mean I had tool at the end
of<00:05:05.220> each<00:05:05.280> pattern<00:05:05.610> but<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.300> first<00:05:06.570> I<00:05:06.900> think<00:05:07.290> I

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
of each pattern but the first I think I

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.830 
of each pattern but the first I think I
went<00:05:07.500> for<00:05:08.250> example<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:09.060> tied<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.330> green<00:05:09.630> one<00:05:09.780> a

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
went for example I tied a green one a

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.630 
went for example I tied a green one a
blue<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.260> purple<00:05:10.740> one<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:10.890> a<00:05:11.040> pink<00:05:11.280> one<00:05:11.340> and

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
blue and a purple one and a pink one and

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.870 
blue and a purple one and a pink one and
then<00:05:11.730> I<00:05:11.760> would<00:05:12.030> tie<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.360> white<00:05:13.230> tool<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.220> then<00:05:14.850> I

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
then I would tie a white tool and then I

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.730 
then I would tie a white tool and then I
would<00:05:15.090> do<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.300> pattern<00:05:15.450> again<00:05:15.840> green<00:05:16.350> blue

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
would do the pattern again green blue

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.370 
would do the pattern again green blue
purple<00:05:17.160> pink<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:18.210> then<00:05:18.420> I<00:05:18.450> would<00:05:18.660> tie<00:05:18.840> pink

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
purple pink and then I would tie pink

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.100 
purple pink and then I would tie pink
tool<00:05:19.620> and<00:05:20.010> then<00:05:20.550> I<00:05:20.580> would<00:05:20.760> repeat<00:05:21.090> that<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:21.990> it

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
tool and then I would repeat that so it

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.560 
tool and then I would repeat that so it
was<00:05:22.290> basically<00:05:22.740> a<00:05:23.040> pattern<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.760> ten<00:05:24.060> instead

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
was basically a pattern of ten instead

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.230 
was basically a pattern of ten instead
of<00:05:24.690> just<00:05:25.400> four<00:05:26.400> or<00:05:26.550> five<00:05:26.700> I<00:05:26.730> don't<00:05:27.090> know<00:05:27.180> if

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
of just four or five I don't know if

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.860 
of just four or five I don't know if
that<00:05:27.360> really<00:05:27.570> makes<00:05:28.020> sense<00:05:28.340> but<00:05:29.340> anyway<00:05:29.730> so<00:05:30.510> I

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
that really makes sense but anyway so I

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.920 
that really makes sense but anyway so I
thought<00:05:31.140> it<00:05:31.290> turned<00:05:31.530> out<00:05:31.680> pretty<00:05:32.660> easy<00:05:33.660> I<00:05:33.810> mean

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
thought it turned out pretty easy I mean

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.440 
thought it turned out pretty easy I mean
it<00:05:34.020> was<00:05:34.160> relatively<00:05:35.160> cheap<00:05:35.460> to<00:05:35.490> make<00:05:35.820> it's

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
it was relatively cheap to make it's

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.300 
it was relatively cheap to make it's
something<00:05:36.780> I<00:05:36.870> can<00:05:37.050> get<00:05:37.230> out<00:05:37.350> year<00:05:37.710> after<00:05:37.740> year

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
something I can get out year after year

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.480 
something I can get out year after year
and<00:05:38.730> hang<00:05:39.210> on<00:05:39.690> my<00:05:40.020> door<00:05:40.170> for<00:05:40.500> that<00:05:40.530> holiday<00:05:40.980> I

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
and hang on my door for that holiday I

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.190 
and hang on my door for that holiday I
also<00:05:42.060> thought<00:05:42.330> it<00:05:42.450> would<00:05:42.570> be<00:05:42.660> a<00:05:42.690> really<00:05:42.990> cute

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
also thought it would be a really cute

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.910 
also thought it would be a really cute
idea<00:05:43.410> they<00:05:43.890> have<00:05:44.070> even<00:05:44.460> smaller<00:05:45.530> foam<00:05:46.530> wreaths

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
idea they have even smaller foam wreaths

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.120 
idea they have even smaller foam wreaths
that<00:05:47.220> I<00:05:47.730> think<00:05:48.060> would<00:05:48.180> be<00:05:48.270> cute<00:05:48.600> to<00:05:49.350> maybe<00:05:49.800> do

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
that I think would be cute to maybe do

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.760 
that I think would be cute to maybe do
like<00:05:50.430> a<00:05:51.090> birthday<00:05:51.420> one<00:05:51.780> if<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.140> can<00:05:52.320> find<00:05:52.530> some

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
like a birthday one if you can find some

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.930 
like a birthday one if you can find some
fabric<00:05:53.250> with<00:05:53.840> balloons<00:05:54.840> or<00:05:55.550> cakes<00:05:56.550> or

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
fabric with balloons or cakes or

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.300 
fabric with balloons or cakes or
whatever<00:05:57.480> on<00:05:57.870> them<00:05:58.110> cupcakes<00:05:58.680> or<00:05:58.890> something

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
whatever on them cupcakes or something

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.600 
whatever on them cupcakes or something
and<00:05:59.670> do<00:06:00.480> a<00:06:00.810> fabric<00:06:01.470> wreath<00:06:01.650> like<00:06:01.800> that<00:06:02.010> that's

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
and do a fabric wreath like that that's

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.790 
and do a fabric wreath like that that's
smaller<00:06:02.970> that<00:06:03.210> you<00:06:03.270> can<00:06:03.510> hang<00:06:03.840> or<00:06:04.320> even<00:06:04.650> the

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
smaller that you can hang or even the
