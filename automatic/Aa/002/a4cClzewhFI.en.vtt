00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.020
 at 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.910
 question what goals is the match 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.939
 so satisfied with the players 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.949
 but prices 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.550
 farther 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.119
 training program 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.900
 finish weekly cycle 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.220
 suggest 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.630
 here 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.369
 whose goal is plane 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.649
 young players 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.509
 game practice 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.850
 but to the players who went to the national 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.210
 Datsan team again normal h 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.870
 what explains the election sparring 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.970
 partner 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.000
 but firstly we are long ago Sergey Gurenko 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.900
 agreed and wanted to play on 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.389
 central stadium but 

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:49.500
 first published 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.540
 here is my second moment 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.700
 small adaptation to synthetics 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.020
 Wrong Gagarin Sergei that 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.700
 I decided 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.060
 handed mined to play on 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.940
 second field in the picture 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.060
 before the match with Spartak 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.180
 midfielder since the national teams 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.330
 there will be more lessons synthetics will 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.600
 in the championship 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.890
 us one more checks of the calculations 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.180
 what conclusions can be made about 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.550
 first coaching success Sergey 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.740
 gurenko to whom is the team first he 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.060
 well done 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.340
 shorter than all this 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.540
 earlier command of the police squad now 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.950
 already in second place 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.630
 and the most important thing is that 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.890
 the players 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.550
 more motivation 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.590
 Assad taught play 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.940
 football and 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.210
 from the locomotive who walked everything is clear yet 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.530
 the best coach 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.700
 except that this vicious was gone 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.899
 what they 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.439
 tried to play mistakes were they going 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.990
 no coach is like a team 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:54.030
 no errors 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.350
 they will always be 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.350
 the canvas to me is important they are bold in deciding 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.940
 yes in the test from the moment they hit the evil and 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.030
 for me the result was not important 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.280
 at very nice they didn't lose there what 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.879
 it looked to me your guys 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.939
 and i'm my interest but even 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.409
 such 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.469
 asked not that even a companion 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.069
 the character however is an interesting match to me 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.969
 liked 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.449
 maybe even principled 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.569
 character given by person coaches 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.319
 there was no task for me to win and 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.799
 tom to prove 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.839
 prevent me from other goals I wanted 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.089
 image of the unit played 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.959
 good stadium with a good team to 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.919
 do not increase the units and what 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.719
 the result for today is not decisive 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.839
 what explains all of a sudden matches as 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.949
 rival efimenko could not go 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.329
 in Moscow Belarus find sparring 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.319
 partners 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.479
 not at night 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.509
 we cook our sokur 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:53.739
 someone 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.540
 Well, first of all, look at what 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.969
 worth working 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.569
 mistakes compare me for a wreck doll 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.169
 chamber of its capabilities 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.289
 compare the capabilities of our players with 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:06.309
 opportunity 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.719
 locomotive players 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.549
 as far as they themselves have mastered the fifa new 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.349
 for yourself the role of coach 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.469
 but not yet fully found that 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.329
 hard in chechnya gitis 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.419
 player it is not soon it will happen 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.269
 a leg 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.479
 what can you do 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.309
 what are the specific goals for the current 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.799
 season if team 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.029
 but zoned by ferry a year ago 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:28.920
 second place 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.470
 but at the same time I have a task 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.470
 decide on players so on 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.299
 next year to work and 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.389
 it is important to me that every year he was a short step 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.370
 forward that year we were also second but 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.679
 were captive your quota year 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.349
 it is now in second place at night 4 match 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.779
 they will be very heavy therefore 

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:50.689
 all ass fight ahead 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:52.290
 for sure to settle in the championship of Russia 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.919
 what do you think about the prospects 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.579
 locomotives 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.019
 in the race for medals is very nice very 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.790
 good calendar but i think russia 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.489
 no very weak teams and 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.559
 and yet the opponent must be tuned. 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.029
 so 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.759
 I think that everything is in the hands of the locomotive and 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.759
 if a team 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:14.699
 last round last match 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.609
 will hold on that 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.309
 level at which uralov 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:21.309
 in last matches from canada i think that 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.559
 recently will 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:25.299
 definitely
