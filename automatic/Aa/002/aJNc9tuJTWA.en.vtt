00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.190 
extra strong because it's going to be
holding<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:04.000> lot<00:02:04.149> more<00:02:04.390> than<00:02:04.450> just<00:02:04.630> the<00:02:04.960> fruit

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
holding a lot more than just the fruit

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
holding a lot more than just the fruit
that<00:02:05.350> was<00:02:05.530> in<00:02:05.680> the<00:02:05.829> in<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.850> original<00:02:07.329> ones<00:02:08.220> but

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
that was in the in the original ones but

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.660 
that was in the in the original ones but
the<00:02:09.340> technique<00:02:09.759> is<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.000> same<00:02:11.310> put<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.489> the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
the technique is the same put on the

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.900 
the technique is the same put on the
flame

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.160
