okay<00:00:01.819> if<00:00:02.060> we<00:00:02.179> have<00:00:02.389> a<00:00:02.419> second<00:00:02.960> test<00:00:03.230> of<00:00:03.440> the<00:00:03.530> LR

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.270 
okay if we have a second test of the LR

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.740 
okay if we have a second test of the LR
500<00:00:05.270> I<00:00:05.540> made<00:00:06.440> robot<00:00:07.040> if<00:00:08.029> you<00:00:08.179> notice<00:00:08.480> on<00:00:08.629> the

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
500 I made robot if you notice on the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.320 
500 I made robot if you notice on the
floor<00:00:08.960> here<00:00:09.349> we<00:00:10.070> have<00:00:10.340> some<00:00:11.590> Musil<00:00:12.820> and<00:00:13.820> we

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
floor here we have some Musil and we

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.669 
floor here we have some Musil and we
have<00:00:14.570> some<00:00:15.279> pet<00:00:16.279> hair<00:00:16.580> and<00:00:17.199> Jim<00:00:18.199> will<00:00:18.319> sort<00:00:18.589> of

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:18.679 
have some pet hair and Jim will sort of

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.609 
have some pet hair and Jim will sort of
dust<00:00:19.269> what<00:00:20.269> I'm<00:00:20.359> gonna<00:00:20.480> do<00:00:20.749> is<00:00:21.079> I'm<00:00:21.289> gonna<00:00:21.380> put

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
dust what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.429 
dust what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put
the<00:00:21.769> I<00:00:21.800> made<00:00:22.159> into<00:00:22.609> spot<00:00:23.210> cleaning<00:00:23.419> mode<00:00:23.689> which

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
the I made into spot cleaning mode which

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.979 
the I made into spot cleaning mode which
it<00:00:24.589> will<00:00:24.710> do<00:00:24.859> automatically<00:00:25.489> anyway<00:00:27.309> but<00:00:28.989> we

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:29.989 
it will do automatically anyway but we

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.719 
it will do automatically anyway but we
will<00:00:30.139> do<00:00:30.289> it<00:00:30.409> so<00:00:30.589> that<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:30.800> will<00:00:30.919> do<00:00:31.099> on<00:00:31.339> that

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:31.729 
will do it so that it will do on that

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.979 
will do it so that it will do on that
particular<00:00:32.119> area<00:00:32.559> okay<00:00:33.559> I've<00:00:33.710> got<00:00:33.890> it<00:00:33.980> set

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
particular area okay I've got it set

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.849 
particular area okay I've got it set
slow<00:00:35.989> speed<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:37.989> normal<00:00:38.989> cleaning<00:00:39.260> mode<00:00:39.410> and

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
slow speed a normal cleaning mode and

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.470 
slow speed a normal cleaning mode and
we're<00:00:40.489> just<00:00:40.670> going<00:00:42.489> so<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.609> idea<00:00:43.879> is<00:00:44.030> is<00:00:44.179> it<00:00:44.329> it

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
we're just going so the idea is is it it

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.680 
we're just going so the idea is is it it
will<00:00:44.600> do<00:00:44.719> a<00:00:44.989> few<00:00:45.350> circles<00:00:46.160> it's<00:00:47.089> been<00:00:47.239> standard

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
will do a few circles it's been standard

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.970 
will do a few circles it's been standard
to<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:47.839> in<00:00:47.960> procedure<00:00:48.289> pretty<00:00:48.620> much<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.829> same

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
to the in procedure pretty much the same

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.389 
to the in procedure pretty much the same
with<00:00:49.129> most<00:00:49.249> robots<00:00:50.379> and<00:00:51.379> then<00:00:52.159> it<00:00:52.280> will

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
with most robots and then it will

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.119 
with most robots and then it will
gradually<00:00:52.820> have<00:00:53.649> ever-increasing<00:00:54.649> circles

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
gradually have ever-increasing circles

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.239 
gradually have ever-increasing circles
to<00:00:55.879> actually<00:00:56.179> pick<00:00:56.359> up<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.510> dust<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:58.100> we'll

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:58.249 
to actually pick up the dust so we'll

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.950 
to actually pick up the dust so we'll
see<00:00:58.399> how<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.550> goes

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.330 

the<00:01:03.530> LR<00:01:03.740> 500<00:01:04.340> is<00:01:04.430> very<00:01:04.640> quiet<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:06.290> don't<00:01:07.220> whether

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
the LR 500 is very quiet I don't whether

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.810 
the LR 500 is very quiet I don't whether
you<00:01:07.490> can<00:01:08.290> hear<00:01:09.290> how<00:01:09.530> quiet<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:10.250> I<00:01:10.280> would<00:01:10.640> say

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
you can hear how quiet is I would say

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.400 
you can hear how quiet is I would say
that<00:01:10.970> you'd<00:01:11.120> certainly<00:01:11.360> really<00:01:11.630> hit<00:01:11.840> here<00:01:12.200> the

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
that you'd certainly really hit here the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.260 
that you'd certainly really hit here the
television<00:01:13.220> in<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.370> background<00:01:13.820> if<00:01:14.000> it<00:01:14.150> was

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
television in the background if it was

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.270 
television in the background if it was
on<00:01:14.830> and<00:01:17.260> it<00:01:18.260> actually<00:01:18.470> trying<00:01:18.800> to<00:01:18.860> run<00:01:19.070> quite

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
on and it actually trying to run quite

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.980 
on and it actually trying to run quite
nicely<00:01:19.550> without<00:01:19.880> actually<00:01:20.570> disturbing

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
nicely without actually disturbing

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.910 
nicely without actually disturbing
anybody<00:01:21.610> this<00:01:22.610> is<00:01:22.790> in<00:01:22.940> slow<00:01:23.240> mode<00:01:23.540> I<00:01:23.780> will<00:01:24.770> put

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
anybody this is in slow mode I will put

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.950 
anybody this is in slow mode I will put
it<00:01:24.979> into<00:01:25.190> fast<00:01:25.430> modes<00:01:25.700> later<00:01:25.790> on<00:01:26.060> I'll<00:01:26.900> show

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
it into fast modes later on I'll show

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.370 
it into fast modes later on I'll show
you<00:01:27.140> how<00:01:27.500> that<00:01:27.530> works<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:29.210> can<00:01:29.360> see<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.690> the

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
you how that works you can see the the

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.180 
you how that works you can see the the
outside<00:01:30.590> brushes<00:01:31.270> most<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:32.600> time<00:01:32.840> do<00:01:33.740> sort

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
outside brushes most of the time do sort

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.180 
outside brushes most of the time do sort
of<00:01:34.250> spike<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.390> into<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.780> middle<00:01:36.190> sometimes

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
of spike it into the middle sometimes

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.889 
of spike it into the middle sometimes
you<00:01:37.340> get<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.640> odd<00:01:37.759> flick<00:01:38.119> where<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.450> flicks<00:01:38.720> it

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
you get the odd flick where it flicks it

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.840 
you get the odd flick where it flicks it
out<00:01:39.050> but<00:01:39.380> then<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.800> tends<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.340> go<00:01:40.460> back<00:01:40.670> and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
out but then it tends to go back and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.890 
out but then it tends to go back and
pick<00:01:40.970> it<00:01:41.090> out<00:01:41.149> later<00:01:41.390> anyway<00:01:44.410> just<00:01:45.640> doing

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
pick it out later anyway just doing

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.990 
pick it out later anyway just doing
the<00:01:48.229> framerate<00:01:48.530> on<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.189> video<00:01:49.580> probably

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
the framerate on this video probably

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.770 
the framerate on this video probably
doesn't<00:01:50.420> show<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:51.280> now<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:53.540> brushes

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
doesn't show that now the the brushes

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.760 
doesn't show that now the the brushes
are<00:01:54.080> spinning<00:01:54.439> there<00:01:54.619> but<00:01:59.110> closer<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.409> might

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
are spinning there but closer you might

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.550 
are spinning there but closer you might
just<00:02:01.070> see<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:02.210> they<00:02:02.509> go<00:02:02.659> round<00:02:02.869> now<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.229> where

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
just see and they go round now to where

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.820 
just see and they go round now to where
the<00:02:04.210> dust<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.540> you<00:02:05.840> can<00:02:05.990> get<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.170> good<00:02:06.409> close-up

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
the dust is you can get a good close-up

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.550 
the dust is you can get a good close-up
there

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.050 

and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.930 

it's<00:02:15.900> um

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
it's um

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.320 
it's um
it<00:02:18.300> does<00:02:18.570> see<00:02:18.810> appear<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.380> have<00:02:19.530> picked<00:02:19.770> up

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
it does see appear to have picked up

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.620 
it does see appear to have picked up
just<00:02:21.330> going<00:02:21.570> back<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.020> original<00:02:22.110> place<00:02:23.630> it

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
just going back to the original place it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.500 
just going back to the original place it
was<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:24.960> there<00:02:25.760> there's<00:02:26.760> one<00:02:26.970> little<00:02:27.300> final

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
was just there there's one little final

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.470 
was just there there's one little final
bit<00:02:27.810> of

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.520 

of<00:02:30.720> dust

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.619 
there's no tricks here son
sometimes<00:02:43.400> people<00:02:43.819> tend<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:46.299> show<00:02:47.299> off<00:02:47.450> their

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
sometimes people tend to show off their

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.229 
sometimes people tend to show off their
robots<00:02:48.109> in<00:02:48.290> ideal<00:02:48.920> situations<00:02:49.640> this<00:02:49.819> is<00:02:50.000> just

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
robots in ideal situations this is just

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.179 
robots in ideal situations this is just
a<00:02:50.329> normal<00:02:50.629> sort<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.900> carpet<00:02:51.349> it<00:02:51.560> isn't<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.980> heavy

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
a normal sort of carpet it isn't a heavy

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.849 
a normal sort of carpet it isn't a heavy
shag<00:02:52.609> carpet<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.329> I<00:02:53.540> think<00:02:53.840> if<00:02:54.079> any<00:02:54.230> carpet<00:02:54.530> was

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
shag carpet so I think if any carpet was

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.039 
shag carpet so I think if any carpet was
a<00:02:57.790> longer<00:02:58.790> pile<00:02:59.150> on<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.540> I<00:02:59.659> think<00:02:59.720> you'd

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
a longer pile on it I think you'd

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.559 
a longer pile on it I think you'd
probably<00:03:00.230> have<00:03:00.560> problems<00:03:03.069> so

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.420 

if<00:03:07.110> you've<00:03:07.290> got<00:03:07.530> big<00:03:07.890> thick<00:03:08.459> rugs<00:03:08.819> and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.759 

big<00:03:13.060> thick<00:03:13.299> carpets<00:03:14.049> I<00:03:14.230> think<00:03:14.439> you<00:03:14.560> can

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
big thick carpets I think you can

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.520 
big thick carpets I think you can
probably<00:03:15.280> forget<00:03:15.579> it<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.319> just<00:03:17.319> use<00:03:17.500> a

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
probably forget it and just use a

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.080 
probably forget it and just use a
conventional<00:03:17.950> cleaner<00:03:19.950> all<00:03:20.950> right<00:03:21.129> that's<00:03:21.909> it

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
conventional cleaner all right that's it

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.349 
conventional cleaner all right that's it
it's<00:03:22.900> all<00:03:23.079> clean
