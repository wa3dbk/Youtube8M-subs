00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 and Argentina will face England 

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.649
 very complicated match is surely 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.160
 a hinge this first meeting because 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.070
 In case of losing, Scotland would be 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.039
 rival thinking in a second phase by 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.189
 that support the cougars a dialogue with the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.769
 pillar of the Argentine team a few hours 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.600
 of the match against England if in 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.400
 The New Zealand World Cup 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.940
 for me the last World Cup and surely 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.940
 will be 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.410
 it will be the last moment with the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.240
 Argentine selected 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.580
 which are the rivals to overcome beyond 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.470
 of everything that is known about the rivals 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.610
 I think there is only one rival to beat and it is 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.690
 the first match that is against 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.690
 england I do not think 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.910
 argentina the cougars is not a team that 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.200
 can speculate I think we have a good 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.600
 team and that we can do well 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.129
 things but if we start playing with 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.330
 the speculations I think that 's where 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.489
 we can fail 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.020
 tell me the group is fine I think we 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.000
 it came very well to be quite a while 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.190
 together in pensacola it seems to me that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.989
 frank are the relations the exchange 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.729
 between all the players so it's 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.650
 Well, the group is fine without playing 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.479
 Hernandez is different I had 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.130
 many hopes since arriving 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.440
 The truth is that it was one of the blows 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.750
 harder commented with those who did not 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.100
 we know well we know this all 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.250
 efforts he made to get the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.950
 world and that the truth is not more than 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.509
 quarrel about not being able to play with him is 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.399
 quarrel because our house when the 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.970
 people recognize when they sing English 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.330
 with what they leave on the court 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.190
 [Applause] 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.220
 you have an ego like any 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.430
 another person within any 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.350
 activity but tell me the truth is a 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.490
 issue that is born in the range of after 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.960
 early 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.600
 we never told ourselves we were going to sing 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.590
 well strong he was not leaving each one 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.830
 well that's the time before entering 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.570
 to a court not where one deals with 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.970
 get as much as possible I think some 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.310
 they have brand we sing the anthem 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.200
 and who is the best was save the world 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.060
 for me it is very important the player who 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.220
 transmits inside the court since 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.870
 plays well the isi playing look at the 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.600
 sides does not seem to me that perhaps 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.870
 AgustÃ­n Pichot is something to highlight 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.850
 because Augustine did not play only comes 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.400
 he but all those who had the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.140
 motivation that he generated makes you 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.360
 all the team play well the best 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.170
 world team for you first 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.250
 later I think that that pillar that is 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.540
 starting and you see in three world 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.250
 surely he wants you to transmit 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.920
 something the truth that always gave the same 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.230
 that the start playing the radio one 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.910
 always with things not but the main thing 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.500
 is to be able to have fun 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.090
 a sport 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.890
 having fun having fun being with 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.030
 the friends and taking things very much in 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.920
 serious 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.890
 that this is the side by decree more 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.680
 in this sport you can dream it's free 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.300
 Great joke bag is free as well 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.069
 that we have to dream and we have to dream 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.550
 but always conaf and under the earth and 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.540
 knowing that we have to start well 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.459
 the world Cup 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.709
 we reiterate support for pumas 530 for 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.750
 Argentine public television 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.879
