00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:04.950
 with great joy I can say that intel taught us before its launch on 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.990
 Most recent processor for desktop prebo cc was precisely when 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.990
 comes to the market we have the result of this team 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.109
 by 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:28.920
 today this last processor that the quintet took out intel and is in ccoo did not arrive 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.490
 It is a 900 message processor 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.550
 and that go tarabita to the market basically that trade this processor 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.310
 a technology called jal belong that means this 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.140
 that has two cores but that technology duplicates it to four cores 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.980
 virtually why for the processes to be much faster 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.860
 In addition to that he uses a rooster and lourdes voltage where he does not use all the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.170
 energy in other processors when the computer does not need only when 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.140
 need 1 use it intelligently or if you need the two towns put a 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.230
 basically work what else this processor brings is a process that 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:13.020
 uses percent that can be used for video for a music for all 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.960
 Applications 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.680
 basic can also be used although this one 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.040
 min mid range is a process that buries liza in design be 5 by him using 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.530
 blades or any type the pro any type of program they say basically is 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.550
 A very good processor for all users is also used for games 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.890
 it yields very well you can watch movies perfectly 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.570
 with this type of machine and in addition to that it comes for all 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.060
 the laptops and all the texts basically going to enter first what 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.600
 text because you can enter desktop computers but from 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.050
 then to enter 1 intel i5 for mobile laptops basically these 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.670
 an excellent processor to buy in this fifth and slow city 2010 here 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.990
 internal the kily 5 of intel
