00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
hunt down those strikers you can give

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.529

him<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.590> 10-15<00:04:23.190> yards<00:04:23.340> stop<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:24.000> because

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
him a 10-15 yards stop and because

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.940 
him a 10-15 yards stop and because
you're<00:04:24.780> always<00:04:24.870> quicker<00:04:25.260> without<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.770> ball

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
you're always quicker without the ball

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.680 
you're always quicker without the ball
then<00:04:26.280> someone<00:04:26.610> with<00:04:26.789> the<00:04:26.940> ball<00:04:27.120> he

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
then someone with the ball he

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.210 
then someone with the ball he

we'll catch up those centre-backs and

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.470 
we'll catch up those centre-backs and
then<00:04:29.370> he's<00:04:29.520> got<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.790> strength<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.180> muscle

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
then he's got the strength to muscle

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.910 
then he's got the strength to muscle
them<00:04:30.600> off<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:30.930> then<00:04:31.050> win<00:04:31.230> the<00:04:31.260> ball<00:04:31.500> bet<00:04:31.680> for

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
there was only one slight thing that I

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.420 
there was only one slight thing that I
didn't<00:04:49.320> like<00:04:49.410> about<00:04:49.530> his<00:04:49.770> duties<00:04:50.070> work<00:04:50.220> grace

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
got a higher tech and work great in a

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.900 
got a higher tech and work great in a
medium<00:04:52.530> defensive<00:04:52.950> work<00:04:53.100> great<00:04:53.280> which<00:04:53.640> meant

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
medium defensive work great which meant

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.640 
medium defensive work great which meant
that<00:04:53.970> he<00:04:54.630> sometimes<00:04:55.140> was<00:04:55.350> out<00:04:55.440> of<00:04:55.470> position

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
that he sometimes was out of position

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.650 
that he sometimes was out of position
sometimes<00:04:56.160> I'd<00:04:56.490> find<00:04:56.730> him<00:04:56.880> like<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.540> know

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
sometimes I'd find him like you know

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.450 
sometimes I'd find him like you know
halfway<00:04:58.080> up<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.290> pitch<00:04:58.560> and<00:04:58.860> because<00:04:59.250> he<00:04:59.280> was

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
halfway up the pitch and because he was

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.920 
halfway up the pitch and because he was
good<00:04:59.640> enough<00:04:59.820> he<00:05:00.000> wasn't<00:05:00.300> out<00:05:00.360> of<00:05:00.420> position<00:05:00.630> at

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
good enough he wasn't out of position at

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.380 
good enough he wasn't out of position at
all<00:05:01.110> but<00:05:01.890> you<00:05:02.370> know<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.610> can<00:05:02.730> leave<00:05:02.910> exposed

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
all but you know it can leave exposed

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.210 
all but you know it can leave exposed
you<00:05:04.110> better<00:05:04.290> off<00:05:04.380> playing<00:05:04.560> with<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.800> free<00:05:05.100> at

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
you better off playing with a free at

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.310 
you better off playing with a free at
the<00:05:05.250> back<00:05:05.490> i<00:05:05.640> reckon<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.210> then<00:05:06.420> he'll<00:05:06.990> just<00:05:07.170> be

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
the back i reckon and then he'll just be

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.050 
the back i reckon and then he'll just be
an<00:05:07.380> absolute<00:05:07.770> monson<00:05:08.070> can<00:05:08.220> dictate<00:05:08.400> play<00:05:08.790> he's

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
an absolute monson can dictate play he's

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.630 
an absolute monson can dictate play he's
probably<00:05:09.270> like<00:05:09.510> an<00:05:09.630> old-school<00:05:10.370> sweeper<00:05:11.370> you
