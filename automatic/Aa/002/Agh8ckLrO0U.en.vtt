00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.890 
and this goes into your tablet pc slate
pc<00:01:58.560> or<00:01:58.800> mac<00:01:59.670> as<00:01:59.940> it<00:02:00.180> says<00:02:00.330> on<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.540> back<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.720> the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
pc or mac as it says on the back of the

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.200 
pc or mac as it says on the back of the
box<00:02:01.080> compatible<00:02:02.070> with<00:02:02.159> apple<00:02:02.580> products<00:02:02.909> yes

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
box compatible with apple products yes

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.720 
box compatible with apple products yes
so<00:02:04.170> so<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.620> would<00:02:04.920> use<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.340> cable

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
so so you would use this cable

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.820 
so so you would use this cable
incidentally<00:02:06.480> to<00:02:06.659> both<00:02:06.840> power<00:02:07.200> your<00:02:07.560> reader

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
incidentally to both power your reader

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.880 
incidentally to both power your reader
as<00:02:08.129> well<00:02:08.580> as<00:02:08.729> copy<00:02:09.060> content<00:02:09.780> from<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:10.470> your

as well as copy content from your your

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.449 
as well as copy content from your your
pc<00:02:11.400> mac<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:11.700> whatnot

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
pc mac and whatnot

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.220 
pc mac and whatnot
so<00:02:14.459> hopefully<00:02:14.909> this<00:02:15.060> has<00:02:15.299> a<00:02:15.659> little<00:02:15.959> bit<00:02:16.170> of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
so hopefully this has a little bit of

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.289 
so hopefully this has a little bit of
juice<00:02:16.530> for<00:02:16.799> us<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.129> do<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> first-time<00:02:17.879> Buddha

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
juice for us to do a first-time Buddha

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.940

so<00:03:37.199> let's<00:03:37.470> see<00:03:37.769> if<00:03:38.069> this<00:03:38.909> has<00:03:39.120> any<00:03:39.389> power

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
so let's see if this has any power

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.580 
so let's see if this has any power
hopefully<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.310> does<00:03:41.720> many<00:03:42.720> people<00:03:42.900> ask<00:03:43.260> us

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
it's not as easy as just clicking here

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.729 
it's not as easy as just clicking here
to<00:03:53.970> turn<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.329> page<00:03:54.510> often<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.260> need<00:03:55.409> to<00:03:55.590> like

make<00:03:55.949> swiping<00:03:56.549> motions<00:03:56.970> which<00:03:57.180> gets<00:03:57.479> really

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
make swiping motions which gets really

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.170 
make swiping motions which gets really
tedious<00:03:58.260> if<00:03:58.650> you're<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.799> fast<00:03:59.010> reader<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.609> really

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
tedious if you're a fast reader I really

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.809 
tedious if you're a fast reader I really
like<00:04:00.449> manual<00:04:01.109> page<00:04:01.379> turnkeys<00:04:02.099> it's<00:04:02.430> very<00:04:02.609> easy

some use out of the preloaded content
and<00:04:43.980> as<00:04:44.880> Michael<00:04:45.210> said<00:04:45.540> yes<00:04:46.200> this<00:04:46.740> isn't<00:04:47.040> touch

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
and as Michael said yes this isn't touch

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.340 
and as Michael said yes this isn't touch
screen<00:04:47.520> because<00:04:47.880> one<00:04:48.240> it'll<00:04:48.930> make<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.230> device

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
screen because one it'll make the device

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.320 
screen because one it'll make the device
a<00:04:49.470> little<00:04:49.830> bit<00:04:49.950> heavier<00:04:50.250> and<00:04:50.520> it'll<00:04:51.000> make<00:04:51.180> the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
a little bit heavier and it'll make the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.970 
a little bit heavier and it'll make the
costs<00:04:51.600> go<00:04:51.900> up<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:52.169> little<00:04:52.260> bit<00:04:52.500> because<00:04:52.650> the

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
costs go up a little bit because the

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.010 
costs go up a little bit because the
screen<00:04:53.370> has<00:04:53.639> to<00:04:53.850> have<00:04:54.000> infrared<00:04:54.480> touch<00:04:54.810> around

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
screen has to have infrared touch around

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.020 
screen has to have infrared touch around
the<00:04:55.230> bezel<00:04:55.440> whereas<00:04:56.160> this<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.580> very<00:04:56.760> cost

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
the bezel whereas this is very cost

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.800 
the bezel whereas this is very cost
effective<00:04:58.760> looks<00:04:59.760> like<00:04:59.910> page<00:05:00.150> turn<00:05:00.450> speeds

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
effective looks like page turn speeds

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.200 
effective looks like page turn speeds
are<00:05:01.020> rather<00:05:01.740> they're<00:05:02.400> really<00:05:02.669> quick<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.150> it

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
are rather they're really quick and it

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.360 
are rather they're really quick and it
doesn't<00:05:03.540> look<00:05:03.660> like<00:05:03.720> every<00:05:04.470> single<00:05:04.860> page<00:05:05.130> you

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
doesn't look like every single page you

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.870 
doesn't look like every single page you
turn<00:05:05.760> is<00:05:06.030> a<00:05:06.300> full<00:05:06.720> ink<00:05:07.680> refresh<00:05:08.250> it<00:05:08.490> looks<00:05:08.669> like

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880
