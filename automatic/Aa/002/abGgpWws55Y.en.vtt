00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.510
 we're going to say that like that I'm rather 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.250
 at the heart 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.750
 me if a phone that I like level 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.180
 of appearance and who makes the options 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.920
 that I want and you know I take but 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.570

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.600
 picked up at the end feel the shots of 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.600
 heart 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:49.550

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.760

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.720
