00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.830 
thing I don't like about the same this
time<00:04:27.470> limit<00:04:28.070> it's<00:04:28.820> bad<00:04:29.030> enough<00:04:29.060> that<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.690> have

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
time limit it's bad enough that you have

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.600 
time limit it's bad enough that you have
to<00:04:29.960> come<00:04:30.169> up<00:04:30.200> with<00:04:30.410> strategies<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.040> how<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.370> do

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
to come up with strategies and how to do

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.290 
to come up with strategies and how to do
this<00:04:31.760> game<00:04:32.000> but<00:04:32.300> where<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:32.990> adds<00:04:33.169> a<00:04:33.320> time<00:04:33.560> limit

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
this game but where it adds a time limit

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.520

guess<00:04:35.300> that's<00:04:35.540> okay<00:04:35.840> cuz<00:04:36.050> it<00:04:36.169> makes<00:04:36.200> you<00:04:36.410> more

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
guess that's okay cuz it makes you more

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.960 
guess that's okay cuz it makes you more
