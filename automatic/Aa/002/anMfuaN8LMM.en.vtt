00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.870
 welcome back to another pp 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.519
 researcher video here in the background that 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.380
 material is already running with the change 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.070
 I do not know if it is one 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.320
 strikes 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.150
 I 'm looking for a bit then can 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.789
 I think I recognize better 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.160
 about the wolves so neutral monsters 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.470
 and vasals are here too 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.699
 agro indicators if we are from the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.519
 to be attacked 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.410
 this looks like somalia or anime 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.500
 here this i am angry or i call 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.059
 wild just what made the strokes, the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.070
 philosophy follows that many things 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.300
 should also be clearly visible visually 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.280
 is nothing new 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.989
 That was part of the whole thing 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.539
 this tower to the very laser so I 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.370
 is white me picks up next 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.289
 but also recently it has been with the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.579
 formally with this image return effect 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.010
 and now it feels natural 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.530
 for sure, and for the future 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.629
 even more things some say now 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.829
 God what's that why do you do 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.489
 the play even easier than it anyway 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.710
 pretty is 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.750
 Personally, I see it all 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.610
 i think rather positive i mean mine 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.130
 Does not do much the case anymore 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.810
 but I think it speaks 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.299
 do not mind that the game too 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.729
 visually clear and clear 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.450
 from that as I said I see the whole 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.549
 rather positive another right 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.310
 Controversial change is that of twisted 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.020
 face wbz hurt that effect is in here 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.659
 background, it looks very nice that it 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.579
 much bigger obvious and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.159
 Above all you can see all three cards 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.320
 always constant means I have to do that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.450
 no longer memorize colors 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.009
 here many say oh my god what 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.540
 is that supposed to be her now ? 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.150
 Anyone can do that much easier now 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.430
 Nook's playing is terrible me 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.960
 mean that it is easier by that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.240
 is probably no question 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.590
 but for old-established to set 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.659
 field player makes no difference 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.790
 they knew the order before 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.390
 now know the order of things 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.460
 whatever 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.510
 and that uses it better now 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.220
 cope 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.050
 and is that somehow important or 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.750
 more relevant it is nice for the 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.490
 but it does not matter or me 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.230
 personally see the whole thing extremely 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.700
 positive because if we could maybe 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.500
 they remind the players 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.720
 have weakness or are color blind 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.010
 for example, they are happy then 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.900
 surely over it 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.090
 the cards are much bigger me 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.560
 recognize the symbols and that means 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.760
 Of course, even if I change the color of the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.900
 card I can not see it 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.150
 even better 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.850
 distinguish and that's a great 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.800
 change or if one necessarily so 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.540
 a lot at least to the whole thing 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.220
 you make it out as you almost do it 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.540
 of course, I leave it to myself 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.550
 just wanted to report the whole thing 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.870
 So thanks for seeing and I hope 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.870
 I'll see you in the next video thanks
