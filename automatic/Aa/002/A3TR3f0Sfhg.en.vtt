00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490 

I'm<00:00:00.960> right<00:00:01.350> now<00:00:01.589> and<00:00:02.629> right<00:00:03.629> now<00:00:03.689> been

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
I'm right now and right now been

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.299 
I'm right now and right now been
experimenting<00:00:05.430> with<00:00:05.460> like<00:00:05.940> high<00:00:06.569> voltage

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
experimenting with like high voltage

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:16.039 
experimenting with like high voltage
pulses<00:00:08.420> and<00:00:09.530> I<00:00:12.710> have<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.130> very<00:00:14.809> messy<00:00:15.809> in

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
pulses and I have this very messy in

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.720 
pulses and I have this very messy in
continue<00:00:16.680> ok<00:00:17.570> here<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.840> my<00:00:18.890> transformer<00:00:19.890> 12

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
continue ok here is my transformer 12

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.759 
continue ok here is my transformer 12
volt<00:00:21.000> five<00:00:21.240> minute<00:00:22.220> it's<00:00:23.220> fading<00:00:24.090> into<00:00:24.449> this

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
volt five minute it's fading into this

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.349 
volt five minute it's fading into this
switch<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.070> pulled<00:00:26.310> out<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.760> door<00:00:27.060> for

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
switch that I pulled out of the door for

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.250 
switch that I pulled out of the door for
a<00:00:27.390> microwave<00:00:27.900> oven<00:00:28.760> this<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.260> microwave

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
a microwave oven this is a microwave

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.520 
a microwave oven this is a microwave
transformer<00:00:32.510> which<00:00:33.510> i'm<00:00:33.750> using<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
transformer which i'm using the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.100 
transformer which i'm using the
compulsion<00:00:35.070> 12<00:00:35.790> volts<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.210> five<00:00:36.450> handsome<00:00:36.930> too

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
compulsion 12 volts or five handsome too

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.959 
compulsion 12 volts or five handsome too
well<00:00:37.800> actually<00:00:37.980> I'm<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.489> sure<00:00:38.610> how

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
well actually I'm not really sure how

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.690 
well actually I'm not really sure how
many<00:00:39.030> answers<00:00:39.540> pointed<00:00:40.230> I'm<00:00:41.070> assuming<00:00:41.610> it's

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
many answers pointed I'm assuming it's

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.660 
many answers pointed I'm assuming it's
five<00:00:41.969> mins<00:00:42.739> because<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.040> my<00:00:44.190> other<00:00:44.370> power

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
five mins because on all my other power

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.600 
five mins because on all my other power
supplies<00:00:45.059> i<00:00:45.090> shorted<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.870> met<00:00:46.370> this<00:00:47.370> one's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
supplies i shorted you met this one's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.310 
supplies i shorted you met this one's
not<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:48.059> picking<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.989> shop

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
not really picking up that it's a shop

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:59.000 
not really picking up that it's a shop
so<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:50.610> good<00:00:53.270> I've<00:00:55.160> we<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.340> hit<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:58.010> 1205

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
so that's good I've we can hit here 1205

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.170 
so that's good I've we can hit here 1205
and<00:00:59.219> power<00:00:59.430> supply<00:01:00.230> then<00:01:01.230> fed<00:01:01.680> into<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:03.199> switch

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
and power supply then fed into a switch

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.300 
and power supply then fed into a switch
for<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.479> microwave<00:01:07.470> oven<00:01:07.680> door<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.310> goes

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
for a microwave oven door that then goes

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.399 
for a microwave oven door that then goes

of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.840> secondary<00:01:40.500> ones<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:41.270> microwave

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
of the secondary ones is microwave

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.179 
of the secondary ones is microwave
transform<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.930> an<00:01:43.049> endpoint<00:01:43.320> grounded<00:01:43.920> which

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
transform is an endpoint grounded which

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.859 
transform is an endpoint grounded which
means<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.610> end<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.180> granted<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
means the end of it is granted to the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.969 
means the end of it is granted to the
call<00:01:47.659> alright<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:48.930> sort<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.799> like<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
call alright and so sort of like a

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.660 
call alright and so sort of like a
strobe<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.729> push<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.270> button<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.670> let's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
strobe when I push the button so let's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:03.510 
strobe when I push the button so let's
show

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.590 

I'm<00:02:04.520> trying<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.880> figure<00:02:05.030> out<00:02:05.210> how<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.359> get<00:02:05.479> it

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
I'm trying to figure out how to get it

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.779 
I'm trying to figure out how to get it
continuously<00:02:06.229> going<00:02:06.439> I'll<00:02:06.740> be<00:02:06.890> good<00:02:07.039> we're

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
continuously going I'll be good we're

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.369 
continuously going I'll be good we're
not<00:02:07.939> even<00:02:07.969> got<00:02:08.269> to<00:02:08.300> light<00:02:08.569> connected<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.229> it

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
not even got to light connected to it

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.619 
not even got to light connected to it
it's<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:10.480> on<00:02:11.480> big<00:02:12.170> light<00:02:12.580> high-voltage<00:02:13.629> like

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
it's a on big light high-voltage like

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.250 
it's a on big light high-voltage like
arc<00:02:15.370> like<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.400> quick<00:02:16.790> one<00:02:17.030> okay<00:02:17.660> it's<00:02:18.019> more<00:02:18.200> of

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
arc like a quick one okay it's more of

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:37.170 
arc like a quick one okay it's more of
like<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.410> discharge<00:02:34.989> yeah<00:02:35.989> after<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.680> just

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
like a discharge yeah after that it just

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.390 
like a discharge yeah after that it just
wanted<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.269> show<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:39.340> hopefully<00:02:40.340> will

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
wanted to show you that hopefully will

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.130 
wanted to show you that hopefully will
work<00:02:40.640> on<00:02:40.819> something<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.209> will<00:02:41.480> continuously

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
work on something that will continuously

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.940 
work on something that will continuously
run<00:02:43.989> yes<00:02:44.989> i'm<00:02:45.769> going<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:45.980> call<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.370> night

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
run yes i'm going to call it a night

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.950 
run yes i'm going to call it a night
yeah
