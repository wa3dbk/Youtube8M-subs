appropriate to that organization so

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:23.979 
appropriate to that organization so
let's<00:01:22.970> just<00:01:23.209> have<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.360> look<00:01:23.420> at<00:01:23.660> some<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.869> the

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:23.989 
let's just have a look at some of the

00:01:23.989 --> 00:01:25.809 
let's just have a look at some of the
interactive<00:01:24.619> properties<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.310> their<00:01:25.580> tech

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819 
interactive properties of their tech

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:32.350 
interactive properties of their tech
9001<00:01:27.009> let's<00:01:28.009> go<00:01:28.190> to<00:01:28.250> internal<00:01:29.060> audit<00:01:31.179> so<00:01:32.179> if<00:01:32.239> we

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
9001 let's go to internal audit so if we

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.199 
9001 let's go to internal audit so if we
open<00:01:32.690> up<00:01:32.959> the<00:01:33.170> internal<00:01:33.590> audit<00:01:33.920> template<00:01:34.369> what

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
open up the internal audit template what

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:37.089 
open up the internal audit template what
we<00:01:35.330> see<00:01:35.539> there<00:01:35.569> is<00:01:35.959> a<00:01:35.989> standardized<00:01:36.619> templer

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:37.099 
we see there is a standardized templer

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.839 
we see there is a standardized templer
which<00:01:37.280> is<00:01:37.429> used<00:01:37.640> for<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.479> majority<00:01:38.780> of

00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:39.849 
which is used for the majority of

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.870 
which is used for the majority of

a<00:01:55.550> mouthful<00:01:57.129> these<00:01:58.129> procedures<00:01:58.640> yes<00:01:58.849> they're

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
a mouthful these procedures yes they're

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.999 
a mouthful these procedures yes they're
documented<00:01:59.479> you<00:01:59.750> can<00:01:59.899> see<00:02:00.110> that<00:02:00.319> in<00:02:00.440> a<00:02:00.530> basic

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
documented you can see that in a basic

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.770 
documented you can see that in a basic
flow<00:02:01.220> chart<00:02:01.550> format<00:02:01.970> but<00:02:02.509> they're<00:02:02.629> also

flow chart format but they're also
interactive<00:02:03.849> from<00:02:04.849> the<00:02:05.000> procedure<00:02:05.330> we<00:02:05.599> can

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
interactive from the procedure we can

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.229 
interactive from the procedure we can
open<00:02:05.899> up<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.170> audit<00:02:06.979> schedule<00:02:07.459> and<00:02:08.119> that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
open up the audit schedule and that

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.380 
open up the audit schedule and that
you'll<00:02:08.450> come<00:02:08.660> up<00:02:08.750> in<00:02:08.929> a<00:02:08.989> few<00:02:09.140> moments<00:02:09.319> and<00:02:10.390> then

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
you'll come up in a few moments and then

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.089 
you'll come up in a few moments and then
we<00:02:11.510> can<00:02:11.690> see<00:02:11.870> the<00:02:11.989> internal<00:02:12.410> audit<00:02:12.680> program

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
we can see the internal audit program

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.830 
we can see the internal audit program
for<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.340> business<00:02:13.670> let's<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:14.599> have<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.780> look

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
for the business let's just have a look

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.240 
for the business let's just have a look
at<00:02:15.519> internal<00:02:16.519> audit<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:18.680> internal<00:02:19.040> audit<00:02:19.190> is

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
at internal audit the internal audit is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.770 
at internal audit the internal audit is
linked<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> program<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.330> we<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.599> go

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
linked to the program so we can go

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.869 
linked to the program so we can go
straight<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.230> an<00:02:21.470> electronic<00:02:21.890> record<00:02:22.489> which

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
straight to an electronic record which
