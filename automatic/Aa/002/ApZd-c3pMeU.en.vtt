00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:13.410
 I marcilei home that was beauty I am luiz 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.449
 goalkeeper does not see and now even with a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 blog new address and www.skol.com.br 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.650
 cocaleiro does not win but I do not either 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.779
 I just wanted to put things on books in the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.400
 blog the pt in the state that does not give in the tile 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.199
 so that's why I ended up doing the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.109
 interest is also why I ended up 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.600
 changing the channel's blog name a lot 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.010
 people asked to have powers and took 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.410
 The goalkeeper does not see I'm actually going 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.989
 let this middle passion not read 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.180
 but when you talk of books in 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.180
 truth in a large part of the content 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.730
 in the channel will continue being of books 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.760
 But I wanted to expand the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.320
 channel horizons and power has room 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.629
 actually to talk a little bit about 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.610
 other things that are not only 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.890
 books so I ended up changing the name 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:04.019
 then the blog went in there and gives a 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:06.119
 checked later is www.skype.com I already 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.700
 had created a first blog number 1 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.000
 some time but just for lack 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.680
 of time I really liked it there and I 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.619
 I was too lazy to get a server 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 but now our dear blogger of ours 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.299
 each day he will stay there again 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 indefinitely but finally speaking 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.950
 about the book also talk here with 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.979
 you today is the book the girl from 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.560
 valley of the delpech height and now if me 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.030
 ask luiz you like 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.159
 self-help books have never seen you 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.470
 commenting on self - help books 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.450
 here on the channel I like yes actually I 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.270
 I think some books really are 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.159
 It seems that writing to sell even 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.259
 end up helping people 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.600
 but rather pushes no addition 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.060
 there are some books that are very good and that 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.560
 You can even open our heads to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.350
 things we had not thought of 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.600
 before, as is the case for example of a 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.329
 monk and the executive has many people who 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.549
 reminiscent of about 16 500 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.930
 Together with prejudice against more 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.179
 man I had a leadership and 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.709
 after they book here very large 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.240
 even because it is based on that 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.670
 what is a thing of being 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.800
 he leads and that kind of thing that 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.480
 I do it a lot and I even intend to 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.090
 make a series of books that I 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.740
 I recommend self - help here for the channel 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.750
 I have another marketing book . 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.230
 personal I want to comment with you too 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.090
 and today it 's the bell girl's turn 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.120
 foot if I knew this book here 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.350
 through some form of the young nerd who 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.970
 did a series of nerdcast about 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.920
 entrepreneurship which is something that I 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.950
 I really miss that one day I really want 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.530
 be a successful entrepreneur 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.710
 who knows, but one of the guests of a 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.050
 of these nerdcast was the august fable 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.810
 creditor of the generation of value that 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.310
 started a youtube channel that 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.070
 propagated this knowledge of the 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.230
 entrepreneurship and he grew up 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.050
 much on the channel because it was too firey 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.370
 in his life whatsapp including me 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.690
 I have a book. It was with a friend. 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.580
 I want to show that the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.710
 also in one of these 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.020
 videos from his channel he ended up paying 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.870
 the interview with delpech which was a 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.810
 agony studying in SÃ£o Paulo and 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.010
 just to work or study in and 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.950
 marketing no mit no macho x institute of 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.290
 something like that and there 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.080
 who revolutionized himself on this issue 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.780
 technology and the stages are 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.880
 innovative companies that principle has 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.460
 a lot of potential to grow to create 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.500
 innovative products and that's when I 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.880
 I loved the story of the feet dell 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.100
 because the process would not be very 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.200
 smart, very hardworking man who runs 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.790
 behind what she thinks will work out 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.190
 and we do not talk when you end up paying and 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.710
 decides to read her book and one of the points 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.790
 legal in this pass book is that the 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.730
 The first thing she did was 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:00.060
 availability available in and butt 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.460
 To the galera download for free and with what is 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.770
 the story of her that she had to tell 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.960
 and unfortunately this was something that 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.420
 somewhat disappointed in the 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.459
 book I found I bought it thinking 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.500
 this is a book that will be 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.570
 really this life trajectory of her 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.000
 Since how she studied here in Brazil. 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.160
 Even as I went there in Haiti. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.560
 working in the Valley 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.320
 silicon hence the name the girl of the valley and the 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.060
 book is over 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.530
 relying on this part of 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.520
 autobiography that was what really 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.650
 interested more pulling more to the side 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.770
 and how to get started 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.110
 teza to create your company than 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.210
 showing the history of the bell really 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.040
 This feeling a little bit more but this one. 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.320
 book is very good mainly because 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.480
 it can be downloaded for free at 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.510
 internet and even a physical version 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.060
 that they should stop here because 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.980
 I think ten dollars with fred gave type 14 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.140
 Ray let's meet him and he brings 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.590

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.670
 with stories of successful cases that 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.950
 started out of nothing with this spirit 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.990
 entrepreneur and today has multi companies 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.720
 millionaires and in addition it also gives 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.880
 Several tips from other books to read 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.710
 more specific in the case 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.830
 I really wanted this book that 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.930
 as a manual on how to be proactive in 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.850
 your professional life 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.280
 You do not have to want a company to 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.110
 use the tips that abel from the book to 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.990
 mine you can use your 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.060
 professional life in various ways that 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.100
 sure will bring you much more 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.830
 success than if you stay in that 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.600
 endless loop of just working for 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.490
 get the money at the end of the month 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.400

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.890
 even a book that contains tips on 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.140
 how to become more proactive in your 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.820

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.370
 very cheap also in relation to 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.740
 degradation of the book the first book was 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.860

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.150
 practical is a pretty good one is a book 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.040
 which I think is worth you have in 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.140
 shelf but with a form of 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.730
