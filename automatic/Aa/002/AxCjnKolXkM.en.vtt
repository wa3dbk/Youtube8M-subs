00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.219 
race exhaust
it's<00:01:14.549> definitely<00:01:14.729> noticeably<00:01:15.659> louder<00:01:15.810> than

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it's definitely noticeably louder than

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.060 
it's definitely noticeably louder than
the<00:01:16.950> stock<00:01:17.250> exhaust<00:01:18.380> but<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> nice

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the stock exhaust but it's it's a nice

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.490 
the stock exhaust but it's it's a nice
sound<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.460> not<00:01:20.840> kind<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> high-pitched

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
sound it's not kind of the high-pitched

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.920 
sound it's not kind of the high-pitched
whining<00:01:22.950> noise<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.850> get<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.119> some<00:01:24.330> sport

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
whining noise that you get on some sport

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.920 
whining noise that you get on some sport
bike<00:01:25.080> exhausts<00:01:26.090> one<00:01:27.090> thing<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.390> will<00:01:27.570> point<00:01:27.600> out

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
bike exhausts one thing I will point out

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.100 
bike exhausts one thing I will point out
is<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:29.009> exhaust<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.670> longer<00:01:30.299> than<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.810> stock

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
is this exhaust is longer than the stock

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.740 
is this exhaust is longer than the stock
so<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.250> actually<00:01:32.400> does<00:01:32.759> come<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.090> contact<00:01:33.119> with

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
so it actually does come in contact with

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.600 
so it actually does come in contact with
the<00:01:34.579> rear<00:01:35.579> blinker<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:37.040> it<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.280> get<00:01:38.430> hot

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the rear blinker and it can get hot

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.359 
the rear blinker and it can get hot
enough<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> damage<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:40.409> blinker<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:41.189> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
enough to damage the blinker that's a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.160 
enough to damage the blinker that's a
unknown<00:01:41.850> concern<00:01:42.479> unknown<00:01:43.170> problem<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> upon

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
unknown concern unknown problem so upon

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
but he says it does make a noticeable

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.530 
but he says it does make a noticeable
improvement<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.770> will<00:02:02.460> say<00:02:02.700> upon<00:02:03.119> riding<00:02:03.450> at

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
improvement I will say upon riding at

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.130 
improvement I will say upon riding at
home<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:05.420> you<00:02:06.420> know<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.540> stopped<00:02:06.869> at<00:02:07.049> her

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
home that you know I stopped at her

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.499 
home that you know I stopped at her
light<00:02:07.350> gave<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.129> plenty<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.550> snot<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.090> I

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
light gave it plenty of snot and I

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.710 
light gave it plenty of snot and I
didn't<00:02:09.750> really<00:02:09.869> drop<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> clutch<00:02:11.390> but<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.599> was

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
didn't really drop the clutch but it was

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.880 
didn't really drop the clutch but it was
probably<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.140> first<00:02:13.170> time<00:02:13.470> ever

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
probably the first time ever

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.160 
probably the first time ever
that<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.700> front<00:02:14.940> wheel<00:02:15.090> did<00:02:15.750> actually<00:02:15.990> come

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
that the front wheel did actually come

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.770 
that the front wheel did actually come
up<00:02:16.380> slightly<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.670> I've<00:02:17.940> never<00:02:18.150> experienced

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
up slightly and I've never experienced

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.420 
up slightly and I've never experienced
that<00:02:18.870> before<00:02:19.050> with<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.770> with<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.220> stock

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
that before with the with the stock

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.400 
that before with the with the stock
exhaust<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.780> stock<00:02:22.050> set<00:02:22.680> up<00:02:24.170> went<00:02:25.170> out<00:02:25.260> on

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
exhaust and the stock set up went out on

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.410 
exhaust and the stock set up went out on
the<00:02:25.530> highway<00:02:25.890> throttle<00:02:26.490> response<00:02:26.700> certainly

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
the highway throttle response certainly

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.590 
the highway throttle response certainly
seems<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:27.900> improved<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:29.090> yeah<00:02:30.090> there<00:02:30.480> is

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
seems to have improved and yeah there is

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.300 
seems to have improved and yeah there is
a<00:02:30.630> noticeable<00:02:31.170> kick<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.830> noticeable

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
a noticeable kick a noticeable

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.230 
a noticeable kick a noticeable
improvement<00:02:32.850> over<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.410> stock<00:02:34.680> exhaust<00:02:35.400> so

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
improvement over the stock exhaust so

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.900 
improvement over the stock exhaust so
just<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.320> short<00:02:37.560> video<00:02:37.709> just<00:02:38.400> wanted<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.790> let
