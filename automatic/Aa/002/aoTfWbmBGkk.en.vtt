and<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.709> did<00:03:48.920> think<00:03:49.220> after<00:03:49.670> actually<00:03:50.030> after<00:03:50.329> I'd

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
and I did think after actually after I'd

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.390 
and I did think after actually after I'd
made<00:03:50.780> this<00:03:51.139> that<00:03:51.350> you<00:03:51.500> could<00:03:51.620> probably<00:03:51.799> stamp

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
made this that you could probably stamp

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.830

and<00:03:52.639> put<00:03:52.790> something<00:03:53.030> on<00:03:53.299> there<00:03:53.480> maybe<00:03:53.720> a

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
and put something on there maybe a

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.500 
and put something on there maybe a
little<00:03:54.049> greeting<00:03:54.230> so<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.680> pops<00:03:54.889> open<00:03:55.510> but

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510
