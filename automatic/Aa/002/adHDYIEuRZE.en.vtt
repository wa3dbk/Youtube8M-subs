00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.810
 normally the engine interview does not 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.760
 we make value judgments about the design 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.840
 of the vehicles 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.520
 but in the case of the test d 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.370
 from today 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.200
 let's make an exception and that is 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.840
 for us 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:47.100
 the infiniti fx is probably the sun 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.100
 most beautiful segment 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.129
 It's hard for us to say this because the 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.129
 design is something 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.520
 is very relative to everyone can you 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.100
 Like one thing I may like another 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.830
 each one we have some tastes but we 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.270
 let's get wet for the fx has always 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.159
 liked the infiniti designs 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:16.219
 the fx was the first vehicle of the new 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.219
 of the new image of infinity with that 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.710
 design so organic and so burgos or that 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.409
 has captivated so many clients in the 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.359
 world in the usa and japan mainly 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.870
 but in Europe it was the first vehicle in 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.660
 reach and mark 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.630
 mark a milestone because it was the most car 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.030
 striking of its segment 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.369
 and what is still this new version has 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.150
 improved what I had has improved a 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:46.600
 little the grill has improved 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.640
 the headlights and has improved those points 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.350
 where he had stayed a little longer 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.350
 back in terms of brand image 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.770
 and the truth is that the whole can not 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.020
 be better 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.700
 we have received all the comments 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.060
 that we received during the test 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.690
 this vehicle none has been negative 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.330
 and everything has been flattering towards making the 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.970
 aesthetics of consumption independently 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.500
 that apart also very well done in 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.560
 a luxury car 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.700
 It is a car that draws attention for its 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.960
 image image of sporty off - road 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.960
 low width 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.740
 the version we tested is the 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:50.500
 and for him the engine of an origin 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:53.910
 renault izan is the 3 liter diesel v6 d 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.750
 of modern manufacture that hardly carries 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.470
 two years in the market 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.810
 and in its engines in which the alliance 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.410
 invested 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.960
 4 years ago 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.580
 in the design and implementation of 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.090
 draft 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.760
 It is a very modern engine 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.200
 what's wrong with it 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.530
 It has different power ranges 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.200
 according to contain it and Solomon 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.410
 land the mountains infinity like 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.940
 nissan luxury brand 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.650
 and it's a motor that moves with a lot 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.650
 sufficiency over the years 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.879
 efe 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.650
 dynamically it is a very sacred vehicle 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:52.280
 it's not because so much in this sea its 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.980
 pensions like brake management 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.030
 and the tires you ride are 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.180
 designed for sportsmanship 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.660
 we can be very comfortable with him but with 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.360
 just press on the key 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.560
 and we find a car that 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.490
 it balances very little 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.760
 and that seems 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.100
 and is actually much more agile than 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.890
 that the figures involve us let's not forget 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.230
 that has a considerable weight and that 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.230
 It has very large vehicle dimensions 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.180
 changes that is associated with v6 of 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.790
 transmetro 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.100
 and it's the fx dolphin 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.790
 It is a gearbox seven 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.790
 relations 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:53.970
 with sequential handling through 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:59.040
 the control of the console or with some cams 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:01.460
 of magnesium located fixed in the column 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.460
 of erection 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.280
 the operating strategy of the 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.280
 Gearbox is pretty good 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.720
 It is very easy to use the car in 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.250
 automatic changes are made as 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.100
 maximum to four thousand five hundred 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:25.100
 revolutions and sports handling 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.169
 the change is made at about 4 thousand 800 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.259
 revolutions 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.870
 may not seem enough but more 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.509
 beyond four thousand 800 revolutions of 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.610
 engine does not offer much more is 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.409
 necessary to cure them 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.659
 to have some good ones 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.659
 benefits and in this case we have them 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.129
 ah 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.560
 ah
