00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.040
 tradition tomato 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.710
 onion lemon is my favorite blue 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:47.850
 I have a blue cheese 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:50.640
 Adam Daikon Egg Salad Very Hot Sauce 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.160
 Jalapeno is my favorite Dijon 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.910
 grainy mustard fish sauce 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.790

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.180
 Of course, cutlet for your convenience, I 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.670
 preliminary kneaded chopped up 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.520
 froze and now she is in this 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.030
 the form 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.380
 2 beer will be more exact 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.990
 light unfiltered beer 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.360
 but one of the main ingredients of ours 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.899
 burger but today he has onion rings in 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.200
 klyare 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:28.700
 for batter we need an egg 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:33.050
 but for now the yolk and white we divide 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.050
 quickly beat the protein to a thick foam 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.979
 ready let's check 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.399
 I pour out a bowl with a yolk and 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.349
 a couple of tablespoons of flour there sypim 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.349
 further pour beer here 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.460
 if liquid add flour if thick 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:59.740
 add all the beer just like that 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.580
 consistency just enter our batter 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.580
 whipped protein 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:15.200
 and very gently gently mix to 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:19.780
 the squirrels have not settled 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.780
 not autumn, we cut onions into rings 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:33.260
 so share 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:35.170
 not bad yet a moment add flour 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.760
 paprika 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.970
 mix we take rings and roll in 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.970
 flour 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.709
 the next step of the ring we throw in the batter and 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:53.739
 drown them there so that the batter is completely stuck 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.739
 and now in breadcrumbs 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:08.049
 further we fry our onion rings in 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:11.629
 deep-fried rings ready 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:16.700
 crafty I mean so so so 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:20.569
 such crisp onion we make sauce 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:28.690
 Caesar for our burger yolk mustard 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:28.690
 juice 1 3 lemon salt whisk as usual 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.930
 butter a little caesar sauce will turn out 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.629
 me now without parmesan 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.810
 will be more like mayonnaise sauce but 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.670
 this is what i need so something like 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.209
 the truth 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.829
 add a few drops of fish sauce 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.930
 a few drops in the stars and sauce 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.769
 a few drops of this miracle a string 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:05.269
 but I just will not hurt 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:07.340
 stir the sauce ready to fry the patties on 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.099
 what were they pre-freezing for 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:15.440
 so that they do not fall apart during frying 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:19.419
 since they are very thin burgers almost 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.419
 ready to do like this 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:35.639
 blue cheese on top put on a one-on 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:39.080
 one cutlet here is put bacon let 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.080
 fry a little 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:58.099
 and so in the end we have a fried bun 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:02.360
 Caesar dressing lettuce 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:08.300

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:13.629

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.629
 chop went edam cheese 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:24.439
 slices over fried bacon ketchup 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.610
 our onion rings in batter from the new 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:29.689
 lettuce leaves 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:34.729
 our double circular and bacon burger 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:37.729

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.800

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.330
 Well, so I called it seemingly price 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.639
 must be very weighty but despite 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.440
 my views the cost of such 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:03.319
 handsome turned 153 rubles 50 kopecks 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.969
 but I will tell you pleasantly surprised given 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:07.509
 burger is worth it to be 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:10.279
 manufactured home 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:13.639
