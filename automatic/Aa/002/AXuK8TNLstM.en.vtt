tones<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.720> thing<00:02:28.900> about<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.380> is

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
tones to it and the thing about this is

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.190 
tones to it and the thing about this is
it's<00:02:30.340> very<00:02:30.400> easy<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.880> apply<00:02:31.180> just<00:02:31.630> putting<00:02:32.110> a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
it's very easy to apply just putting a

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.570 
it's very easy to apply just putting a
kind<00:02:32.800> of<00:02:32.830> like<00:02:32.980> in<00:02:33.130> bowl<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:36.100> got<00:02:36.340> caught
