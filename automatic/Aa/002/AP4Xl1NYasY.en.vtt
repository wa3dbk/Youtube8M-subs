00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149 

I<00:00:00.060> love<00:00:00.750> the<00:00:00.870> way<00:00:01.050> transition<00:00:01.680> being<00:00:01.890> done

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
I love the way transition being done

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.600 
I love the way transition being done
let's<00:00:03.149> check<00:00:03.389> out<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.720> breaking<00:00:04.140> breath

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.760 

the<00:00:09.970> three<00:00:10.210> important<00:00:10.660> things<00:00:10.720> here<00:00:11.170> are<00:00:11.410> when

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
the three important things here are when

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.209 
the three important things here are when
to<00:00:11.920> steer<00:00:12.160> in<00:00:12.420> when<00:00:13.420> to<00:00:13.540> shift<00:00:13.750> down<00:00:13.900> and<00:00:14.559> how

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
to steer in when to shift down and how

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.910 
to steer in when to shift down and how
long<00:00:15.459> a<00:00:15.490> keep<00:00:15.879> breaking<00:00:16.439> these<00:00:17.439> are<00:00:17.619> the<00:00:17.680> three

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
long a keep breaking these are the three

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.310 
long a keep breaking these are the three
most<00:00:18.130> important<00:00:18.640> factors<00:00:21.210> okay<00:00:22.210> third<00:00:23.080> gear

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
most important factors okay third gear

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.580 
most important factors okay third gear
and<00:00:23.950> I'm<00:00:24.070> stepping<00:00:24.460> on<00:00:24.550> it<00:00:24.730> I'm<00:00:25.090> speeding<00:00:25.779> then

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
and I'm stepping on it I'm speeding then

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.769 
and I'm stepping on it I'm speeding then
break<00:00:27.060> how<00:00:28.060> much<00:00:28.240> you<00:00:28.390> break<00:00:28.720> is<00:00:29.140> crucial<00:00:30.779> if

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:31.779 
break how much you break is crucial if

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.479 
break how much you break is crucial if
you<00:00:31.960> kill<00:00:32.199> the<00:00:32.320> speed<00:00:32.529> too<00:00:32.800> much<00:00:33.010> you'll<00:00:33.309> end

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
you kill the speed too much you'll end

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.340 
you kill the speed too much you'll end
up<00:00:33.610> stopping<00:00:34.030> before<00:00:34.540> you<00:00:34.629> drift<00:00:34.900> like<00:00:35.110> this

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
up stopping before you drift like this

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.070 
up stopping before you drift like this
and<00:00:35.620> with<00:00:36.280> understeer<00:00:36.790> so<00:00:37.510> you'll<00:00:37.870> need<00:00:38.019> a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
and with understeer so you'll need a

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.990 
and with understeer so you'll need a
fair<00:00:38.350> amount<00:00:38.470> of<00:00:38.680> speed<00:00:38.980> even<00:00:39.460> when<00:00:39.699> you<00:00:39.790> begin

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
fair amount of speed even when you begin

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.170 
fair amount of speed even when you begin
breaking<00:00:40.470> slow<00:00:41.470> down<00:00:41.650> to<00:00:41.799> about<00:00:42.010> 70%<00:00:42.699> on<00:00:43.120> the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
breaking slow down to about 70% on the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.590 
breaking slow down to about 70% on the
straightaway<00:00:43.659> and<00:00:43.989> then<00:00:44.290> let<00:00:44.530> go<00:00:45.180> let<00:00:46.180> go<00:00:46.449> of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
straightaway and then let go let go of

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.289 
straightaway and then let go let go of
the<00:00:46.720> brake<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:47.170> steer<00:00:47.650> into<00:00:47.979> the<00:00:48.070> corner<00:00:48.489> here

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.299 
the brake and steer into the corner here

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:50.939 
the brake and steer into the corner here
you're<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.809> little<00:00:50.140> over<00:00:50.379> speed

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
you're a little over speed

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.710 
you're a little over speed
if<00:00:51.430> you<00:00:51.610> break<00:00:51.790> through<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.210> corner<00:00:52.540> you'll

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
if you break through the corner you'll

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.750 
if you break through the corner you'll
end<00:00:52.839> up<00:00:52.930> with<00:00:53.080> understeer<00:00:53.589> so<00:00:53.920> first<00:00:54.460> break

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
end up with understeer so first break

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.570 
end up with understeer so first break
and<00:00:55.059> then<00:00:55.390> turn<00:00:55.659> heel<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.650> toe<00:00:56.799> and<00:00:57.070> steer<00:00:57.309> in

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
and then turn heel and toe and steer in

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.549 
and then turn heel and toe and steer in
towards<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.000> clipping<00:00:58.330> point<00:00:58.510> you'll<00:00:59.409> be

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
towards the clipping point you'll be

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.710 
towards the clipping point you'll be
over<00:00:59.799> speeding<00:01:00.040> here<00:01:00.369> as<00:01:00.430> well<00:01:00.640> then<00:01:01.570> you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
over speeding here as well then you

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.570 
over speeding here as well then you
shift<00:01:01.960> down<00:01:02.049> to<00:01:02.290> second<00:01:02.650> gear<00:01:02.830> while<00:01:03.190> leaving

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
shift down to second gear while leaving

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.730 
shift down to second gear while leaving
your<00:01:03.790> foot<00:01:04.119> on<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.540> brake<00:01:07.320> let's<00:01:08.320> say<00:01:08.500> you're

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
your foot on the brake let's say you're

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.460 
your foot on the brake let's say you're
running<00:01:08.920> around<00:01:09.420> 5,500<00:01:10.420> revs<00:01:10.659> when<00:01:11.049> you<00:01:11.170> shift

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
running around 5,500 revs when you shift

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.920 
running around 5,500 revs when you shift
down<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:11.920> second<00:01:12.280> gear<00:01:12.520> release<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.660> clutch

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
down to second gear release the clutch

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.620 
down to second gear release the clutch
like<00:01:14.260> you're<00:01:14.440> running<00:01:14.680> around<00:01:14.880> 5400<00:01:15.880> Reds<00:01:16.090> but

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
like you're running around 5400 Reds but

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.320 
like you're running around 5400 Reds but
don't<00:01:16.900> let<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.290> gears<00:01:17.530> lock<00:01:17.830> it's<00:01:18.760> similar<00:01:19.120> to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
don't let the gears lock it's similar to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.720 
don't let the gears lock it's similar to
shift<00:01:19.750> block<00:01:20.050> drifting<00:01:20.590> but<00:01:21.220> you<00:01:21.370> don't<00:01:21.520> lock

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
shift block drifting but you don't lock

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.010 
shift block drifting but you don't lock
the<00:01:21.970> rear<00:01:22.120> tires<00:01:22.510> with<00:01:22.870> braking<00:01:25.020> anyhow

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
the rear tires with braking anyhow

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.100 
the rear tires with braking anyhow
that's<00:01:26.800> how<00:01:27.010> I<00:01:27.070> do

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
that's how I do

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.040 
that's how I do
sometimes<00:01:29.010> I<00:01:29.190> drift<00:01:29.520> by<00:01:29.700> only<00:01:29.880> breaking<00:01:30.360> light

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
sometimes I drift by only breaking light

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.050 
sometimes I drift by only breaking light
through<00:01:31.590> corners<00:01:32.070> where<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.610> enter<00:01:32.760> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
through corners where I can enter and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.630 
through corners where I can enter and
exit<00:01:33.330> in<00:01:33.420> second<00:01:33.810> gear<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.260> step<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.370> brakes

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
exit in second gear I step on the brakes

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.480 
exit in second gear I step on the brakes
leave<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.720> brakes<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.200> then<00:01:37.830> turn<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.370> I

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
leave the brakes on then turn and I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
leave the brakes on then turn and I
brake<00:01:38.730> once<00:01:38.970> again<00:01:39.270> towards<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.990> clipping

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
brake once again towards the clipping

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.550 
brake once again towards the clipping
point<00:01:40.520> then<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.640> car<00:01:41.850> starts<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.300> slide<00:01:42.600> with

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
point then the car starts to slide with

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.340 
point then the car starts to slide with
this<00:01:43.800> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.220> drifting<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.570> concentrate<00:01:46.170> on

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
this kind of drifting and concentrate on

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.260 
this kind of drifting and concentrate on

next up is the fake trip where you

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:45.540 
next up is the fake trip where you

just<00:02:48.220> by<00:02:48.400> breaking<00:02:48.850> you<00:02:49.360> shift<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.870> weight

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
just by breaking you shift the weight

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:58.880 
just by breaking you shift the weight
with<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.290> faint<00:02:50.650> movement

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
quickly steer like this and at this

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.520 
quickly steer like this and at this
point<00:03:01.980> my<00:03:02.280> foot<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.850> off<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.150> gas<00:03:03.330> when<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:04.410> took

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
point my foot is off the gas when I took

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.100 
point my foot is off the gas when I took
the<00:03:04.830> car<00:03:05.070> like<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.880> car<00:03:06.450> bounces<00:03:06.870> back

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
the car like this the car bounces back

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.500 
the car like this the car bounces back
with<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.560> weight<00:03:07.820> that's<00:03:08.820> when<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> step<00:03:09.360> on

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
with the weight that's when I step on

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.050 
with the weight that's when I step on
the<00:03:09.630> gas<00:03:09.750> pedal<00:03:10.070> it's<00:03:11.070> just<00:03:11.400> like<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.700> pendulum

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
the gas pedal it's just like a pendulum

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.330 
the gas pedal it's just like a pendulum
and<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.900> use<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.290> return<00:03:13.650> force<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.160> make

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
and you use that return force to make

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.510 
and you use that return force to make
the<00:03:14.520> weight<00:03:14.730> transition<00:03:15.800> over<00:03:16.800> here<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.310> I've

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
the weight transition over here to I've

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.820 
the weight transition over here to I've
stepped<00:03:17.820> on<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.120> gas<00:03:18.150> all<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.260> way<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.800> a

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
stepped on the gas all the way for a

stepped on the gas all the way for a
second<00:03:20.310> okay<00:03:20.850> for<00:03:21.270> I<00:03:21.300> let<00:03:21.690> go<00:03:21.930> in<00:03:22.890> order<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.400> get

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
second okay for I let go in order to get

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.290 
second okay for I let go in order to get
the<00:03:23.760> car<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.060> slide<00:03:24.709> once<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.920> car<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.280> inside

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
the car to slide once the car is inside

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.530 
the car to slide once the car is inside
release<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.440> foot<00:03:28.650> from<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:28.980> gas<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:32.540> used

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
release the foot from the gas and I used

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.350 
release the foot from the gas and I used
to<00:03:33.630> do<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.020> lot<00:03:34.610> if<00:03:35.610> you're<00:03:35.820> going<00:03:36.060> too

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
to do this a lot if you're going too

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.270 
to do this a lot if you're going too
slow<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.930> have<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.230> step<00:03:37.500> on<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.680> gas<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.130> make

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
slow you have to step on the gas to make

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.160 
slow you have to step on the gas to make
it<00:03:38.400> happen<00:03:38.610> but<00:03:39.209> if<00:03:39.330> you're<00:03:39.510> going<00:03:39.720> fast

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
it happen but if you're going fast

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.960 
it happen but if you're going fast
enough<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.770> get<00:03:41.070> her<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.580> left<00:03:41.730> and

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
enough and get her to the left and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.150 
enough and get her to the left and
quickly<00:03:42.450> steer<00:03:42.750> back<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.260> right<00:03:43.500> your

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
quickly steer back to the right your

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.300 
quickly steer back to the right your
tail<00:03:44.489> will<00:03:44.730> automatically<00:03:45.390> start<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.780> slide

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
tail will automatically start to slide

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.490 
tail will automatically start to slide
but<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.340> know<00:03:47.550> I<00:03:48.150> wasn't<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.989> good<00:03:49.230> back

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
but you know I wasn't that good back

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.830 
but you know I wasn't that good back
then<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:50.130> my<00:03:50.370> car<00:03:50.790> would<00:03:51.030> lose<00:03:51.209> speed<00:03:51.480> while<00:03:51.810> I

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
then so my car would lose speed while I

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.650 
then so my car would lose speed while I
was<00:03:52.050> doing<00:03:52.200> all<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:53.090> that's<00:03:54.090> when<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.420> learned

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
was doing all that that's when I learned

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.510 
was doing all that that's when I learned
to<00:03:54.840> give<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.110> car<00:03:55.290> some<00:03:55.530> gas<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:56.040> make<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.220> car

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
to give the car some gas to make the car

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.750 
to give the car some gas to make the car
slowly<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:58.140> drift<00:03:58.470> even<00:03:59.370> at<00:03:59.550> such

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
slowly so that I can drift even at such

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.449 
slowly so that I can drift even at such
speeds<00:04:00.470> because<00:04:01.470> of<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.739> inertial<00:04:02.190> force

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
speeds because of the inertial force

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.670 
speeds because of the inertial force
from<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.880> faint<00:04:03.150> action<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:04.260> freaking

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
from the faint action the freaking

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.080 
from the faint action the freaking
doesn't<00:04:05.010> have<00:04:05.100> to<00:04:05.220> be<00:04:05.310> as<00:04:05.430> strong<00:04:05.670> as<00:04:05.940> the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
doesn't have to be as strong as the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.300 
doesn't have to be as strong as the
braking<00:04:06.480> track<00:04:06.720> it's<00:04:07.380> all<00:04:07.620> physics<00:04:08.100> and

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
braking track it's all physics and

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.280 
braking track it's all physics and
dynamics<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.600> rhythm<00:04:09.930> of<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.110> right

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
dynamics but the rhythm of the right

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:34.219 
dynamics but the rhythm of the right
foot<00:04:10.560> is<00:04:10.890> always<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.519> same

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.050 

okay<00:04:35.229> shall<00:04:35.680> we<00:04:35.770> try<00:04:36.009> this<00:04:36.069> dynamic<00:04:36.669> drifting

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
okay shall we try this dynamic drifting

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.020 
okay shall we try this dynamic drifting
this<00:04:37.930> one's<00:04:38.139> pretty<00:04:38.380> difficult<00:04:38.650> so<00:04:39.220> even

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
this one's pretty difficult so even

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.879 
this one's pretty difficult so even
professional<00:04:40.599> racing<00:04:40.810> drivers<00:04:41.259> like<00:04:41.410> us<00:04:41.440> can

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
professional racing drivers like us can

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.159 
professional racing drivers like us can
always<00:04:42.190> get<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.460> right

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
always get it right

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.540 
always get it right
drifting<00:04:44.169> begins<00:04:44.560> from<00:04:44.889> stepping<00:04:45.280> off<00:04:45.400> the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550

you release the gas your tails slide

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:46.950 
you release the gas your tails slide

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
full speed by releasing the throttle you

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.589 
full speed by releasing the throttle you
can<00:06:08.860> initiate<00:06:09.130> the<00:06:09.430> tail<00:06:09.639> slide<00:06:09.910> from<00:06:10.419> there

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:10.599 
can initiate the tail slide from there

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.089 
can initiate the tail slide from there
it's<00:06:10.930> just<00:06:11.139> the<00:06:11.259> counter<00:06:11.590> steering<00:06:11.889> and

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
it's just the counter steering and

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:13.620 
it's just the counter steering and
stepping<00:06:12.460> on<00:06:12.550> the<00:06:12.639> gas<00:06:12.759> again<00:06:13.090> at<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.300> exit

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
stepping on the gas again at the exit

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.170 
stepping on the gas again at the exit
and<00:06:14.319> that's<00:06:14.500> what<00:06:14.770> I<00:06:14.800> call<00:06:15.190> the<00:06:15.400> dynamic<00:06:15.580> drift

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
and that's what I call the dynamic drift

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.450 
and that's what I call the dynamic drift
this<00:06:16.810> is<00:06:16.990> an<00:06:17.139> example<00:06:17.440> of<00:06:17.620> not<00:06:17.830> how<00:06:18.039> he<00:06:18.099> stepped

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
this is an example of not how he stepped

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.640 
this is an example of not how he stepped
off<00:06:18.550> the<00:06:18.729> gas<00:06:18.940> but<00:06:19.599> how<00:06:19.720> soon<00:06:19.930> she<00:06:20.110> was<00:06:20.289> able<00:06:20.470> to

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
off the gas but how soon she was able to

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.620 
off the gas but how soon she was able to
avoid<00:06:21.009> crashing<00:06:21.550> his<00:06:22.180> lightning-quick

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
avoid crashing his lightning-quick

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:32.390 
avoid crashing his lightning-quick
steering<00:06:23.229> work<00:06:23.410> is<00:06:23.740> simply<00:06:24.160> unbelievable

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.430

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 
so that was dynamic drifting which is

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.740
