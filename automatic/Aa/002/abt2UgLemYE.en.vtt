you can add too I just find that the dry
mix<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.439> better<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:06.000> use<00:01:06.150> paint<00:01:06.420> pigments

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
mix is better you can use paint pigments

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.590 
mix is better you can use paint pigments

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
lumpy err because we did it by hand and

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.350 
lumpy err because we did it by hand and
then<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.710> mix<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.280> we're<00:01:59.940> mixing<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
be eating this even though it's

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.370 
be eating this even though it's
non-toxic<00:02:09.240> I<00:02:09.660> don't<00:02:10.050> think<00:02:10.260> it's<00:02:10.380> very<00:02:10.440> tasty

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
non-toxic I don't think it's very tasty

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.980 
non-toxic I don't think it's very tasty
once<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.530> have<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.860> mixed<00:02:14.400> up<00:02:14.550> all<00:02:15.480> together

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
once we have that mixed up all together
