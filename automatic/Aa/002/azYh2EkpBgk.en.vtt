 more on point is for it in the video 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.900
 tutorial of today we will explain 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.840
 how to extract from a photograph the 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.970
 parts that interest us for 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.680
 later apply it to one of 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.680
 our templates or for 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.690
 insert it in any photograph to 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.350
 we will do the following we are going here in 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.860
 file open and we're going to open this 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.990
 image the one that we have and we go now 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.780
 let's go here to adjust the screen 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:04.170
 with the magnifying tool adjust the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.180
 screen there is a one tool that 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.590
 comes in the version of photoshop cs3 that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.170
 is this that is here is called 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.760
 quick selection tool there is one that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.670
 is the tool to edit the magic 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.170
 and another quick selection tool and 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.790
 we click on the selection tool 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.950
 fast this tool 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.100
 when you chop here it appears in the part 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.100
 higher 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.509
 a series of and with milestones 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.150
 2b and the even the brush size to 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.880
 move a brush size 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.960
 well more or less than 89 px 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.579
 in this type of image and notice that 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.310
 a circle appears inside with a 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.650
 more symbol you see it and if I peak the letter 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.780
 heart 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.160
 this symbol more now when I work 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.860
 with it it will become less symbol 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.700
 well then 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.530
 look at this image 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.750
 I have a tool selection 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.479
 quick and applied him here look like 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.750
 they appear as the little ants see them 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.890
 notice that now another click a double click 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.569
 and it looked 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.980
 well then he gave another click and already 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.400
 automatically it is already contributing the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.800
 body of the civic girl around here is already 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:30.760
 notice that automatically 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.760
 the program is practically already putting 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.120
 just where I am interested, the best is 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.400
 make some cuts where I'm 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.489
 selecting he does it as a way 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.640
 automatic with the large lupita here 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.400
 and here yes now it poked again in 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.790
 quick selection tool and in the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.459
 size how low to apply it here 7 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.010
 from a mouse click and it's just 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.409
 select and now here modifying 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.319
 that you will become familiar with this 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.829
 tool look now I just chopped and 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.389
 what I just did is then 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.209
 select the arm and as I do not 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.370
 interested in I give you step back edition and 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.790
 I leave it as I can use a 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.790
 a little more 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.750
 and here I can still lower a bit 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.100
 plus 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.410
 selecting the tool again 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:27.060
 quick selection by lowering the brush by 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.069
 example to 7 px and I'm doing it like that 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.740
 I had 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.950
 for example 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.020
 let's apply the magnifying glass tool 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.410
 we adjust the screen to see it 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.860
 in a fast way for example also 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.690
 with the quick selection tool you see 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.240
 that the symbol is placed more if I 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.730
 I press the alternative key and left it 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.920
 fixed footprint the symbol becomes 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.230
 a minus symbol and that means by 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.900
 example if it spikes here that the program to 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.110
 give it at least expand see how I am 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.610
 expanding the hair here a little bit that 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.010
 I do not want to expand that I want it 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.410
 to do as it was because peak change to 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.480
 more symbol and I will go reducing and 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.310
 will always continue to reduce the size of the 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.000
 of the circumference that you have 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.850
 put there 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.609
 in agreement let's do it in a way 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.320
 quick here for example I could put 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.730
 a little bit more the symbol there if I 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.730
 I would like if a little 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.960
 for example so we leave it for the video 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.360
 tutorial come here the hair see here the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.990
 hair shape shape hair here 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.430
 maybe we should press the key 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:42.940
 alternative and see how right now 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.009
 I'm taking the hair a little bit more 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.969
 so that I have a little more hair 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.129
 you realize well then what you know 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:54.080
 that works then let's decrease 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.390
 a little bit the image we like the 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.729
 screen with the lupita 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:04.279
 and let's select invest 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.319
 to select only the image and look 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:09.919
 what's new the side of photoshop cs3 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:11.449
 brings as a novelty to chop for example 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.270
 again here in the tool 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.729
 divine quick selection what he puts here 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.389
 perfect edges we prick and we are 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:22.219
 open this new window and here in this 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.120
 new window by default of the values 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:29.100
 they come so if you look here 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:32.200
 how the background is changing 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:35.590
 you see it chipping notes and with milestones 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.310
 you realize then this means 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.470
 this means for me to extract the image 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.080
 of this photo and I can play with these 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.940
 parameters with the radio here explains you 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.300
 Below you will find a description of 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.810
 what the radio contrast explains what 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.700
 typically used for the smooth 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.340
 climb etcetera et cetera etcetera 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:01.760
 agreement if we could see the parameters 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:04.080
 let's put it for example well 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.879
 with the background 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.180
 black to see if to see how you look like 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:13.680
 he finished chopping here 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.810
 preview with black background see if 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.510
 is pando look look how it will look 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.400
 you look and pressed against expanding to the fullest 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.490
 look how would the image you realize 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.680
 when you have to play with that until 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.760
 you see that more or less you have left you 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:32.200
 It looks good as you like it 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.610
 then let's put that has left like this 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.940
 so that the video tutorial does not do much 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:41.560
 here I play with the tool to set a 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.560
 little bit like that 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.400
 with the soften tool and so on 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.870
 in previewing if you uncheck it is like 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.780
 we made the original cut in agreement and 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.310
 if we sting is how we are leaving 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:02.150
 to give you an idea 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:02.150
 well once you like how the
