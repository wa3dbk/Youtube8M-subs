00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.230

 is the original there are also limitations 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.640
 how will you distinguish it because it brings its 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.770
 respective hose and regulator for 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.380
 connect directly to the decanter the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.700
 others obviously did not bring and this will 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.890
 It will bring an additional cost to you 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.960

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.360
 registered to do all that 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.010

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.200
 only that but with this stove 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.060
 you or to avoid having to put stoves 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.420
 fixed in all the rooms of your house 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.500
 that is, you are going to reduce the consumption of 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.180
 gas per month 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.870
 good the characteristics of this stove 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.550
 basically they are 3 thousand 800 calories 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.980
 pilot carbon monoxide analyzer 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.470
 which is very important on with 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.049
 it sparkles and has regulation obviously 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.460
 minimum maximum will reduce consumption 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.680
 Excessive stoves 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.509
 electrical that in addition to taking 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.729
 heat the environment require 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:12.570
 obviously of an electricity consumption 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.150
 quite 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.250
 considerable the carafe goes inside the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.800
 same which obviously facilitates the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.570
 transfer of the stove and the carafe by 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.460
 another part has an anti-roll system 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.410
 by the separation of the four 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.060
 wheels so it's very easy to move 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.830
 It is ideal for those people who 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.150
 enjoy the outdoors that you like 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.540
 fish with friends good with this stove 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.759
 not even the cold is going to stop them 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.369
 it also works well for those locals 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.979
 that do not have natural gas network and in the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.210
 Winter is obviously going to need 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.340
