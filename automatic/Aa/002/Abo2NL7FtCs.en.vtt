00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.269
 Covering our walls is always a 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.710
 additional to which we can resort if 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.599
 we want to give it a very personal 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.099
 marked suddenly give warmth to a 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.619
 space I want throughout the program 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.270
 Show them many options of covers 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.010
 I want to tell you step by step 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.020
 what they should keep in mind for 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.910
 choose the ideal wallpaper for each 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.710
 space 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.510
 we are used to telling 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.400
 wallpaper to everything with what 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.829
 we can cover our wall but in 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.960
 not all are roles are there 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.550
 different types of materials and 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.190
 different compositions that we can 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.620
 find for all your elements that 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.809
 result wall coverings are 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.000
 finished a bunch of catalogs to be able to 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.550
 show them many options especially of 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.970
 the quality of this wall cover that 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.970
 They can choose 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.060
 important important 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.240
 of quality 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.060
 clear look out this toque was a 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.890
 family keyboard then we renew you 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.899
 we gave this watts treatment and 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.970
 alcalÃ¡ put the marble is here 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.860
 then how we had the mirrors in the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.960
 background on the roof 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.970
 the idea was to use that tree paper 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.920
 so that when it reflects this 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.929
 will continue upwards is not 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.240
 verticality the fact of putting the mirror 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.259
 It gives you the feeling that it is much more 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.259
 big space 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.420
 now let's see another alternative for 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.369
 coat our walls vinyls 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.100
 self-adhesive that is very practical 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.829
 to install and maintain the proposal of 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.360
 decal and amira decal gives you the 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.979
 Good option apart from being able to design 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.990
 the pattern that you want but it comes back 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.209
 2 991 defined 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.969
 here the unions are not noticed because no no 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.799
 it is an exact and separate plot 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.390
 finish your wall then you do not see 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.140
 as much as a hyper hit but 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.140
 as a guest 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.709
 was to make a contrast but very subtle 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.560
 then in the end what we are can 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.409
 use come transparent already totally 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.180
 transparent and cut the designs there what 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.560
 we put and what it does is give it a little 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.209
 of brightness to the area where chain 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.349
 then you already have two types of 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.939
 solidarity, you are simply 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.939
 intensifying the color of the wall 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.480
 i 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.490
 this is the guest bathroom that we are going to 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.490
 intervene at the end of the program
