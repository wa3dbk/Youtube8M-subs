be<00:02:29.820> very<00:02:29.850> similar<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> previous<00:02:30.930> one<00:02:31.380> as

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
be very similar to the previous one as

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.010 
be very similar to the previous one as
it<00:02:31.980> has<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.370> same<00:02:32.580> characteristics<00:02:33.450> the

it has the same characteristics the

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.780 
it has the same characteristics the
difference<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.620> due<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> profile<00:02:35.580> being

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
difference is due to the profile being

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.940 
difference is due to the profile being
