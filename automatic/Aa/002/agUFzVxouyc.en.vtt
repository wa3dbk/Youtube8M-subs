00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.220
 magazine for the interview with ralf is okay 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.650
 we are here in the club of his 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:38.020
 bvb falls in walldorf on the occasion of the 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:40.300
 league play against dachau the first one runs 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.920
 just the b is next to me and 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.340
 has won his game against boll and 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.920
 so that his team 1 0 brought into leadership 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.020
 here in velten no unknown you were 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.720
 to talk jesus member again 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.670
 come I'd always nice if 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.200
 to come back again 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.430
 even if the localities something 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.540
 So I did not change it 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.670
 Recognized more 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.830
 but it burned down well then 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.570
 and therefore, as well as a rebuild 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.340
 to be made but very very nice 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.990
 and of course we still know 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.900
 one or the other from 20 years ago 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.369
 it has to be said it's nice when it 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.290
 but it's always nice to age 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.440
 effective place to come back now 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.700
 you could go to the new games again 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.520
 as a german champion has certainly 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.390
 won quite generally emerging form 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.869
 display 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.610
 Do you see that as well as you always have 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.259
 worse and better phases with me 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.000
 hangs so well in the last years too 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.940
 varied and off I still have 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.190
 Back shoulder problems and the year 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.990
 So it's always very clear 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.940
 if I am if I am not feeling well 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.470
 then also the performance wants you 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.270
 not so good and it's just because of it 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.610
 that somehow it is wrong that it is 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.520
 here and there tweaks and zwackt do if 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.100
 it does not stop the case is then heard 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.819
 yes not yet to the old iron 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.479
 Of course , that's right now 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.590
 The euro gained tour in Italy is here 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.440
 without any near by 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.229
 marched through it was great in the endgame 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.209
 clearly won 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.069
 so that is prepared for the chronicle 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.670
 From now on it will be over in two weeks 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:16.090
 las vegas as it is there the guess how it is 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.770
 going out is well in advance 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.959
 let's say bad times 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.819
 Of course, the euroleague knows quite well 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.170
 important for my own as well 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.550
 Confidence because I have those now 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.030
 no tournament last two years 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.950
 won 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.810
 a few times knocked second third 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.190
 become but 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.099
 of course his victory was also for 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.540
 Self-confidence is simply important and important 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.540
 Of course, now I'm fine, too 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.450
 strengthened and with even more positive 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.380
 feelings colleagues 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.599
 Every year, it becomes a lot 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.760
 balanced history the bookmakers 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.620
 Europe is slightly ahead 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.330
 But as I said there came a coin 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.430
 throw it is again a hotter 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.940
 hopefully be better with the dance 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.940
 end for us 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.230
 what do you say to this year's 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.060
 nomination criteria matchroom sport 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.050
 said she was doing a best of 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.030
 selection 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.830
 Nevertheless, there are of course critics 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.330
 the say thorsten homann belongs to 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.519
 team as acting world champion 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.690
 how do you think the decision that 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.060
 you're not there in the short term anyway 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.150
 it has reacted differently in the team now 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.230
 karl boys because now in Germany 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.690
 I would not say that properly 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.849
 had seen what the water to the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.110
 Your own nomination was yes 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.000
 not entirely undisputed 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.130
 if you consider historical of course 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.019
 of course as a dressage clearly 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.430
 from the services themselves that 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.400
 addressed only now again 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.470
 Of course, winning it was critical 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.970
 water on the nomination criteria 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.720
 both sides also from American 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.209
 sight then yes well you have the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.430
 decision after the mascioli cup 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.989
 last year hit who or four 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.700
 people that they are more or less stuck 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.980
 go on the european side pointed 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.230
 I did not know America 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.780
 but from the European side it was already 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.030
 relatively early, of course, which four are fixed 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.310
 there was a position could be 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.200
 but so to speak , I'm not 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.560
 more enrollments to the da 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.000
 to know the exact names where I am 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.480
 I knew that very early on 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.579
 am 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.260
 even if maybe the performance in the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.720
 last one and a half or two years 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.790
 not quite as topp and me 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.079
 probably that year too 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.540
 would not have been there 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.459
 because I now even the one with the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.579
 I have to be the king of money 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.800
 and I also time or since day 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.960
 I am one 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.190
 because I'm the first player to get stuck 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.099
 me, of course, even if 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.080
 maybe one or the other 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.770
 he qualifies for the right 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.729
 would have had 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.500
 say 9000 euro, you clearly he is yes 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.199
 maybe at the wrong time again 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.699
 become world champion 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.930
 until the time really stood 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.220
 even the fifth player, even if 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.030
 it of course in the outside 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:51.210
 media has not yet been documented is 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.840
 just bad luck had gone stupid 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:57.930
 Metrum because the brake is still to pull 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.729
 Of course you have to share your opinion 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.819
 because the players already knew so 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.219
 also the fifth player and then too 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.360
 should be well say you had it 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.979
 but now you have to unload again 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.539
 Of course it is also bad so 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.699
 Of course we also speak badly 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.710
 in the short term we still have 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.479
 our german fans who accompany you 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.860
 what are he there a few words and the 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.270
 to report when watching the video and 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.639
 soon publish there's know 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.190
 Of course, what is good is always good 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.020
 nice if also domestic fans at scui 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.969
 Cup are in england are always 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.130
 some in las vegas i believe that 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.650
 recent years including therefore is 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.360
 always great when there's a big bunch out 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.669
 Germany flies over the pond and 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.870
 We are actively supported and I am pleased 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.620
 me on the boys then again 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.020
 to watch in videos 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.069
 we all want to believe we have to chronicle 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.190
 I'll thank you now 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:46.909
 interview also thanks the pain of 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.759
 broadband high goals with camera and 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:53.520
 has helped out and we say hello 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:57.110
 meldorf and would now both teams 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.110
 Still good for the rest of the games
