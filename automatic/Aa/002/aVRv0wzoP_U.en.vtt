00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello that such welcome to the new video 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.740
 we are in raid in the xbox version 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.360
 360 if I have the opportunity to try the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.980
 full version of the 360 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.259
 I will compare compare and see how it is in 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.800
 regarding the team when we go 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.900
 we left with the sling cbr600rr as already 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.630
 had also tested the current equipment 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.610
 the moment graphically is obviously 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.100
 lower 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.410
 There is no doubt about it although although the 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.440
 people have listened to comments in forums 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.800
 that the team version john was like 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.120
 if it were the version of the 360 I 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.079
 sincerely once I 've already 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.629
 tried by myself 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.859
 known for that graphically you see 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.159
 lower course 360 is most 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:59.250
 logical good there are many times that the 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:01:02.620
 people exaggerate a lot we go pretty 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.230
 when we go to see it and the important thing is 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.820
 I want them to see if he hits shots and momentum 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.560
 goes well does not hit me perfect jerks what 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.960
 that if we go to the ground what I do notice is the 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.330
 Soil looks like I see it a little better 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.350
 here in 360 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.640
 gonzÃ¡lez for wanting to put me first 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.640
 normal electric 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:33.650
 an improved to the course I have taken the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:37.930
 same circuit of the demo of the xbox war 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.930
 so that it looks 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.329
 what is the comparison if you want 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.780
 see it in the same channel I have also 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.670
 another video also from the juan team 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.670
 of this circuit with this bike too 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.470
 to see if we can reach it and not 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.570
 stay in the last good position 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.640
 this is the penultimate but good looking 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.740
 the panorama 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.020
 This is where I hit too 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.020
 pull the water and here for now 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.700
 do not 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.200
 but obviously the note then 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.170
 graphically 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.780
 inferior and obviously therefore 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.210
 the 360 because the support supports them 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.500
 better of course 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.080
 perfect 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.110
 overtake is well well well endured 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.640
 good perfect 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.170
 and we follow each other 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.170
 there we have the head group 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.500
 the management that has control all that 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.720
 it is exactly the same as what is the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.790
 name the comfort of the control of the xbox 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.810
 one obviously is not the same as that of 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.290
 the 360 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.660
 I prefer the drama is much softer 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.400
 but come on, do not take more than 3 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.060
 I could say that more or less the same but 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.390
 in comfort I prefer more general 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.190
 all step 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.260
 let's take the curve inside 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.380
 perfect we have not already put in position 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.070
 number 4 there we have the first three 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.070
 We're going over there 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.260
 It is around one - half turn 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.970
 produce let's go 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.069
 in front of it is always something that 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.280
 admire shit 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.579
 and that hit and if you apply pulls 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.200
 there apply jerks but I do not know if it is 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.939
 because I have left more than the area of 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.190
 circuit and had to choose more 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:35.980
 graphic loading 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.000
 but if you hit me too 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.700
 what is during the tour 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.510
 of the circuit has not given me jerks but 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.510
 there at that time 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:51.720
 - - grove 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.710
 the crazy trees are a little more 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.810
 cool triplets but I keep saying what 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.319
 same as always if you want it 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.499
 have a good time and all that for 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.130
 Nor do you need to ask both 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:08.460
 the game has fun 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.900
 and driving is good 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.580
 nothing you have to enjoy the games already 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.150
 is next to forget about the subject 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.180
 graphic with that 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.799
 important is the control and the subject of 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.280
 the pulls obviously because it makes a 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.300
 little and playable but otherwise 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.979
 Enjoy the games that you have 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.259
 what to do and leave what would count 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.470
 graph if it is better than if it is 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.930
 worst 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.440
 That's nonsense, I'm from the time 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.460
 from the spektrum when I was playing 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.310
 arcane and I passed it as fucking mother and 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.540
 I say I watched games motorcycle games and 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.920
 come on, they have no point 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.510
 comparison with this 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.260
 crazy people with my age is what I have 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.610
 I have seen I have seen the evolution and 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.610
 I'm really happy with what 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.060
 what I see with what I have and what I 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.900
 game 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.610
 I enjoy graphic themes but already 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.120
 I put that inside there well caught 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:08.889
 of mother whore 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:12.100
 so let's put up with these two 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:15.100
 acts that run bad because it is 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.630
 that the cbr is not in the curves and 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.760
 curves and I go but it happens a little 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.940
 you were braking but it was good that you hit me in 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.060
 that curve sticker girl 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.270
 and yes but come on it does not happen nothing happens 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.280
 I enjoy a very good career 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.530
 disputed also to say that the 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.790
 difficulty is exactly the same as 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.730
 I put in the xbox one 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.740
 then disabled the aids to is session 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.150
 of automatic gears and position 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.670
 of the pilot that I have also put 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.160
 in automatic it is worth the difficulty 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.920
 I have the guide in half 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.889
 so it's exactly the same in the 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.469
 difficulty is exactly the same 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:56.110
 let's go into the last curve of 

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:56.110
 goal and I think I do not think not 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.860
 that I do not want to add because 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.889
 you know with a simple touch 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.719
 you go to the ground 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.860
 come come, this is how the last one comes 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.840
 curve the last left curve and 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.240
 then right 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.240
 come perfect come now 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.340
 a bit better 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:24.069
 I hope you liked it and you know 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:27.060
 enjoyed and see you in the next 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.060
 video until next time 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.759
 people
