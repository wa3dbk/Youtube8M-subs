in here so it's going to be a bundle of
quick<00:00:16.230> tips<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.560> guess<00:00:16.740> ahead<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.850> second

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.670 
quick tips I guess ahead for the second
episode<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:19.230> change<00:00:19.529> you'll

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
episode so the first change you'll

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.960

the wilderness and you right-click

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.170 
the wilderness and you right-click
somebody<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> will<00:00:30.539> show<00:00:30.810> their<00:00:30.960> combat<00:00:31.289> level

now combat levels have been readjusted

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.530 
now combat levels have been readjusted
in<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.070> you'll<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.460> players<00:00:36.030> will<00:00:36.270> start

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
off as a level four now the formula is

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.369 
off as a level four now the formula is
now<00:00:39.090> much<00:00:39.300> easier<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.690> understand<00:00:40.140> rather

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
now much easier to understand rather

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.959 
now much easier to understand rather
than<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> last<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.129> was<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.430> don't<00:00:41.670> think

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
than the last one that was I don't think

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.330 
than the last one that was I don't think
anybody<00:00:42.149> understood<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.809> had<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.020> use<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
anybody understood that you had to use a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.529 
anybody understood that you had to use a
scientific<00:00:44.340> calculator<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.969> one<00:00:45.149> but

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
scientific calculator for that one but

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.150 
scientific calculator for that one but
this<00:00:45.600> one<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:45.989> easy<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.620> X<00:00:46.829> plus

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
this one is really easy so it's X plus

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
this one is really easy so it's X plus
your<00:00:47.309> defense<00:00:47.700> level<00:00:47.879> plus<00:00:48.210> 2<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.700> X<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.940> your

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
your defense level plus 2 and X is your

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.900 
your defense level plus 2 and X is your
highest<00:00:51.420> level<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.100> attack<00:00:53.100> strength<00:00:53.489> magic

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
highest level of attack strength magic

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.910 
highest level of attack strength magic
range<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.480> summoning<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.680> means<00:00:55.860> that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
range and summoning so that means that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.200 
range and summoning so that means that
your<00:00:56.100> character<00:00:56.280> won't<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> disadvantage

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
your character won't be a disadvantage

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.819 
your character won't be a disadvantage

removed skulls so as soon as you go into

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.719 
removed skulls so as soon as you go into
the<00:01:16.560> wilderness<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.100> will<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.310> risking

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the wilderness you will be risking

everything you're wearing to be careful

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
everything you're wearing to be careful
I<00:01:20.040> guess<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.060> only<00:01:21.119> exception<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:21.689> would

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
I guess the only exception to this would

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
I guess the only exception to this would
be<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.170> you're<00:01:22.290> using<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> potato<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
be when you're using the potato and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.450 
be when you're using the potato and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
prayer the wilderness levels have

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.890 
prayer the wilderness levels have
