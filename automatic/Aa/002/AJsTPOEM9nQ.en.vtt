00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.016
 And if we started with your name? 

00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:27.118
 47 

00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:29.054
 It's not a name. 

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:31.038
 No. 

00:00:31.054 --> 00:00:32.060
 But it's mine. 

00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:34.140
 What are you exactly? 

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:37.096
 A killer. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.076
 And you are here to kill who? 

00:00:43.012 --> 00:00:45.044
 You should really let me go. 

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:49.046
 The last time I checked you were the one who's locked up here with me and I'm the one with the rifle. 

00:00:50.052 --> 00:00:52.064
 No, Mr Sanders ... 

00:00:52.064 --> 00:00:54.067
 ... you are locked up here with me 

00:00:54.094 --> 00:00:56.176
 and you brought my weapon. 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.027
 Listen, I know it sounds strange because it is. 

00:01:21.028 --> 00:01:23.084
 He is an improved human being. 

00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:25.065
 Stronger, 

00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:27.117
 faster 

00:01:29.042 --> 00:01:31.064
 and smarter than normal. 

00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:37.051
 They are what are called agents. 

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.016
 What does all this have to do with me? 

00:01:41.016 --> 00:01:43.072
 Your father started the program. 

00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:46.007
 He knows their weaknesses. 

00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:48.044
 You are the key to finding your father. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.008
 This year 

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:02.092
 Your time 

00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:08.076
 has arrived 

00:02:28.048 --> 00:02:31.000
