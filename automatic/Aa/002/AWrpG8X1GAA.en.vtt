00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
to me at least the idea that people

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
think they have to be able to draw to be

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.240 
think they have to be able to draw to be
a<00:00:15.030> graphic<00:00:15.269> designer

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
there are parts the rough design

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.900 
there are parts the rough design
industry<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.710> will<00:00:22.859> help<00:00:23.100> you<00:00:23.340> in<00:00:23.490> if<00:00:23.670> you

who can only push pixels in the computer

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.450 
who can only push pixels in the computer
then<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.409> going<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.619> be<00:01:34.680> very<00:01:34.770> limiting<00:01:35.430> for

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
lot harder to brainstorm and get ideas

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.420
