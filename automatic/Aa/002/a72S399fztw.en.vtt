at one end of the table and how far I

on<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.120> 4<00:02:40.720> wheelchair<00:02:41.720> could<00:02:42.590> possibly<00:02:42.980> have

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
on the 4 wheelchair could possibly have

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.620 
on the 4 wheelchair could possibly have
two<00:02:44.060> advantages<00:02:44.690> when<00:02:45.680> using<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.299> M&amp;L<00:02:47.299> bridge

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
two advantages when using the M&amp;L bridge

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.979 
two advantages when using the M&amp;L bridge
one<00:02:48.590> advantage<00:02:49.130> is<00:02:49.400> they<00:02:50.360> can<00:02:50.540> reach<00:02:50.690> farther

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
one advantage is they can reach farther

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.020 
one advantage is they can reach farther
down<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.440> table<00:02:51.830> because<00:02:52.070> all<00:02:52.459> shots<00:02:52.790> are

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
down the table because all shots are

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.600 
down the table because all shots are
performed<00:02:53.480> one-handed<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.310> also<00:02:55.310> they<00:02:55.580> can

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
performed one-handed and also they can

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.770 
performed one-handed and also they can
position<00:02:56.950> their<00:02:57.950> eye<00:02:58.000> directly<00:02:59.000> behind<00:02:59.480> the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
position their eye directly behind the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.620 
position their eye directly behind the
kid<00:03:00.070> giving<00:03:01.070> them<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.400> better<00:03:01.970> line<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.480> sight

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.260

when using the larger version place your

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.980 
when using the larger version place your
cue<00:03:11.480> stick<00:03:12.490> your<00:03:13.490> tip<00:03:13.700> approximately<00:03:14.420> one

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
cue stick your tip approximately one

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.100 
cue stick your tip approximately one
inch<00:03:15.230> past<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.130> front<00:03:16.460> of<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:16.580> bridge<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.240> a

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
inch past the front of the bridge and a
