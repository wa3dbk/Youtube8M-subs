00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.750
The Jets still had a small chance to actually
making it to the playoffs, al though their

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.980
record was bad, at a 6 - 7.
However, Mark Sanchez once again fumbled away

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.970
the chances of the Jets, shattering their
hopes of making it to the play-offs, and ending

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.889
the story for the Jets right there and then.
Sanchez threw an interception into a triple

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.679
coverage only 1 series before the jets were
given a final shot at the plyoffs, with only

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:15.540
47 seconds left at the Titans' 25-yard line
after Tennessee's punter, Brett Kern, had

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.239
poofed one from the right side of his foot..
Sanchez was standing behind star Nick Mangold

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:21.679
in the shotgun formation, right when the snap
came in low. As expected, Sanchez fumbled

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:22.869
it, ruining the chances for the Jets, and
wrapping the present and delivering it right

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.289
into the hands of Tennessee's linebacker,
who seemed to not have a problem with this.

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.289
The Jets have a lot of work on their hands,
and have a lot of question marks when it comes

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.800
to their line-up as it is now, judging from
recent results.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.370
However, it is clear that Marc Sanchez is
done for, as his fumble once again shattered

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.370
the only remaining glimpse of hope the Jets
had for the play-offs.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.699
Personally, I think actions like this shouldn't
happen to players getting paid so much, and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.640
looking at a fumble like this one from Mark,
it is clear that he doesn't belong to be in

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.890
the Jets anymore as it is, because the results
he displayed the last season have been sub-par,

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.899
to say the least.
