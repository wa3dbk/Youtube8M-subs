00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.360 
place doesn't get a whole lot of
pressure<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.840> I<00:05:00.530> just<00:05:00.740> think<00:05:00.950> that<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.160> shed

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
pressure and I just think that the shed

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.640 
pressure and I just think that the shed
get<00:05:01.580> stocked<00:05:02.000> up<00:05:02.150> in<00:05:02.330> here<00:05:02.540> and<00:05:02.690> that's<00:05:03.470> why

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
get stocked up in here and that's why

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.410 
get stocked up in here and that's why
some<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:03.920> the<00:05:03.980> bigger<00:05:04.520> bass<00:05:04.760> or<00:05:05.000> back<00:05:05.150> here<00:05:05.330> but

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
some of the bigger bass or back here but

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.420 
some of the bigger bass or back here but
