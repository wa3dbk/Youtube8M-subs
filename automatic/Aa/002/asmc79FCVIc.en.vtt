00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.569
 now what we are going to proceed that will be the discrediting of the whole disc 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.410
 hard 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.109
 then the first recommendations before the lierse vizcaína 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.019
 that remove any type of object 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.109
 if I could goods from the desk 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.990
 I feel like this 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.990
 p for example on the bars that appeared later 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.329
 It has its sides 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.839
 shortcuts that are in them 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.839
 or some other kind of 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.509
 the program that creates effects in the hospital 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:32.710
 because because there 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.540
 this what we are going to do in 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.960
 these moments with the presentation of the disc 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.330
 it is a very delicate process 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 and then it has to be correctly 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.700
 but here you have to finish 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060
 all this comes out of the foundation track 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.800
 I do not recommend that you can not 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.370
 even if they cancel it every year 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.690
 this is this is a recommendation because I often 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.270
 I reach the round of eighteen to cancel 30 percent 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.960
 and when he restarted his operating system because they simply do not convince anymore that 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.200
 let's be that way 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.930
 then I recommend sugar 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.930
 I just wanted everyone to be constant 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.100
 and that's it 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.900
 and most importantly I said you do not end 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.790
 if it takes an hour two three four hours overtime all night 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.380
 do not leave us 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.410
 that they are going to cancel 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.140
 although we follow music inc 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.140
 the most important we have 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.350
 write included Paraguay 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.410
 so for 2012 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.930
 then what we are going to see here I am 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.930
 revilla accessories 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.650
 day 15 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.690
 then here 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.530
 here we can realize 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.040
 that there are different 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.040
 either partitions 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.120
 then what I can do here 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.420
 he can that's why that's where I'm from unity will be then 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.580
 zoco the sec 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.850
 and what I'm going to do 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.850
 in this case of san mamés 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.969
 because it just penalizes the disc and I'm going to start 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.349
 without which it is not mestalla saying 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.229
 how much is the percentage that is analyzing inhabited 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:25.229
 We wait until it's over 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.399
 once it has finished 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.329
 here we put 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.899
 that the level that highlighted infraction that would give the whole hard drive 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:38.289
 although 5% 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.049
 then in this case 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:42.630
 they have the most 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.630
 what a knife suggests 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:48.769
 includes to avoid 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.099
 kessel childhood 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.099
 how would this process 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.069
 yes relatives we are using 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.899
 the police station jumping 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 that's the way things are 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.499
 and in venezuela 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.329
 we no longer need 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.419
 I know what computers would do 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.699
 yes the hard drive project 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.199
 everything in your training 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.669
 and when I run something 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.789
 it was just take away information from that space 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.279
 then there that hollow 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:29.829
 then when it starts to read the hard drive 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.789
 it starts to be a kind of 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:35.499
 of recognition of everything they find 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.929
 then what defragmentation does 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:40.929
 is that all those holes take them away 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.719
 so what it does is that now in those holes 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.279
 already with bogotá 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:52.599
 I want to locate the files that still then that we are using in the 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.399
 machine 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.780
 then let it be so 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.870
 as from a single pull the reader who indicated that one 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.959
 can reach 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:03:59.989
 to read 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.459
 all the information 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.869
 without there being holes and that there 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:07.039
 and without there being any need of who that is what is 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.799
 that's why it becomes 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.089
 percent and the system load as well as the other applications to 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.299
 run 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.239
 and they are faster 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.399
 then here we present what disk defragmentation 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.579
 I'm not going to do it here 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.970
 because you just wanted to show them how it is done with care 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.150
 good with the windows presenter 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
 this one is for windows xp for windows vista or for windows 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.009
 then quidant that temptation of Christ 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.419
 let's ask closed 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.139
 Now what I'm going to do here starts now, he warned that it's 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.050
 2010 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.840
 and I'm going to choose the defragmentation option 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.330
 and we are going to see him differentiate between the fragmentation that he would give us 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.759
 and irving weissman sales of 11 points 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:55.189
 I commented graves 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.189
 then I go home Jalisco next to the functions 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.349
 and here I go the option to discount disco 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.629
 then isco jiguaní volume 6 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.460
 and you select here the hard drives you want 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.550
 analyze 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.059
 here in texcoco 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:14.759
 it's mainly that he gives me 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.669
 wait fifteen decide what it is you want will already be showing in analysis 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.409
 and it's as if nothing 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.409
 so here I started doing an analysis of the entire hard drive 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.129
 it was on the street montera 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.869
 the files that would be already fragmented those that are 

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:33.830
 simple questions 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.189
 And some others 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:39.860
 then I see that here they are giving me a defragmentation of 16 points 7 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.580
 percent 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.580
 much bigger than the one we were not with brown 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.069
 from gaza la 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:48.509
 in this sense 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.509
 lisicki to carry out 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.589
 isaac equally 600 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.229
 impossible to fail 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.419
 then you say that there it ends 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.939
 for the hard drive 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:04.059
 in dollarization 

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:06.210
 detailed because it can be carried out 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.349
 in a reasonable time 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:08.559
 this is 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:11.589
 that was going to be carried out 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:14.569
 the whole crisis min 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.330
 sienna miller a 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.050
 so here I can believe 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.680
 that the whole disc where it is 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.119
 2 points 3 percent one is a very intense woman 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.270
 if this part a site defragmentation that will give me 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.770
 with 14 points 5 percent and all this blue station 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:33.760
 without wish to comment 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.849
 it was simply 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.460
 borges I do not have more information 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.580
 so 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.580
 is blind and stop here the video 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.860
 to do it 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.319
 to do it simply 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:47.050
 without something else is not like that 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.569
 preferring 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:49.480
 yes 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.480
 The only thing I'm going to say is that I'm going to add some images 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:54.949
 as another way 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.740
 if level is processed 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.619
 two months ago all the seasons 

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:00.089
 Mr 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:03.089
 and the time I'm going to check 

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:06.550
 the network as the athlete 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.550
 this maximum value 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:11.449
 this pack
