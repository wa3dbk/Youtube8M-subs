00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
they are and you have enough time to do

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.980 
they are and you have enough time to do
a<00:02:56.180> good

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
a good

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.890 
a good
do<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.860> glitch<00:02:59.220> because<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:00.540> really

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
do this glitch because it's really

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.790 
do this glitch because it's really
easily<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:02.280> might<00:03:02.520> need<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:03.800> plasma

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
easily and you might need to plasma

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.930 
easily and you might need to plasma
grenades<00:03:05.160> which<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.730> can<00:03:05.880> find<00:03:05.910> right<00:03:06.210> there

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
grenades which you can find right there

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.050 
grenades which you can find right there
so<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.000> put<00:03:09.570> one<00:03:10.230> sticky<00:03:10.800> on<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.280> yellow<00:03:11.670> or

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
so you put one sticky on that yellow or

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.170 
so you put one sticky on that yellow or
white<00:03:12.090> light<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.710> count<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> like<00:03:14.220> four

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
white light and you count to like four

because I put my light see I'm just like
on<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.770> side<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.160> tree<00:03:41.460> and<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.000> building

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.300 

pretty<00:03:46.680> cool<00:03:48.560> so<00:03:49.560> they<00:03:49.740> can't<00:03:49.950> even<00:03:50.040> check

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
pretty cool so they can't even check

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.620 
pretty cool so they can't even check
your<00:03:50.520> names<00:03:50.670> in<00:03:50.790> there<00:03:50.940> because<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.270> just<00:03:51.390> goes

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
your names in there because it just goes

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.290 
your names in there because it just goes
down<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.990> whole<00:03:52.200> or<00:03:52.500> just<00:03:52.530> goes<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.850> so

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
down the whole or just goes to it so

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:05.300 
down the whole or just goes to it so
it's<00:03:55.200> hard<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.560> like<00:03:56.190> kill<00:03:56.490> people<00:04:01.250> um<00:04:04.310> there's

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.970 
it's hard to like kill people um there's
an<00:04:05.490> escape<00:04:05.970> way<00:04:06.780> which<00:04:07.080> you<00:04:07.200> can<00:04:07.350> go<00:04:07.500> there<00:04:07.740> or

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
an escape way which you can go there or

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.220 
an escape way which you can go there or
you<00:04:08.190> can<00:04:08.370> go<00:04:08.520> into<00:04:09.000> another<00:04:09.330> hiding<00:04:09.810> spot

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
you can go into another hiding spot

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.260 
you can go into another hiding spot
which<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.890> right<00:04:11.070> there<00:04:11.100> on<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.340> trick<00:04:11.610> so<00:04:12.180> you

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
which is right there on the trick so you

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.180 
which is right there on the trick so you
just<00:04:12.510> go<00:04:12.810> down<00:04:12.990> the<00:04:13.140> hole<00:04:13.320> which<00:04:13.770> is<00:04:13.920> on<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
just go down the hole which is on the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.610 
just go down the hole which is on the
left<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.790> then<00:04:15.450> you're<00:04:15.630> there<00:04:15.900> or<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.500> can

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
left and then you're there or you can

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.510 
left and then you're there or you can
just<00:04:16.739> jump<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.250> legend<00:04:17.640> dip<00:04:19.220> this<00:04:20.220> bad

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
just jump to the legend dip this bad

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.330 
just jump to the legend dip this bad
people<00:04:20.910> can<00:04:21.180> kill<00:04:21.480> you<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:21.960> be<00:04:22.140> careful<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:23.190> is

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
people can kill you so be careful but is

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.380 
people can kill you so be careful but is
pretty<00:04:23.580> good<00:04:23.700> hiding<00:04:24.000> spot<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:28.530> that

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
pretty good hiding spot so so that

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.750 
pretty good hiding spot so so that
that's<00:04:30.390> a<00:04:30.600> really<00:04:31.020> good<00:04:31.310> hiding<00:04:32.310> spot<00:04:34.760> these

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
that's a really good hiding spot these

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.490 
that's a really good hiding spot these
aren't<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:36.180> much<00:04:36.330> of<00:04:36.450> hiding<00:04:36.750> spots<00:04:36.990> because

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
aren't so much of hiding spots because

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.100 
aren't so much of hiding spots because
people<00:04:38.160> can<00:04:38.280> find<00:04:38.610> you<00:04:38.760> but<00:04:39.420> i<00:04:39.450> guess<00:04:39.780> if

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
people can find you but i guess if

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.790 
people can find you but i guess if
someone<00:04:41.100> were<00:04:41.340> to<00:04:41.550> be<00:04:41.730> over<00:04:42.480> like<00:04:43.260> walking

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
someone were to be over like walking

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.890 
someone were to be over like walking
towards<00:04:44.070> you<00:04:44.250> or<00:04:44.280> some<00:04:44.670> this<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:45.780> pretty

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
towards you or some this is a pretty

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.660 
towards you or some this is a pretty
good<00:04:46.080> place<00:04:46.290> to<00:04:46.560> shoot<00:04:46.770> them<00:04:46.920> like<00:04:47.400> if<00:04:47.550> they're

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
good place to shoot them like if they're

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.130 
good place to shoot them like if they're
just<00:04:47.850> walking<00:04:48.000> right<00:04:48.210> there<00:04:48.420> boom<00:04:48.900> my<00:04:49.140> dad

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.920 

um<00:04:54.670> you<00:04:55.670> know<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:55.850> can<00:04:56.000> find<00:04:56.210> other<00:04:56.330> places<00:04:56.540> in

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
um you know you can find other places in

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.230 
um you know you can find other places in
here<00:04:57.230> that's<00:04:58.040> like<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.580> main<00:04:58.730> one<00:04:59.000> that<00:04:59.030> I

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
here that's like the main one that I

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.230 
here that's like the main one that I
know<00:04:59.360> the<00:05:00.020> best<00:05:00.230> one<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.500> guess<00:05:00.940> if<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.120> have<00:05:02.210> a

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
know the best one I guess if you have a

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.350 
know the best one I guess if you have a
shotgun<00:05:03.040> once<00:05:04.040> up<00:05:04.250> someone<00:05:04.610> shoots<00:05:04.910> you<00:05:05.030> put

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
shotgun once up someone shoots you put

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.290 
shotgun once up someone shoots you put
out<00:05:05.480> that<00:05:05.660> bubble<00:05:06.020> shield<00:05:06.260> and<00:05:06.610> then<00:05:07.610> a<00:05:07.910> good

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
out that bubble shield and then a good

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.240 
out that bubble shield and then a good
technique<00:05:08.660> is<00:05:08.930> have<00:05:09.440> your<00:05:09.590> machine<00:05:09.920> gun<00:05:10.100> out

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
technique is have your machine gun out

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.920 
technique is have your machine gun out
and<00:05:10.490> then<00:05:10.730> when<00:05:10.910> they<00:05:11.030> get<00:05:11.180> close<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.540> you<00:05:11.570> then

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
and then when they get close to you then

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.050 
and then when they get close to you then
get<00:05:12.110> your<00:05:12.230> shot<00:05:12.470> this<00:05:13.430> is<00:05:13.610> going<00:05:13.760> to<00:05:13.820> place

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
get your shot this is going to place

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.850 
get your shot this is going to place
people<00:05:14.870> are<00:05:15.050> like<00:05:15.170> what<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.440> crap<00:05:15.620> where'd

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
people are like what the crap where'd

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.320 
people are like what the crap where'd
you<00:05:15.920> go<00:05:16.390> boom<00:05:17.830> surprise<00:05:18.830> that's<00:05:19.490> good<00:05:19.970> spot

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
you go boom surprise that's good spot

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.080 
you go boom surprise that's good spot
for<00:05:20.590> people<00:05:21.590> are<00:05:21.650> chasing<00:05:21.830> you<00:05:22.160> you<00:05:22.940> can

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
for people are chasing you you can

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.460 
for people are chasing you you can
easily<00:05:23.240> kill<00:05:23.660> them<00:05:23.810> even<00:05:24.020> if<00:05:24.170> you're<00:05:24.290> weak

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
easily kill them even if you're weak

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.310 
easily kill them even if you're weak
because<00:05:24.680> they<00:05:24.860> won't<00:05:25.010> touch<00:05:25.310> you<00:05:25.600> this<00:05:26.600> this

because they won't touch you this this

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.500 
because they won't touch you this this
is<00:05:27.560> probably<00:05:27.920> the<00:05:28.100> worst<00:05:28.160> one<00:05:28.580> ever<00:05:28.760> because

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
is probably the worst one ever because

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.900 
is probably the worst one ever because
anyone<00:05:30.020> can<00:05:30.140> get<00:05:30.470> you<00:05:30.620> here<00:05:30.860> I<00:05:31.070> don't<00:05:31.820> know

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
what you'd use it for at all but I guess

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.240 
what you'd use it for at all but I guess
since<00:05:35.000> I<00:05:35.180> know<00:05:35.360> it<00:05:35.540> it's<00:05:36.230> pretty<00:05:36.380> cool<00:05:36.590> i'll

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
since I know it it's pretty cool i'll

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.470 
since I know it it's pretty cool i'll
show<00:05:37.430> you<00:05:37.520> it<00:05:37.870> right<00:05:38.870> there<00:05:40.150> people<00:05:41.150> can<00:05:41.240> get

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
show you it right there people can get

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.290 
show you it right there people can get
you<00:05:41.720> but<00:05:42.560> it<00:05:42.830> is<00:05:43.130> actually<00:05:43.340> good<00:05:43.730> for<00:05:43.760> it<00:05:44.060> here

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
you but it is actually good for it here

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.910 
you but it is actually good for it here
for<00:05:44.510> someone's<00:05:44.810> right<00:05:44.960> there<00:05:45.230> they<00:05:45.500> can't<00:05:45.710> see

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
for someone's right there they can't see

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.760 
for someone's right there they can't see
you<00:05:46.040> so<00:05:46.970> i<00:05:47.000> guess<00:05:47.240> it's<00:05:47.450> good<00:05:47.690> like<00:05:48.020> hiding

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
you so i guess it's good like hiding

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.750 
you so i guess it's good like hiding
place<00:05:49.220> to<00:05:50.180> not<00:05:50.330> die<00:05:50.570> so<00:05:51.560> and<00:05:52.010> you<00:05:52.430> can't<00:05:52.640> go

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
place to not die so and you can't go

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.940 
place to not die so and you can't go
down<00:05:52.940> there<00:05:52.970> you<00:05:53.390> can<00:05:53.870> just<00:05:53.900> stay<00:05:54.320> where<00:05:54.860> i

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
down there you can just stay where i

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:01.360 
down there you can just stay where i
showed<00:05:55.190> you<00:05:58.870> as<00:05:59.870> you<00:05:59.990> see<00:06:00.290> you<00:06:00.800> can<00:06:00.950> only<00:06:01.100> be<00:06:01.310> in

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
showed you as you see you can only be in

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:07.290 
showed you as you see you can only be in
that<00:06:01.490> one<00:06:01.670> little<00:06:01.700> spot<00:06:02.180> um<00:06:04.270> another<00:06:05.320> glitch

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
that one little spot um another glitch

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.950 
that one little spot um another glitch
the<00:06:08.300> last<00:06:08.540> glitch<00:06:08.810> i<00:06:08.960> should<00:06:09.200> say<00:06:09.440> is<00:06:10.810> kind<00:06:11.810> of

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
the last glitch i should say is kind of

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.450 
the last glitch i should say is kind of
like<00:06:12.050> that<00:06:12.260> other<00:06:12.410> one<00:06:12.530> i<00:06:12.590> showed<00:06:12.680> you<00:06:12.890> except

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
like that other one i showed you except

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.180 
like that other one i showed you except
we<00:06:13.580> build<00:06:13.820> this<00:06:14.030> way<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:14.570> you<00:06:14.690> go<00:06:14.870> up<00:06:14.900> the<00:06:15.380> tree

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
we build this way and you go up the tree

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.030 
we build this way and you go up the tree
and<00:06:16.490> then<00:06:17.090> this<00:06:17.690> but<00:06:17.930> is<00:06:18.080> really<00:06:18.260> like<00:06:18.890> the

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
and then this but is really like the

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.310 
and then this but is really like the
best<00:06:19.780> sniping<00:06:20.780> spot<00:06:21.110> in<00:06:21.350> the<00:06:21.800> whole<00:06:21.950> map<00:06:23.320> like

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
best sniping spot in the whole map like

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.940 
best sniping spot in the whole map like
I<00:06:24.670> guess<00:06:25.670> it<00:06:26.300> could<00:06:26.510> be<00:06:26.660> the<00:06:26.750> second<00:06:27.170> because

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
I guess it could be the second because

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.750 
I guess it could be the second because
that<00:06:28.130> other<00:06:28.250> one<00:06:28.400> but<00:06:28.760> you<00:06:28.880> get<00:06:29.060> out<00:06:29.240> there<00:06:29.570> and

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
that other one but you get out there and

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.360 
that other one but you get out there and
it's<00:06:31.760> it's<00:06:32.090> kind<00:06:32.540> of<00:06:32.600> hard<00:06:32.900> but<00:06:33.620> once<00:06:33.740> you<00:06:33.860> like

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
it's it's kind of hard but once you like

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.070 
it's it's kind of hard but once you like
do<00:06:34.580> it<00:06:34.700> it's<00:06:34.940> pretty<00:06:35.210> easy<00:06:35.270> so<00:06:35.570> you<00:06:35.660> can<00:06:35.780> snipe

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 
do it it's pretty easy so you can snipe

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.380 
do it it's pretty easy so you can snipe
you<00:06:36.350> can<00:06:36.500> hide<00:06:36.710> you<00:06:36.890> can<00:06:37.040> do<00:06:37.130> whatever<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:38.270> you

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.390 
you can hide you can do whatever and you

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.870 
you can hide you can do whatever and you
can<00:06:38.540> really<00:06:38.720> get<00:06:38.900> away<00:06:38.990> from<00:06:39.110> people<00:06:39.410> so<00:06:39.890> it's

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
can really get away from people so it's

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.270 
can really get away from people so it's
not<00:06:41.000> too<00:06:41.210> hard<00:06:41.390> just<00:06:41.690> keep<00:06:42.560> on<00:06:42.710> trying<00:06:43.040> s

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
not too hard just keep on trying s

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.660 
not too hard just keep on trying s
people<00:06:44.090> come<00:06:44.870> at<00:06:44.990> me<00:06:45.140> if<00:06:45.260> you<00:06:45.320> don't<00:06:46.100> know<00:06:46.280> or

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.920 
need some help with it I can tell us any
more<00:06:49.190> techniques<00:06:49.730> except<00:06:50.210> for<00:06:50.360> I<00:06:50.420> just<00:06:50.600> don't
