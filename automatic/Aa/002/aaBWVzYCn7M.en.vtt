00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.599
 welcome back those guys this 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.269
 is the eighth episode 08 fifa 13 will be 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.830
 the episode in which this new one started 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.080
 adventure with this new team 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.320
 in fact, as you can see, I am at this point 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.420
 creating the team and soon before the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.269
 initial package then as you will see vi 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.650
 miss I will change from the other account to which 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.230
 I had passed before to eliminate the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.380
 team players the coach it 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.710
 stadium here I hope we say this too 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.120
 that this team gives me satisfaction 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.710
 until then he has given me since 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.739
 this episode will end with three victories 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.620
 they won't be perfect except the second one 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.960
 however, they will be victory therefore 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.039
 the important thing is that here is the first one 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.590
 game as you see the team 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.809
 opponent was was not very strong era 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.260
 it was probably the starting team 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.690
 with just two or three purchases as it was 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.170
 to the playmaker who was golden and me 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.049
 looks like a bronze food is not a silver 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.970
 cdc but I don't remember and it will be a game 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.250
 strange since I will command practically 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.840
 the game only I will be ahead 2 a 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.390
 0 in the end does not make me two throws two goals is 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 however all in all it will be one 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.080
 good game since in any case the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.759
 I end the win on penalties with his own 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.130
 error is therefore good but victory 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.290
 all in all I will be happy seeing that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.450
 anyway as I said we say it 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.640
 I dominated so I saw that anyway 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.070
 the team turned well or at least dwarfs 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.320
 it turned out well since he and everything does 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.479
 so let's say I got some 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.250
 security that I didn't have on dwarfs before 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.210
 which however is a great player too 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.899
 if i took it also got 85 anyway 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.440
 I think he will give me several 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.020
 satisfaction here 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.310
 this rigor that misses him that me 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.670
 leads to victory while mine 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.110
 goalkeeper passes over him mocking him 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.290
 probably doing it too 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.910
 pernacchia saw itself from the video and ne 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.430
 I go to win it goes from buying stack jars 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.880
 he is an attacker and morais that a wing 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.990
 right you bought it simply for it 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.490
 same reason as I saw before 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.680
 attacked only me but I only did two 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.360
 goal and I went to equalize it is because 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.220
 opens nothing unfinished since 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.860
 the only good was the dwarves the others were 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.690
 blowjobs so I decided to buy 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.430
 these two players who were good 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.810
 especially he was a Portuguese then 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.310
 maybe there's even a little bit more than 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.850
 affinity between the attackers is succeeded 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.240
 do better 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.710
 and in fact we see immediately we say i 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.540
 results given that this match the 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.720
 lincoln 3 to 0 with also a nice goal of 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.340
 morais di di testa but above all his 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.660
 canal it was seen that he did the 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.200
 cutting therefore means that anyway 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.150
 there is this affinity between the attackers 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.400
 also goals from dwarves and then in years and will do 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.400
 another makes two is very strong we 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.500
 therefore no act on the occasion of it 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.810
 spoken already in the other episodes though 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.270
 however, since little has been said 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.190
 a little while ago there was always an affinity 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.030
 just look at these things because how 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.700
 you have seen if that morais was the 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.470
 right yet he cut in for per 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.810
 do the header for let's say 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.690
 propose if there is no affinity between the 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.760
 strikers but not all players 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.080
 this will never happen because not 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.820
 since there is an affinity for the players 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.380
 will only remain in their role in 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.090
 feathers put that you have players that 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.489
 it's not in their role so it's like if 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.110
 you don't have in the field and therefore you look for 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.150
 always to have at least affinity between the 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.320
 departments if you can't at least have them 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.660
 among all players 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.730
 I go to get it seems to me hugo viana that 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.260
 is a central gold midfielder I have it 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.330
 caught because it was what it cost to 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.980
 less obviously my cc that I would like in 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.600
 team are quite different 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.220
 but I'm happy with that because 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.800
 he had noticed that in any case he also had 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.959
 arranged arranged despite having say 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.030
 put the attack in place a little bit 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.130
 I needed a little bit more push 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.630
 from the midfield maybe one to take 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.640
 ball and for a shelter and kick in the goal 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.100
 here it is however a plan it seems to me that 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.680
 have a good shot 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:00.880
 so a good player this game 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:04.390
 it is the third one that I will win I will win 64 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.420
 maybe it will be a nice game considering that 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.770
 anyway I go ahead then me 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.150
 shortens the distances then they come into 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.280
 advantage then they retort to the 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.150
 I end up winning at the last minute by doing 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.150
 the 6 to 4 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.079
 it seems to me a bit of a goal if not hands me 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.540
 mistake 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.370
 what is the classic some make me from 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.880
 corner kick now even if you play 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.590
 against me 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.090
 you know that if you play against it 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.570
 you have to pull so it takes kick 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.280
 corner 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.169
 do things done surely like why 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.560
 if you notice, he took at least 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.520
 at least six or seven goals from seven 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.560
 bets I made for the other team 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.110
 from a corner kick it is absurd in 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.240
 b meeting I looked like poles that 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.889
 so even if my jump well the 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.180
 others even not jumping take them 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.169
 my defenders as well as this 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.570
 chance they make absurd holes to play 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.750
 against in java I played with three 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.770
 people of you juve pleased me 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.919
 play against you 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.650
 anyway if you want to play against me 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:05.340
 the song you know anyway it's mick mck 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.340
 underscore useful for playing with me 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.470
 with let's say with the rotor account 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.790
 do it while you want to play me with 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.560
 my personal next door though 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.830
 anyway, i 'm not playing very much 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.320
 predominantly agreement on that account 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.330
 because now she's still scared 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.960
 ahead this series is however z a 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.910
 dragon 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.470
 anyway if you want to add e 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.650
 let's play together against you 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.380
 how did you like to play here 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.690
 it seems that I make 5 from two goals again 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.160
 of us very strong nania a very good 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.690
 shooting is good accuracy and therefore a 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.890
 excellent purchase here I will need 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.200
 really a lot 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.539
 another thing I wanted to tell you is that it is 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.460
 Andrew's video released that even though it is 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.590
 on cod however I invite you to go to 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.540
 look why 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.790
 and very nice as video above all is 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.130
 done live so it's very difficult 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.470
 here is comment while playing though 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.990
 he would do well anyway he also succeeds 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.360
 a good commentary and then I invite you to 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.030
 take a look here is just right for you 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.950
 going through it is another thing 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.070
 I wanted to say propose was if you wanted 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.900
 a live match of mine is the right one 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.150
 I will not talk about it in the next proposal 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.590
 episode you tell me what you think 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.850
 maybe in the next episode I'll try to 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.070
 deepen a moment by saying maybe 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.810
 where he does maybe on TV instead 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.960
 what a season to go head-to-head or maybe 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.910
 against someone else from the channel here 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.260
 vince I throw it I throw it there in 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.550
 this episode then maybe we'll talk to you 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.180
 in the next episode 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.950
 the episode is over so I invite you to 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.600
 watch both previous episodes and 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.160
 subscribe to the channel to put me 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.660
