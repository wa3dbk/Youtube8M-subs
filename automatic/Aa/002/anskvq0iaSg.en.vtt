and<00:01:02.280> test<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> discharge<00:01:03.539> lever

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.679 

then

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
then

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.569 
then
inspect<00:01:09.109> the<00:01:09.170> empty<00:01:09.499> cylinder<00:01:09.950> internally

cases<00:01:15.109> a<00:01:15.289> pressure<00:01:15.619> test<00:01:15.979> is<00:01:16.159> necessary<00:01:16.759> to

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
cases a pressure test is necessary to

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.090 
cases a pressure test is necessary to
verify<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.750> integrity<00:01:18.380> of<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:18.740> agent

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
verify the integrity of the agent

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.649 
verify the integrity of the agent
cylinder<00:01:21.130> we<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:22.310> refill<00:01:22.819> the<00:01:23.060> extinguisher

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
cylinder we then refill the extinguisher

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.889 
cylinder we then refill the extinguisher
with<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.990> proper<00:01:24.380> amount<00:01:24.649> of<00:01:24.799> chemical<00:01:25.310> agent

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
with the proper amount of chemical agent

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.839 
with the proper amount of chemical agent
next<00:01:26.899> we<00:01:27.109> install<00:01:27.439> a<00:01:27.469> verification<00:01:27.920> collar<00:01:28.490> to

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:28.849 
next we install a verification collar to

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:30.130 
next we install a verification collar to
demonstrate<00:01:29.299> that<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.569> unit<00:01:29.899> has<00:01:30.109> been

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
demonstrate that the unit has been

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.389 
demonstrate that the unit has been
disassembled<00:01:31.039> and<00:01:32.770> then<00:01:33.770> reinstall<00:01:34.369> the

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
disassembled and then reinstall the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.399 
disassembled and then reinstall the
valve<00:01:34.609> assembly<00:01:37.630> we'll<00:01:38.630> repressurize<00:01:39.380> the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
valve assembly we'll repressurize the

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.830 
valve assembly we'll repressurize the
extinguisher<00:01:40.219> to<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.700> specified<00:01:41.209> operating

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.889 
extinguisher to the specified operating
pressure<00:01:43.030> then<00:01:44.030> a<00:01:44.060> leak<00:01:44.329> check<00:01:44.569> is<00:01:44.719> performed

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
pressure then a leak check is performed

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.749 
pressure then a leak check is performed
to<00:01:45.349> make<00:01:45.439> sure<00:01:45.739> the<00:01:45.890> unit<00:01:46.189> is<00:01:46.280> holding<00:01:46.640> its

to make sure the unit is holding its
pressure<00:01:47.030> charge<00:01:48.549> finally<00:01:49.549> we'll<00:01:49.819> reinstall

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
pressure charge finally we'll reinstall

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.990 
pressure charge finally we'll reinstall
