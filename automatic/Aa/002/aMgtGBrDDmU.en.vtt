00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.020
 asked to do a tour of my apartment and 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.120
 I 'll finally do it today, I 'll show you 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.490
 only the most interesting rooms 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.740
 let's start the first room is mine 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.860
 living room here I spend almost all my 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.860
 time 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.010
 the original really wanted to carry this 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 the regiment I did not like me I just 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.480
 I wanted you for an apartment visually more 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.660
 but they didn't let me because i'm renting 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 this apartment and to make it more 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.859
 attractive I will not put all 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.670
 interesting decorations and items further 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.340
 my dinner table he was assembled on 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.640
 Custom color and shape, I chose not the most 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.170
 he resembles a detail from a barbie house 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.860
 such a nice modern barbie 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.739
 house personally, I think there is nothing more 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.239
 inspiring than nature and precisely 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.989
 so I tried to buy as much as possible 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.850
 more sorts of plants to your room and 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.920
 I even regret that I completely did not do my 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.930
 flat style rustic sea ​​are they if you 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.930
 I wonder what kind of style google 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.379
 but 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.110
 me 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.660
 with 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.060
 in general, then in this apartment prevails 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.230
 light and wooden tones but despite 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.480
 I decided to choose 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.940
 very bright details such as for example 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.860
 my couch advice for those who like to spend 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.800
 a lot of time on the couch 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.479
 be sure to buy yourself such a blanket 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.190
 he is not only visually beautiful but also 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.430
 help out in winter when it happens very 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.800
 cold on my bedroom 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.250
 Pastel prevails here. 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.530
 blue color since my desktop 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.750
 is the background for many of my videos I 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.680
 tried very hard to decorate it and 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.570
 made him the accent of my room about 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.160
 accessories in my room I rented a hall 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.840

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.479
 of

 created for the bathroom 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.790

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.320
 it looks and the fact that it is wooden so 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.320
 I put it in my room

 I found my chair in the veranda section but 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.310
 to make it more so vintage 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.290
 and at the same time suitable for my 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.470
