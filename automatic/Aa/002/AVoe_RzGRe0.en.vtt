00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.610
 hello dear friends here is video game 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.920
 like the ones from retro video game reviews and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.460
 I welcome you to my video review 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.769
 to the walking dead survival instinct 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.869
 we are watching the wii u version today 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.760
 of the game and I'll just show you 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.210
 Something about playing everything on the box 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.210
 Has 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.559
 this is the game for 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.870
 series 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.370
 I only got dead from the walking 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.649
 a few follow I am now 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.300
 not a rock hard fan what i find in 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.550
 even positive in this case 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.230
 because I approach the game very objectively 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.690
 gone and also very objectively about 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.640
 I can judge the game myself 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.010
 zombie games really like that 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.600
 what like capcoms resident evil series 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.100
 or jean guillou for the wii u 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.100
 I actually find pretty cool the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.110
 walking dead survival instinct acts 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.299
 it is a prequel to the series 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.490
 the game was developed by terminal 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.869
 reality that time for the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.880
 pretty cool bloodrayne series 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.009
 were responsible or recent 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 past the ghostbusters the movie 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.430
 had developed a game 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.560
 you should not play with the game 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.090
 tell tale adventure confuse something very much 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.920
 based on the comics 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:36.180
 the walking dead on arrival instincts 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:38.369
 based on the tv series kombi zur 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.400
 story the events are playing in front of them 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.500
 the tv series of the fixed the playable 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.299
 character and his brother beat more 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.950
 shortly after the zombie outbreak of 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.920
 georgia to atlanta by acting 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.840
 only one goal and that survive 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.360
 The story is very thin because of it 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.310
 There is nothing else than survival 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.110
 ensures that the main and the 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.340
 Nebencharaktere relatively flat 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.600
 come over and absolutely none 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.920
 develop personality 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.560
 that comes a weak and 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.600
 uninspired story that is a total 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.039
 Contrast to the tv series which was a pity 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.300
 I have a story here 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.300
 much more on your money 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.840
 Gameplay Technique is 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.060
 the walking dead revival instincts around 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.680
 ego shooter with stuff elements man 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.510
 searches different locations like 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.350
 For example, abandoned communities 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.340
 resources 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.290
 you also meet up 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.630
 then characterize the white one 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.700
 tasks that can be done so eg 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.130
 you have to go for a cop a few 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.410
 Look for batteries or one in yourself 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.910
 eating a prison cell, for example 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.170
 bring 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.880
 this relaxes the game on us 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.440
 the additional characters settle one 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.060
 even if you because the tasks the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.220
 one have been assigned successfully 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.890
 done what I thought was pretty cool 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.900
 the resource management before you enter 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.850
 level has entered a menu in the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.700
 you have to specify what is taken 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.570
 The secondary characters can also be included 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.890
 be equipped and you can 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.940
 assign tasks so you can to 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.590
 example say that one of the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.420
 main characters must look for sprit 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.710
 or he for others the resources 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.970
 should look out or rather 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.980
 to stay with the car 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.810
 in the end you even decide who 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.250
 ride is allowed in the car is not 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.360
 really much space and you can only 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.170
 a certain number of people 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.120
 take 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.890
 so you can decide if you want the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.180
 head or he take the trucker 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.520
 everyone wanted to have different too 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.020
 attributes but in pure 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.990
 play does not really carry 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.120
 come yes come to drive there is 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.709
 different ways to choose 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.510
 This creates a very big 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.530
 replay value because you in the first 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.050
 passage of the game not all 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.820
 villages see the paths all 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.440
 fork and you really have to decide 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.390
 Which way one takes then depending on 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.190
 decision you have, for example, synonymous high 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.989
 fuel consumption or the quality 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.610
 resources are fluctuating and also the strength 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.440
 and the number of zombies varies 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.580
 After decision I found pretty cool 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.989
 and along with the resources 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.870
 Management is real here 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.090
 freedom of choice in the game what you do 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.709
 against it was not that was the 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.630
 Repeat tasks very quickly 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.280
 sneaks and gathers easily and collects 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.650
 the zombies are pretty , too 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.000
 silly well i eat my zombies and the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.489
 Of course, they are not smarter but the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.930
 here is really not mature here 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.430
 a real mother never arises and 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.260
 if you then give a shot then 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.820
 the sun is flying all to one 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.430
 and you have almost no chance 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.410
 more 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.800
 had it far better solve 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.449
 there can be the game next to xbox 360 and 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.280
 Playstation 3 also on the rail and 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:30.289
 I wanted to have the original version for testing 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.520
 Here are a few words to the 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.770
 review features lose 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.030
 you have an inventory on the gamepad 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.030
 is pretty cool because you go through 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.830
 the inventory and the gamepad very much 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.729
 fast on various things in the budget 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.919
 can access 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.060
 this saves the annoying in the menu 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.190
 go and pick I found pretty 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.860
 cool made more features offers the 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.590
 but unfortunately not so it is 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.120
 very very limited and not so good 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.979
 expanded as for example the direct 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.979
 competitors jean guillou from ubisoft 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.250
 yes graphically presented the game 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.140
 not so good we have it here 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.150
 muddy textures to do stiffer 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.950
 We see animations and there are 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.050
 various graphics and clipping errors 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.120
 Nevertheless, it is under visual optics 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.620
 nicely done and the atmosphere is in 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.460
 some locations pretty well 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.190
 captured 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.900
 for the year 2013 we both have 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.740
 walking dead survival instincts be it 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.870
 but with one sooner 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.290
 below average jean title too 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.970
 do 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.310
 pity there would have been much more in it 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.230
 you can do that on the other side 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.540
 English speaker doing her job pretty 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.550
 Cool the main characters are from the 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.290
 original actors dubbed 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.700
 a nice soundtrack and very good 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.710
 summer noises are a perfect fit 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.540
 have done happen on the other side 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.820
 but we also have weak sound and weapons 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.540
 effects and that does not quite fit 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.410
 the formula horror atmosphere yes 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.830
 Create activision in this game 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.830
 wanted 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.090
 let's come to the conclusion the walking dead 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.860
 survival instinct has a lot of potential 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.990
 have original characters we have that 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.490
 resource management we have the level 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.170
 selection while driving 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.970
 but unfortunately everything fails at the 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.070
 Implementation under engineering is easy 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.720
 too monotonous and graphically too good 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.550
 I had the feeling that part of that 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.090
 play released a bit too early 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.920
 has been 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.370
 It's just a typical license game 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.370
 what a shame
