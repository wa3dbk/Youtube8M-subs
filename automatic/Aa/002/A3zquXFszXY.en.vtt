00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 hello people also a bad hair day 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 game over 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.519
 As I then congratulate 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.020
 if it does then maybe you can 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.730
 this video I have helped me namely 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.529
 Three people are picked out 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.449
 very good to do a bad hair day 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.220
 can and once an open 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.099
 variant a top variant and a 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.330
 right hairstyles variant and this 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.070
 I would like to see you in this video 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.480
 show because I think everyone of us has 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.059
 One could do his bad hair day and then 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.980
 that may be a possibility for 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.940
 be you and that's why I wish you 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.410
 Now have fun with these three hairstyles 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.120
 the first hairstyle is the one I want 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.149
 my hair despite bad hair day please 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.590
 openly wearing hairstyle and around the whole 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.059
 I use a little bit better 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.219
 dry shampoo which I easily 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.230
 Everywhere a bit above all 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.300
 distribute in my hair and then with 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.219
 the simple fingering a massage so that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.530
 the hair looks a bit better 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.239
 a bit more handy then than 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.250
 Next I copy with a top her 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.730
 Only the harpoon came 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.350
 above 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.119
 it's not about an incredible amount 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.939
 creating volume just a bit like that 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.470
 to be and then it is usually at 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.119
 bad hair days to stand the claim 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.400
 they also sit in secret because of that 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.710
 I eliminate the teens they are attacking 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.780
 a rotating and rear a little zoom 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.310
 before and the whole so this rove 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.310
 then moor underneath 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.320
 on the other side of symmetry 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.120
 because of the same game streak take 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.670
 moor and the hair her 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.890
 have raised the whole then think 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.360
 arrange a little bit on my account and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.340
 Now I'll go with you again 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.020
 The curling iron really only in the ends 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.090
 and really just for a moment 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.830
 a bit more movement in the hair 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.820
 to bring so choose or curl 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.970
 something like that 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.860
 and then I have a whole at the end 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.990
 simple hairstyle really that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.550
 but it is not easy now 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.050
 Unbelievably much , but looks at everyone 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.250
 case for the day is well suited for 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.800
 the school or something 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.410
 and then you definitely can 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.180
 Let's go now to the pigtail variant and it 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.950
 lends itself to a headgear 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.509
 to sit up if you have a bad hair day 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.480
 then there are different ones and me 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.450
 decide me in this case for one 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.980
 hat and start but first to mine 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.989
 hair all on one side to pack 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.660
 front strands outside if 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.340
 they should stay outside and the whole thing 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.200
 just need to bring in one page 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.140
 should then be the headgear of my 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.000
 choice to sit up and then I bad 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.530
 just something I like to fen 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.090
 advertises that a fishbone braid is one 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.530
 normal plaited braid the whole 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.060
 let me link you mine 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.860
 herringbone instruction below in the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.320
 infobox if that is braided 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.810
 voluminous I do all this and then 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.130
 I have a hairstyle so easy and so 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.019
 fast that I do not even talk to that 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.640
 come afterwards and if necessary can 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.320
 I even get the headgear 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.329
 exchange and different variants 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.569
 try it out and hiding it all well 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.760
 and looks somewhat like something 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.549
 and the third variant is me 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.370
 am a well it should definitely 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:07.269
 case at the end after hairstyle look hairstyle 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.590
 because I like it and it works 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.180
 but also easier than you think and 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.700
 Although I bring it all first 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.560
 Hair backwards and then start one 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.719
 to braid French plait 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.790
 how does this you find in yourself 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:20.709
 billions of millions of instructions 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.599
 youtube actually it's just braiding 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.760
 to take electricity with it again and again 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.200
 and that's exactly what I'm doing here 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.879
 through bad to the back and 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.799
 if you have come down completely 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:31.359
 loosely fluffy continue to braid like 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.609
 he does that properly is all you 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.349
 Leave hair gum rhine to the end 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.150
 and then I would be at the end of the pot 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.019
 to create a bit of space by being there 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.540
 a little bit 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.370
 Well, actually, the whole thing 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.780
 bit apart with it 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.310
 then you can want the braid 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.739
 they can work inside and inside 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.389
 can hide and best fixed 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.400
 the whole thing with h pinch it 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.709
 you really need it 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.060
 not so much that it is relatively stable and 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.919
 then you have one in the back 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.000
 figure who looks like more work than 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.250
 she was actually 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.359
 For me it's all natural now 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.340
 still a bit too strict 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.530
 that's why it's too cheap just to streak 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.060
 out and in the end I have one 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.609
 I definitely want hairstyle in everyday life 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.590
 Can not wear the unmade 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.750
 looks 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.030
 and yes just in the room hairstyle field 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.620
 I chose the three hairstyles 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.389
 for simplicity beauty and fast 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.650
 because it's easy when you're supposed to 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.970
 school goes or so fast in the morning 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.440
 have to go and if I arrive there now 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.330

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.310
 have lasted an hour then the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.050
