moving to Google Apps for Education we

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.920 
moving to Google Apps for Education we
were<00:02:19.489> so<00:02:19.640> happy<00:02:19.849> to<00:02:20.030> see<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.180> Meraki<00:02:20.540> now<00:02:20.749> has

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
were so happy to see that Meraki now has

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.270 
were so happy to see that Meraki now has
content<00:02:21.319> filtering<00:02:21.620> built<00:02:21.829> in<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.189> that

content filtering built in and that

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.190 
content filtering built in and that
they're<00:02:22.730> adding<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.389> that<00:02:23.420> content<00:02:23.870> filtering

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
they're adding to that content filtering

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.890 
they're adding to that content filtering
a<00:02:24.499> lot<00:02:24.920> more<00:02:25.129> so<00:02:25.879> we<00:02:26.120> will<00:02:26.150> continue<00:02:26.659> to<00:02:26.780> rely

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
a lot more so we will continue to rely

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.680 
a lot more so we will continue to rely

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
that I can give for why we held back was

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.070 
that I can give for why we held back was
because<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.550> kept<00:02:56.820> thinking<00:02:57.240> that<00:02:57.570> I<00:02:57.780> was<00:02:57.960> going

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
to somehow wake up and that this wasn't
