constructed in various size planks and
are<00:01:48.060> supported<00:01:48.569> by<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.750> clear<00:01:49.080> legs<00:01:49.319> that

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
are supported by the clear legs that

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.719 
are supported by the clear legs that
reach<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.069> bottom<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.640> pool

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.340 

the<00:01:54.729> platforms<00:01:55.299> are<00:01:55.420> long<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.630> narrow<00:01:56.020> and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
the platforms are long and narrow and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.609 
the platforms are long and narrow and
are<00:01:56.829> best<00:01:57.070> seen<00:01:57.429> from<00:01:57.700> low<00:01:57.909> angles<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
are best seen from low angles the

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.440 
are best seen from low angles the
platforms<00:02:00.189> are<00:02:00.310> hard<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.670> see<00:02:00.880> from<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.149> sides

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
platforms are hard to see from the sides

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.660 
platforms are hard to see from the sides
so<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.380> camera<00:02:02.740> angles<00:02:03.070> are<00:02:03.219> carefully

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
so the camera angles are carefully

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.999 
so the camera angles are carefully
chosen<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:04.299> plotted<00:02:05.049> out<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.350> make<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.740> trick

slightly above the surface so you can

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.860 
slightly above the surface so you can
