particularly maybe this is a case of Tim

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.730 
particularly maybe this is a case of Tim
Bradley's<00:02:50.950> heart<00:02:52.290> getting<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.350> better<00:02:53.530> of

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
Bradley's heart getting the better of

as<00:02:57.580> far<00:02:57.730> as<00:02:57.880> I'm<00:02:57.970> concerned<00:02:58.000> he<00:02:58.420> would<00:02:58.570> get

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
as far as I'm concerned he would get

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.480 
as far as I'm concerned he would get
destroyed<00:03:00.070> by<00:03:00.580> Gennady<00:03:01.570> golovkin<00:03:02.280> maybe<00:03:03.280> girl

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
destroyed by Gennady golovkin maybe girl

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.920 
destroyed by Gennady golovkin maybe girl

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
of kin ain't used to fighting a guy so

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.900 
of kin ain't used to fighting a guy so
sure<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.920> speed<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.340> Bradley<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:06.790> all

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
sure and the speed of Bradley and all

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.480 
sure and the speed of Bradley and all
that<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:08.020> wouldn't<00:03:08.710> take<00:03:08.890> him<00:03:09.070> that<00:03:09.220> long<00:03:09.280> to

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
that it wouldn't take him that long to

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.610 
that it wouldn't take him that long to
catch<00:03:09.730> up<00:03:09.970> with<00:03:10.120> him<00:03:10.180> in<00:03:10.330> my<00:03:10.360> opinion<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.200> Tim

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
catch up with him in my opinion and Tim

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.080 
catch up with him in my opinion and Tim
Bradley<00:03:11.860> don't<00:03:12.190> have<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:12.490> power<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.820> get

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
Bradley don't have the power to get

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.700 
Bradley don't have the power to get
golovkin's<00:03:13.510> respect<00:03:13.990> and<00:03:14.140> keep<00:03:14.260> him<00:03:14.410> off<00:03:14.560> him

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
golovkin's respect and keep him off him

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.520 
golovkin's respect and keep him off him
so<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.670> would<00:03:15.970> obviously<00:03:16.420> be<00:03:16.780> taking<00:03:16.900> girl<00:03:17.380> off

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
so I would obviously be taking girl off

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.990 
so I would obviously be taking girl off
game<00:03:17.710> by<00:03:17.740> a<00:03:17.860> stoppage<00:03:18.250> in<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.550> fight<00:03:18.760> and

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940
