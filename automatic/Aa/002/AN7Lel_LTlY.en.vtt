00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.710 

see<00:00:33.070> right<00:00:33.250> here<00:00:33.430> oh<00:00:34.230> nice

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.360 

the<00:00:38.960> other<00:00:39.110> thing<00:00:39.380> is<00:00:39.530> how<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.770> baller<00:00:40.070> door

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
the other thing is how the baller door

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.160 
the other thing is how the baller door
systems<00:00:40.880> there's<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.150> limiter<00:00:41.570> strapped<00:00:41.900> here

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
systems there's a limiter strapped here

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.980 
systems there's a limiter strapped here
okay<00:00:42.800> but<00:00:43.430> you<00:00:43.550> can<00:00:43.730> pull<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.150> pin<00:00:44.420> on<00:00:44.660> the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
okay but you can pull a pin on the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.270 
okay but you can pull a pin on the
inside<00:00:45.290> of<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:45.410> limiter<00:00:45.680> strap<00:00:45.950> there<00:00:46.130> and

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
inside of the limiter strap there and

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.530 
inside of the limiter strap there and
then<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:46.490> can<00:00:46.580> lift<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:46.940> door<00:00:47.090> off<00:00:47.150> the<00:00:47.240> door

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
then you can lift the door off the door

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.380 
then you can lift the door off the door
weighs<00:00:47.750> approximately<00:00:47.930> 35<00:00:48.650> okay<00:00:48.830> so<00:00:49.760> it<00:00:49.880> steps

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
weighs approximately 35 okay so it steps

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.760 
weighs approximately 35 okay so it steps
right<00:00:50.570> up<00:00:50.630> off<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:50.990> there<00:00:51.290> then<00:00:51.440> it's<00:00:51.620> got<00:00:51.740> a

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
right up off of there then it's got a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.070 
right up off of there then it's got a
nice<00:00:51.980> seal<00:00:52.280> around<00:00:52.490> the<00:00:52.760> top<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.360> on<00:00:53.990> the

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
nice seal around the top and on the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.240 
nice seal around the top and on the
sides<00:00:54.380> and<00:00:55.390> so<00:00:56.390> is<00:00:56.630> that<00:00:56.810> your<00:00:57.410> door<00:00:57.620> system<00:00:58.100> is

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
sides and so is that your door system is

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.120 
sides and so is that your door system is
that<00:00:58.370> something<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:59.350> an<00:01:00.350> end<00:01:00.650> user<00:01:00.710> can

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
that something that an end user can

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.520 
that something that an end user can
install<00:01:01.400> themselves<00:01:02.030> totally<00:01:02.530> what's

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
install themselves totally what's

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.510 
install themselves totally what's
involved<00:01:03.830> in<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:05.920> if<00:01:06.920> they're<00:01:07.100> doing<00:01:07.250> our

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
involved in that if they're doing our

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.580 
involved in that if they're doing our
enclosure<00:01:07.880> system<00:01:08.830> you're<00:01:09.830> probably<00:01:09.860> looking

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
enclosure system you're probably looking

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.750 
enclosure system you're probably looking
guards<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:12.950> that<00:01:13.070> would<00:01:13.190> include<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.490> heater

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
guards and that would include the heater

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.160 
guards and that would include the heater
too<00:01:14.000> because<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.080> heater<00:01:15.290> we<00:01:16.190> run<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.580> defrost

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
too because the heater we run a defrost

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.780 
too because the heater we run a defrost
with<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.290> heater<00:01:18.500> and<00:01:18.710> then<00:01:19.340> there's<00:01:19.610> two

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
with the heater and then there's two

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.910 
with the heater and then there's two
vents<00:01:20.119> below<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.080> dash<00:01:21.259> for<00:01:21.619> your<00:01:21.740> lower

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
vents below the dash for your lower

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.370 
vents below the dash for your lower
extremities

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.600 

so<00:01:29.380> that<00:01:29.500> would<00:01:29.620> be<00:01:29.770> one<00:01:30.010> of<00:01:30.040> the<00:01:30.160> first<00:01:30.400> things

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
so that would be one of the first things

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.490 
so that would be one of the first things
that<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.820> do<00:01:31.090> when<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:31.900> would<00:01:32.020> be<00:01:32.140> putting

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
that you do when you would be putting

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.880 
that you do when you would be putting
the<00:01:32.620> cap<00:01:32.830> system<00:01:33.100> on<00:01:33.430> and<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:35.110> six<00:01:35.380> into<00:01:35.800> the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
the cap system on and this six into the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.070 
the cap system on and this six into the
hydraulics<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.580> your<00:01:36.730> vehicle<00:01:37.270> and<00:01:37.510> then<00:01:37.930> it's

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
hydraulics of your vehicle and then it's

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.870 
hydraulics of your vehicle and then it's
got<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.260> here<00:01:38.500> control<00:01:38.920> valve<00:01:39.190> it<00:01:39.430> allows<00:01:39.670> you

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
got a here control valve it allows you

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.390 
got a here control valve it allows you
to<00:01:39.970> turn<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.510> hot<00:01:40.780> water<00:01:40.810> on<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.470> off<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:42.220> even

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
to turn the hot water on and off so even

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.100 
to turn the hot water on and off so even
in<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.670> summertime<00:01:43.240> you<00:01:43.270> can<00:01:43.570> turn<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.960> hot

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
in the summertime you can turn the hot

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.260 
in the summertime you can turn the hot
water<00:01:44.140> off<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.800> use<00:01:44.980> a<00:01:45.010> fan<00:01:45.400> for<00:01:45.910> keeping<00:01:46.150> the

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
water off and use a fan for keeping the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.090 
water off and use a fan for keeping the
dust<00:01:46.420> down<00:01:46.660> in<00:01:46.900> the<00:01:46.990> Calgary<00:01:47.200> also<00:01:47.800> blowing

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
dust down in the Calgary also blowing

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.850 
dust down in the Calgary also blowing
some<00:01:48.340> air<00:01:48.430> on<00:01:48.610> your<00:01:48.760> here<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:50.440> now<00:01:50.590> is<00:01:50.740> there

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
some air on your here so now is there

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.150 
some air on your here so now is there
any<00:01:52.080> structural<00:01:53.080> modification<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:54.040> any
