00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
think it's just a 3d rail maybe if you

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.010 
think it's just a 3d rail maybe if you
guys<00:01:39.820> have<00:01:40.060> any<00:01:40.149> opinions<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.720> can<00:01:40.869> leave

because<00:02:28.159> supposedly<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:29.609> brick<00:02:29.969> in<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.209> back

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
because supposedly the brick in the back

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.819 
because supposedly the brick in the back
left<00:02:30.689> looked<00:02:31.019> a<00:02:31.109> little<00:02:31.230> bit<00:02:31.409> different<00:02:31.739> and

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
left looked a little bit different and

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.770 
left looked a little bit different and
I'll<00:02:32.640> zoom<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.939> on<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> break<00:02:33.299> in<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.659> me

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
I'll zoom it on the break in to me

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.539 
I'll zoom it on the break in to me
honestly<00:02:34.019> it<00:02:34.379> really<00:02:34.650> does<00:02:35.099> not<00:02:35.250> look<00:02:35.489> that

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
honestly it really does not look that

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.459 
honestly it really does not look that
much<00:02:36.000> different<00:02:36.030> like<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.629> you<00:02:37.049> know<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.170> can

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
much different like it you know I can

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:38.929 
much different like it you know I can
still<00:02:37.739> clearly<00:02:38.010> tell<00:02:38.280> us<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> break<00:02:38.730> there's

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939 
still clearly tell us a break there's

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.240 
still clearly tell us a break there's
really<00:02:39.239> nothing<00:02:39.629> on<00:02:39.719> top<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.139> guess<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> do

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
really nothing on top I guess I do

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.709 
really nothing on top I guess I do
understand<00:02:41.879> where<00:02:42.000> some<00:02:42.180> people<00:02:42.209> came<00:02:42.540> from

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
understand where some people came from

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.809 
understand where some people came from
but<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.379> carpets<00:02:44.010> are<00:02:44.129> not<00:02:44.280> coming<00:02:44.670> with

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
somebody where my friends actually was

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.929 
somebody where my friends actually was
saying<00:02:46.889> which<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.129> actually<00:02:47.310> really<00:02:47.670> cool

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:47.939 
saying which is actually really cool

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.729 
saying which is actually really cool
because<00:02:48.090> he<00:02:48.389> actually<00:02:48.480> looked<00:02:48.810> into<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.170> he

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
because he actually looked into it he

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.080 
because he actually looked into it he
said<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.159> they're<00:02:50.310> changed<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.849> MIT

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
said that they're changed the MIT

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
mapping which is like some technical

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.440 
mapping which is like some technical
stuff<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:53.280> basically<00:02:53.670> what<00:02:53.879> that<00:02:53.939> means<00:02:54.090> is

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
stuff but basically what that means is

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.990 
stuff but basically what that means is
that<00:02:54.510> they're<00:02:55.409> doing<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.889> so<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.639> things

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
that they're doing that so like things

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.149 
that they're doing that so like things
can<00:02:57.299> load<00:02:57.569> better<00:02:57.900> like<00:02:58.200> like<00:02:58.650> further<00:02:58.919> away

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
can load better like like further away

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.390 
can load better like like further away
and<00:02:59.519> stuff<00:02:59.669> and<00:02:59.909> he<00:03:00.139> said<00:03:01.139> possibly<00:03:01.859> obviously

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
and stuff and he said possibly obviously

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.580 
and stuff and he said possibly obviously
unlimited<00:03:02.879> worlds<00:03:03.269> are<00:03:03.419> like<00:03:03.569> not<00:03:03.780> coming<00:03:04.139> but

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
unlimited worlds are like not coming but

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.459 
unlimited worlds are like not coming but
he<00:03:04.680> said<00:03:04.889> maybe<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:06.000> like<00:03:06.359> they<00:03:06.540> may<00:03:06.750> be<00:03:07.139> sort

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:07.469 
he said maybe that like they may be sort

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.709 
he said maybe that like they may be sort
of<00:03:07.530> instead<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.549> doing<00:03:08.939> just<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.419> height

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
of instead of doing just the height

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.720 
of instead of doing just the height
limit<00:03:10.019> increase<00:03:10.349> they<00:03:10.650> may<00:03:10.859> be<00:03:10.889> expanding<00:03:11.609> it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
limit increase they may be expanding it

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.759 
limit increase they may be expanding it
you<00:03:11.849> know<00:03:11.989> sideways<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.169> stuff<00:03:13.379> so<00:03:13.530> he<00:03:13.620> may<00:03:13.709> be

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
you know sideways and stuff so he may be

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.080 
you know sideways and stuff so he may be

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.309 
the wither skeleton or the wither boss
will<00:03:48.120> not<00:03:48.150> actually<00:03:48.599> be<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:49.019> this<00:03:49.109> update

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
will not actually be in this update

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.039 
will not actually be in this update
it'll<00:03:49.709> be<00:03:49.889> in<00:03:50.099> a<00:03:50.280> later<00:03:50.699> update<00:03:50.819> it's<00:03:51.479> just<00:03:51.930> the

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
it'll be in a later update it's just the

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.990 
it'll be in a later update it's just the
mob<00:03:52.229> heads<00:03:52.470> for<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:52.769> so<00:03:53.340> we<00:03:53.519> will<00:03:53.549> have<00:03:53.879> to

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
mob heads for now so we will have to

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.789 
mob heads for now so we will have to
wait<00:03:54.150> for<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.569> but<00:03:55.259> at<00:03:55.379> least<00:03:55.470> we<00:03:55.650> have<00:03:55.769> the

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
wait for that but at least we have the

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.110 
wait for that but at least we have the
heads<00:03:56.040> for<00:03:56.189> now<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.489> I<00:03:56.519> guess<00:03:56.729> that<00:03:56.909> that's

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
heads for now so I guess that that's

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.240 
heads for now so I guess that that's
pretty<00:03:57.389> good<00:03:57.629> now<00:03:58.199> the<00:03:58.290> next<00:03:58.439> tweet<00:03:58.799> they<00:03:59.040> have
