00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.879
 how are you guys this is a video 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.460
 very basic very short on one of the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.960
 easier ways to sound from 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.820
 clarinet this is for those who barely 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.889
 are beginning to play the clarinet is 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.420
 something very simple very basic so that 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.630
 it sounds very easy what they call the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.330
 mouthpiece 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.189
 to begin with we need only these two 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.949
 parts of the clarinet what is the 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.109
 keg or barrel and nozzle with 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.640
 the cane and the clamp can also be 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.309
 only with the mouthpiece that is what 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.769
 we need to know first the cane is going to 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.170
 go resting on the lower lip and 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:41.680
 this one is covering the teeth 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.850
 lower so let's do it 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.769
 it covers 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.079
 and the upper teeth are going to go 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.379
 supported on top of the 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.379
 nozzle 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.400
 once having this very clear we are going to 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.580
 try to close all the muscles 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.650
 try what they call as embrace the 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.940
 mouthpiece with all the muscles of the 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.940
 lips and face 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.320
 ready then the most important declarant 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:16.359
 is to try to put a lot of air into 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.659
 instrument the idea is that it sounds like this 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.659
 way 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.050
 let's practice that many times 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.940
 putting a lot of air always and we're going to 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.610
 try to generate a little more 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.770
 pressure careful without biting a lot because 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.900
 we avoid the entry of air we go to 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.330
 try to put a little pressure on 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.410
 the speed air to try to 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.410
 get out that sound 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.079
 ah 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.750
 the idea is that it sounds like that we should 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.670
 do after just try to 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.090
 keep that sound as stable 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.320
 possible the longest to try to go 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.900
 exercising very well the muscles that 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.310
 we need to expel the air and 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.380
 after that we can place 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.110
 all the clarinet and try to do 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.940
 exactly the same without supporting us alone 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.540
 in the back without covering any 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.540
 orifice 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.450
 remember the most important thing is that the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.090
 air comes out very stable 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.280
 so practice how much I hope that 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.439
 it works for them and anything 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.879
 write remember to subscribe and we 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.879
 we see in the next video
