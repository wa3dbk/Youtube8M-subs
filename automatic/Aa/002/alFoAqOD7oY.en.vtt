00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.520
 hello everyone with you channel to others and in this 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.580
 I will tell you the best tutorial video 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.180
 use force staff to collect 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:29.900
 force staff we need to buy a bid in 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:36.650
 wizard per thousand rings regeneration 350 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:39.850
 and recipe for 900 than force staff better 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:44.059
 Daguer yes he has less range 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.350
 but he shall not break when you are attacked with 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:53.150
 using it you can easily get away from 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.000
 the enemy can do this through 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.640
 textures in different places 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.489
 now you will see approximately how 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.640
 done here I run force staff not 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.290
 I get off easy 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:12.070
 your enemy can do it as light 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.409
 so for the darkness there are many different such 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.450
 jumpable places with 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.180
 using force staff if you had 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.090
 dagger when attacking, he would get off and here 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.540
 never managed to leave for this stuff 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.540
 not this way 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:38.060
 you can only leave the camp 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.060
 and retaining skills 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.929
 you can also run into your hand when you 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.469
 They ran bunk you can not see you 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.770
 gain time the same leaves the force 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.420
 staff 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.810
