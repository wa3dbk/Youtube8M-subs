have at our common issue is that the
hole<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.230> faucet<00:00:13.769> above<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.250> sink<00:00:14.519> leaks

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
hole in the faucet above the sink leaks

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.410 
hole in the faucet above the sink leaks
water<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.139> that's<00:00:16.470> caused<00:00:17.119> here<00:00:18.119> we<00:00:18.270> have<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
water and that's caused here we have a

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.689 
water and that's caused here we have a
little<00:00:18.690> kind<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.680> breakdown<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.220> what<00:00:20.550> your

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
little kind of a breakdown of what your

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.279 
little kind of a breakdown of what your
faucet<00:00:21.180> looks<00:00:21.359> like<00:00:21.539> here's<00:00:21.779> what<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.050> see

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
faucet looks like here's what you see

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.590 
faucet looks like here's what you see
from<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.650> sink<00:00:22.949> up<00:00:23.160> this<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.449> don't

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
from the sink up this is what you don't

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.210 
from the sink up this is what you don't
see<00:00:24.930> that's<00:00:25.230> beneath<00:00:25.560> your<00:00:25.800> saying<00:00:26.070> you've

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
see that's beneath your saying you've

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.880 
see that's beneath your saying you've
got<00:00:26.250> three<00:00:26.670> lines<00:00:26.849> here<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
got three lines here one this is the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.650 
got three lines here one this is the
good<00:00:29.039> water<00:00:29.279> as<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.550> comes<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.939> your<00:00:30.119> faucet

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
good water as it comes in to your faucet

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.720 
good water as it comes in to your faucet
this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.650> drain<00:00:31.920> water<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.399> comes<00:00:32.550> from

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
this is the drain water that comes from

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.400 
this is the drain water that comes from
your<00:00:33.149> reverse<00:00:33.420> osmosis<00:00:33.809> unit<00:00:34.290> that's

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
your reverse osmosis unit that's

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.130 
your reverse osmosis unit that's
typically<00:00:34.860> read<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.760> line<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.780> for

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
typically read this line here but for

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.690 
typically read this line here but for
today<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.309> different<00:00:38.610> color

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
today we just have it a different color

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.139 
today we just have it a different color
so<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:40.550> one<00:00:41.550> here<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.000> what

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
so you can see this one here is what

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209 
so you can see this one here is what
connects<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.840> drain<00:00:43.050> itself<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.160> only

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
connects to the drain itself the only

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.860 
connects to the drain itself the only
difference<00:00:44.640> between<00:00:44.730> these<00:00:45.090> two<00:00:45.329> lines<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
difference between these two lines and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.959 
difference between these two lines and
be<00:00:45.960> telling<00:00:46.289> difference<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.860> this<00:00:47.610> one<00:00:47.670> is

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
be telling difference is this one is

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.310 
be telling difference is this one is
always<00:00:48.210> smaller<00:00:48.539> than<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.050> one<00:00:49.170> that

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
always smaller than the one that

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.439 
always smaller than the one that
actually<00:00:49.440> goes<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.100> drain<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.120> normal

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
actually goes the drain so the normal

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.450 
actually goes the drain so the normal
operation<00:00:52.140> water<00:00:52.440> comes<00:00:52.829> from<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.219> reverse

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
operation water comes from your reverse

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.000 
operation water comes from your reverse
osmosis<00:00:53.910> unit<00:00:54.480> up<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.230> your<00:00:55.350> faucet<00:00:55.620> and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
osmosis unit up to your faucet and

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.770 
osmosis unit up to your faucet and
literally<00:00:56.520> falls<00:00:56.850> through<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.270> small<00:00:57.539> pocket

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
literally falls through a small pocket

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.290 
literally falls through a small pocket
of<00:00:58.020> air<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.620> called<00:00:59.129> an<00:00:59.250> air<00:00:59.399> gap<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.090> that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
of air here called an air gap and that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.119 
of air here called an air gap and that
basically<00:01:00.690> keeps<00:01:00.960> any<00:01:01.289> drain<00:01:01.590> water<00:01:01.829> from

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
basically keeps any drain water from

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.060 
basically keeps any drain water from
back<00:01:02.460> siphoning<00:01:03.420> into<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.260> filter<00:01:04.619> system

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
back siphoning into your filter system

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.830 
back siphoning into your filter system
so<00:01:05.519> normal<00:01:05.909> operation<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.659> water

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so normal operation you have water

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.859 
so normal operation you have water
flowing<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.880> tube<00:01:09.210> here<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
flowing in here out this tube here and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.260 
flowing in here out this tube here and
running<00:01:10.439> out<00:01:10.799> into<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.130> drain<00:01:11.460> something

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
running out into your drain something

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.770 
running out into your drain something
like<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.890> so<00:01:13.890> what<00:01:14.100> happens<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:15.540> stuff

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
like that so what happens is what stuff

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.679 
like that so what happens is what stuff
grows<00:01:16.140> inside<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.130> tube<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.790> things<00:01:18.570> are

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
grows inside that tube as things are

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.410 
grows inside that tube as things are
want<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.229> grow<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.830> drains<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.210> get

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
want to grow and drains you get

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.469 
want to grow and drains you get
restriction<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.409> now<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.670> isn't<00:01:23.939> no<00:01:24.240> longer

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
restriction and now this isn't no longer

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.749 
restriction and now this isn't no longer
the<00:01:24.570> point<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.900> resistance<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.159> water<00:01:26.490> will

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the point of resistance so a water will

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.450 
the point of resistance so a water will
start<00:01:27.000> coming<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:28.110> hole<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.860> running

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
start coming out this hole and running

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.859 
start coming out this hole and running
all<00:01:29.549> over<00:01:29.790> your<00:01:29.939> sink<00:01:30.270> which<00:01:30.509> you've<00:01:30.689> probably

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
all over your sink which you've probably

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.120 
all over your sink which you've probably
seen<00:01:31.880> so<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.210> do<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.900> fix<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.710> we

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
seen so all we do to fix that is we

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.249 
seen so all we do to fix that is we
clear<00:01:35.369> off<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.700> drain<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.720> able<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.079> flow

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
clear off this drain it's able to flow

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.230 
clear off this drain it's able to flow
freely<00:01:37.500> again<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> water<00:01:38.310> stops<00:01:38.700> flowing<00:01:38.939> out

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
freely again and water stops flowing out

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.890 
freely again and water stops flowing out
the<00:01:39.390> air-gap

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the air-gap

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.080 
the air-gap
what<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.710> typically<00:01:41.159> see<00:01:41.460> underneath<00:01:41.820> your

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
what you typically see underneath your

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.300 
what you typically see underneath your
sink<00:01:42.390> where<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.899> line<00:01:43.649> connects<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> your

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
sink where the line connects to your

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.039 
sink where the line connects to your
drain<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> saddle<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.540> looks<00:01:45.810> something

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
drain is a saddle that looks something

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.670 
drain is a saddle that looks something
like<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.909> it's<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.270> threaded<00:01:49.079> compression

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680

fitting<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.640> will<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.000> screw<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.509> off

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250

and<00:01:53.250> we<00:01:53.640> pull<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.149> like<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.590> just

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and we pull on like that you can just

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.649 
and we pull on like that you can just
take<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> pipe<00:01:56.430> cleaner<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> wire<00:01:57.149> brush<00:01:57.479> or

some time clean that out the best
can<00:02:00.799> and<00:02:01.799> it's<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.070> good<00:02:02.220> time<00:02:02.280> also<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.689> clean

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450

step<00:02:06.960> rosin<00:02:07.380> there<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:08.009> also<00:02:08.360> these<00:02:09.360> have<00:02:09.869> a

step rosin there but also these have a

step rosin there but also these have a

things<00:02:12.030> under<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> sink<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:12.959> if<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.410> hole

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
things under the sink and if that hole

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.070 
things under the sink and if that hole
isn't<00:02:13.950> lined<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.489> right<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:15.420> also<00:02:15.750> will

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
isn't lined up just right that also will

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.199 
isn't lined up just right that also will
restrict<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> flow<00:02:16.800> but<00:02:17.640> once<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.880> got<00:02:18.000> that

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
restrict the flow but once you got that

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.000 
restrict the flow but once you got that
all<00:02:18.269> cleaned<00:02:18.660> down<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:20.519> grew<00:02:20.760> back<00:02:20.790> on

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
all cleaned down you just grew back on

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.400 
all cleaned down you just grew back on
so<00:02:23.010> long<00:02:23.220> as<00:02:23.400> it's<00:02:23.550> nice<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.540> tight<00:02:24.780> you

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
so long as it's nice and tight you

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.320 
so long as it's nice and tight you
shouldn't<00:02:25.709> have<00:02:25.830> any<00:02:25.890> further<00:02:26.489> problems<00:02:26.849> if

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
shouldn't have any further problems if

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.790 
shouldn't have any further problems if
the<00:02:27.450> problem<00:02:27.780> does<00:02:27.810> persist<00:02:28.440> there<00:02:28.680> is<00:02:28.769> a

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the problem does persist there is a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.220 
the problem does persist there is a
couple<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.220> other<00:02:29.400> solutions<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.870> you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
couple of other solutions and you

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.350 
couple of other solutions and you
wouldn't<00:02:31.530> call<00:02:31.709> our<00:02:31.830> office<00:02:32.220> at<00:02:32.760> seven<00:02:33.090> seven

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
wouldn't call our office at seven seven

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.930 
wouldn't call our office at seven seven
five<00:02:33.540> three<00:02:33.870> two<00:02:34.080> four<00:02:34.560> two<00:02:35.280> thousand<00:02:35.760> one
