00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello curious and curious from youtube today 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.240
 let's make candles with lightning what 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.639
 first thing we're going to need are molds 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.910
 in different ways and we are also going to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.540
 need colored waxes to make the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.490
 center hole we will use needles 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 these are the colors that we have 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.650
 chosen two for each mold now what 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.340
 we have to do is introduce them in 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.190
 each mold cited 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.460
 so would the result be this after 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.080
 remove and each one will be a color 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.480
 now let's put it inside the 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.370
 microwave we can put it about 8 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.460
 minutes but you can leave yourselves 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.970
 checking we put 8 minutes to maximum 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.970
 power 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.470
 and ready our dinners are already 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.070
 melted we just have to get it out of the 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.620
 microwave and put a few minutes 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.350
 freezer you can go looking to see 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.120
 when they are ready we go slowly 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.120
 that the molds do not move and we close 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.869
 once the mixture is dry 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.909
 only thing we have to do is go 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:12.650
 removing the mold little by little so that 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.330
 we only have the shape of our 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.330
 star is very cool 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.619
 so all the candles of all would be 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.950
 the colors that we have chosen 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.899
 now we only have to do one 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.840
 small little hole in the center for 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.969
 then put our our wick the 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.859
 wick can be a wick we have 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.829
 reused of candles that we do not want or 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.420
 You can also do it like that 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.490
 i would mount space so that 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.340
 break the center of our candle and this one 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.229
 it would be now only remains to check 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.119
 you chuli if more candles and put them in 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.119
 home and enjoy them
