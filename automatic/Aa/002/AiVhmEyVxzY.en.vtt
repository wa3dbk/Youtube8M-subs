00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
pay-per-view they have merchandising and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.140 
pay-per-view they have merchandising and
television<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.260> very<00:03:01.319> very<00:03:01.769> big<00:03:02.069> so<00:03:02.700> what<00:03:02.940> we

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
television is very very big so what we

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.240 
television is very very big so what we
had<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.420> do<00:03:03.780> we<00:03:04.290> didn't<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.739> all<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:04.950> we

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
had to do we didn't have all that we

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.740 
had to do we didn't have all that we
didn't<00:03:05.430> have<00:03:05.519> no<00:03:05.700> pay-per-view<00:03:05.940> we<00:03:06.450> had<00:03:06.569> no

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.930 
didn't have no pay-per-view we had no
merchandising<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:07.890> didn't<00:03:08.130> have<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.459> big

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
merchandising we didn't have the big

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.540 
merchandising we didn't have the big
money's<00:03:09.300> from<00:03:09.620> television<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:10.769> we<00:03:10.920> depended

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
money's from television so we depended

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.690 
money's from television so we depended
strictly<00:03:12.030> on<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.300> arena<00:03:12.569> so<00:03:13.260> we<00:03:13.470> had<00:03:13.650> to<00:03:13.860> make

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
strictly on the arena so we had to make

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.060 
strictly on the arena so we had to make
wrestling<00:03:15.180> matches<00:03:15.390> for<00:03:15.750> example<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.739> if<00:03:16.920> I
