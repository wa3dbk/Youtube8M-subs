00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
this video is about well amber natural

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.769 
this video is about well amber natural
Baltic<00:00:03.929> amber<00:00:04.140> this<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.370> as<00:00:05.670> it<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.060> when<00:00:06.660> it

not recognizable unsorted the factories

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.220 
not recognizable unsorted the factories
take<00:00:18.720> these<00:00:18.990> raw<00:00:19.470> amber<00:00:19.980> they'll<00:00:20.730> wash<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
take these raw amber they'll wash it and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.269 
take these raw amber they'll wash it and
you<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:23.070> buy<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.150> form<00:00:24.510> for<00:00:25.070> your<00:00:26.070> own

tumbling and use or the factories then
sort<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.470> amber<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.180> they'll<00:00:33.180> handpick<00:00:33.870> it

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
sort the amber and they'll handpick it

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.720 
sort the amber and they'll handpick it
according<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.460> size<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.170> color<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.219> some

according to size and and color in some

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.500 
according to size and and color in some
cases<00:00:39.059> they'll<00:00:40.020> run<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> sieve<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
cases they'll run it to a sieve so that

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.680 
cases they'll run it to a sieve so that
your<00:00:42.809> amber<00:00:43.410> comes<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:45.079> given<00:00:46.079> size<00:00:47.239> but<00:00:48.239> most

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
your amber comes a given size but most

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.880 
your amber comes a given size but most
large<00:00:49.700> manufacturers<00:00:50.750> will<00:00:51.750> buy<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.469> this

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
large manufacturers will buy it in this

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.330 
large manufacturers will buy it in this
form<00:00:53.510> because<00:00:54.510> they<00:00:55.079> hand-picked<00:00:55.500> themselves

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
form because they hand-picked themselves

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.209 
form because they hand-picked themselves
and<00:00:56.610> use<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.539> they<00:00:57.899> wish<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.190> a

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
and use it as they wish this is a

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.349 
and use it as they wish this is a
picture<00:00:59.550> of<00:01:00.079> hand-picked<00:01:01.079> clean<00:01:01.829> raw<00:01:02.670> natural

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
picture of hand-picked clean raw natural

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.060 
picture of hand-picked clean raw natural
Baltic<00:01:04.260> amber<00:01:05.390> then<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.930> factories<00:01:07.470> will

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
Baltic amber then the factories will

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.750 
Baltic amber then the factories will
start<00:01:08.400> processing<00:01:09.020> they<00:01:10.020> put<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.430> sieve

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
start processing they put it to a sieve

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.340 
start processing they put it to a sieve
and<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.650> buy<00:01:13.920> amber<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:15.299> smaller<00:01:15.990> pieces

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
and you can buy amber and smaller pieces

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.060 
and you can buy amber and smaller pieces
this<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.280> mat<00:01:17.549> those<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.720> cleaned<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.229> much

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
this is a mat those it's cleaned up much

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.330 
this is a mat those it's cleaned up much
of<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.790> broken<00:01:21.659> up<00:01:21.900> amber<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
of this is broken up amber and the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.469 
of this is broken up amber and the
pieces<00:01:23.610> start<00:01:24.479> getting<00:01:25.080> smaller<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:26.040> time

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
pieces start getting smaller with time

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.020 
pieces start getting smaller with time
finally<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.720> factory's<00:01:28.340> written<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
finally the factory's written to you a

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.100 
finally the factory's written to you a
very<00:01:30.390> fine<00:01:30.960> mix<00:01:31.320> or<00:01:32.070> an<00:01:32.430> amber<00:01:33.119> gravel<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
very fine mix or an amber gravel that

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.249 
very fine mix or an amber gravel that
you<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.890> use<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.340> tumbled<00:01:35.850> or<00:01:36.420> they<00:01:37.020> will

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you can use the tumbled or they will

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.429 
you can use the tumbled or they will
start<00:01:37.590> tumbling<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.310> for<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
start tumbling it for you this is a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.370 
start tumbling it for you this is a
tumbled<00:01:41.070> mix<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:42.090> call<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.750> debark

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
tumbled mix they call it debark

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.039 
tumbled mix they call it debark
they<00:01:44.070> take<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.640> bark<00:01:44.880> off<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.509> amber<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
they take the bark off the amber and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.630 
they take the bark off the amber and
then<00:01:47.149> here<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.390> another<00:01:48.420> picture<00:01:48.990> as<00:01:49.640> that

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
then here is another picture as that

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.460 
then here is another picture as that
gets<00:01:50.939> smaller<00:01:51.680> smaller<00:01:52.680> pieces<00:01:53.009> also<00:01:53.520> be<00:01:54.119> part

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
gets smaller smaller pieces also be part

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.520 
gets smaller smaller pieces also be part
then<00:01:55.470> finally<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:57.030> some<00:01:57.299> very<00:01:57.930> small

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
then finally you have some very small

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.359 
then finally you have some very small
pieces<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.610> are<00:02:00.259> tumbled<00:02:01.259> these<00:02:02.040> are

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
pieces that are tumbled these are

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.850 
pieces that are tumbled these are
appropriate<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> tumbling<00:02:04.619> in

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
appropriate for for the tumbling in

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.089
