the<00:02:26.170> phone<00:02:26.410> very<00:02:26.860> carefully<00:02:27.459> we've<00:02:28.090> created

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the phone very carefully we've created

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.020 
the phone very carefully we've created
the<00:02:28.780> new<00:02:28.990> much<00:02:29.470> smaller<00:02:29.890> lightning<00:02:30.580> connector

the new much smaller lightning connector
it's<00:02:31.569> all<00:02:31.810> digital<00:02:32.050> so<00:02:32.709> it's<00:02:32.950> designed<00:02:33.370> for

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
it's all digital so it's designed for

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.210 
it's all digital so it's designed for
today's<00:02:33.910> uses<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:35.319> made<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.650> reversible

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
today's uses and we made it reversible

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.930 
today's uses and we made it reversible
so<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.790> fits<00:02:37.060> either<00:02:37.270> way<00:02:38.069> we<00:02:39.069> also<00:02:39.250> move<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.910> a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
so it fits either way we also move to a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.780
