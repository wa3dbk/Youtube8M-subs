so it's kind of realistic beard and now
I<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.650> use<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> little<00:02:17.040> bit<00:02:17.160> blood<00:02:17.370> just

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
I just just use a little bit blood just

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.360 
I just just use a little bit blood just
to<00:02:17.760> give<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.570> saw<00:02:19.110> look<00:02:19.500> as<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.160> see

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
to give that saw look as you can see

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.330 
to give that saw look as you can see
let's<00:02:20.670> stick<00:02:21.240> it<00:02:21.330> already<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.470> now<00:02:22.890> I'm<00:02:23.070> had<00:02:23.310> a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
let's stick it already and now I'm had a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.000 
let's stick it already and now I'm had a
little<00:02:23.610> bit<00:02:23.790> more<00:02:23.989> coagulated<00:02:24.989> blood<00:02:25.020> just

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
little bit more coagulated blood just

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.050 
little bit more coagulated blood just
two<00:02:26.190> people<00:02:27.060> afflicted<00:02:27.630> me<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.610> any<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.880> then

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
two people afflicted me and any and then

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.760 
two people afflicted me and any and then
I<00:02:30.150> put<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.750> edges<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.260> think<00:02:31.530> was

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
I put it on the edges that I think was

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.650 
I put it on the edges that I think was
it<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:32.970> now<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.180> just<00:02:33.239> looks<00:02:33.360> like<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
it but so now it just looks like a

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.130 
it but so now it just looks like a
cutting<00:02:33.989> serology<00:02:34.560> say<00:02:35.030> about<00:02:36.030> thick<00:02:36.780> edge

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
cutting serology say about thick edge

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.680 
cutting serology say about thick edge
and<00:02:37.470> but<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.430> party<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.180> put<00:02:39.390> as<00:02:39.540> much

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
and but this party just put as much

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.140 
and but this party just put as much
blood<00:02:39.930> as<00:02:39.989> want<00:02:40.350> really<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.190> was<00:02:41.640> up<00:02:41.790> later

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
blood as want really I I was up later

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.080 
blood as want really I I was up later
now<00:02:42.840> I<00:02:42.870> broke<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> pencil<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.430> then<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.640> put<00:02:45.060> on

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
now I broke a pencil and then I put on

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.240 
now I broke a pencil and then I put on
the<00:02:45.300> hold<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.750> already<00:02:46.140> made<00:02:46.380> for<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.830> pencil

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the hold I already made for the pencil

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.930 
the hold I already made for the pencil
and<00:02:48.560> it's<00:02:49.560> like<00:02:49.680> I'm<00:02:49.830> happy<00:02:50.070> with<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.730> then

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
and it's like I'm happy with it and then

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.960 
and it's like I'm happy with it and then
that's<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.390> that's<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.190> real<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.489> final<00:02:53.820> look

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
that's it that's the real the final look

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.490 
that's it that's the real the final look
and<00:02:54.330> then<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.540> just<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.930> add<00:02:55.080> more<00:02:55.320> blood

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
and then I just have to add more blood

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.390 
and then I just have to add more blood
if<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.400> want<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.570> then<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.590> need<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.220> use

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
if you want to and then I need to use

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.270 
if you want to and then I need to use
the<00:02:59.670> low<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:01.760> now<00:03:02.760> what<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.030> did<00:03:03.330> i<00:03:03.570> i<00:03:04.530> watered

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
the low so now what I did i i watered

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.759 
the low so now what I did i i watered
some<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.120> work<00:03:06.299> some<00:03:06.630> of<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.870> blood<00:03:07.350> just

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
some of the work some of the blood just

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.789 
some of the work some of the blood just
so<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.310> would<00:03:08.489> flow<00:03:08.940> easier<00:03:09.239> when<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.709> pumped<00:03:10.709> it

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
so it would flow easier when I pumped it

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.060 
so it would flow easier when I pumped it
out<00:03:10.980> out<00:03:11.400> of<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.670> womb<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.269> made<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.140> I
