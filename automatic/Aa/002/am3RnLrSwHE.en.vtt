 Hello everyone, if you have long nails 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.040
 I 'm sure that at least once in life you 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.500
 they were broken and if not then you are very 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.290
 lucky on even and well-groomed legs 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.269
 terribly nice to look at doing 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.250
 somehow worked at home or just 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.260
 doing something long nails can 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.600
 break from worse worse at all 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.980
 break off 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.160
 and even my nail broke off completely and 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.380
 but I'm not a professional or rather not at all 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.239
 the professional therefore I do not like 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.970
 may be right as well as me 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.460
 more to taste like their old nails 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:42.350
 length and what do I do in this situation 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.540
 I will tell you in this video to start with 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.790
 using saws and i'm a bit quite a bit 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.470
 Spill gloss with nail in order to 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.010
 artificial nail is better mated with 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.010
 natural 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.289
 a plus 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.289
 but 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:28.580
 now i need tipsy understandably 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:49.880
 each pick individually now 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:52.340
 shine steps of and already processed type 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.340
 I need to gently grease me 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.170
 glue without a brush which means that 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.490
 the main thing is not to overdo otherwise stick 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.960
 not only a nail map 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.960
 I apply a nail between seconds 20 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.180
 on 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.180
 only 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.370
 when glue is finally a challenge i'm with 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:44.969
 using the cutting tips, choosing the necessary 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:48.349
 nail length with a nail file passed 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.349
 nail the desired shape and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.579
 god of the sky and 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.510
 Now you need to cut down the transition to 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.510
 he was unnoticed 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:49.560
 then i use it would be worth it enough 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.560
 me this is evelyn on nails 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.659
 if you apply colored varnish, then no 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.519
 transitions will not be visible and all here is 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:20.220
 easy way hope this video you 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.220
 It helped and we'll see you soon so 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.970
 rack 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.410
