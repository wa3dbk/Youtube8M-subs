00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.909
 friends hello with you gennady 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.540
 Pavlenko and I will tell you now and 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.389
 I'll show you how it works once 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.620
 the lessons you download from ours 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.249
 communication site lessons 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.980
 but already watched the video how to download the game as 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.880
 run it 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.960
 and here you run it like this 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.800
 here is the screen 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.490
 and the question of selling is what to do with it because 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.079
 that there is such a situation before the massacre 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.810
 strongly me 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.349
 and secondly you can hear me 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.659
 in the third here appears regularly 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.440
 slides with texts or questions 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.069
 that is, among the seats 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:37.009
 there are questions that can be 

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:38.000
 reply 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.810
 and most importantly here on the right and constantly 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.940
 walking chad 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.430
 where the participants saw the lesson which recording 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.360
 look 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 but always what they say 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.590
 asks are clarified start 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.500
 communicate with each other published 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.090
 slip into the services that is here in very 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.129
 many m 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.620
 let's say the factors 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.370
 and we need to understand how optimal 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.290
 interacting with this lesson 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.520
 I recommend the next he 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.000
 become a leader 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.909
 from the first look at this lesson percentage 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.360
 from the beginning till the end 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.650
 yet not answering the question that is or not 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.990
 plunging into the country plunging lessons 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.410
 but in order to understand the topic itself 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.450
 and in the second in order to immediately 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.760
 read chad 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.080
 because parts people are not easy 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.430
 nothing to talk about but communication 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.520
 It is the theme of a given task, that is what 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.390
 as well as in general the task is built 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.400
 I was just talking to 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.750
 participants and then at some point ask 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.190
 question 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.000
 answer which you need to chat 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.140
 and that is from myself at the moment 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.650
 for example in this lesson which 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.890
 can ask this question 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.180
 situations manifest you 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.080
 depending on the opinions of others 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.360
 and participants answer this question in 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.570
 chat 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.570
 see this is a lesson 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.280
 and you also need to answer this question 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.119
 i recommend doing this after you 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.469
 And read the Stage Theater interesting 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.910
 look at the record 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.860
 after that you have handouts 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.370
 so that tet with husky tower they have you 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.640
 separate words to files and both already 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.960
 you can just work with them 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.039
 because you already know what it is about 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:16.009
 but in general the most important course of course 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.539
 these are not explanations or questions 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.129
 exactly the exercises themselves 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.669
 and the further this exercise will be 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:22.889
 promise in this lesson you this 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:24.499
 see and hear 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:26.689
 and then using these warehouses using 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.289
 transparent material 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.849
 do this exercise 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:31.810
 that is her 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.719
 summarizing what he said 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.729
 and the first you watch 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.639
 if you are interested in the hour and he 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.429
 often interesting because a 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.459
 participants are going to interesting and his 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.019
 communicate fall 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.939
 the robot is now helping to expand 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.870
 field of understanding here this problem 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.679
 situations we work with 

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.829
 and it is very bored do not always understand teach 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:54.599
 are asking 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.029
 that is, it allows you to expand as a rule 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:58.549
 this field itself is an explanation in that 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.779
 including 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.699
 and after that weapon you take the slides 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.769
 such ones just won't be full screen 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.319
 already work with them separately 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.959
 here so your author gennady pavlenko
