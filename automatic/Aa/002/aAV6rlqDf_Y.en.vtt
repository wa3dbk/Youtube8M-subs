00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.349
 there this morning we come to realize a dream 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.410
 of child going to sea with sailors 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:18.160
 then live their time thoroughly 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.610
 to immerse themselves in their daily life aboard 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.610
 their trawler 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.550
 it is 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.680
 we send people to spend a day 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.380
 with us at sea where he sees what 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.150
 what sailors need and then a 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.770
 once the trawls have arrived so 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.970
 the lobster fish they can 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.220
 also pick up the grilled fish 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:55.510
 a few langoustines participate in the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:58.390
 washing station in each statement of 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.270
 with us it's a little bit a little 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.820
 little surprise when there were your 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.260
 pieces to support it allows to see 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.479
 something that we have never seen 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.430
 fish against not necessarily us 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.560
 it's simple we can do trip hop 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.030
 it touches us and things before 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.030
 they are transformed 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:30.530
 and lobsters the crabs all this 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:33.140
 it feels fresh and pleasant 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.679
 allows us to discover the job 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.450
 well on several people and by the 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.679
 same opportunity it also opens us and the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.340
 look at the outside world 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.819
 so it's a two-way exchange 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.819
 it's always good 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.320
 so it does not take a format broke 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.320
 fly was passing
