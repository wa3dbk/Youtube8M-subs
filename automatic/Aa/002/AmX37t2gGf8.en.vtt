you can get them like a lot of the basic
suppliers<00:00:17.970> now<00:00:18.359> sell<00:00:18.949> heat-resistant

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
suppliers now sell heat-resistant

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.130 
suppliers now sell heat-resistant
synthetics<00:00:20.400> now<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.210> already<00:00:21.539> kind<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.930> flat

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
synthetics now so already kind of flat

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.050 
synthetics now so already kind of flat
iron<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.650> part<00:00:22.920> tell<00:00:23.519> them<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.730> can<00:00:23.850> tell

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
iron this part tell them you can tell

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.189 
iron this part tell them you can tell
how<00:00:24.210> different<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.689> looks<00:00:24.840> from<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.769> side<00:00:27.199> see

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
how different it looks from the side see

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.080 
how different it looks from the side see
how<00:00:28.289> different<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.859> but<00:00:29.730> I'm<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:30.000> to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
how different it is but I'm going to

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.680 
how different it is but I'm going to
finish<00:00:30.439> flat<00:00:31.439> iron<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.910> use<00:00:33.090> my<00:00:33.300> maxi

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
finish flat iron it and I use my maxi

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.979 
finish flat iron it and I use my maxi
gly<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.710> think<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.850> best<00:00:36.180> flat

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
gly and I think that is the best flat

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
gly and I think that is the best flat
iron<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> use<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.670> steam

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
iron to use for it because of the steam

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.889 
iron to use for it because of the steam

dry<00:00:47.070> he<00:00:47.370> works<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.420> them<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.160> see<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.670> lot

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
dry he works on them but see a lot

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.819 
dry he works on them but see a lot
better<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.690> setting<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.140> my<00:00:55.260> maxi<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.739> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
better and the setting I my maxi like a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.060 
better and the setting I my maxi like a
lesson<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.280> all<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> way<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.379> I<00:00:58.379> know<00:00:58.530> when

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
lesson on all the way up and I know when

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.160 
lesson on all the way up and I know when
you<00:00:59.190> buy<00:00:59.399> them<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.850> say<00:01:00.859> um<00:01:02.359> should<00:01:03.359> be<00:01:03.480> 200

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
you buy them they say um should be 200

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
you buy them they say um should be 200
degrees<00:01:05.450> or<00:01:06.450> lower<00:01:06.619> but<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.920> kept<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.880> kept

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
degrees or lower but I kept I just kept

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.330 
degrees or lower but I kept I just kept
slowly<00:01:09.869> putting<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.260> up<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.680> notice<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
slowly putting it up and notice that it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.810 
slowly putting it up and notice that it
didn't<00:01:11.580> melt<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.840> what<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> suggest<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:14.610> test

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
didn't melt so what I suggest is to test

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.490 
didn't melt so what I suggest is to test
it<00:01:15.060> before<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.479> go<00:01:15.750> burning<00:01:16.110> away<00:01:16.200> without

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it before you go burning away without

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.810 
it before you go burning away without
and<00:01:16.799> blame<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.130> me<00:01:18.110> cuz<00:01:19.110> from<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.250> hear

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and blame it on me cuz from what I hear

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.609 
and blame it on me cuz from what I hear
you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:22.189> if<00:01:23.600> it's<00:01:24.600> too<00:01:24.750> hot<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.470> week

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you know if it's too hot for the week

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.539 
you know if it's too hot for the week
will<00:01:25.920> melt

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.639 

and<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.999> know<00:01:30.179> how<00:01:30.390> lakes<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.499> equates

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
and you know how lakes and that equates

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.830 
and you know how lakes and that equates
get<00:01:32.280> really<00:01:32.759> nice<00:01:33.359> nap<00:01:33.929> in<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.319> back<00:01:34.469> no<00:01:35.840> you

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
get really nice nap in the back no you

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.340 
get really nice nap in the back no you
can<00:01:36.869> just<00:01:37.560> flat<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.399> it<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.700> see<00:01:39.149> how<00:01:39.799> nice<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
can just flat on it out see how nice and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.880 
can just flat on it out see how nice and
straight<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:45.859> remember<00:01:46.859> that<00:01:47.009> one<00:01:48.679> I'm<00:01:49.679> gonna

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
straight and remember that one I'm gonna

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.789 
straight and remember that one I'm gonna
do<00:01:50.159> other<00:01:50.909> side<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.659> quick<00:01:52.109> I<00:01:54.679> don't<00:01:55.679> have

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
do other side really quick I don't have

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.260 
do other side really quick I don't have
much<00:01:55.920> time<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.459> camera<00:01:56.759> could<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.240> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
much time on this camera could I have a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.459 
much time on this camera could I have a
whole<00:01:57.420> bunch<00:01:57.569> of<00:01:57.750> pictures<00:01:57.929> with<00:01:58.140> another

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
whole bunch of pictures with another

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.289 
whole bunch of pictures with another
video<00:01:58.649> wouldn't<00:01:59.099> so<00:01:59.429> my<00:01:59.549> memory<00:01:59.880> card<00:01:59.909> when<00:02:00.240> he

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
video wouldn't so my memory card when he

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.919 
video wouldn't so my memory card when he
goes<00:02:00.450> up<00:02:00.599> to<00:02:00.719> seven<00:02:01.049> minutes<00:02:02.569> I'll<00:02:03.569> have<00:02:03.599> to

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
goes up to seven minutes I'll have to

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:10.819 
goes up to seven minutes I'll have to
stop<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:08.569> so<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.599> usually<00:02:10.229> push<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.560> steam

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
stop it so I usually push the steam

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.430 
stop it so I usually push the steam
button<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:12.060> I'm<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.540> down<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.140> I'm

brush it and keep going make sure I hit
the<00:02:24.150> steam<00:02:24.480> at<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.750> end<00:02:25.190> you<00:02:26.190> know<00:02:26.370> it's

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
the steam at the end you know it's
