00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
do here is actually will measure back a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.359 
do here is actually will measure back a
foot<00:01:05.610> behind<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.510> pitch<00:01:06.689> home<00:01:07.350> plate<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
foot behind the pitch home plate to

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.850 
foot behind the pitch home plate to
actually<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:10.049> everything<00:01:10.290> out<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> way

actually get everything out of the way
and<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.549> we'll<00:01:11.640> run<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.880> string<00:01:12.299> line

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
and then we'll run a string line

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.160 
and then we'll run a string line
straight<00:01:13.530> through<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.150> mound<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.900> through

straight through the mound in through

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.830 
straight through the mound in through
second<00:01:16.560> base<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.790> mound<00:01:18.000> should<00:01:18.330> line<00:01:18.600> up

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
second base and the mound should line up

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.100 
second base and the mound should line up
perfectly<00:01:20.210> right<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.540> string<00:01:21.900> line

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
perfectly right on that string line

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:33.830 
perfectly right on that string line
after<00:01:23.070> its<00:01:23.220> installed<00:01:32.360> what<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.509> want<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> do

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.520 
we check this right away we'll know the
strings<00:02:12.250> right<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:14.080> then<00:02:14.230> we<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.440> move

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
strings right and then we can move

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.100 
strings right and then we can move
forward<00:02:14.610> this<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.760> most<00:02:16.000> important<00:02:16.420> part

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
forward this is the most important part

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.950 
forward this is the most important part
so<00:02:17.380> we'll<00:02:18.250> get<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.550> 10<00:02:18.760> inches<00:02:19.120> we'll<00:02:19.750> check

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
so we'll get this 10 inches we'll check

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.780 
so we'll get this 10 inches we'll check
our<00:02:20.080> line<00:02:20.260> level<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.250> everything<00:02:21.460> should

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
our line level and everything should

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.840 
our line level and everything should
follow<00:02:22.000> suit<00:02:22.330> as<00:02:22.480> we're<00:02:22.690> moving<00:02:22.960> out<00:02:23.080> there

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
follow suit as we're moving out there

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.820 
follow suit as we're moving out there
finally<00:02:24.850> we<00:02:24.910> have<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:25.870> can<00:02:26.470> get<00:02:26.710> your

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
finally we have if you can get your

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.710 
finally we have if you can get your
hands<00:02:27.010> on<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.250> transit<00:02:27.730> obvious<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:28.600> the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
hands on the transit obvious it's the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.120 
hands on the transit obvious it's the
best<00:02:28.930> way<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.140> do<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:29.530> it's<00:02:29.710> pretty<00:02:29.770> much

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
best way to do it it's pretty much

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.740 
best way to do it it's pretty much
things<00:02:30.610> pretty<00:02:30.910> simple

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
things pretty simple

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.450 
things pretty simple
what<00:02:32.170> josh<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.620> doing<00:02:32.740> now<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.220> we're<00:02:33.370> getting

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
what josh is doing now is we're getting

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.700 
what josh is doing now is we're getting
a<00:02:33.640> pinch<00:02:33.850> point<00:02:34.150> rich<00:02:34.450> mark<00:02:34.750> off<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.590> home

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
a pinch point rich mark off the home

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.190 
a pinch point rich mark off the home
plate<00:02:36.180> using<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.390> transit<00:02:37.810> we're<00:02:37.960> getting<00:02:38.110> a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
plate using the transit we're getting a

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.570 
plate using the transit we're getting a
signal<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.580> it's<00:02:39.850> pretty<00:02:40.060> much<00:02:41.400> keeps<00:02:42.400> it

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
signal so it's pretty much keeps it

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.300 
signal so it's pretty much keeps it

just checking make sure we're still in
the<00:02:47.440> center<00:02:47.770> so<00:02:48.100> we<00:02:48.220> don't<00:02:48.400> lose<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.820> Center

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
inches these are straight edge so that's

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.280 
inches these are straight edge so that's
a<00:03:28.190> reference<00:03:28.640> point<00:03:28.850> we<00:03:29.120> start<00:03:35.080> art<00:03:36.080> as<00:03:36.170> you

obviously we're going to pop our string
we're<00:03:57.500> going<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.680> measure<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:58.040> stuff<00:03:58.340> again

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
we're going to measure the stuff again

we're going to measure the stuff again
here's<00:03:59.090> kind<00:03:59.330> of<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.450> pitching<00:03:59.840> rubber<00:03:59.870> side

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
here's kind of the pitching rubber side

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:02.559 
here's kind of the pitching rubber side
by<00:04:00.590> side<00:04:00.860> and<00:04:01.190> this<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.519> kind<00:04:01.790> of<00:04:01.849> what<00:04:02.060> the
