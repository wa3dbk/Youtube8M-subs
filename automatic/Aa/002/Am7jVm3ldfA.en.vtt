00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
in anime studio pro 9 there have been

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.099 
in anime studio pro 9 there have been
some<00:00:21.220> improvements<00:00:21.910> as<00:00:22.029> to<00:00:22.449> how<00:00:22.630> we<00:00:22.689> can<00:00:22.930> edit

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.109 
some improvements as to how we can edit

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:25.769 
some improvements as to how we can edit
keyframes<00:00:23.800> in<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.160> timeline<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:25.570> tutorial

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
keyframes in the timeline this tutorial

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.069 
keyframes in the timeline this tutorial
will<00:00:26.289> cover<00:00:26.439> those<00:00:26.859> new<00:00:27.070> methods<00:00:27.779> first<00:00:28.779> of

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:29.079 
will cover those new methods first of

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.560 
will cover those new methods first of
all<00:00:29.230> it<00:00:29.439> is<00:00:30.130> now<00:00:30.310> much<00:00:30.669> easier<00:00:30.910> to<00:00:31.390> add<00:00:31.539> a

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
all it is now much easier to add a

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.720 
all it is now much easier to add a
keyframe<00:00:31.920> wherever<00:00:32.920> you<00:00:33.129> want<00:00:33.399> on<00:00:33.610> the

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
keyframe wherever you want on the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.360 
keyframe wherever you want on the
timeline<00:00:34.050> let's<00:00:35.050> say<00:00:35.230> for<00:00:35.260> instance<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:36.070> moved

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
timeline let's say for instance I moved

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.360 
timeline let's say for instance I moved
two<00:00:36.670> frames<00:00:37.089> 72<00:00:37.480> on<00:00:37.839> the<00:00:37.960> timeline<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:38.589> I<00:00:39.129> want

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
two frames 72 on the timeline and I want

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.130 
two frames 72 on the timeline and I want
to<00:00:39.489> create<00:00:39.790> a<00:00:39.850> keyframe<00:00:40.180> for<00:00:40.510> this<00:00:40.870> channel

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
to create a keyframe for this channel

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.350 
to create a keyframe for this channel
instead<00:00:42.129> of<00:00:42.430> grabbing<00:00:42.640> let's<00:00:43.059> say<00:00:43.210> the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
instead of grabbing let's say the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.180 
instead of grabbing let's say the
transform<00:00:43.839> layer<00:00:44.019> tool<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.530> clicking<00:00:44.980> on<00:00:45.040> the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
transform layer tool and clicking on the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.520 
transform layer tool and clicking on the
canvas<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.760> create<00:00:45.790> a<00:00:46.030> keyframe<00:00:46.239> I<00:00:46.690> could

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
canvas to create a keyframe I could

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.429 
canvas to create a keyframe I could
simply<00:00:47.710> now<00:00:47.980> come<00:00:48.250> down<00:00:48.370> here<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.909> the<00:00:49.000> channel

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:49.439 
simply now come down here to the channel

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:54.090 
simply now come down here to the channel
double<00:00:50.439> click<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:52.180> create<00:00:52.330> a<00:00:52.479> keyframe<00:00:53.100> so

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
double click to create a keyframe so

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.619 
double click to create a keyframe so
that<00:00:54.250> really<00:00:54.489> simplifies<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.059> process<00:00:55.239> now

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
that really simplifies the process now

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.799 
that really simplifies the process now
when<00:00:56.140> it<00:00:56.260> comes<00:00:56.439> to<00:00:56.650> adding<00:00:56.860> keyframes<00:00:57.809> also

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
when it comes to adding keyframes also

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.289 
when it comes to adding keyframes also
this<00:00:59.049> works<00:00:59.320> in<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.680> motion<00:01:00.010> graph<00:01:00.189> so<00:01:00.879> if<00:01:01.180> I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
this works in the motion graph so if I

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:04.410 
this works in the motion graph so if I
go<00:01:01.330> to<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.750> motion<00:01:02.110> graph<00:01:02.290> tab<00:01:02.589> and<00:01:03.150> I<00:01:04.150> am<00:01:04.269> in

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
go to the motion graph tab and I am in

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.140 
go to the motion graph tab and I am in
this<00:01:04.600> channel<00:01:04.839> currently<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:05.759> can<00:01:06.759> simply<00:01:07.060> come

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
this channel currently I can simply come

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.620 
this channel currently I can simply come
over<00:01:07.360> here<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.810> frame<00:01:08.560> 84<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.630> double-click

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
over here to frame 84 and double-click

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.179 
over here to frame 84 and double-click
and<00:01:10.890> I've<00:01:11.890> now<00:01:12.070> added<00:01:12.310> a<00:01:12.670> keyframe<00:01:13.150> for<00:01:13.450> every

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and I've now added a keyframe for every

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.490 
and I've now added a keyframe for every
property<00:01:15.189> of<00:01:15.460> this<00:01:15.820> channel<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.200> works

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
property of this channel so that works

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.440 
property of this channel so that works
really<00:01:17.619> well<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.189> can<00:01:18.340> help<00:01:18.520> speed<00:01:18.850> up<00:01:18.880> your

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
really well and can help speed up your

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.010 
really well and can help speed up your
workflow<00:01:19.509> when<00:01:20.380> working<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:20.920> anime<00:01:21.310> studio

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
workflow when working in anime studio

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.860 
workflow when working in anime studio
now<00:01:23.020> let<00:01:23.170> me<00:01:23.230> come<00:01:23.409> back<00:01:23.440> here<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:24.040> my<00:01:24.190> channels

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
now let me come back here to my channels

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.350 
now let me come back here to my channels
next<00:01:25.870> is<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.080> ability<00:01:26.620> to<00:01:27.070> move<00:01:27.670> keyframes

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
next is the ability to move keyframes

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.170 
next is the ability to move keyframes
past<00:01:28.780> each<00:01:29.050> other<00:01:29.220> let's<00:01:30.220> say<00:01:30.370> for<00:01:30.610> instance<00:01:30.670> I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
past each other let's say for instance I

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.310 
past each other let's say for instance I
highlight<00:01:31.720> these<00:01:32.200> three<00:01:32.590> frames<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:34.000> in<00:01:34.360> the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
highlight these three frames now in the

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.950 
highlight these three frames now in the
past<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:36.010> past<00:01:36.190> versions<00:01:36.520> if<00:01:36.940> I<00:01:37.450> tried<00:01:37.840> to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
past and past versions if I tried to

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.960 
past and past versions if I tried to
move<00:01:38.110> these<00:01:38.320> ahead<00:01:38.800> of<00:01:39.070> let's<00:01:39.430> say<00:01:39.580> these<00:01:39.760> two

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
move these ahead of let's say these two

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.690 
move these ahead of let's say these two
keyframes<00:01:40.860> basically<00:01:41.860> what<00:01:42.010> would<00:01:42.130> happen<00:01:42.520> is

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
keyframes basically what would happen is

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.250 
keyframes basically what would happen is
you<00:01:43.000> would<00:01:43.180> run<00:01:43.420> into<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.750> problem<00:01:43.870> where

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
you would run into the problem where

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.530 
you would run into the problem where
they<00:01:44.800> would<00:01:44.979> Clyde<00:01:45.370> you<00:01:45.670> would<00:01:45.820> bump<00:01:46.090> into<00:01:46.210> it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
they would Clyde you would bump into it

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.420 
they would Clyde you would bump into it
you<00:01:46.720> couldn't<00:01:46.960> go<00:01:47.170> past<00:01:47.200> that<00:01:47.710> certain<00:01:48.100> point

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
you couldn't go past that certain point

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.690 
you couldn't go past that certain point
well<00:01:49.299> now<00:01:49.510> as<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:49.870> can<00:01:49.990> see<00:01:50.049> I<00:01:50.409> can<00:01:50.950> move<00:01:51.340> past

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
well now as you can see I can move past

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.840 
well now as you can see I can move past
any<00:01:52.180> key<00:01:53.049> frame<00:01:53.320> I<00:01:53.440> want<00:01:53.680> now<00:01:54.520> those<00:01:54.670> can

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
any key frame I want now those can

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.399 
any key frame I want now those can
create<00:01:55.090> some<00:01:55.270> interesting<00:01:55.450> movements<00:01:56.229> for

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
create some interesting movements for

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.020 
create some interesting movements for
you<00:01:56.820> however<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.930> works<00:01:59.170> as<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.650> should<00:01:59.680> and<00:02:00.100> I

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
you however it works as it should and I

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.730 
you however it works as it should and I
think<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.540> has<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:01.690> new<00:02:01.869> feature<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.710> will

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
think that has a new feature you will

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.920 
think that has a new feature you will
find<00:02:03.190> beneficial<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:05.590> graph<00:02:05.860> mode<00:02:06.190> now

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
find beneficial when in graph mode now

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.869 
find beneficial when in graph mode now
you<00:02:07.930> have<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.349> ability<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.979> scale<00:02:09.519> keys

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
you have the ability to scale keys

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.750 
you have the ability to scale keys
vertically<00:02:10.509> so<00:02:11.290> let's<00:02:11.440> say<00:02:11.620> at<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:11.980> point<00:02:12.099> in

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
vertically so let's say at this point in

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.990 
vertically so let's say at this point in
my<00:02:13.090> timeline<00:02:13.510> like<00:02:14.019> right<00:02:14.409> here<00:02:14.769> I<00:02:14.920> want<00:02:15.640> to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
my timeline like right here I want to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.320 
my timeline like right here I want to
adjust<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:17.500> point<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.069> graph<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.640> could

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
adjust this point of the graph I could

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.300 
adjust this point of the graph I could
hold<00:02:19.569> down<00:02:19.780> my<00:02:19.810> left<00:02:20.049> mouse<00:02:20.140> button<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.739> as

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
hold down my left mouse button and as

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.339 
hold down my left mouse button and as
you<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.580> see<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.790> can<00:02:21.849> go<00:02:22.090> up<00:02:22.299> and<00:02:22.480> down<00:02:22.810> now<00:02:23.140> as

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
you can see I can go up and down now as

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.730 
you can see I can go up and down now as
well<00:02:24.010> as<00:02:24.280> left<00:02:24.909> and<00:02:25.120> right<00:02:25.319> but<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.500> course

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
well as left and right but of course

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.070 
well as left and right but of course
this<00:02:26.950> gives<00:02:27.190> us<00:02:27.340> much<00:02:27.610> more<00:02:27.640> flexibility<00:02:28.420> when

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
this gives us much more flexibility when

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.510 
this gives us much more flexibility when
working<00:02:29.290> in<00:02:29.470> graph<00:02:29.680> mode<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.190> can<00:02:30.310> see<00:02:30.490> I

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
working in graph mode and you can see I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.790 
working in graph mode and you can see I
can<00:02:30.580> alter

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
can alter

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.620 
can alter
X<00:02:31.920> property<00:02:32.460> here<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.850> come<00:02:33.150> down<00:02:33.330> here<00:02:33.540> and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
X property here and come down here and

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.250 
X property here and come down here and
alter<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:33.990> Y<00:02:34.260> property<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.460> on<00:02:36.080> okay<00:02:37.080> now

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
alter the Y property and so on okay now

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.240 
alter the Y property and so on okay now
let<00:02:37.470> me<00:02:37.500> bounce<00:02:37.770> back<00:02:38.070> here<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.850> channels

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
let me bounce back here to the channels

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.880 
let me bounce back here to the channels
tab<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.930> I'm<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.080> going<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.290> add<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.650> couple

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
tab and I'm just going to add a couple

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.250 
tab and I'm just going to add a couple
more<00:02:44.010> channels<00:02:44.490> here<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.240> I'll<00:02:46.080> come<00:02:46.230> over

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
more channels here so I'll come over

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.490 
more channels here so I'll come over
here<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.560> frame<00:02:46.920> 12<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.570> I'll<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:48.930> expand

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
here to frame 12 and I'll just expand

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.830 
here to frame 12 and I'll just expand
this<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:50.000> rotate<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.030> slightly<00:02:51.240> so<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.660> have

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
this and rotate it slightly so I have

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.890 
this and rotate it slightly so I have
some<00:02:52.140> channels<00:02:52.890> pop<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.280> here<00:02:53.490> for<00:02:53.940> this

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
some channels pop in here for this

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.290 
some channels pop in here for this
example<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.830> can<00:02:56.010> do<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.670> camera<00:02:57.090> here<00:02:57.270> as

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
example and I can do the camera here as

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.260 
example and I can do the camera here as
well<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:57.810> I'll<00:02:58.560> pop<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.040> frame<00:02:59.280> one<00:02:59.520> at<00:02:59.700> a

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
well so I'll pop to frame one at a

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.230 
well so I'll pop to frame one at a
camera<00:03:00.600> key<00:03:00.840> frame<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.260> so<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:01.940> okay<00:03:02.940> now

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
camera key frame and so on so okay now

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.590 
camera key frame and so on so okay now
you<00:03:04.110> are<00:03:04.670> working<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.760> your<00:03:05.880> animation<00:03:06.390> and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
you are working on your animation and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.260 
you are working on your animation and
you<00:03:06.720> want<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.230> add<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.560> keyframe<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.610> all<00:03:09.030> the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
you want to add a keyframe for all the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.940 
you want to add a keyframe for all the
channels<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:10.320> know<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.530> double<00:03:10.770> click

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
channels you know the double click

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.130 
channels you know the double click
method<00:03:11.130> now<00:03:11.460> but<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.120> only<00:03:12.270> adds<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.750> keyframe

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
method now but that only adds a keyframe

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.460 
method now but that only adds a keyframe
for<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.770> certain<00:03:14.160> channel<00:03:14.840> but<00:03:15.840> now<00:03:16.020> if<00:03:16.350> you

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
for that certain channel but now if you

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.550 
for that certain channel but now if you
go<00:03:16.590> up<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:17.000> animation<00:03:18.000> add<00:03:19.430> keyframe<00:03:21.560> this

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
go up to animation add keyframe this

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.650 
go up to animation add keyframe this
will<00:03:22.740> now<00:03:22.890> add<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.130> keyframe<00:03:23.550> for<00:03:23.880> all<00:03:24.300> current

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
will now add a keyframe for all current

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.520 
will now add a keyframe for all current
channels<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.270> can<00:03:27.420> see<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.840> even<00:03:27.990> added<00:03:28.380> a

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
channels and you can see it even added a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.700 
channels and you can see it even added a
keyframe<00:03:28.920> now<00:03:29.130> for<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:30.320> point<00:03:31.320> motion

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
keyframe now for the point motion

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.330 
keyframe now for the point motion
portion<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:33.060> animation<00:03:33.990> so<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.710> now<00:03:35.310> have

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
portion of the animation so you now have

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.090 
portion of the animation so you now have
keyframes<00:03:36.150> for<00:03:36.300> all<00:03:36.660> those<00:03:36.989> points<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.770> that

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
keyframes for all those points and that

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.800 
keyframes for all those points and that
allows<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.610> lock<00:03:38.850> in<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.209> animation<00:03:39.540> at

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
allows you to lock in the animation at

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.710 
allows you to lock in the animation at
that<00:03:39.959> certain<00:03:40.260> point<00:03:40.500> for<00:03:41.160> all<00:03:41.459> instances<00:03:42.270> of

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
that certain point for all instances of

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.920 
that certain point for all instances of
your<00:03:43.320> animation<00:03:44.040> channels<00:03:44.580> so<00:03:45.510> that's<00:03:45.720> a

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
your animation channels so that's a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.830 
your animation channels so that's a
another<00:03:46.350> useful<00:03:46.620> feature<00:03:46.860> for<00:03:47.750> working<00:03:48.750> on

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
another useful feature for working on

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.860 
another useful feature for working on
the<00:03:48.959> timeline<00:03:49.730> another<00:03:50.730> new<00:03:50.910> feature<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.480> the

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
the timeline another new feature is the

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.500 
the timeline another new feature is the
ability<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.709> edit<00:03:53.040> multiple<00:03:53.760> keyframes<00:03:54.300> at

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
ability to edit multiple keyframes at

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.830 
ability to edit multiple keyframes at
once<00:03:54.920> so<00:03:55.920> just<00:03:56.880> as<00:03:57.000> an<00:03:57.120> example<00:03:57.239> here<00:03:57.750> I'm<00:03:57.810> just

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
once so just as an example here I'm just

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.320 
once so just as an example here I'm just
going<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.110> get<00:03:58.860> rid<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.100> all<00:03:59.220> this<00:03:59.459> stuff<00:03:59.730> right

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
going to get rid of all this stuff right

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.350 
going to get rid of all this stuff right
now<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.720> pop<00:04:01.440> back<00:04:01.680> here<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.250> grab<00:04:02.520> my

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
now and pop back here and grab my

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.840 
now and pop back here and grab my
transform<00:04:04.080> layer<00:04:04.260> tool<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:05.400> can<00:04:05.520> see<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:05.760> have

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
transform layer tool you can see I have

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.990 
transform layer tool you can see I have
a<00:04:06.060> path<00:04:06.360> now<00:04:06.690> it's<00:04:06.989> just<00:04:07.680> an<00:04:07.980> example<00:04:08.520> i

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
a path now it's just an example i

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.100 
a path now it's just an example i
created<00:04:09.860> but<00:04:10.910> when<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:11.940> page<00:04:12.600> through<00:04:12.630> here<00:04:13.020> you

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
created but when I page through here you

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.750 
created but when I page through here you
can<00:04:13.230> see<00:04:13.350> I<00:04:13.380> have<00:04:13.470> some<00:04:13.860> movement<00:04:14.430> going<00:04:14.550> on

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
can see I have some movement going on

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.039 
can see I have some movement going on
now<00:04:15.510> let's<00:04:15.720> say<00:04:15.900> for<00:04:16.169> whatever<00:04:16.470> reason<00:04:16.830> i<00:04:18.049> made

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
now let's say for whatever reason i made

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.080 
now let's say for whatever reason i made
this<00:04:19.169> animation<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.190> realize<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:20.640> made<00:04:21.060> a

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
this animation and I realize I made a

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.960 
this animation and I realize I made a
mistake<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.720> I<00:04:22.260> want<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.430> animation<00:04:23.760> to

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
mistake that I want the animation to

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.750 
mistake that I want the animation to
take<00:04:24.240> place<00:04:24.510> over<00:04:25.140> here<00:04:25.380> on<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:26.250> portion<00:04:26.700> of

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
take place over here on this portion of

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.700 
take place over here on this portion of
my<00:04:26.910> screen<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.360> want<00:04:27.750> all<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.230> movement<00:04:28.500> to

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
my screen I want all this movement to

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.040 
my screen I want all this movement to
take<00:04:28.860> place<00:04:29.130> over<00:04:29.490> here<00:04:29.790> well<00:04:30.570> in<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.870> past

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
take place over here well in the past

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.860 
take place over here well in the past
you<00:04:31.410> know<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.590> had<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:32.190> essentially<00:04:33.180> move

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
you know you had to essentially move

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.690 
you know you had to essentially move
every<00:04:34.169> keyframe<00:04:34.710> individually<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.580> would

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
every keyframe individually you would

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.030 
every keyframe individually you would
have<00:04:35.790> to<00:04:35.850> move<00:04:36.030> this<00:04:36.240> one<00:04:36.480> then<00:04:37.230> page<00:04:37.500> over<00:04:37.830> to

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
have to move this one then page over to

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.290 
have to move this one then page over to
frame<00:04:38.880> 12<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:39.570> then<00:04:39.870> move<00:04:40.350> that<00:04:40.770> one<00:04:41.039> and<00:04:41.300> just

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
frame 12 and then move that one and just

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.420 
frame 12 and then move that one and just
kind<00:04:42.479> of<00:04:42.510> keep<00:04:42.720> piecing<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.860> animation

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
kind of keep piecing the animation

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.380 
kind of keep piecing the animation
together

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
together

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.510 
together
where<00:04:45.510> you<00:04:45.780> wanted<00:04:46.260> it<00:04:46.320> to<00:04:46.380> go<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:47.010> this<00:04:47.340> could

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
where you wanted it to go and this could

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.260 
where you wanted it to go and this could
be<00:04:47.700> very<00:04:47.730> tedious<00:04:48.830> however<00:04:49.830> now<00:04:50.070> if<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:51.060> come

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
be very tedious however now if you come

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.480 
be very tedious however now if you come
down<00:04:51.420> here<00:04:51.450> to<00:04:51.720> your<00:04:51.900> timeline<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.620> highlight

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
down here to your timeline and highlight

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.310 
down here to your timeline and highlight
all<00:04:53.700> of<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:54.330> keyframes<00:04:54.810> and<00:04:56.300> then<00:04:57.300> move<00:04:58.140> the

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
all of the keyframes and then move the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.560 
all of the keyframes and then move the
animation<00:04:58.890> or<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.520> particular<00:04:59.790> key<00:05:00.300> frame

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
animation or that particular key frame

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.630 
animation or that particular key frame
where<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:00.840> want<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.170> so<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:01.650> can<00:05:02.280> move<00:05:02.370> it<00:05:02.490> like

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:02.640 
where you want it so I can move it like

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.020 
where you want it so I can move it like
over<00:05:03.120> here<00:05:03.420> and<00:05:03.630> release<00:05:04.200> you<00:05:05.010> can<00:05:05.190> see<00:05:05.400> now<00:05:05.580> it

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
over here and release you can see now it

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.520 
over here and release you can see now it
moves<00:05:06.360> that<00:05:06.690> entire<00:05:07.250> animation<00:05:09.380> where<00:05:10.380> you

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
moves that entire animation where you

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.620 
moves that entire animation where you
want<00:05:10.770> it<00:05:10.800> to<00:05:10.950> go<00:05:11.130> because<00:05:11.820> you<00:05:11.940> have<00:05:11.970> all<00:05:12.420> those

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
want it to go because you have all those

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.190 
want it to go because you have all those
key<00:05:12.900> frame<00:05:13.170> selected<00:05:13.670> now<00:05:14.670> this<00:05:14.880> works<00:05:15.240> too

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
key frame selected now this works too

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.460 
key frame selected now this works too
for<00:05:16.620> instance<00:05:16.920> if<00:05:17.130> I<00:05:17.280> only<00:05:17.490> selected<00:05:18.470> like

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
for instance if I only selected like

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.430 
for instance if I only selected like
let's<00:05:19.680> say<00:05:19.770> for<00:05:20.040> instance<00:05:20.070> i<00:05:21.200> select<00:05:22.200> these

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
let's say for instance i select these

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.210 
let's say for instance i select these
three<00:05:22.800> key<00:05:23.010> frames<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.610> then<00:05:24.540> I<00:05:24.630> move<00:05:24.840> them

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
three key frames and then I move them

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.190 
three key frames and then I move them
you<00:05:26.220> can<00:05:26.370> see<00:05:26.550> now<00:05:26.730> it<00:05:27.000> alters<00:05:27.450> the<00:05:27.600> path<00:05:27.810> but

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
you can see now it alters the path but

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.410 
you can see now it alters the path but
those<00:05:28.410> three<00:05:28.800> key<00:05:29.040> frames<00:05:29.460> have<00:05:30.000> now<00:05:30.210> been

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:30.420 
those three key frames have now been

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.990 
those three key frames have now been
moved<00:05:30.690> according<00:05:31.320> to<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:32.340> animation<00:05:32.850> that

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
moved according to the animation that

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.570 
moved according to the animation that
has<00:05:33.120> taken<00:05:33.270> place<00:05:33.450> up<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:34.170> that<00:05:34.320> point<00:05:34.560> so<00:05:34.860> that

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
has taken place up to that point so that

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.320 
has taken place up to that point so that
can<00:05:35.910> be<00:05:36.030> very<00:05:36.240> useful<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:37.040> a<00:05:38.040> time<00:05:38.340> saver<00:05:38.640> when

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
can be very useful and a time saver when

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.990 
can be very useful and a time saver when
working<00:05:39.600> on<00:05:39.810> your<00:05:40.020> animations<00:05:40.650> and<00:05:41.000> this

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
working on your animations and this

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.080 
working on your animations and this
works<00:05:42.270> for<00:05:42.540> point<00:05:43.200> movement<00:05:43.680> as<00:05:43.830> well<00:05:44.280> to

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
works for point movement as well to

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.060 
works for point movement as well to
demonstrate<00:05:45.210> this<00:05:45.660> further<00:05:45.990> I<00:05:46.110> have<00:05:46.530> created

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
demonstrate this further I have created

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.180 
demonstrate this further I have created
another<00:05:47.610> example<00:05:48.060> here<00:05:48.420> I<00:05:49.020> have<00:05:49.500> an<00:05:49.680> object

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
another example here I have an object

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.750 
another example here I have an object
that<00:05:50.430> is<00:05:51.260> edited<00:05:52.260> only<00:05:52.590> by<00:05:52.710> points<00:05:53.340> and<00:05:53.670> you

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
that is edited only by points and you

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.640 
that is edited only by points and you
can<00:05:53.880> see<00:05:54.060> that<00:05:54.240> on<00:05:54.420> my<00:05:54.660> timeline<00:05:55.020> through<00:05:55.560> the

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
can see that on my timeline through the

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.830 
can see that on my timeline through the
channels<00:05:56.070> and<00:05:56.310> what<00:05:56.940> I<00:05:56.970> did<00:05:57.180> here<00:05:57.450> with<00:05:57.660> the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
channels and what I did here with the

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.530 
channels and what I did here with the
points<00:05:58.290> is<00:05:58.440> as<00:05:59.010> I<00:05:59.130> came<00:05:59.370> in<00:05:59.550> and<00:05:59.790> I<00:06:00.210> just<00:06:00.240> did

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
points is as I came in and I just did

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.510 
points is as I came in and I just did
this<00:06:00.690> quick<00:06:01.110> animation<00:06:01.350> word<00:06:01.860> stretches<00:06:02.400> back

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
this quick animation word stretches back

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.450 
this quick animation word stretches back
and<00:06:02.580> forth<00:06:02.970> so<00:06:03.870> let's<00:06:04.230> say<00:06:04.470> for<00:06:05.190> whatever

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
and forth so let's say for whatever

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.030 
and forth so let's say for whatever
reason<00:06:05.850> I<00:06:06.050> finished<00:06:07.050> this<00:06:07.230> and<00:06:07.530> I'm<00:06:07.680> like<00:06:07.860> oh

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
reason I finished this and I'm like oh

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.000 
reason I finished this and I'm like oh
well<00:06:08.370> I<00:06:08.400> want<00:06:08.850> to<00:06:09.290> alter<00:06:10.290> my<00:06:10.410> points<00:06:10.830> I

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
well I want to alter my points I

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.340 
well I want to alter my points I
actually<00:06:11.340> don't<00:06:11.640> want<00:06:11.850> this<00:06:12.000> shape<00:06:12.300> so<00:06:13.080> I'm<00:06:13.200> on

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
actually don't want this shape so I'm on

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
shape like so so I this is the shape i

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.620 
shape like so so I this is the shape i
wanted<00:06:29.070> but<00:06:29.540> of<00:06:30.540> course<00:06:30.810> as<00:06:31.140> it<00:06:31.830> pages<00:06:32.040> through

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
wanted but of course as it pages through

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.510 
wanted but of course as it pages through
since<00:06:33.630> we<00:06:33.810> already<00:06:34.050> created<00:06:34.680> keyframes<00:06:35.250> for

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
since we already created keyframes for

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.740 
since we already created keyframes for
this<00:06:36.120> particular<00:06:38.000> animation<00:06:39.000> with<00:06:39.600> the

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
this particular animation with the

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.600 
this particular animation with the
points<00:06:40.140> you<00:06:40.470> can<00:06:40.500> see<00:06:40.800> now<00:06:40.950> that<00:06:41.130> it<00:06:41.160> morphs

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
points you can see now that it morphs

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.230 
points you can see now that it morphs
back<00:06:42.050> when<00:06:43.050> we<00:06:43.170> hit<00:06:43.350> the<00:06:43.500> second<00:06:43.800> keyframe<00:06:44.240> so

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
back when we hit the second keyframe so

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.690 
back when we hit the second keyframe so
by<00:06:45.840> page<00:06:46.110> back<00:06:46.350> here<00:06:46.650> and<00:06:46.740> just<00:06:47.430> get<00:06:47.550> rid<00:06:47.610> of

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:47.700 
by page back here and just get rid of

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.020 
by page back here and just get rid of
this<00:06:47.850> what<00:06:48.810> i<00:06:48.870> can<00:06:49.050> do<00:06:49.260> now<00:06:49.760> using<00:06:50.760> the<00:06:50.850> same

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:02.900 
with my translate point tool and create

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:12.680 
with my translate point tool and create
the<00:07:03.900> shape<00:07:04.110> I<00:07:04.260> want<00:07:09.950> and<00:07:10.950> so<00:07:11.880> now<00:07:12.060> when<00:07:12.360> I<00:07:12.390> page

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690 
the shape I want and so now when I page

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.340 
the shape I want and so now when I page
through<00:07:13.520> you<00:07:14.520> can<00:07:14.670> see<00:07:14.940> that<00:07:15.630> those<00:07:15.810> points

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
through you can see that those points

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.270 
through you can see that those points
retained<00:07:17.190> their<00:07:17.910> shape<00:07:18.890> while<00:07:19.890> at<00:07:20.010> the<00:07:20.100> same

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
retained their shape while at the same

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.010 
retained their shape while at the same
time<00:07:20.340> they're<00:07:21.030> going<00:07:21.390> through<00:07:21.660> and<00:07:21.810> being

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
time they're going through and being

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.670 
time they're going through and being
resized<00:07:22.440> and<00:07:22.800> so<00:07:23.310> on<00:07:23.490> so<00:07:24.360> again<00:07:24.630> this<00:07:25.320> can

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 
resized and so on so again this can

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.230
