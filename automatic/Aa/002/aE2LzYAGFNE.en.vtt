bag of pennies that I didn't count so
let's<00:01:01.289> go<00:01:01.469> test<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.949> Green<00:01:02.129> Machine<00:01:03.080> and

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
let's go test the Green Machine and

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.289 
let's go test the Green Machine and
while<00:01:05.100> we're<00:01:05.369> doing<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.610> why<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.210> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
while we're doing that why don't you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.859 
while we're doing that why don't you
take<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> guess<00:01:07.100> how<00:01:08.100> much<00:01:08.220> money<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:10.369> this

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
take a guess how much money is in this

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:19.429 
take a guess how much money is in this
regular<00:01:12.869> sized<00:01:14.330> Ziploc<00:01:15.330> style<00:01:16.850> bag<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.439> guess

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
regular sized Ziploc style bag I guess

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.429 
regular sized Ziploc style bag I guess
it's<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> freezer<00:01:19.950> bag<00:01:20.150> it's<00:01:21.150> still<00:01:21.439> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it's a freezer bag it's still the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.609 
it's a freezer bag it's still the
regular<00:01:22.830> size<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.369> about<00:01:23.430> hand<00:01:23.939> size<00:01:25.159> okay

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
regular size it's about hand size okay

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.480 
regular size it's about hand size okay
okay<00:01:28.850> okay<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.240> are<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> results<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
okay okay so here are the results the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
okay okay so here are the results the
part<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> parentheses<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.930> right<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
part in the parentheses to the right is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.710 
part in the parentheses to the right is
where<00:01:34.710> what<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.610> Green<00:01:35.790> Machine<00:01:35.909> says<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.540> put

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
where what the Green Machine says I put

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.249 
where what the Green Machine says I put
in<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.860> number<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> left<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.869> number

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
in the number to the left of the number

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.710 
in the number to the left of the number
in<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> parentheses<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.790> number<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.450> I

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
in the parentheses is the number that I

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.830 
in the parentheses is the number that I
believe<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.409> put<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:44.030> general<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.390> close

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
believe I put in in general it's close

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.020 
believe I put in in general it's close
to<00:01:46.170> within<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> margin<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> error<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.640> take<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to within the margin of error but take a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:02:02.270 
to within the margin of error but take a
look<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.360> yourself

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.680 

so<00:02:03.280> as<00:02:03.400> you<00:02:03.490> can<00:02:03.580> see<00:02:03.640> from<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.000> test<00:02:04.270> the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
so as you can see from the test the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.200 
so as you can see from the test the
green<00:02:04.900> machine<00:02:05.260> does<00:02:05.530> pretty<00:02:06.400> good<00:02:06.490> missed<00:02:07.090> a

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
green machine does pretty good missed a

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.780 
green machine does pretty good missed a
little<00:02:07.330> bit<00:02:07.570> all<00:02:08.320> in<00:02:08.560> all<00:02:08.710> I<00:02:08.740> would<00:02:09.010> say<00:02:09.040> it's

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
little bit all in all I would say it's

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.970 
little bit all in all I would say it's
probably<00:02:10.000> not<00:02:10.450> ripping<00:02:11.380> me<00:02:11.590> off

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
probably not ripping me off

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.330 
probably not ripping me off
I<00:02:12.010> just<00:02:12.370> am<00:02:12.640> greedy<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.600> I<00:02:13.990> want<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.530> error

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
I just am greedy and I want it to error

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.450 
I just am greedy and I want it to error
in<00:02:15.670> my<00:02:15.880> favor<00:02:16.230> as<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.710> can<00:02:17.830> see<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.250> only

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
in my favor as you can see it only

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.720 
in my favor as you can see it only
slightly<00:02:18.850> erred<00:02:19.210> in<00:02:19.510> its<00:02:20.020> favor<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:20.950> there<00:02:21.670> you

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
slightly erred in its favor so there you

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:22.050 
slightly erred in its favor so there you
go

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
go

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.600 
go
