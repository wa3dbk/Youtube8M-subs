00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
high-quality sound there's one issue

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.350 
high-quality sound there's one issue
sometimes<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.640> could<00:02:47.820> get<00:02:48.000> some<00:02:48.180> noise

sometimes you could get some noise

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.360 
sometimes you could get some noise
leakage<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.140> these<00:02:49.290> things<00:02:49.500> may<00:02:49.800> sound<00:02:50.010> loud

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
leakage and these things may sound loud

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
a more noisy environment these will be

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.060 
a more noisy environment these will be
perfectly<00:03:02.910> fine<00:03:03.239> bass<00:03:03.959> isn't<00:03:04.230> great<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:04.860> gets

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070
