all billet billet aluminum this is a new
version<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.220> an<00:00:23.340> updated<00:00:23.699> version<00:00:23.850> here

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
version it's an updated version here

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.779 
version it's an updated version here
this<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.480> all<00:00:24.600> polished<00:00:25.340> so<00:00:26.340> it's<00:00:26.490> got<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> nice

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
this is all polished so it's got a nice

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.370 
this is all polished so it's got a nice
little<00:00:27.000> look<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.330> it

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
little look to it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.740 
little look to it
the<00:00:29.160> idea<00:00:29.400> here<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> not<00:00:30.119> just<00:00:30.359> changing

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the idea here now is not just changing

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.590 
the idea here now is not just changing
the<00:00:30.869> lever<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.650> an<00:00:31.800> easy<00:00:32.010> pull<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.940> when<00:00:33.570> I

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the lever it's an easy pull so when I

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.860 
the lever it's an easy pull so when I
say<00:00:33.809> easy<00:00:33.840> pool<00:00:34.260> that's<00:00:34.680> pretty<00:00:35.220> pretty

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
say easy pool that's pretty pretty

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.940 
say easy pool that's pretty pretty
obvious<00:00:36.870> what<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> mean<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.770> makes

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
obvious what I mean is that it makes

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.160 
obvious what I mean is that it makes
your<00:00:38.160> pull<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.700> lever<00:00:38.880> much<00:00:39.180> easier<00:00:39.570> why

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
your pull on the lever much easier why

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.660 
your pull on the lever much easier why
would<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.440> want<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.680> well<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.370> numerous

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
would you want that well for numerous

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.100 
would you want that well for numerous
reasons<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.660> you're<00:00:42.809> working

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
reasons one is that if you're working

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
reasons one is that if you're working
the<00:00:43.200> clutch<00:00:43.410> all<00:00:43.620> day<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:44.820> there's<00:00:45.030> only

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
the clutch all day you know there's only

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.610 
the clutch all day you know there's only
seems<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.540> be<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.690> lot<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.899> pressure<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:46.260> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
seems to be a lot of pressure there and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.160 
seems to be a lot of pressure there and
some<00:00:47.070> people<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.489> use<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:48.030> finger<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.570> or

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
some people like to use one finger if or

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.350 
some people like to use one finger if or
two<00:00:49.410> fingers<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.430> gets<00:00:50.610> really<00:00:50.760> tiring

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
two fingers and that gets really tiring

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600 
two fingers and that gets really tiring
on<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:51.809> hand<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.829> you're<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:53.129> at<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> track

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
going to use our clips we're gonna use

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.649 
going to use our clips we're gonna use
our<00:01:46.290> scale<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:47.700> show<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.149> how<00:01:48.270> how

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
our scale here to show you just how how

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.359 
our scale here to show you just how how
different<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.229> significant<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.009> easy<00:01:50.159> pull

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
different and significant and easy pull

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.969 
different and significant and easy pull
system<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.540> measures<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.229> pounds

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
system is so this measures in in pounds

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.440 
system is so this measures in in pounds
and<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.280> pretty<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.700> pretty<00:01:53.909> basic<00:01:54.060> here

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and it's pretty it's pretty basic here

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
and it's pretty it's pretty basic here
we're<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.229> measure<00:01:55.500> how<00:01:55.860> much

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
we're just going to measure how much

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.160 
we're just going to measure how much
force<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.090> takes<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.360> pull<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> stock<00:01:57.930> clutch

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
force it takes to pull the stock clutch

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.200 
force it takes to pull the stock clutch
back<00:01:58.470> then<00:01:59.100> we'll<00:01:59.280> swap<00:01:59.549> over<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.060> easy

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
back then we'll swap over to the easy

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.030 
back then we'll swap over to the easy
pull<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.960> we'll<00:02:01.079> measure<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.439> again<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
pull and we'll measure that again and

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
pull and we'll measure that again and
you<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> difference<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.630> it's

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you can see the difference is it's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.560 
you can see the difference is it's
pretty<00:02:04.170> drastic

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
pretty drastic

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.930 
pretty drastic

this<00:02:28.459> one<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.820> pretty<00:02:29.660> pretty<00:02:30.050> good<00:02:30.230> quality

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
this one is pretty pretty good quality

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.590 
this one is pretty pretty good quality
from<00:02:30.770> what<00:02:30.950> we've<00:02:31.070> seen<00:02:31.100> so<00:02:31.280> far<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.240> let's<00:02:32.420> go

put<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.090> on<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:46.040> we're<00:02:46.130> going<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.310> pretend

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
put this on and we're going to pretend

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.920 
put this on and we're going to pretend
that<00:02:46.640> this<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.540> hand<00:02:47.959> pulling<00:02:48.560> this<00:02:48.680> in<00:02:48.890> so

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
that this is a hand pulling this in so

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.740 
that this is a hand pulling this in so
let<00:02:50.930> me<00:02:51.020> check<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:51.470> out<00:02:51.709> pull<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.820> to

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
let me check this out pull it in to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.089 
let me check this out pull it in to
there<00:02:54.459> lock<00:02:55.459> it<00:02:55.640> in

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.920 

okay

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
okay

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.369 
okay
so<00:03:01.560> we've<00:03:01.650> got<00:03:02.239> 16<00:03:03.239> and<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.450> half<00:03:03.629> pounds<00:03:04.200> of

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
so we've got 16 and a half pounds of

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.190 
so we've got 16 and a half pounds of
force<00:03:04.739> now<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.659> might<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:06.870> mean<00:03:07.170> anything

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
force now that might not mean anything

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.910 
force now that might not mean anything
to<00:03:07.530> you

literally that you have to push against
this<00:03:14.040> now<00:03:14.340> if<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:14.610> think<00:03:14.819> of<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.060> know<00:03:15.150> pick

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
this now if you think of you know pick

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.539 
this now if you think of you know pick
up<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.780> jug<00:03:16.409> of<00:03:16.439> milk<00:03:16.650> only<00:03:17.040> weighs<00:03:17.189> six<00:03:17.459> pounds

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
up a jug of milk only weighs six pounds

up a jug of milk only weighs six pounds
so<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:19.379> have<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.620> pick<00:03:19.769> up<00:03:19.920> three<00:03:20.189> of<00:03:20.310> those

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
so you have to pick up three of those

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.210 
so you have to pick up three of those
nearly<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.629> to<00:03:22.109> push<00:03:22.379> that<00:03:22.530> lever<00:03:22.769> in<00:03:23.040> now

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
compare it with our previous so I'm

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:35.870 
compare it with our previous so I'm
going<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.400> give<00:04:23.520> this<00:04:23.639> a<00:04:23.699> pull<00:04:24.000> here

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.360

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
so here we are at 7.5 so that's nearly

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.740 
so here we are at 7.5 so that's nearly
half<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.919> what<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.340> stock<00:04:45.580> clutch<00:04:46.150> pull<00:04:46.510> was

that's pretty significant you know
before<00:04:52.479> it<00:04:52.510> was<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:53.199> wasn't<00:04:53.530> exactly<00:04:53.740> hard<00:04:54.280> to
