00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
them as much so you might end up getting

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.510 
them as much so you might end up getting
a<00:01:20.810> square<00:01:21.140> blade<00:01:21.380> scraper<00:01:24.009> whatever<00:01:25.009> just

science<00:03:11.590> it<00:03:12.280> just<00:03:12.550> takes<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.850> little<00:03:12.970> bit<00:03:13.150> of

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
science it just takes a little bit of

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.000 
science it just takes a little bit of
fortitude<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:14.020> little<00:03:14.530> bit<00:03:14.620> of<00:03:14.709> elbow<00:03:14.860> grease
