something that I thought was very
interesting<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.569> melissa<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.680> involved

and working with him according to the
poster<00:02:25.859> the<00:02:26.849> reason<00:02:27.269> why<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.489> Melissa

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
poster the reason why is that Melissa

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.210 
poster the reason why is that Melissa
actually<00:02:30.540> buried<00:02:30.989> Bethany<00:02:31.439> young<00:02:31.680> alive

actually buried Bethany young alive

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.199 
actually buried Bethany young alive
because<00:02:33.090> um<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.790> not<00:02:35.909> something<00:02:36.090> that

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
because um this is not something that

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.149

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
something that I feel like anyone could

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.469 
something that I feel like anyone could
predict<00:04:34.919> so<00:04:35.310> either<00:04:35.520> this<00:04:35.760> person<00:04:36.120> totally

predict so either this person totally
make<00:04:36.630> this<00:04:36.659> up<00:04:37.020> or<00:04:37.260> if<00:04:37.860> this<00:04:38.039> happens<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.700> I

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
my opinion but they also said that Emily

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.080
