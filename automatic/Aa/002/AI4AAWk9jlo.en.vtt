00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 we are in martyr artillery oli in 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.589
 berisso with our production team 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.469
 the first green column of the year we're going to 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.630
 travel with hugo with his boat all the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.509
 works they are doing in the mountain of 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.270
 berisso in this jungle that lost more than 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.670
 50 hectares we will be showing you 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.630
 live cutting live and the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.630
 water contamination 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.730
 Y 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.739
 lifetime 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.210
 m 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.040
 there was tell us where we are in this 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.160
 good time we just got out of the 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.730
 shipyard martinoli we are in the channel 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.790
 of access to the wing gunner 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.070
 right what the camera is taking is 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.350
 the first part of the jungle mountain 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.140
 from here we have this sugarcane 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.450
 tacuaras from here and all this goes 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.970
 to be dismantled so that a route passes 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.220
 to take out the containers that will go 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.780
 parallel to the coastal embankment 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.080
 is 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.180
 is from here to there that is 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.400
 a very new layout is what we are 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.950
 seeing the profile of the humidity when 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.500
 low the growing what we have is this 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.470
 profile where we see that the roots are 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.140
 in the air when you think the water reaches 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.659
 the height of that length that we have there 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.360
 and it is what transforms the flood all 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.280
 this area and is the one that makes the vegetation 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.500
 we are on the peak channel the course to the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.030
 four hugo mouths what we can 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.220
 see here in this good part we have 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.380
 on port we have what will be the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.409
 Silver terminal that starts 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.210
 approximately here this area is the 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.119
 who will receive all 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.909
 containers apparently will receive 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.979
 500 thousand containers per year what 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.649
 means that the port of buenos aires 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.140
 along with the south dock and all avellaneda 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.390
 receive one million per year we will have 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.819
 half only at a concentrated point 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.410
 we are talking about a mega structure 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.600
 then not what was spoken to 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.850
 principle no no it's not a mega 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.410
 structure a mega work there is a 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:32.150
 investment of 2,000 million pesos 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.220
 we do not know why it was approved 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.670
 environmental impact what is the impact 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.710
 environmental because it is very difficult to have 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.960
 approved this inside that this was monte 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.480
 this was not a protected landscape 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.100
 Christ and apart we were just watching 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.690
 the species we could take with the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.430
 camera that is already starting to 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.939
 disappear 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.159
 look here at about 150 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.129
 meters there was a quarry that no longer 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:01.459
 there is more was covered where we had a 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.650
 kind of reservation that reservation had 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.750
 they could see in a day and there are records of 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.519
 alcoa de la plata and dzeko a de berisso 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.739
 which are the observation centers of 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.069
 Argentine bird birds an institution 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.379
 which is like wildlife where it 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.239
 they could see up to 70 species in 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.489
 one day we are talking about a year ago 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.470
 behind as it was called the company that 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.470
 started with this work the company that 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.769
 awarded the province of Buenos Aires 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.079
 this silver in turn this explodes to 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.909
 do the dredging that is what we are 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:35.719
 watching us showing on sticks 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:38.810
 now in the water that company is pentamar 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:41.810
 and joined together with another company that dried 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.590
 dima sale sea unfortunately the same 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.900
 company that made the move in 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.209
 nordelta here last year at a party 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.180
 of fish here there were 30 species of fish 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.370
 here 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.010
 this year we can discover one or two or 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.379
 what we see here is the water outlet 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.659
 salted water salt 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.170
 they broke when they did the strict 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.909
 of silver the foundation my theory is that 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.889
 this water that is coming out here 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.569
 they knew they were going to break this is it 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.489
 investing approximately 10 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.069
 million liters directly here 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.320
 santiago river to the peak channel no and it's 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.389
 eliminating notice all that is the 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.459
 vegetation of the lake here this was monte 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.770
 this is a natural disaster directly 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.810
 it is a natural disaster the hotel that 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.180
 would have to stop the works before 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.400
 this disaster receives here we are going to take 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.159
 one shows the water that normally 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.370
 have to have a ph 7 we just 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:37.900
 make a sample just now and let's measure 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.810
 the ph 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.810
 and from this place and we're going to see that the ph 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:52.040
 there we have there are three the ph is 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.860
 exceeding the maximum value of 82 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.350
 we have the red color above the chest 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.850
 at night because there is a ph it is as if 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.580
 out the bandina what is coming out 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.910
 potassium hydroxide at night a lot 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.570
 of kiko are being thrown untreated 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.630
 destroying everything that is the 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.160
 biodiversity especially the aquatic 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.310
 We are watching live live the 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.580
 dismantle by six machines 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.580
 affairs 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.890
 where is that something is in your journey 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.830
 and all this up to the river of silver 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.170
 all this is not authorized and they are 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.930
 raising the pipes to start 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.270
 disassemble everything and dismantle 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.560
 If you look at it here and contains shots go 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.110
 to see that all the trees there already 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.479
 they are yellow because they are drying 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.360
 all that is mud with the highest 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:49.060
 pollution has heavy metals a 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.880
 bucket to weigh about 15 kilos more or 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.699
 less and that's where you see this is 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.120
 is here where the wetland disappears 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:59.750
 directly 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.750
 all right 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.970
 ah
