to another mod showcase and today I'm

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.200 
to another mod showcase and today I'm
gonna<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.800> showing<00:00:11.010> your<00:00:11.250> mod<00:00:11.490> called<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.940> no

gonna be showing your mod called the no

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.390 
gonna be showing your mod called the no
cubes<00:00:12.660> mod<00:00:12.960> which<00:00:13.410> aims<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.740> smooth<00:00:14.099> out<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
cubes mod which aims to smooth out the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.950 
cubes mod which aims to smooth out the
terrain<00:00:14.580> in<00:00:14.790> Minecraft<00:00:15.210> by<00:00:15.330> adding<00:00:15.599> slopes

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
terrain in Minecraft by adding slopes

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.450 
terrain in Minecraft by adding slopes
which<00:00:16.410> naturally<00:00:16.859> generate<00:00:17.250> when<00:00:17.369> you

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
which naturally generate when you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.519 
which naturally generate when you
generate<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.970> world<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:19.080> way<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.350> works

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
generate a world and the way this works

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.019 
generate a world and the way this works
is<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:20.070> if<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.580> like<00:00:20.730> two<00:00:20.910> different

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
is you if you have like two different

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.300 
is you if you have like two different
elevations<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.810> blocks<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.289> slope<00:00:22.859> will<00:00:23.039> form

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
elevations of blocks a slope will form

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.400 
elevations of blocks a slope will form
between<00:00:23.670> them<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.359> actually<00:00:24.689> have<00:00:24.869> I

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
between them if you actually have I

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.779 
between them if you actually have I
think<00:00:25.830> there's<00:00:26.070> four<00:00:26.099> different<00:00:26.490> kinds<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
think there's four different kinds of

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.490 
think there's four different kinds of
blocks<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.119> works<00:00:27.390> with<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.380> have

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
blocks this works with so if you have

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500 
blocks this works with so if you have
grass<00:00:28.769> blocks<00:00:29.130> stone<00:00:29.609> blocks<00:00:29.910> dirt<00:00:30.240> blocks

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
grass blocks stone blocks dirt blocks

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.389 
grass blocks stone blocks dirt blocks
and<00:00:30.750> snow<00:00:31.260> blocks<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.740> those<00:00:31.890> snow-capped

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and snow blocks like those snow-capped

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.010 
and snow blocks like those snow-capped
peaks<00:00:32.669> over<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.719> try<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
peaks over there it's going to try and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.479 
peaks over there it's going to try and
smooth<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> train<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.010> make<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.340> like

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
smooth out the train to make it like

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.360 
smooth out the train to make it like
really<00:00:35.520> gentle<00:00:36.239> kind<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.750> gradients<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:38.219> yeah

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
really gentle kind of gradients but yeah

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.310 
really gentle kind of gradients but yeah
so<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.760> could<00:00:38.910> possibly<00:00:39.000> get<00:00:39.329> 500<00:00:39.930> likes<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
so if we could possibly get 500 likes I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.660 
so if we could possibly get 500 likes I
know<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.620> bit<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.890> stretched<00:00:41.219> goal<00:00:41.489> that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
know it's a bit of a stretched goal that

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.700 
know it's a bit of a stretched goal that
one<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.570> 500<00:00:42.750> likes<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.559> mod

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
one but if we get 500 likes on this mod

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.190 
one but if we get 500 likes on this mod
showcase<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.460> would<00:00:44.610> be<00:00:44.760> brilliant<00:00:45.170> but<00:00:46.170> I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
showcase that would be brilliant but I

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.240 
showcase that would be brilliant but I
did<00:00:46.350> actually<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> laugh<00:00:46.980> when<00:00:47.190> I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
did actually have a laugh when I

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.709 
did actually have a laugh when I
actually<00:00:47.370> looked<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> mod<00:00:48.059> topic<00:00:48.420> because

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
actually looked at the mod topic because

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.410 
actually looked at the mod topic because
the<00:00:49.020> title<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> mod<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.950> no<00:00:50.399> cubes<00:00:50.879> smooth

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
the title of the mod is no cubes smooth

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.810 
the title of the mod is no cubes smooth
terrain<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.920> looking<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.579> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
terrain and I'm like looking at this and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.270 
terrain and I'm like looking at this and
thinking<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.289> smooth<00:00:55.620> terrain<00:00:55.890> this

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
thinking this is not smooth terrain this

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.400 
thinking this is not smooth terrain this
is<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:56.550> far<00:00:56.789> away<00:00:57.059> from<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.600> concept<00:00:58.260> of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
is as far away from the concept of

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.990 
is as far away from the concept of
smooth<00:00:58.770> terrain<00:00:59.160> as<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.550> possibly<00:00:59.730> think

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
smooth terrain as I can possibly think

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.790 
smooth terrain as I can possibly think
of<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.480> mean<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.780> ground<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.260> undulating

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
of I mean the ground is just undulating

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.709 
of I mean the ground is just undulating
look<00:01:02.190> at<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.850> got<00:01:02.969> pits<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.570> like

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
look at this it's just got pits and like

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.399 
look at this it's just got pits and like
Peaks

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
Peaks

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.740 
Peaks
everywhere<00:01:04.830> it's<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.700> really<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.479> rough

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
everywhere it's just really really rough

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.420 
everywhere it's just really really rough
in<00:01:06.990> fact<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.710> rough<00:01:07.950> even<00:01:08.280> when

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
in fact it's so rough even when

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.980 
in fact it's so rough even when
something<00:01:08.640> looks<00:01:08.909> relatively<00:01:09.270> flat<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.810> just

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
something looks relatively flat you just

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.560 
something looks relatively flat you just
randomly<00:01:10.290> pop<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.890> random<00:01:11.460> locations<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
randomly pop up in random locations and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.870 
randomly pop up in random locations and
stuff<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.229> but<00:01:13.710> yeah<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.310> um<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
stuff like that but yeah this um the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.160 
stuff like that but yeah this um the
slopes<00:01:15.119> actually<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.810> some<00:01:15.990> cool

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
slopes actually do have some cool

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.899 
slopes actually do have some cool
functionality<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.250> know<00:01:17.400> normally<00:01:17.820> in

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
functionality so you know normally in

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.130 
functionality so you know normally in
Minecraft<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.270> actually<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.750> jump<00:01:18.990> up

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
Minecraft you actually have to jump up

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.570 
Minecraft you actually have to jump up
blocks<00:01:19.439> when<00:01:19.650> they<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.159> higher<00:01:20.340> but

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
blocks when they go one up higher but

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.700 
blocks when they go one up higher but
now<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.390> go<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.630> f5<00:01:22.020> mode<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.439> just<00:01:22.560> walk

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
now if I go to f5 mode and just walk

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.260 
now if I go to f5 mode and just walk
into<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> slope<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.000> don't<00:01:24.090> have

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
into the slope you can see I don't have

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.300 
into the slope you can see I don't have
to<00:01:24.360> press<00:01:24.509> space<00:01:24.780> at<00:01:24.990> all<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.470> pop<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.070> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to press space at all I just pop up to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.249 
to press space at all I just pop up to
the<00:01:26.400> next<00:01:26.610> level<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.750> course<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> can

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
the next level like so of course you can

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.710 
the next level like so of course you can
jump<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:29.040> work<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.570> walk

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
jump and it work but you can just walk

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.359 
jump and it work but you can just walk
around<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.439> don't<00:01:31.590> need<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> jump<00:01:32.040> at<00:01:32.189> all

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
around and you don't need to jump at all

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.069 
around and you don't need to jump at all
and<00:01:32.729> look<00:01:33.150> over<00:01:33.360> here<00:01:33.600> we've<00:01:33.750> got<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.049> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and look over here we've got like a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.539 
and look over here we've got like a
little<00:01:34.200> glitch<00:01:34.560> where<00:01:34.890> we've<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.189> got<00:01:35.369> like

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
little glitch where we've just got like

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.100 
little glitch where we've just got like
a<00:01:35.579> slope<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.479> trying<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.810> connect<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
a slope that's trying to connect to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.719 
a slope that's trying to connect to
these<00:01:37.229> leaves<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.890> we've<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.460> got<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
these leaves and we've just got like a

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.789 
these leaves and we've just got like a
sudden<00:01:39.000> jump<00:01:39.630> upwards<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.500> that's<00:01:40.680> not

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
sudden jump upwards there so that's not

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.280 
sudden jump upwards there so that's not
really<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.100> smooth<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.570> yeah<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
really that smooth but yeah it's just a

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990 
really that smooth but yeah it's just a
little<00:01:43.500> glitch<00:01:43.890> where<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> grass<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.579> trying

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
little glitch where the grass is trying

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.609 
little glitch where the grass is trying
to<00:01:45.090> connect<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.509> leaves<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.140> some<00:01:46.290> reason

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
to connect to the leaves for some reason

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.780 
to connect to the leaves for some reason
and<00:01:46.890> look<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.250> what<00:01:47.369> was<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.579> just

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and look at that what was I just

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.520 
and look at that what was I just
standing<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.329> look<00:01:48.840> at<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.079> I'm<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.380> like

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
standing on look at that I'm just like

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.760 
standing on look at that I'm just like
levitating<00:01:50.100> yeah<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.210> mod<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.869> very<00:01:52.259> buggy

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
levitating yeah this mod is very buggy

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.770 
levitating yeah this mod is very buggy
and<00:01:53.130> glitchy<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.149> hopefully<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.570> will<00:01:54.659> be

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and glitchy but hopefully this will be

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.030 
and glitchy but hopefully this will be
fixed<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.290> future<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.799> I'm<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:55.979> just

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
fixed in the future so I'm not just

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.100 
fixed in the future so I'm not just
randomly<00:01:56.490> floating<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.240> little<00:01:57.630> Peaks<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
randomly floating on little Peaks that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
randomly floating on little Peaks that
don't<00:01:58.259> exist<00:01:58.649> let's<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.460> walk<00:01:59.610> around<00:01:59.759> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
don't exist let's just walk around and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.940 
don't exist let's just walk around and
pretty<00:02:00.630> much<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.020> can<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.560> show

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
pretty much all I can do is just show

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.920 
pretty much all I can do is just show
you<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.880> landscape<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.719> what<00:02:03.810> it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
you that like landscape and what it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.660 
you that like landscape and what it
looks<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.619> look<00:02:04.890> at<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.280> grass

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
looks like and look at this the grass

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.969 
looks like and look at this the grass
doesn't<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.210> work<00:02:06.390> very<00:02:06.420> well<00:02:06.689> yeah<00:02:07.320> I

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
doesn't really work very well yeah I

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.529 
doesn't really work very well yeah I
suppose<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.550> can't<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:08.910> make<00:02:08.970> slanted

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
suppose I can't really make slanted

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.720 
suppose I can't really make slanted
grass<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.140> would<00:02:10.319> be<00:02:10.679> kind<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.009> difficult<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
grass it would be kind of difficult and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.760 
grass it would be kind of difficult and
look<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.090> cow<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.450> tree<00:02:12.690> hello<00:02:13.020> cow

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
look a cow on a tree hello cow

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.340 
look a cow on a tree hello cow
oh<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.100> on<00:02:14.400> about<00:02:14.520> mobs<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.510> mobs<00:02:15.720> are<00:02:16.020> also

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
oh and on about mobs the mobs are also

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.080 
oh and on about mobs the mobs are also
affected<00:02:16.740> by<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.920> slopes<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.760> they'll<00:02:17.910> no

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
affected by the slopes so they'll no

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.700 
affected by the slopes so they'll no
longer<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.600> jump<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:18.960> blocks<00:02:19.260> they'll<00:02:19.530> just

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
longer just jump up blocks they'll just

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.040 
longer just jump up blocks they'll just
have<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.890> walk<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:21.000> works<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.660> they<00:02:21.870> don't

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
have to walk and it works so they don't

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.560 
have to walk and it works so they don't
jump<00:02:22.950> up<00:02:23.100> blocks<00:02:23.400> even<00:02:23.640> though<00:02:23.940> they<00:02:24.150> normally

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
jump up blocks even though they normally

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.270 
jump up blocks even though they normally
would<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.810> Minecraft<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.650> look<00:02:25.920> at<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.130> that

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
would in Minecraft and look at that that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.250 
would in Minecraft and look at that that
chickens<00:02:26.640> just<00:02:26.700> floating<00:02:27.210> down<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.660> yeah

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
chickens just floating down and yeah

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.840 
chickens just floating down and yeah
this<00:02:28.590> brings<00:02:28.800> me<00:02:28.860> on<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.040> another<00:02:29.340> thing<00:02:29.490> so

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
this brings me on to another thing so

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.150 
this brings me on to another thing so
this<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.510> hill<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:31.800> there<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
this is a hill and you can see there the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.560 
this is a hill and you can see there the
grass<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.610> trying<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.910> smooth<00:02:33.120> out<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.330> hill

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
grass is trying to smooth out the hill

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.660 
grass is trying to smooth out the hill
it<00:02:33.900> doesn't<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.320> good<00:02:34.770> of<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.950> job<00:02:34.980> but<00:02:35.550> you

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
it doesn't do that good of a job but you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.850 
it doesn't do that good of a job but you
know<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:36.180> looks<00:02:36.450> decent<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.140> over<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.740> we've

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
know it looks decent and over here we've

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.470 
know it looks decent and over here we've
got<00:02:37.890> an<00:02:38.070> example<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.640> stone<00:02:38.910> smoothing

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
got an example of the stone smoothing

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.660 
got an example of the stone smoothing
and<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.620> see<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.860> slopes<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.430> stone

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
and you can see the slopes of the stone

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.430 
and you can see the slopes of the stone
on<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.300> side<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.750> mountain<00:02:43.050> here<00:02:43.290> and

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
on this side of the mountain here and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.980 
on this side of the mountain here and
yeah<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.520> think<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.270> main<00:02:45.450> thing<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.750> need<00:02:45.900> to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
yeah so I think the main thing I need to

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.720 
yeah so I think the main thing I need to
show<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.500> how<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.830> works<00:02:47.070> with<00:02:47.280> building

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
show you is how it works with building

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.950 
show you is how it works with building
because<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:48.390> don't<00:02:48.570> really<00:02:48.660> want<00:02:48.870> your

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
because you don't really want your

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.900 
because you don't really want your
buildings<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.620> sloped<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.340> that's<00:02:50.790> why

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
buildings to be sloped and that's why

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.370 
buildings to be sloped and that's why
this<00:02:51.090> mod<00:02:51.270> only<00:02:51.600> works<00:02:51.810> with<00:02:51.990> four<00:02:52.230> different

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
this mod only works with four different

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.290 
this mod only works with four different
blocks<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.340> if<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.550> try<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.820> build<00:02:54.060> something

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
blocks so if you try and build something

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.970 
blocks so if you try and build something
with<00:02:54.510> stone<00:02:54.780> for<00:02:55.020> example<00:02:55.380> which<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.800> one<00:02:55.950> of

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
with stone for example which is one of

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.560 
with stone for example which is one of
the<00:02:56.100> blocks<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.400> are<00:02:56.610> affected<00:02:57.150> by<00:02:57.240> this<00:02:57.300> mod

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
the blocks that are affected by this mod

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.300 
the blocks that are affected by this mod
you<00:02:57.750> can<00:02:57.960> see<00:02:58.110> I'm<00:02:58.200> placing<00:02:58.440> down<00:02:58.710> stone<00:02:59.040> here

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
you can see I'm placing down stone here

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.040 
you can see I'm placing down stone here
it's<00:02:59.730> just<00:02:59.880> making<00:03:00.060> random<00:03:00.390> little<00:03:00.810> Peaks

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
it's just making random little Peaks

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.360 
it's just making random little Peaks
because<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:01.590> completely<00:03:02.010> randomly

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
because it's completely randomly

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.940 
because it's completely randomly
generated<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.720> distortion<00:03:04.320> of<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.470> stone

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
generated the distortion of the stone

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.220 
generated the distortion of the stone
and<00:03:05.220> dirt<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.580> stuff<00:03:05.970> so<00:03:06.660> it<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:06.930> randomly

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
and dirt and stuff so it just randomly

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.960 
and dirt and stuff so it just randomly
generates<00:03:07.770> different<00:03:08.040> kinds<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.700> landscapes

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
generates different kinds of landscapes

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.330 
generates different kinds of landscapes
hmm<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.410> if<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.680> want<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:10.920> build<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.190> house

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
hmm but if you want to build a house

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.800 
hmm but if you want to build a house
that's<00:03:11.610> not<00:03:11.700> really<00:03:11.970> very<00:03:12.000> helpful<00:03:12.330> and

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
that's not really very helpful and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.960 
that's not really very helpful and
that's<00:03:13.200> why<00:03:13.320> this<00:03:13.380> mod<00:03:13.740> has<00:03:13.920> excluded<00:03:14.430> certain

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
that's why this mod has excluded certain

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.940 
that's why this mod has excluded certain
blocks<00:03:15.240> so<00:03:15.780> every<00:03:16.170> other<00:03:16.320> block<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:16.800> Minecraft

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
blocks so every other block in Minecraft

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.340 
blocks so every other block in Minecraft
apart<00:03:17.520> from<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.330> four<00:03:18.630> blocks<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:19.050> it<00:03:19.170> works

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
apart from the four blocks that it works

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.620 
apart from the four blocks that it works
with<00:03:19.560> aren't<00:03:20.400> affected<00:03:20.910> by<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.090> slopes<00:03:21.420> at

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
with aren't affected by the slopes at

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.030 
with aren't affected by the slopes at
all<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.020> can<00:03:22.140> place<00:03:22.320> down<00:03:22.500> some<00:03:22.680> wood<00:03:22.800> here

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
all so I can place down some wood here

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.980 
all so I can place down some wood here
like<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.330> can<00:03:24.450> see<00:03:24.570> nothing's

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
like so and you can see nothing's

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.110 
like so and you can see nothing's
connecting<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.400> wood<00:03:26.910> isn't

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
connecting to it and the wood isn't

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.790 
connecting to it and the wood isn't
slanted<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:27.990> can<00:03:28.140> actually<00:03:28.260> still<00:03:28.560> build

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
slanted so you can actually still build

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.220 
slanted so you can actually still build
houses<00:03:29.190> perfectly<00:03:30.030> fine<00:03:30.209> or<00:03:30.630> even<00:03:30.690> though

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
houses perfectly fine or even though

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.780 
houses perfectly fine or even though
it's<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.440> bit<00:03:31.590> weird<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.980> actually<00:03:32.310> place<00:03:32.520> down

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
it's a bit weird to actually place down

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.870 
it's a bit weird to actually place down
the<00:03:33.360> blocks<00:03:33.840> on<00:03:34.050> like<00:03:34.440> undulating<00:03:34.800> ground<00:03:35.400> it

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the blocks on like undulating ground it

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.699 
the blocks on like undulating ground it
just<00:03:36.090> feels<00:03:36.270> a<00:03:36.390> bit<00:03:36.420> unnatural<00:03:37.110> but<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.500> still

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
just feels a bit unnatural but it still

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.710 
just feels a bit unnatural but it still
does<00:03:37.890> work<00:03:38.100> perfectly<00:03:38.670> fine<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.420> can<00:03:39.540> put<00:03:39.690> a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
does work perfectly fine so I can put a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.240 
does work perfectly fine so I can put a
little<00:03:39.840> Hut<00:03:40.080> here<00:03:40.320> if<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.740> really<00:03:40.920> wanted<00:03:41.190> to

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
little Hut here if I really wanted to

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.970 
little Hut here if I really wanted to
and<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.910> works<00:03:42.120> perfectly<00:03:42.720> fine<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.260> what<00:03:43.950> I

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
and it works perfectly fine and what I

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.320 
and it works perfectly fine and what I
wanted<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.280> see<00:03:44.490> is<00:03:44.550> if<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.850> can<00:03:44.940> actually<00:03:45.060> make

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
wanted to see is if it can actually make

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.540 
wanted to see is if it can actually make
like<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.600> sloped<00:03:45.959> roof<00:03:46.230> using<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.770> stone<00:03:47.070> it

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
like a sloped roof using the stone it

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.070 
like a sloped roof using the stone it
could<00:03:47.790> be<00:03:47.880> quite<00:03:48.090> difficult<00:03:48.330> though<00:03:48.720> let's

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
could be quite difficult though let's

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.050 
could be quite difficult though let's
have<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.230> go<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:49.950> let's<00:03:50.310> say<00:03:50.490> I<00:03:50.520> just<00:03:50.640> put<00:03:51.030> down

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
have a go so let's say I just put down

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.600 
have a go so let's say I just put down
some<00:03:51.540> blocks<00:03:51.810> here<00:03:52.160> actually<00:03:53.160> now<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.310> need<00:03:53.520> to

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
some blocks here actually now I need to

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.970 
some blocks here actually now I need to
put<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:53.910> stone<00:03:54.540> block<00:03:54.690> well<00:03:55.050> look<00:03:55.380> at<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.590> it's

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
put a stone block well look at this it's

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.890 
put a stone block well look at this it's
so<00:03:56.100> glitchy<00:03:56.550> hard<00:03:57.270> to<00:03:57.360> know<00:03:57.450> what's<00:03:57.630> happening

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
so glitchy hard to know what's happening

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.530 
so glitchy hard to know what's happening
here<00:03:58.080> it's<00:03:58.170> like<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.290> paper-thin<00:03:59.360> area<00:04:00.360> of

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
here it's like a paper-thin area of

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.570 
here it's like a paper-thin area of
stone<00:04:00.900> but<00:04:01.770> yeah<00:04:01.860> let's<00:04:02.010> try<00:04:02.190> something<00:04:02.430> else

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
stone but yeah let's try something else

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.220 
stone but yeah let's try something else
so<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:02.970> fight<00:04:03.300> yeah<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:03.510> can<00:04:03.810> actually<00:04:03.959> make<00:04:04.200> a

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
so a fight yeah you can actually make a

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.140 
so a fight yeah you can actually make a
sloped<00:04:04.560> roof<00:04:04.800> you<00:04:05.280> just<00:04:05.400> place<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.610> block<00:04:05.880> here

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
sloped roof you just place a block here

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.060 
sloped roof you just place a block here
and<00:04:06.330> then<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.450> block<00:04:06.690> there<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.290> can<00:04:07.440> kind

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
and then a block there and you can kind

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.800 
and then a block there and you can kind
of<00:04:08.190> make<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.400> sloped<00:04:08.790> roof<00:04:09.000> here<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.510> could<00:04:09.660> do

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
of make a sloped roof here you could do

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.690 
of make a sloped roof here you could do
that<00:04:09.959> it's<00:04:10.380> kind<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.770> difficult<00:04:10.950> it<00:04:11.310> probably

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
that it's kind of difficult it probably

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.490 
that it's kind of difficult it probably
be<00:04:11.790> a<00:04:11.820> lot<00:04:12.030> easier<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.600> just<00:04:12.900> download<00:04:13.020> a<00:04:13.260> mod

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
be a lot easier to just download a mod

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.140 
be a lot easier to just download a mod
that<00:04:13.680> adds<00:04:13.709> slopes<00:04:14.250> directly<00:04:14.760> into<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.000> game

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
that adds slopes directly into the game

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.390 
that adds slopes directly into the game
like<00:04:15.390> slope<00:04:15.690> items<00:04:16.140> but<00:04:16.859> if<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.010> just<00:04:17.160> want<00:04:17.340> it

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
like slope items but if you just want it

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.710 
like slope items but if you just want it
to<00:04:17.430> work<00:04:17.580> with<00:04:17.760> everything<00:04:18.299> without<00:04:18.480> you

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
to work with everything without you

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.690 
to work with everything without you
