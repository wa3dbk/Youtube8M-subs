00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.250
 danny congratulations 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.540
 that seems like a start to you 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.570
 to have 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.039
 it all seemed as if from the stands 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.269
 the 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.889
 the never really much tension is that 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.180
 even if you come in the back first 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.070
 hero yes shadow of tension in mine 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.970
 I want every game everyone can go for 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.650
 we indeed meet each other and in siebe we 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.630
 know when strong points have one 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.830
 number of good strikers 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.870
 so we are collectively natural as 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.070
 the a1 cheap is very strong 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.220
 are you talking about doing more than writing 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.079
 and I think that is very bad today 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.770
 It has clearly been shown that you see 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.320
 maybe back in the 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.670
 goal scorers their heemskerk than and and 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.960
 fast of course that many score but 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.840
 you we more people that really a lot 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.460
 able to score and that's right here 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.660
 have new it gives he is the mantra 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.170
 who do sport and just me too 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.760
 great with it and says it works diamond 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.050
 fantastic through the only cloudy day 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760
 now have a nice one 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.260
 takes all it over that work with us 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.200
 really ideal 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.689
 how was your day a bit double 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.890
 mean a shot really cell layer too 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.120
 despite it he didn't 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.240
 Wild week trained because we at the 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.890
 I have been sick but yes it went 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.840
 way in bad have to say but be 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.970
 be satisfied afterwards 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.470
 and then you say it was full of excitement 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.210
 really stress you are upside down they walk 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.619
 fall own by this season 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.060
 it's pretty easy for it anyway 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.360
 you follow me really super now 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.570
 play 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.520
 Yes 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.280
 sometimes your true Indra still it 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.040
 we just do that when some are best 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.750
 actually no but for each one with 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.850
 garden or tense are you that 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.380
 with just anyone can 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.840
 win each other and that's what makes it 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.190
 nice yes of course yes 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.479
 we run very well and I think so too 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.009
 that we really have to do because we 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.810
 just disturb all of them 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.460
 be a real team and we are 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.690
 of course we are also a video to deal with 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.670
 are all alone that you are 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.210
 older than the worst we really have 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.009
 a 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.509
 from a large group with you 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.160
 all 4 friends with each other you can 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.570
 good find 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.399
 saves a tweet even more than the same 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.200
 I think that age might be that 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.950
 most also that we are a good group 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.860
 ready but now where you for waste 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.940
 designated as favorite for the title 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.530
 if we go so easy ie 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.580
 first game played 5 won 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.720
 a little something comes to it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.040
 victory over or is it one 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.620
 little bit or I exaggerated this 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.120
 to say yes maybe a bit 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.420
 asked to say but you sure 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.440
 do you feel you do feel better 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.510
 of course if you do it completely 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.310
 nice runs and also be a law 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.840
 I notice that myself also mean if you 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.030
 number of sides nice goals day must go 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.739
 together but then a good one another just 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.060
 better on and then everything just goes well 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.250
 easier 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.360
 of course if you want some more wind then 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.230
 then everything goes a little easier and 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.670
 make it more flexible 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.099
 I am thinking of going very early 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.379
 and now five bed are common 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.790
 of course but it is still very early and 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:52.090
 the condition 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:56.410
 you surprise yourself a little yes me 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.580
 aren't you a little bit there actually 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.280
 I really think because everyone had 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.069
 naturally expects two members 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.120
 boat would turn with it again anyway 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.250
 pretty much what we actually perform 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.830
 and surprised 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.240
 yes difficult to say and sp 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.130
 moisturizing on those two years ago 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.760
 just grab the title 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:22.120
 how could it be such a disappointment yes yes 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.650
 I think the arms mystical nature 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.790
 the one is also the elderly other typed 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.430
 in case stopped and very ordinary and 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.900
 yes their can just do it all 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.489
 one side and all both faces 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.450
 naturally have mix quickly and that 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.000
 heemskerk 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.950
 slash that do take off 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.180
 otherwise they don't really have people who 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.280
 we can easily score 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.140
 can all score easily 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.569
 it just makes us good things as strong 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.370
 I think we are really quite upset about that 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.739
 his example last year the bucket 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.420
 if think big difference be also one 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.129
 difference is that from last year that 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.500
 danny the thin plays 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:04:01.420
 yes indeed it goes to the right so I 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.220
 do n't know they easily get into it 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.780
 team that we run smoothly 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.849
 yes delicious delicious wg I know 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.700
 with in the profession it often did not increase either 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.900
 in standing with luydens a really delicious 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.959
 playing the 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.400
 I have never been used to anything 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.560
 it is so easy sedannetje what 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.910
 easy around and the work of it goes 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.750
 simply delicious love for each other 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.769
 to 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.210
 i can also play very i am very 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.590
 always used to be the youth for a 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.599
 playable c-line arriving and then too 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.160
 just delicious so it is really cool 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.460
 nice to tap on it important 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.360
 being able to stand out also speaks to us 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.160
 lion corner art 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.270
 the boys want it to be routine 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.770
 also a bit of a nice offer and 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.720
 to turn 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.120
 some people who just think they are 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.120
 old rooms just like the sweet humanitarian 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.180
 he is right they are just a very big one 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.830
 and as soon as you want just as long as usual 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.750
 also in Dutch team with the older ones 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.630
 do you know everything nicely better of it 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.660
 came out 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.970
 and yes that respect they are of course 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.130
 the idea has scored already show 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.570
 sailing to that of course also roll that 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.850
 not so big is both thrown with you 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.250
 because yes we certainly know a lot about it 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.350
 while the cities are on their own 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.170
 protection like rum and angry but yes that 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.850
 does them against and vice versa 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.410
 yes that does free we are that we have 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.080
 have also been used together always 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.580
 played so yes for each other delicious 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.590
 to them 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.700
 I may never argue at home either 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.490
 not so 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.700
 has asten nice to the great day 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.260
 for pkc you if you are still completely fit 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.670
 then recovering from the disease can 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.040
 only better 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:36.200
