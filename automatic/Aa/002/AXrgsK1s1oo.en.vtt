from<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:58.340> wanted<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.550> try<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.760> sealant<00:01:59.090> mark

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
from and I wanted to try a sealant mark

from and I wanted to try a sealant mark
out<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.930> wonder<00:02:00.080> how<00:02:00.110> did<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.940> slow-motion

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
out you wonder how did the slow-motion

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.140 
out you wonder how did the slow-motion
camera<00:02:02.180> i<00:02:02.450> was<00:02:02.900> using<00:02:03.050> cameras<00:02:03.680> to<00:02:03.860> do<00:02:04.010> mod<00:02:04.250> ice

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
camera i was using cameras to do mod ice

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.550 
camera i was using cameras to do mod ice
update<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.570> for<00:02:05.600> one<00:02:05.780> point<00:02:05.990> four<00:02:06.170> point<00:02:06.200> six

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
update it for one point four point six

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.919 
update it for one point four point six
and<00:02:06.860> seven<00:02:07.340> so<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:07.670> don't<00:02:08.360> think<00:02:08.510> separates<00:02:08.840> out

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
and seven so I don't think separates out

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.230 
and seven so I don't think separates out
yet<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.320> might<00:02:09.920> be<00:02:10.070> but<00:02:10.610> that's<00:02:10.790> update<00:02:11.060> for

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
yet it might be but that's update for

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.300 
yet it might be but that's update for
that<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:12.140> that's<00:02:12.230> all<00:02:12.380> good<00:02:12.410> also<00:02:13.040> single

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
that and so that's all good also single

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.800 
that and so that's all good also single
