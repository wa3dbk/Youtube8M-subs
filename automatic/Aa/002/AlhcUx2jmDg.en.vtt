00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 yo guests viva blue you see and i do 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.830
 today another episode of 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.679
 I teske the ten team today 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.969
 accurate he has a very different team 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.070
 than most people 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.260
 he just put in three different song 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.180
 a team and the sit and just fakro 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.100
 players at so I am very curious how 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.779
 this is going to play but let me worth it 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.420
 has muscle 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.990
 let's go well I now have a team 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.269
 made 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.279
 this is what it looks like all the games they have 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.500
 just full of chemistry except my links 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.600
 behind which has six team spirit but 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.820
 furthermore it looks pretty nice I understand 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
 just not why I am good at 10 young 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.480
 the striker is standing because he can 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.219
 don't shoot very well and isn't either 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.590
 physically but it will still see 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.989
 maybe we also play for whom 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 know my now let though and this game 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.320
 are going to play 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.460
 so we stayed in the quarterfinals 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.460
 I can continue to do that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.910
 holy shit this is really not normal 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.979
 here holy shit well i have to be mine 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.630
 do the utmost to be able to win 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.130
 no no no no you are going to be in the paint too 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.260
 put 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.840
 this is all the one wants in the sixth minute 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.390
 then maybe the pilot can make it right 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.939
 from repulsion and then did not insist 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.310
 many but unfortunately single well varnishes 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.250
 I'm through 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.189
 he goes just next to it was whole 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.970
 how unbroken this was my chance 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.270
 next coming 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.930
 this fat is a miek wat 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.970
 my first andrÃ© pill pill per week 10 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.340
 but still I make everything right now 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.960
 you are happy to work with it and you can taste it 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.200
 opponents can feel 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.330
 it is put in the meantime is a 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.770
 and hopefully I can hold this and can 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.410
 maybe not a score and then i have 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.380
 just injured hi now just put 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.600
 messi je he just still has it 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.060
 and I think I also saw more beautiful yes 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.590
 never put heaven in the butcher 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.369
 nowhere because being a team 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.229
 that guy has no no no oh he shit 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.560
 stands for again 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.149
 with cavani all new jobs this i just 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.400
 so happy that I'll be right back 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:16.709
 to be back now 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.250
 three stitches or khujo jacket 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.440
 6 which is now a second anchor a moment 2 of 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.350
 great what the perfect timing is 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.810
 He hears the game has now ended 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.920
 state 2 2 no the game is not yet 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.780
 past 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.040
 there is of course that extension oh 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:38.910
 nice move I'm a do and yes yes yes 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.370
 yes 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.550
 yes for two in the guy that it is 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.910
 Well, Jonkie Tremble 10 knows if we are 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.530
 there is super light yellow 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.650
 in the meantime it is time for the extension 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.810
 I am 324 so that is super night and 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.120
 I just have to fix this and then I have 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.310
 won this competition and that will be fine 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.060
 a small roll, albeit original 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.060
 goes in with cavani opinion 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.160
 and he throws him shit man I said that 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.110
 I fixed it just had to score that 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.150
 no no no 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:17.709
 this solo with a laughter move goes pretty well 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:21.620
 nice i'm totally carl dix well 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.580
 no, I have to want to be on us and 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.030
 slightly larger 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.190
 oh no now he goes with messi 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.470
 He also wondered what he dribbled at 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.569
 forward with people he also scores him me 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.790
 do n't know what's up if we're this one 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.410
 train but I can just drink the before 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.870
 don't hold on 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.299
 it's over so that means 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:46.390
 penalties I shoot him at the top right 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.390
 and luckily this is the penalty 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.959
 hello why does it take so long you think 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.130
 now with never stand still and he knew 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.489
 mine has been 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.170
 yes finally weeks 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.780
 also do a lot of penalties 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.220
 but it doesn't matter at all 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.310
 really not call it tense 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.049
 but once one now in the semis my 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.690
 next two positions 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:14.000
 I am fortunately less gothic 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.880
 he sometimes many bessie and a gun 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.220
 that too are two huge animals big 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.630
 theologian and with the bag out and that 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.930
 he does of course 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.880
 well this cool little demo 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.630
 what is the new one with the bags 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.550
 like boat live set now you have to be in it 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.400
 and not again 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.610
 how can this good dude put I'm here now 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.140
 again should still through king cab and now 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.240
 he actually sits 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.180
 just before the break I still had a lot 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.000
 opportunities but they were all now and then 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.640
 this is finally what it is 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.950
 Meanwhile, so I'm still very for 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.320
 and I just have to hold on to this 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.970
 and then I start next episode 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.580
 just in the final 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.440
 no and then we are through and what does 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.600
 my godfather 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.400
 so I just finished 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.690
 to say that I had to do this 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.450
 keep on keeping 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:13.040
 This really saves no sense at all should 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:16.010
 see you happy 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.610
 I stand for it 2 to 5 minutes after 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.240
 he spoken score I also try the 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.420
 queue 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.750
 he is doing and I am way too far 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.520
 forward but I have already before 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.540
 resit with the in you and this score 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:35.030
 that either no 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.950
 and then you score ryan the i'm just two 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.990
 one time with type 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.960
 I miss him both a cult and weather 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.910
 immediately scored again as bad luck 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.020
 take a no 'in it and he 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.900
 scores him 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.510
 shit you shit three minutes before time 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.540
 he still scores with anguo 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:56.120
 This is the robbery I must I must I 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.390
 must now score high 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.100
 a view moment slade it is unfortunately 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.230
 past 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.570
 I lost two and three and this 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.130
 actually makes no sense because I had 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.820
 these people are actually just have to 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.410
 to win 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.700
 so that means i'm next 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.510
 episode all over again 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.130
 to start 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.830
 but then it's time for the 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.720
 assessment of the team defending 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.130
 I quite choy will only lumos 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.080
 and rodrigues 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.880
 a bit on the slow side but one 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.160
 port just a dozen just you see 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.689
 beasts and fisenko therefore gets the 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.279
 defense and pure and hal of me and 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:30.839
 we are now in midfield 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.149
 attacking midfielders gets from me 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:34.739
 a 7 and a half and defensive 

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:36.599
 midfielder and six and all 

00:06:34.739 --> 00:06:39.029
 so then the midfield gets there 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.719
 out of the seven and then we are finally at it 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:42.209
 the attacks 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:44.519
 yes let converts do nothing about it 

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:46.979
 that is one of the best attackers of 

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:49.019
 the style in my opinion where q10 yo 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.849
 that's just not a spit 

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:52.649
 he is super chill in midfield 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.989
 but as a striker he just doesn't make any 

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:56.819
 goals he just can't always do well 

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:57.659
 don't shoot ice who sees you ca n't 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.249
 to knock 

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:01.409
 and therefore the attackers get mine 

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:03.659
 So six and a half this thing gets in 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:05.879
 a total of seven girls 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:08.939
 Finally said the price quality 

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:11.159
 it is a super cheap team only 

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:13.439
 above tank is a bit expensive so the 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:15.449
 value for money get bowling 8 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:16.829
 from me because it is not expensive and stuff 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:18.389
 actually quite nice 

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:20.729
 but this was it for this episode 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.439
 from this him team you also want a chance 

00:07:20.729 --> 00:07:24.449
 make me a team one time 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:26.279
 test the day down in the back of the 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.110
 reactions and did you like this video 

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:30.029
 then give a thumbs up 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.419
 and of course finally you leave the 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:32.419
 bosses 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:48.310
 finally i could never be like it 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:48.310
 a customer not needed at all
