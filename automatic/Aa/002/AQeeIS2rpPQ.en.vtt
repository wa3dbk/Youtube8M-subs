00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.480 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.580> make<00:00:02.939> feed<00:00:03.540> B<00:00:03.750> patties<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.890> make<00:00:05.069> Phoebe

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
to make feed B patties to make Phoebe

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.259 
to make feed B patties to make Phoebe
patties<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.450> need<00:00:06.720> sugar<00:00:07.319> syrup<00:00:07.940> in<00:00:08.940> some

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
patties you need sugar syrup in some

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.120 
patties you need sugar syrup in some
countries<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.960> can<00:00:10.170> buy<00:00:10.349> sugar<00:00:10.679> syrup

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
countries you can buy sugar syrup

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.830 
countries you can buy sugar syrup
pre-made<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:11.820> if<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.059> want<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.420> make<00:00:12.599> sugar

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
pre-made but if you want to make sugar

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.259 
pre-made but if you want to make sugar
syrup<00:00:13.139> yourself<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.219> how<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.849> you

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
syrup yourself this is how to do it you

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.420 
syrup yourself this is how to do it you
need<00:00:15.420> 50<00:00:15.870> percent<00:00:16.230> water<00:00:16.410> than<00:00:16.830> 50<00:00:17.250> percent

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
need 50 percent water than 50 percent

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.640 
need 50 percent water than 50 percent
sugar<00:00:17.820> as<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.480> see<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.930> scale<00:00:19.170> there

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
sugar as you can see on the scale there

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.279 
sugar as you can see on the scale there
are<00:00:19.800> both<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.010> same<00:00:20.460> way<00:00:20.670> for<00:00:21.240> example<00:00:21.750> if<00:00:21.930> you

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
are both the same way for example if you

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.040 
are both the same way for example if you
want<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.590> make<00:00:22.800> 1<00:00:23.310> litre<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.699> sugar<00:00:24.090> syrup<00:00:24.390> you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
want to make 1 litre of sugar syrup you

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.220 
want to make 1 litre of sugar syrup you
need<00:00:25.289> half<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.800> liter<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.340> water<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.000> 500<00:00:27.960> grams

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
need half a liter of water and 500 grams

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.890 
need half a liter of water and 500 grams
of<00:00:28.410> sugar<00:00:28.680> or<00:00:29.099> if<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.730> want<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.000> make<00:00:30.179> 2<00:00:30.510> litres

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
of sugar or if you want to make 2 litres

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.450 
of sugar or if you want to make 2 litres
of<00:00:30.929> syrup<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.189> need<00:00:32.460> 1<00:00:33.450> liter<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> water<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.649> 1

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
of syrup you need 1 liter of water and 1

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.840 
of syrup you need 1 liter of water and 1
kilogram<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.270> sugar<00:00:36.950> while<00:00:37.950> making<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.579> syrup

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
kilogram of sugar while making the syrup

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.479 
kilogram of sugar while making the syrup
you<00:00:39.750> should<00:00:39.989> use<00:00:40.230> warm<00:00:40.559> water<00:00:40.829> because<00:00:41.160> you

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
you should use warm water because you

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.760 
you should use warm water because you
can<00:00:41.670> dissolve<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.300> sugar<00:00:42.329> better<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.530> there

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
can dissolve the sugar better and there

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.709 
can dissolve the sugar better and there
are<00:00:43.860> no<00:00:44.010> crystals<00:00:44.550> left<00:00:44.789> over<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> syrup

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
are no crystals left over in the syrup

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.819 
are no crystals left over in the syrup
ok<00:00:46.500> now<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> make<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.879> sugar<00:00:48.149> syrup

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.290 

ok<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> add<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> warm<00:00:54.030> water

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
ok so you have to add the warm water

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.790 
ok so you have to add the warm water
into<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> sugar

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.070 

now<00:01:02.800> mix<00:01:03.130> it<00:01:03.280> evenly<00:01:03.520> so<00:01:04.390> that<00:01:04.600> there<00:01:04.750> are<00:01:04.839> no

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
now mix it evenly so that there are no

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.620 
now mix it evenly so that there are no
crystals<00:01:05.560> left<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.100> you<00:01:06.160> have<00:01:06.370> a<00:01:06.630> consistent

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
crystals left and you have a consistent

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:19.980 
crystals left and you have a consistent
mixture

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.380 

now<00:01:20.990> as<00:01:21.410> you<00:01:21.710> can<00:01:21.860> see<00:01:22.130> there<00:01:22.580> are<00:01:22.700> no<00:01:22.880> crystals

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
now as you can see there are no crystals

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.170 
now as you can see there are no crystals
left<00:01:23.780> in<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.110> sugar<00:01:24.470> syrup<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:25.280> is<00:01:25.610> how<00:01:26.030> it

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
left in the sugar syrup this is how it

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.000 
left in the sugar syrup this is how it
should<00:01:26.210> look<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.930> sugar<00:01:27.290> syrup<00:01:27.590> this<00:01:27.830> is

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
should look this is sugar syrup this is

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.870 
should look this is sugar syrup this is
50%<00:01:28.430> sugar<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.360> 50%<00:01:29.840> water<00:01:30.260> okay<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:31.370> want<00:01:31.700> to

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
50% sugar and 50% water okay I want to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.650 
50% sugar and 50% water okay I want to
make<00:01:32.060> 400<00:01:32.900> grams<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.470> paddy<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:35.030> doesn't

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
make 400 grams of paddy it doesn't

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.350 
make 400 grams of paddy it doesn't
matter<00:01:35.840> how<00:01:36.110> much<00:01:36.320> you<00:01:36.380> put<00:01:36.710> in<00:01:36.830> it<00:01:36.980> the<00:01:37.490> amount

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
matter how much you put in it the amount

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.300 
matter how much you put in it the amount
you<00:01:38.600> put<00:01:38.810> in<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.080> is<00:01:39.230> the<00:01:39.590> amount<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:40.010> paddy

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
you put in it is the amount of paddy

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:58.050 
you put in it is the amount of paddy
that<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:40.760> will<00:01:40.910> make

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.420 

now<00:01:58.630> this<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:59.170> how<00:01:59.350> much<00:01:59.560> patty<00:01:59.860> I'm<00:02:00.070> going<00:02:00.340> to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
now this is how much patty I'm going to

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.570 
now this is how much patty I'm going to
make<00:02:00.610> this<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:01.000> 500<00:02:01.690> grams<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:02.400> feed<00:02:03.400> V<00:02:03.640> powder

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
make this is 500 grams of feed V powder

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.510 
make this is 500 grams of feed V powder
now<00:02:06.580> I'm<00:02:06.850> going<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.210> add<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.600> sugar<00:02:07.810> sheer

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
now I'm going to add the sugar sheer

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.520 
now I'm going to add the sugar sheer
slowly<00:02:09.520> into<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.720> there<00:02:11.110> are<00:02:11.260> no

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
slowly into it so that there are no

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.729 
slowly into it so that there are no
lumps<00:02:12.190> now<00:02:13.030> as<00:02:13.300> I'm<00:02:13.480> making<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.560> much

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
lumps now as I'm making it it is much

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.130 
lumps now as I'm making it it is much
easier<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.730> use<00:02:15.760> your<00:02:16.150> hands<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.750> mix<00:02:16.780> it

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
easier to use your hands to mix it

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.040 
easier to use your hands to mix it
because<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:18.220> tends<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.670> make<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.150> easier<00:02:19.900> and

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
because it tends to make it easier and

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.520 
because it tends to make it easier and
it's<00:02:20.530> more<00:02:20.860> consistent<00:02:24.840> do<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:25.930> know<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.260> is

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
it's more consistent do you know this is

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.010 
it's more consistent do you know this is
too<00:02:26.770> thick<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.610> I'm<00:02:27.670> going<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> add<00:02:28.150> more<00:02:28.750> sugar

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
too thick so I'm going to add more sugar

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:37.979 
too thick so I'm going to add more sugar
syrup<00:02:29.560> slowly<00:02:35.370> now<00:02:36.370> if<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.700> mixture<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.330> too

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
syrup slowly now if the mixture is too

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.280 
syrup slowly now if the mixture is too
thick<00:02:38.019> add<00:02:38.739> more<00:02:39.730> sugar<00:02:39.940> syrup<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.660> if<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.110> is

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
thick add more sugar syrup and if it is

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.410 
thick add more sugar syrup and if it is
too<00:02:41.530> thin<00:02:41.890> add<00:02:42.160> more<00:02:42.760> powder

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
too thin add more powder
