00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
many years to come it's a business

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.399

that's going through cycles both down
and<00:02:37.440> up<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:37.980> will<00:02:38.909> come<00:02:39.150> through<00:02:39.329> this<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.780> I

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
and up and will come through this and I

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.690

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
cabin and make them more flexible so it

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.479 
cabin and make them more flexible so it
was<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.489> combination<00:03:38.879> of<00:03:39.299> those<00:03:39.480> factors<00:03:40.489> that

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
was a combination of those factors that

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.970 
was a combination of those factors that
the<00:03:41.549> customers<00:03:42.180> gave<00:03:42.449> us<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:43.079> drove<00:03:43.410> us<00:03:43.620> into

the customers gave us that drove us into

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.000 
the customers gave us that drove us into
the<00:03:44.370> developments<00:03:45.329> that<00:03:45.449> we<00:03:45.480> did<00:03:45.750> if<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.829> had

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
the developments that we did if you had

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.460 
the developments that we did if you had
to<00:03:47.129> name<00:03:47.160> in<00:03:47.669> either<00:03:47.970> airplanes<00:03:48.660> regard<00:03:49.199> that

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
to name in either airplanes regard that

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.770 
to name in either airplanes regard that
thing<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.609> distinguishes<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.419> from<00:03:51.449> what's

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
thing that distinguishes it from what's

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.780 
thing that distinguishes it from what's
come<00:03:51.989> before<00:03:52.139> what<00:03:52.590> are<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.980> what's<00:03:53.639> the

airplanes but they're buying support

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.380 
airplanes but they're buying support
support<00:04:24.860> is<00:04:25.250> a<00:04:25.280> huge<00:04:25.760> watchword<00:04:26.210> because
