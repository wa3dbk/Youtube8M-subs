00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
so that's really were where I think my

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.200 
so that's really were where I think my
biggest<00:01:46.830> challenge<00:01:47.040> was<00:01:47.550> I<00:01:47.580> mean<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.060> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
biggest challenge was I mean not that I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.060 
biggest challenge was I mean not that I
can't<00:01:48.420> overcome<00:01:48.480> it<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.080> for<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.830> most<00:01:49.950> part

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
can't overcome it but for the most part

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.100 
can't overcome it but for the most part
that<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:50.370> where<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.580> challenge<00:01:50.940> was<00:01:51.180> was

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
that was where the challenge was was

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.020 
that was where the challenge was was
filling<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.710> truck<00:01:53.010> getting<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.430> feel<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:53.640> it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
filling the truck getting a feel for it

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.990
