on the big old circle and the inside
will<00:02:21.200> be<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.350> racetrack<00:02:22.060> not<00:02:23.060> still<00:02:23.450> being

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
will be a racetrack not still being

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.570 
will be a racetrack not still being
under<00:02:24.350> construction<00:02:25.450> yeah<00:02:26.530> there<00:02:27.530> we<00:02:28.430> just

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
under construction yeah there we just

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.900 
under construction yeah there we just
have<00:02:28.850> it's<00:02:29.480> like<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:30.410> tour<00:02:30.860> bus<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.430> it<00:02:31.580> goes
