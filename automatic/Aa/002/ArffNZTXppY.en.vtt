00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.680
 and so we continue our work on 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.160
 creating a carcass for a bike and so 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 Now we take the frame and we take measurements. 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.130
 we cut out such strips from plywood 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.210
 that is, the side walls of our frame 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 our box do them enough 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.630
 symmetrical so everyone looked 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.640
 ok so we need to fix them 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.070
 we fasten them to the screws 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.760
 I mean, I fix them personally, but you can 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.309
 would start another for that we will drill 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.370
 first a hole between plywood and 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.960
 frame and then it is already screwed our 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.499
 self-tapping screw 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.929
 on the frame I already realized that the thickness of the frame 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.030
 not enough to dynamics 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.519
 sounded good so I had to 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.659
 make extra rings for 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.300
 thickenings 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:10.830
 gram and that is, the thickening of the frame box 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.480
 and that's what happened in the end 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.570
 This of course until rough processing 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.670
 so in the third part will be more already 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.140
 it is clear how the body will look like 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.380
 frame and the like in it now too 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.400
 one can already observe such eye-catching 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.060
 body features that's what we have out 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.360
 on a bicycle those irregularities that you 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.760
 see on the side panel this 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.170
 specially made that is not to think that 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.100
 is crooked drank 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.370
 it's made specifically to hide those 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.800
 places where I have connections frame that is 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:56.410
 the framework where my bolts stand out 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.260
 not the sides of the box, we see that we 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.210
 there is a lot of space left 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.700
 you can easily place the battery 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.920
 you can place some kind of electronics then 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.670
 there are wires neatly and all this 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.770
 will look neat and in this 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.600
 case we still have a place to the sound 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.130
 that is, we still have a volume box 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.760
 here between the two jumpers will be 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.420
 accommodate the battery that is for it 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.270
 Buzilova special mount for those 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.170
 who will need more informative 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.970
 the part that is the size and the material and the 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.400
 like you can find it 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.700
 special article on my site link 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.860
 which will be in the description that is, will disappear 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.370
 immediately a series of several questions there 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.370
 the size is exactly how much I spent 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.250
 time like that 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.770
