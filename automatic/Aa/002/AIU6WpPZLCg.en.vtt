00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.380
 all the runners came home healthy and 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.600
 save tonight at the end of this stage 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.430
 marathon and it was not a thin 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.559
 deal considering weather conditions 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.630
 it rained and this bad weather will have 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.970
 accompanied for a good part of 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.099
 the day the peloton of this round of 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.539
 France at the end of this 19th stage everything 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.699
 will therefore be played in the against the 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.410
 tomorrow's watch for thibaut pinot face 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.119
 to these opponents jean christophe péraud 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.339
 and Alejandro Valverde 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.430
 but tonight we were coming back to this 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:36.110
 day this difficult step and one gets 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.050
 congratulate on not having completely 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.820
 lost all serenity yes we had we had 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.900
 not really planned a day like this 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 we knew it was going to rain a little 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.500
 few storms but we had a good 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.570
 part of the stage under the waterspouts 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.700
 to really be ondo ossa made the race 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.100
 dangerous nerve yet a step 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.920
 still difficult where the organisms are 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.420
 tired we had discussed before the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.829
 starting with arnaud that 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.039
 it was first priority panty handsome 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.989
 all day a final that can be 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.829
 a little complicated than if arnaud had 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.049
 still legs to go to do his 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.220
 sprint was average but a good arnaud 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.270
 it's not weather conditions it 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.100
 really appreciate for the faluns this 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.450
 crime and then it was all first for 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.039
 thibault and when we saw the son a little 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.240
 the more it was complicated it was 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.799
 the main thing was to spend a 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.820
 the most serene day possible 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.490
 so obviously it was not obvious 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.810
 with the weather conditions but no 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.680
 the main thing was not to lose 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.539
 time to learn from break 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.409
 obviously avoid falls that was 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.539
 An evidence 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.770
 so that was done and so 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.450
 now more than just focusing on 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.979
 the chrono that arrives in terms of 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.470
 recovery just after a day 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.549
 more is not it penalizing 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.799
 if penalizing but it's penalizing for 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.420
 everyone so no good massage this 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.369
 evening they will make a coup de 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.600
 cryotherapy for some and then 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.580
 tomorrow we go again everything 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.420
 protocol we spend time there 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.540
 leave it with energy 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.890
 and 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.330
 here's that jersey that's preventing that 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.020
 three days who has it so we do not have no 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.670
 the longer the pulse pressure too much time 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.140
 on protocol and it will not be 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.400
 penalizing for the rest we had a 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.190
 chrono everything place was completely 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.170
 for powerful cures as perron there 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.880
 it really was a course of 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.410
 vertical drop using breaks legs we will say 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.030
 same name on the contrary it will benefit 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.149
 thibout in any case it's going to level the 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.990
 values ​​and he ends up well so we 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.000
 is optimistic for tomorrow 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.100
 the most amazing after this day 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.840
 trying is that teammates 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.350
 thibaut pinot did not even lose 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.530
 their smile 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.300
 it was really difficult internal food 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.610
 we learned buckets of water when we want 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.500
 to say it was he had to remain vigilant 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.110
 bus when a guy placed at the general like 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.490
 thibault you always have to stay 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.990
 vigilant because there the falls were 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.880
 Finally, there was no 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.190
 but it could have been hot months 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.480
 thanks to exit tickets we got cold 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.410
 but of course we did well 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.390
 so, it's all right 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.390
 yes I think he is illiterate 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.910
 the child we saw in the penultimate 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.170
 bump and it we had them climb it 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.640
 and he manages to go up alone 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.260
 yes I managed to come back and he 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.250
 but it's true that he was there and I 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.870
 seeing that they were very strong I think 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.830
 which is for tomorrow that will do it 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.400
 no no the dangerous rain a very final 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.070
 chaotic but hey he did not lose any 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.530
 time it will save the essential 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.260
 exactly there will not have been a single 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.530
 transitional step that's for sure banon 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.209
 when it could have been windy and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.220
 and still today it could have been 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.110
 quiet but there was rain 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.370
 I think for the recovery it goes 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.010
 to be a big problem tomorrow with a view to 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.270
 against the clock for thibault no I 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.480
 do not think I think he spent a 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.470
 day still quiet even though 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.870
 does not always have the favor of 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.819
 predictions against the specialist jean 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.900
 christophe Péraud facing the experienced 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.330
 alejandro valverde 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.370
 thibaut pinot counts well tomorrow 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.270
 stay in second place 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.810
 General classification 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.570
 the verdict will fall after 54 km of race 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.200
 and we will be in périgueux at the end of 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.200
 this 20th stage
