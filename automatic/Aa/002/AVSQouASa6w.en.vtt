 pay special attention and those who used to 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.370
 this music is not interested in them any 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.789
 they did not know 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.980
 now often they ask us was 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.350
 interesting experience of communication with listeners 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.039
 people came to the concert with some 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.899
 wary 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.520
 knowing nothing of Russian music and 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.280
 some Russian composers 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.070
 but after the concert they said that from 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.820
 all that we have performed these many years 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.600
 works 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.720
 hooked them most album with 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.549
 Russian music that we recorded 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.009
 special I do not want to throw words but 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.439
 it really is so we felt that 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.280
 do what in our country nobody 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.600
 we didnâ€™t do it here 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.509
 school so other people turned 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.119
 they gave them an award and not only for their 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.630
 music is low out of creativity for what they 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.920
 sing 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.710
 back got not only here and forms 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.869
 handed them Russian sacred music 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.220
 Russian sacred music on purely 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.440
 technical such tricks are very difficult 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.100
 executed that is possible of course and sometimes 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.289
 this is heard even not only 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.960
 foreign chorus even Russian king 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:03.569
 sometimes you hear that they are singing so to speak 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.399
 all the notes in place sing harmoniously clean a 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:09.459
 penetration of spirituality 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.550
 no for various reasons here as well 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.750
 The final is very important to be 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:20.980
 inspired by a spark one obviously knows that 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:25.330
 they sing what lyrics they sing and how it is 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.600
 this text is combined with music 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.290
 boldly disharmonies here they come 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.040
 produce 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.019
 colossal peter impressions spiritual 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.230
 aspect of this music is to find 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.410
 expression otherwise it is no longer true to me 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.540
 from ancient performance this music 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.090
 to be performed with awe 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.310
 I really enjoyed studying and singing 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.590
 of course it was difficult because of the language 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.100
 but we tried to match the spirit and 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.630
 the meaning of this music 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.410
 the album is called reached after all 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.060
 and rush species the sacred spirit of Russia 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.590
 unexpected in something symbolic in the background 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.609
 current geopolitical tensions 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.970
 between Russia and the United States while politicians argue 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:11.980
 culture unites 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.320
 there have been so many periods of hostility in history 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.540
 and rift but we know that music 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.400
 unites us all as people and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.310
 continue to make sure that in 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.510
 the main thing we are very similar music teaches 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.640
 this is hardly a coincidence that 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.280
 personification of interest in Russia became 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.310
 Orthodox music album were if 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.030
 will people be ready to see our 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.900
 culture is more than we say 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.180
 may even leave the country a couple of stars he 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.350
