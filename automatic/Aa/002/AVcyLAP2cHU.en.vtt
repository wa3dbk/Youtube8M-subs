00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
apparently the quality of the sounds

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019 
apparently the quality of the sounds
which<00:00:25.650> makes<00:00:26.220> me<00:00:26.310> feel<00:00:26.460> great<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.820> has<00:00:26.939> been

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
which makes me feel great this has been

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.820 
which makes me feel great this has been
a<00:00:27.090> lot<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.269> time<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.630> basically<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.590> most

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
a lot of time on it basically and most

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.560 
a lot of time on it basically and most
conveniently<00:00:29.279> I've<00:00:29.550> named<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.240> folder

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
conveniently I've named the folder

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.720 
conveniently I've named the folder
exactly<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> same<00:00:31.230> name<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> original

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
exactly the same name as the original

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.040 
exactly the same name as the original
folder<00:00:32.880> which<00:00:33.149> means<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.480> guys<00:00:33.570> can<00:00:33.809> simply

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.569 
already have sounds for in the pack but
maybe<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.200> feel<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.649> they<00:00:43.800> need<00:00:43.920> updating<00:00:44.430> or

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
to do is merge the folders so I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.900 
to do is merge the folders so I
recommend<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.800> keep<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.190> same<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.670> you

a<00:01:01.230> quick<00:01:01.379> tutorial<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:02.039> after<00:01:02.550> effects

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
a quick tutorial in after effects

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
a quick tutorial in after effects
because<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.570> getting<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.899> lot<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.379> questions

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
because I was getting a lot of questions

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.730 
because I was getting a lot of questions
about<00:01:05.390> optimizing<00:01:06.390> these<00:01:06.750> sounds<00:01:07.530> since

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
about optimizing these sounds since

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
about optimizing these sounds since

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
there are no longer files that we can

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
there are no longer files that we can
pull<00:01:09.930> straight<00:01:10.380> from<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> pc<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.460> our

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
pull straight from the pc to get our

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.760 
pull straight from the pc to get our
sound<00:01:11.729> effects<00:01:11.990> but<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.590> pretty

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
sound effects but you know it's pretty

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.590 
sound effects but you know it's pretty
easy<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.760> i<00:01:14.790> wanted<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.119> go<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> little<00:01:15.420> bit

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
easy but i wanted to go a little bit

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.510

audio<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.580> game<00:01:20.729> because<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
audio in this game because it's the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.590 
first call of duty in which the gun
sounds<00:01:23.189> physically<00:01:23.610> change<00:01:23.939> for<00:01:24.210> indoor<00:01:24.509> and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
sounds physically change for indoor and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
sounds physically change for indoor and
outdoor<00:01:24.720> environments<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:25.560> I've<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:26.130> two

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
outdoor environments so I've got two

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.399 
outdoor environments so I've got two
examples<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.330> today<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.630> don't<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.140> how

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
examples for you today I don't know how

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.560 
examples for you today I don't know how
clear<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.060> will<00:01:30.450> make

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
clear it's going to be but I will make

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.730 
clear it's going to be but I will make
it<00:01:30.689> clear<00:01:30.869> by<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.079> end<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.439> let's<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:31.650> out<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
it clear by the end so let's go out and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.719 
it clear by the end so let's go out and
take<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> listen<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.340> first<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
take a listen to the first one this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.340 
take a listen to the first one this
should<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.060> an<00:01:33.150> indoor<00:01:33.479> example<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:39.350> compared

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
should be an indoor example and compared

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:49.870 
should be an indoor example and compared
to<00:01:40.470> our<00:01:40.590> outdoor<00:01:41.009> example

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.680 

so<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.970> might<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.150> a<00:01:51.240> little<00:01:51.360> hard<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.659> hear

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
so it might be a little hard to hear

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.330 
so it might be a little hard to hear
with<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.170> background<00:01:52.560> noise<00:01:52.590> unfortunately

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
with the background noise unfortunately

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.670 
with the background noise unfortunately
I<00:01:53.369> haven't<00:01:53.580> enough<00:01:53.880> clips<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.840> at<00:01:55.320> least<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
I haven't enough clips or at least I

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.990 
I haven't enough clips or at least I
feel<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.280> not<00:01:56.430> hit<00:01:56.550> enough<00:01:56.760> clips

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
feel like I have not hit enough clips

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.210 
feel like I have not hit enough clips
yet<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.390> ghosts<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.440> get<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.979> clip<00:01:59.190> that

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
yet and ghosts to really get a clip that

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.370 
yet and ghosts to really get a clip that
exemplifies<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.000> best<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.990> believe<00:02:01.229> they

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
exemplifies this best but I believe they

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.410 
exemplifies this best but I believe they
are<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.560> same<00:02:01.740> audio<00:02:02.070> file<00:02:02.310> except<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.210> end

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
are the same audio file except the end

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
are the same audio file except the end
is<00:02:03.659> just<00:02:03.690> cut<00:02:03.990> off<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.380> indoors<00:02:04.800> since<00:02:05.040> in

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
is just cut off for indoors since in

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.920 
is just cut off for indoors since in
indoor<00:02:05.729> environments<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.330> will<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.630> less

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
indoor environments you will have less

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 
indoor environments you will have less
reverb<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.950> outdoor<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.520> will<00:02:08.640> hear

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
reverb and in the outdoor you will hear

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.809 
reverb and in the outdoor you will hear
a<00:02:09.060> very<00:02:09.780> very<00:02:09.959> long<00:02:10.229> reverb<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.890> if<00:02:11.130> you<00:02:11.430> open

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
a very very long reverb so if you open

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.530 
a very very long reverb so if you open
up<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.000> shot<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.450> see<00:02:12.560> or<00:02:13.560> hear<00:02:14.540> that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
up the shot you can see or hear that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.449 
up the shot you can see or hear that
we've<00:02:15.660> got<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.989> full<00:02:16.230> sound<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.160> entire

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
we've got the full sound with the entire

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.310 
we've got the full sound with the entire
reverb<00:02:17.910> that's<00:02:18.209> why<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> audio<00:02:18.780> files<00:02:18.989> are<00:02:19.170> so

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
reverb that's why the audio files are so

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.500 
reverb that's why the audio files are so
long<00:02:19.700> but<00:02:20.700> unfortunately<00:02:20.820> we<00:02:21.239> want<00:02:21.420> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
long but unfortunately we want to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.699 
long but unfortunately we want to
optimize<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.170> especially<00:02:22.560> for

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
optimize that especially for

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.080 
optimize that especially for
perfectionist<00:02:23.310> like<00:02:23.370> me<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.850> I've<00:02:23.940> created

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
perfectionist like me so I've created

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.870 
perfectionist like me so I've created
two<00:02:24.650> little<00:02:25.650> files<00:02:25.890> here<00:02:26.160> one<00:02:26.310> with<00:02:26.430> an<00:02:26.519> indoor

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
two little files here one with an indoor

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.670 
two little files here one with an indoor
environment<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.630> one<00:02:27.930> on<00:02:28.050> octane<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.590> an

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
environment and one on octane with an

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
environment and one on octane with an
outdoor<00:02:29.040> environment<00:02:29.550> if<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.030> guys<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.480> want

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
outdoor environment if you guys I want

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.270 
outdoor environment if you guys I want
to<00:02:30.750> know<00:02:30.840> how<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.140> set<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.190> my

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
to know how to set this up this is in my

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.860 
to know how to set this up this is in my
last<00:02:32.459> tutorial<00:02:32.610> about<00:02:33.150> setting<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:33.780> your

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
last tutorial about setting up your

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.020 
last tutorial about setting up your
audio<00:02:34.110> files<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.739> pre<00:02:34.890> composing<00:02:35.340> importance

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
audio files and pre composing importance

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.560 
audio files and pre composing importance
of<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.180> everything<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:38.570> right

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
of that everything like that so right

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.600 
of that everything like that so right
here<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:40.080> see<00:02:40.739> that<00:02:40.860> we<00:02:40.950> get<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.190> folding

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
here you see that we get the folding

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.460 
here you see that we get the folding
verb<00:02:41.790> as<00:02:41.910> we<00:02:42.030> listen<00:02:42.269> to<00:02:42.360> before<00:02:42.480> however<00:02:43.230> on

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
verb as we listen to before however on

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.509 
verb as we listen to before however on
this<00:02:44.340> strike<00:02:44.700> zone<00:02:44.970> clip<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.040> hear<00:02:50.340> that

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
this strike zone clip you can hear that

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.610 
this strike zone clip you can hear that
the<00:02:50.790> long<00:02:51.120> reverb<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:52.019> course<00:02:52.230> all<00:02:52.440> this

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
the long reverb and of course all this

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.110 
the long reverb and of course all this
background<00:02:52.829> noise<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.370> stuff<00:02:53.519> will<00:02:53.670> not<00:02:53.850> show

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
background noise and stuff will not show

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.360 
background noise and stuff will not show
up<00:02:54.150> in<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.450> reverb<00:02:54.750> will<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:55.049> fainter<00:02:55.980> when<00:02:56.280> we

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
up in the reverb will be fainter when we

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.759 
up in the reverb will be fainter when we
add<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:57.239> some<00:02:57.630> music<00:02:58.049> or<00:02:58.230> whatever<00:02:58.350> audio

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
add it to some music or whatever audio

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.740 
add it to some music or whatever audio
we<00:02:58.920> are<00:02:59.010> seeing<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.400> too<00:02:59.610> but<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.299> point<00:03:00.510> is

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
we are seeing this too but the point is

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.630 
we are seeing this too but the point is
is<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.200> will<00:03:01.320> still<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.590> noticeable<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.370> people

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
is it will still be noticeable to people

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.460 
is it will still be noticeable to people
that<00:03:02.700> are<00:03:02.820> looking<00:03:02.910> forward<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:03.630> we<00:03:04.110> want<00:03:04.350> to

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
that are looking forward so we want to

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.420 
that are looking forward so we want to
cut<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.799> off<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:05.130> make<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.310> more

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
cut that off and make that more

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.250 
cut that off and make that more
realistic<00:03:05.670> for<00:03:06.120> an<00:03:06.420> indoor<00:03:06.810> environment<00:03:07.200> so

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
realistic for an indoor environment so

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.190 
realistic for an indoor environment so
we<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.440> open<00:03:07.560> up<00:03:07.709> our<00:03:07.829> link<00:03:08.070> shot<00:03:08.250> composition

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
we can open up our link shot composition

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.699 
we can open up our link shot composition
and<00:03:11.360> basically<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.480> want<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.690> go<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.840> not

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
and basically you want to go to not

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.410 
and basically you want to go to not
quite<00:03:14.489> at<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.790> end<00:03:14.940> because<00:03:15.060> we<00:03:15.209> want<00:03:15.360> a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
quite at the end because we want a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.390 
quite at the end because we want a
little<00:03:15.720> bit<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.840> reverb<00:03:16.019> but<00:03:16.769> maybe<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.310> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
little bit of reverb but maybe just a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.759 
little bit of reverb but maybe just a
few<00:03:17.640> frames<00:03:17.880> after<00:03:18.299> like<00:03:18.540> so<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.530> we're<00:03:19.650> going

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
few frames after like so and we're going

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.800 
few frames after like so and we're going
to<00:03:19.829> hit<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.980> key<00:03:20.190> frame<00:03:20.430> for<00:03:20.760> our<00:03:21.150> audio<00:03:21.480> levels

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
to hit a key frame for our audio levels

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.780 
to hit a key frame for our audio levels
and<00:03:21.959> then<00:03:22.620> we're<00:03:22.769> going<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.950> go<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.370> little<00:03:23.610> bit

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
and then we're going to go a little bit

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.620 
and then we're going to go a little bit
beyond<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.480> maybe<00:03:26.030> second<00:03:27.030> or<00:03:27.120> so<00:03:27.269> and<00:03:27.480> we're

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
beyond that maybe second or so and we're

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.940 
beyond that maybe second or so and we're
going<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.810> bring<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.079> down<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.410> negative<00:03:28.530> 48

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
going to bring this down to negative 48

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.800 
going to bring this down to negative 48
you<00:03:29.640> can't<00:03:29.820> bring<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.000> lower<00:03:30.269> but<00:03:30.510> anything

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
you can't bring that lower but anything

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.060 
you can't bring that lower but anything
in<00:03:30.930> negative<00:03:31.200> 48<00:03:31.410> is<00:03:31.590> not<00:03:31.769> going<00:03:31.890> to<00:03:31.950> be

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
in negative 48 is not going to be

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.090 
in negative 48 is not going to be
audible<00:03:32.340> audio<00:03:33.060> audible<00:03:33.690> auto<00:03:34.049> yeah<00:03:34.680> audible

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
audible audio audible auto yeah audible

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.039 
audible audio audible auto yeah audible
on<00:03:35.220> youtube<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:36.090> now<00:03:36.660> if<00:03:36.780> we<00:03:36.840> take<00:03:36.900> a

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
on youtube so now if we take a

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.819 
on youtube so now if we take a
meandering<00:03:37.530> listen<00:03:37.799> again<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:40.560> might<00:03:40.709> need

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
meandering listen again you might need

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:47.930 
meandering listen again you might need
to<00:03:40.920> scoot<00:03:41.130> this<00:03:41.220> little<00:03:41.670> bit<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.970> left

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.240 

maybe<00:03:48.810> this<00:03:49.020> one<00:03:49.260> keyframe<00:03:49.470> back<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.040> little

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
maybe this one keyframe back a little

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.840 
maybe this one keyframe back a little
bit<00:03:51.710> there<00:03:52.710> we<00:03:52.800> go<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.160> now<00:03:53.280> we're<00:03:53.460> getting<00:03:53.700> a

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
bit there we go and now we're getting a

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.760 
bit there we go and now we're getting a
no<00:03:54.300> long<00:03:54.750> reverb<00:03:55.110> but<00:03:55.320> we're<00:03:55.440> getting<00:03:55.530> that

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
no long reverb but we're getting that

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.040 
no long reverb but we're getting that
short<00:03:56.100> immediate<00:03:56.550> echo<00:03:56.850> and<00:03:57.060> that's<00:03:57.870> what<00:03:57.990> we

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
short immediate echo and that's what we

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.240 
short immediate echo and that's what we
want<00:03:58.230> so<00:03:58.380> now<00:03:58.500> when<00:03:58.650> we<00:03:58.740> go<00:03:58.860> back<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.070> our

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
want so now when we go back to our

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:07.360 
want so now when we go back to our
strike<00:03:59.610> zone<00:03:59.820> clip<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.360> play<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.470> again

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.350 

we're<00:04:08.370> getting<00:04:08.550> something<00:04:08.760> a<00:04:09.030> lot<00:04:09.330> more

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
we're getting something a lot more

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.240 
we're getting something a lot more
realistic<00:04:10.020> to<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.680> environment<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:11.130> would

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
realistic to the environment that would

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.610 
realistic to the environment that would
be<00:04:11.370> we<00:04:11.640> would<00:04:11.670> be<00:04:11.850> hearing<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.620> that's

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
be we would be hearing it in that's

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.500 
be we would be hearing it in that's
pretty<00:04:13.770> much<00:04:13.860> all<00:04:14.010> for<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.220> tutorial

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
pretty much all for the tutorial

pretty much all for the tutorial
basically<00:04:15.510> for<00:04:15.810> me<00:04:16.380> sound<00:04:17.010> design<00:04:17.459> is<00:04:17.489> one<00:04:17.850> of

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
basically for me sound design is one of

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.120 
basically for me sound design is one of
the<00:04:18.000> more<00:04:18.150> important<00:04:18.510> aspects<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:19.049> an<00:04:19.799> edit

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
the more important aspects of an edit

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.090 
the more important aspects of an edit
because<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.910> feel<00:04:21.420> like<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:22.049> is<00:04:22.230> in<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.920> end

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
because I feel like that is in the end

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.320 
because I feel like that is in the end
the<00:04:23.220> thing<00:04:23.400> that's<00:04:23.520> going<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:23.760> stick<00:04:23.940> for<00:04:24.180> you

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
the thing that's going to stick for you

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.910 
the thing that's going to stick for you
stick<00:04:25.170> to<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:25.320> most<00:04:25.530> you're<00:04:25.710> not<00:04:25.800> gonna

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
stick to you most you're not gonna

little details how the edit and the

style and the flow and frankly your
quality<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:32.700> the<00:04:32.760> edit<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.150> directly

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
quality of the edit is directly

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.270 
quality of the edit is directly
proportional<00:04:34.140> to<00:04:34.170> attention<00:04:34.620> to<00:04:34.710> details<00:04:35.040> and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
proportional to attention to details and

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.370 
proportional to attention to details and
this<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.490> a<00:04:35.520> detail<00:04:36.060> it's<00:04:36.210> easily<00:04:36.420> fixable<00:04:36.510> so

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
this is a detail it's easily fixable so

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.360 
this is a detail it's easily fixable so
again<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.740> was<00:04:37.860> pretty<00:04:38.010> much<00:04:38.160> for<00:04:38.310> the

that's pretty much all for the tutorial
I<00:04:40.050> think<00:04:40.230> you<00:04:40.290> guys<00:04:40.410> for<00:04:40.710> watching<00:04:40.740> and

I think you guys for watching and

I think you guys for watching and
supporting<00:04:41.880> me<00:04:42.030> with<00:04:42.180> this<00:04:42.660> sound<00:04:42.930> pack<00:04:43.110> again

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
supporting me with this sound pack again

supporting me with this sound pack again
it<00:04:43.590> did<00:04:43.680> not<00:04:43.770> take<00:04:44.010> a<00:04:44.040> lot<00:04:44.220> of<00:04:44.280> time<00:04:44.370> actually

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
it did not take a lot of time actually

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.400 
it did not take a lot of time actually
had<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.030> go<00:04:45.150> outside<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.780> map<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.140> get<00:04:46.260> some

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
had to go outside the map to get some

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.660 
had to go outside the map to get some
really<00:04:46.560> really<00:04:46.620> clean<00:04:46.920> sound<00:04:47.250> since<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.580> was

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
really really clean sound since it was

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.060 
really really clean sound since it was
so<00:04:47.880> hard<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:48.420> get<00:04:48.600> a<00:04:48.750> quiet<00:04:49.110> spot<00:04:49.470> on<00:04:49.680> this<00:04:49.800> game

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
so hard to get a quiet spot on this game

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.220
