00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.910
 piolla, my name is all 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.610
 I'm from Brazil's next top directly from 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.310
 lg digital experience for 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.400
 present to you or r 80 which is more 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.650
 one of the members of line l3 of lg 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.200
 it should be running on the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.450
 market very soon and I will go 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.280
 show you the look he has 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.649
 one is enough a very compact size 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.079
 plus a very generous screen of 5 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.829
 inch resolution 800 480 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.539
 pixels is a lcd screen with ips panel with 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.120
 very good quality 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.280
 it also has a dual core cpu of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.399
 1.2 ghz is if what ensures a good 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.670
 speed in processing good fluidity 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.859
 on the interface and also comes with 1 gb of 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.859
 RAM memory 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.940
 There you are seeing the duel menus. 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.589
 80 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.860
 it uses the default interface of the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.350
 caption also with white background with 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.689
 the same array of colorful icons 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.299
 so for those who already know the devices 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.939
 with the most recent versions of the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.600
 android will feel well acquainted 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.729
 with him 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.920
 An interesting thing is that the LG 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.110
 added the line and 3 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.360
 the choice of the applications that the slide 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.719
 almost all of them come with these 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.479
 apps that are basically me apps 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:36.930
 you can open it's application 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.380
 calendar calendar is from internet 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.570
 video player all of them in window and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.420
 you can resize this window you 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.700
 can expand it can maximize there to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.109
 occupying the entire screen may leave 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.600
 transparent to interact with 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.149
 applications even because 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.159
 you can leave these windows by 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.140
 applications from other 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.020
 applications is quite 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.630
 allows you to explore a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.749
 little more than multitasking than android 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.330
 there you are seeing the 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:13.320
 system interface is divided by tabs 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.420
 confirming the dry white background in 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.170
 colors of the lg 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.670
 even this is a block applet 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.490
 of notes he is between them 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.720
 and then I'll leave it again at 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.640
 window format 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.860
 remembering you can scale this 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.620
 window has the option for you too 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.959
 turn into icon but I did kind of 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.040
 inadvertently not be with how to enable 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.319
 this option 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.010
 another interesting thing here for you 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.530
 enable multitasking in the 80 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.810
 need to hold the button menu button 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.950
 decreases the home button on the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.870
 Truth does it end up activating google nal 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.319
 is different because other 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:01.049
 line l3 is operated differently 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:04.080
 80 eighty also allows you are 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.500
 change theme you can download other 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.660
 themes in lg's shop swapping background is 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.019
 Icons format you modify 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.090
 enough the interface there taking a look 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:19.500
 in memory but we can see that it 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.019
 has 4GB of internal memory and then the 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.610
 people can see that you have these four 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.560
 punishable gigabytes is a little 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.989
 less because it already exists and applications 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.950
 pre-installed it has a slot for 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.350
 micro sd card showing the memory 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.820
 it's 1 gigabyte 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.040
 it has a good memory capacity 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.459
 the screen that was due a little bit 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.640
 in relation to the internal memory because four 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.920
 gigabytes is not much capacity you 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.269
 ends up having a bit of limitation but 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.989
 you can expand this memory 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:56.100
 using micro sd cards is where you 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:58.170
 can install is photos music videos and 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:02.519
 other files and leave internal memory 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:07.609
 only for installing apps there 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:10.500
 taking a look at the look of it 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:13.470
 left side right to the top 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.650
 from below showing tv antenna 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.650
 digital 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:22.870
 It looks just like it's pretty big but it's 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.460
 seems to be a little fragile 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:30.020
 you see that he has 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.030
 digital tv radio fm also then you 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.500
 you can enable both fm radio and 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.450
 tv and digital tv works in standard 1sec 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.620
 that standard that has a quality 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:45.380
 a little is a little worse 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.800
 it is a low resolution image of 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:52.730
 320 by 240 pixels but with the advantage of 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.800
 that you are can use it on the move for 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.250
 example inside a car and a bus 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.620
 so she better captures the tv signal 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.460
 digital still , I had a little bit 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.570
 difficult to tune in but more 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:12.050
 forward you will see that I 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:14.330
 I got then is you can choose the 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.350
 window size can be in a4 format 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.590
 with cut by 369 can only leave it 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:26.050
 in window he has the option of you too 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.050
 is to see the programming grid 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.550
 case in full screen if you slide the 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.140
 finger from left to right or from 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.560
 right to left you change the 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.560
 channels 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:42.110
 Look, just see what I can do. 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.130
 tuning a channel there looks at the size of the 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:49.900
 antenna for you to have an idea and he 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.580
 can also be used in portrait format 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.310
 Look, he has the option of also recording 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.070
 the program gives you to capture a photo 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.840
 programming doubt you can 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.080
 capture an image in addition to recording a 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:05.180
 video there is a place for you 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.890
 view these recorded files will 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.080
 showing his camera he has a 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.110
 8-megapixel rear camera is one 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.720
 good resolution because unfortunately it does not 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.490
 not even on HD, it records on 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.240
 sd format 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.300
 as you will see later on 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.150
 front camera is in the lg pamphlet is 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.630
 saying that it has 1.3 megapixels more 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.740
 in the device settings only 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.210
 0.3 megapixels 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.120
 Are you watching the camera recording? 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:41.039
 only at the maximum of 800 per 480 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:43.650
 pixels wvga format and then the camera 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:46.470
 looking frontal is only showing that 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:49.080
 record videos and take photos only on the 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.919
 standard monitor or this camera would have 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.139
 only 0.3 megapixels 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:58.139
 so the camera is just enough 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:00.389
 to take the tube is either self-portraits in the 

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:01.919
 It's true to make video calls, right? 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:06.690
 self-portrait if she would not have a 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:08.490
 very good quality and the rear camera 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.349
 despite the rather high resolution 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.740
 unfortunately it is due in the 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:15.870
 recording but it is a fairly 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:18.030
 interesting to have a very generous screen 5 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:21.270
 inches are you seeing that the 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:23.400
 camera also has autofocus and 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.789
 it is possible to take pictures and only 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.340
 an an interesting resource unfortunately 

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:31.440
 You can not adjust the focus. 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.330
 automatically while filming and that's it. 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.380
 this is a personal first 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:38.759
 lg l 80 print which is part of the 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.650
 line of three 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:44.729
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:47.580
 in the future I hope to be able to 

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:51.560
 more detailed analysis of this apparatus 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.560
 I hug you all and see you next time.
