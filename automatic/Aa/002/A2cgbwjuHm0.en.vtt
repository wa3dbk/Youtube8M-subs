here it's a fairly easy procedure these

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.519 
here it's a fairly easy procedure these
things<00:00:28.860> will<00:00:28.980> get<00:00:29.040> knocked<00:00:29.250> out<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.329> get

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
things will get knocked out if you get

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.660 
things will get knocked out if you get
an<00:00:31.529> accident<00:00:32.480> or<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.989> parked<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.500> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
before they give way so might be time to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.780 
before they give way so might be time to
replace<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.620> unless<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> want<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> red<00:00:44.579> tape

ahead and show you how to do it there's
two<00:01:03.150> Phillips<00:01:03.480> screws<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.259> and<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:04.710> one

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
two Phillips screws here and then one

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
two Phillips screws here and then one
way<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.369> right<00:01:05.640> underneath<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.240> bumper<00:01:06.659> here

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869

mounting pins on the outside of the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.620 
mounting pins on the outside of the
assembly<00:01:25.659> there<00:01:25.840> which<00:01:26.830> there<00:01:27.070> we<00:01:27.220> go<00:01:27.630> there's

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
assembly there which there we go there's

assembly there which there we go there's
going<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.780> be<00:01:28.840> two<00:01:29.260> wiring<00:01:30.190> harnesses<00:01:30.640> here<00:01:30.880> on

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
going to be two wiring harnesses here on

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.660 
going to be two wiring harnesses here on
the<00:01:31.090> back<00:01:31.259> want<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.320> go<00:01:32.410> ahead<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.830> disconnect

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
the back want to go ahead and disconnect

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:46.290 
the back want to go ahead and disconnect
those<00:01:45.119> okay

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
those okay

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.109 
those okay
and<00:01:46.570> now<00:01:46.750> our<00:01:46.899> taillights<00:01:47.289> off<00:01:48.030> you're<00:01:49.030> going

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
and now our taillights off you're going

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.820 
and now our taillights off you're going
to<00:01:49.210> have<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.360> mounting<00:01:50.080> studs<00:01:50.350> here<00:01:50.560> I<00:01:50.619> believe

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
to have a mounting studs here I believe

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.260 
to have a mounting studs here I believe
that<00:01:51.100> supposed<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.369> be<00:01:51.460> one<00:01:51.610> here<00:01:51.789> as<00:01:51.880> well<00:01:52.030> our

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
that supposed to be one here as well our

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.350 
that supposed to be one here as well our
seems<00:01:52.509> to<00:01:52.600> be<00:01:52.660> missing<00:01:52.869> it<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.640> either<00:01:55.060> way

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
seems to be missing it but either way

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.260 
seems to be missing it but either way
your<00:01:55.840> wiring<00:01:56.470> harnesses<00:01:56.920> are<00:01:57.070> here<00:01:57.399> if<00:01:58.180> you

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
your wiring harnesses are here if you

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.960 
your wiring harnesses are here if you
just<00:01:58.869> want<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.170> change<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.619> bulb<00:01:59.800> you<00:02:00.160> can

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
just want to change the bulb you can

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.560 
just want to change the bulb you can
twist<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:02.140> harness<00:02:02.670> counterclockwise<00:02:03.670> pull

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
twist the harness counterclockwise pull

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.950 
twist the harness counterclockwise pull
the<00:02:04.630> bulb<00:02:04.899> out<00:02:05.050> put<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.619> new<00:02:05.770> one<00:02:05.950> in<00:02:06.960> get

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
the bulb out put the new one in get

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.800 
the bulb out put the new one in get
buried<00:02:08.200> back<00:02:08.320> in<00:02:08.380> there<00:02:09.600> make<00:02:10.600> sure<00:02:10.630> it's

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
buried back in there make sure it's

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.970 
buried back in there make sure it's
seated<00:02:11.200> in<00:02:11.380> there<00:02:11.560> real<00:02:11.739> good

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
seated in there real good

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.420 
seated in there real good
okay<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:14.500> there's<00:02:14.709> obviously<00:02:14.830> nothing<00:02:15.160> wrong

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
okay but there's obviously nothing wrong

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.490 
okay but there's obviously nothing wrong
with<00:02:15.610> our<00:02:15.670> taillight<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.989> we're<00:02:17.080> going<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.380> put

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
with our taillight so we're going to put

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.080 
with our taillight so we're going to put
it<00:02:17.590> right<00:02:17.620> back<00:02:17.890> in<00:02:18.130> just<00:02:18.670> want<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.970> basically

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
it right back in just want to basically

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.840 
it right back in just want to basically
show<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:20.230> back<00:02:20.440> if<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.310> order<00:02:21.549> your<00:02:21.579> part

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
show you the back if you order your part

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.180 
show you the back if you order your part
from<00:02:21.970> Copart<00:02:22.390> comm<00:02:23.200> it's<00:02:23.500> likely<00:02:23.980> going<00:02:24.130> to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
from Copart comm it's likely going to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.350 
from Copart comm it's likely going to
include<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:25.600> new<00:02:26.549> sockets<00:02:27.549> with<00:02:27.700> bulbs<00:02:28.120> most

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
include the new sockets with bulbs most

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.509 
include the new sockets with bulbs most
of<00:02:28.510> our<00:02:28.600> models<00:02:28.810> do<00:02:29.140> if<00:02:29.410> your<00:02:29.920> model<00:02:30.070> doesn't
