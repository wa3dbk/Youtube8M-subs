me about a train station he's building

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.529 
me about a train station he's building
this<00:00:14.549> very<00:00:15.139> detailed<00:00:16.250> system<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.789> network<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
this very detailed system and network of

whatever<00:00:21.359> rails<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.100> he<00:00:23.100> wanted<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.519> system

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
whatever rails and he wanted a system

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.540 
whatever rails and he wanted a system
where<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.119> could<00:00:24.300> go<00:00:24.449> ahead<00:00:24.650> arrive<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:26.340> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
where you could go ahead arrive to the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.259 
where you could go ahead arrive to the
landing<00:00:27.539> platform<00:00:28.220> on<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.279> minecart<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.150> it's

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
landing platform on the minecart so it's

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.970 
landing platform on the minecart so it's
powered<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:31.170> ahead<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.710> then<00:00:31.859> it

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
powered it's going ahead and then it

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.069 
powered it's going ahead and then it
stops<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> location<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.570> get<00:00:33.780> out<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
stops at a location you can get out and

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.780 
stops at a location you can get out and
without<00:00:34.380> touching<00:00:34.680> anything<00:00:35.040> it'll<00:00:35.370> continue

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
without touching anything it'll continue

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.000 
without touching anything it'll continue
on<00:00:36.030> its<00:00:36.180> path<00:00:36.420> after<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.780> few<00:00:37.020> seconds<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.559> went

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
on its path after a few seconds I went

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.350 
on its path after a few seconds I went
ahead<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.340> showed<00:00:38.550> him<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.820> design<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
ahead and I showed him this design it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.209 
ahead and I showed him this design it

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.090 
it if you're confused then I'll show you
guys<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> build<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.800> we're<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:49.920> gonna

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
guys how to build it so we're just gonna

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.889 
guys how to build it so we're just gonna
push<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.520> minecart<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.360> just<00:00:51.539> give<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
push the minecart here and just give a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.060 
push the minecart here and just give a
little<00:00:51.989> power<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> reach<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:54.059> stops<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
little power to reach that it stops and

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.670 
little power to reach that it stops and
then<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.160> continues<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.510> let<00:00:58.320> me<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.559> run

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
then it continues so let me just run

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.290 
then it continues so let me just run
through<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:59.010> happens<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.489> like<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.059> saw

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
through what happens it like you saw

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.630 
through what happens it like you saw
okay<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.530> want<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.949> place<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> minecart

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
okay so you want to place a minecart

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.280 
okay so you want to place a minecart
down<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.420> needs<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.930> powered

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
down and have it needs to be powered

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.960 
down and have it needs to be powered
initially<00:01:04.710> whether<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.580> button

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
initially whether that be from a button

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.600 
initially whether that be from a button
or<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.720> pre<00:01:07.020> powered<00:01:07.680> rail<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
or from a pre powered rail like this so

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.530 
or from a pre powered rail like this so
you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.939> put<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.180> down<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.360> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
you can just put it down and it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.410 
you can just put it down and it
automatically<00:01:10.049> goes<00:01:10.400> whatever<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.580> case<00:01:11.790> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
automatically goes whatever the case you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.399 
automatically goes whatever the case you
want<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.990> go<00:01:13.110> ahead<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.369> pre

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
want it to go ahead and have a pre

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.219 
want it to go ahead and have a pre
powered<00:01:16.409> rail<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.720> what<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.840> want<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> happen

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
powered rail so what we want to happen

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.710 
powered rail so what we want to happen
is<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> has<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.860> roll<00:01:20.130> up<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> rail<00:01:20.790> hit<00:01:21.600> it

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
is it has to roll up on the rail hit it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.840 
is it has to roll up on the rail hit it
a<00:01:21.780> detector<00:01:22.290> rail<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.979> detector<00:01:23.460> rail<00:01:23.640> will

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
a detector rail the detector rail will

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
a detector rail the detector rail will
send<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.270> signal<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.049> Redstone<00:01:25.799> underneath

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
send a signal to the Redstone underneath

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.850 
send a signal to the Redstone underneath
and<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.909> throughout<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.720> current<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.290> then

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and go throughout the current and then

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.950 
and go throughout the current and then
it's<00:01:29.009> gonna<00:01:29.100> travel<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.909> up<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> come

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it's gonna travel right up here and come

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.890 
it's gonna travel right up here and come
to<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.350> powered<00:01:31.920> rail<00:01:32.130> now<00:01:32.759> when<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.750> on

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
to this powered rail now when it's on

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
to this powered rail now when it's on
the<00:01:34.020> powered<00:01:34.320> rail<00:01:34.530> at<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.799> powered<00:01:35.220> rail<00:01:35.400> is

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the powered rail at the powered rail is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.030 
the powered rail at the powered rail is
not<00:01:35.670> powered<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.780> minecart<00:01:37.590> will<00:01:37.710> actually

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
not powered the minecart will actually

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.969 
not powered the minecart will actually
stop<00:01:38.460> okay<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:40.020> once<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.350> powered<00:01:40.500> it'll

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
stop okay then once it's powered it'll

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.100 
stop okay then once it's powered it'll
continue<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> move<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.659> use<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
continue to move so we can use that to

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.139 
continue to move so we can use that to
our<00:01:43.140> advantage<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:44.100> we're<00:01:44.189> gonna<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.939> does

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
our advantage what we're gonna it does

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.030 
our advantage what we're gonna it does
rather<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> goes<00:01:46.409> ahead<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.740> triggers

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
rather is when it goes ahead it triggers

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.490 
rather is when it goes ahead it triggers
the<00:01:47.220> powered<00:01:47.610> rail<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.079> power<00:01:49.229> or<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the powered rail or not the power or the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.020 
the powered rail or not the power or the
detector<00:01:49.920> rail<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.310> comes<00:01:50.579> up<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:50.880> it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
detector rail it comes up here and it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.210 
detector rail it comes up here and it
stops<00:01:51.329> right<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:51.680> until<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.860> gets<00:01:53.040> that

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
stops right here until it gets that

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.490 
stops right here until it gets that
signal<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.509> know<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.960> alter

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
signal from this you know you can alter

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.920 
signal from this you know you can alter
the<00:01:56.040> amount<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.369> time<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.880> want<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.780> have

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the amount of time that you want to have

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.039 
the amount of time that you want to have
it<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.380> people<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.860> get<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.070> or<00:01:59.369> off<00:01:59.490> or<00:02:00.049> chests

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
it so people can get on or off or chests

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.959 
it so people can get on or off or chests
if<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.469> mine<00:02:01.680> carts<00:02:02.040> with<00:02:02.340> chests<00:02:02.790> or

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
if you have mine carts with chests or

if you have mine carts with chests or
whatever<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:04.020> want<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.680> alter<00:02:04.979> that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
whatever you want to you can alter that

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.090 
whatever you want to you can alter that
by<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.610> adding<00:02:05.909> more<00:02:06.329> repeaters<00:02:06.930> and

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
by just adding more repeaters and

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.250 
by just adding more repeaters and
adding<00:02:08.370> more<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.760> delay<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.570> longer<00:02:09.870> chain

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
adding more of a delay or a longer chain

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.540 
adding more of a delay or a longer chain
whatever<00:02:10.620> you<00:02:10.770> want<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.010> do<00:02:11.190> or<00:02:11.370> you're<00:02:11.460> gonna

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
whatever you want to do or you're gonna

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.740 
whatever you want to do or you're gonna
have<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.730> shorter<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.360> wanted<00:02:12.540> to<00:02:12.660> go

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
have a shorter one if you wanted to go

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.900 
have a shorter one if you wanted to go
stop<00:02:13.140> go<00:02:13.170> stop<00:02:13.380> go<00:02:13.680> stop<00:02:13.860> go<00:02:14.130> really<00:02:14.700> quickly

hotbar except for this type of minecart
and<00:02:20.910> these<00:02:21.600> two<00:02:21.810> blocks<00:02:22.080> I'm<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.470> using

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
and these two blocks I'm just using

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.410 
and these two blocks I'm just using
these<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.040> show<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.250> guys<00:02:23.490> right<00:02:23.670> here<00:02:23.880> the

these to show you guys right here the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.760 
these to show you guys right here the
minecart<00:02:24.870> like<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.050> said<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.290> guys<00:02:25.380> can<00:02:25.560> use

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.250 
mine carts with chests or just powered
mine<00:02:28.140> carts<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:30.330> do<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.630> we're<00:02:30.750> gonna<00:02:30.840> just

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
mine carts can do that we're gonna just

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.230 
mine carts can do that we're gonna just
start<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.650> off<00:02:31.770> like<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.460> we're<00:02:33.090> going

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
start it off like this and we're going

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.020 
start it off like this and we're going
to<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:35.100> go<00:02:35.280> ahead<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.640> will<00:02:35.820> be<00:02:35.940> our

to have you go ahead this will be our
initial<00:02:36.240> starting<00:02:36.780> rail<00:02:39.680> we'll<00:02:40.680> bring<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.010> up

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
initial starting rail we'll bring it up

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.480 
initial starting rail we'll bring it up
here<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.540> from<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.780> it's<00:02:43.020> gonna<00:02:43.170> go<00:02:43.470> out<00:02:43.650> you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
here and from this it's gonna go out you

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.190 
here and from this it's gonna go out you
guys<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.910> course<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.360> this<00:02:45.540> is<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.110> know

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
guys can of course have this is you know

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.990 
guys can of course have this is you know
whatever<00:02:46.500> length<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.070> prefer<00:02:47.610> I'm<00:02:47.790> just

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
whatever length you prefer I'm just

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.900 
whatever length you prefer I'm just
setting<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.420> up<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:49.100> for<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.610> be<00:02:50.730> more

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
setting it up like this for to be more

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.210 
setting it up like this for to be more
compact<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.720> then<00:02:52.170> right<00:02:52.380> here<00:02:52.710> we're<00:02:53.160> gonna

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
compact and then right here we're gonna

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.130 
compact and then right here we're gonna
want<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.430> put<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.640> detector<00:02:54.240> rail<00:02:54.390> okay<00:02:54.930> and

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
want to put a detector rail okay and

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.420 
want to put a detector rail okay and
we're<00:02:55.290> actually<00:02:55.410> gonna<00:02:55.620> want<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.920> dig<00:02:56.190> down

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
we're actually gonna want to dig down

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.840 
we're actually gonna want to dig down
two<00:02:56.850> blocks<00:02:58.130> underneath<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.580> right

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
two blocks underneath here right

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.790 
two blocks underneath here right
underneath<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.360> detector<00:03:00.840> eyo<00:03:00.990> we<00:03:01.470> want<00:03:01.680> to

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
underneath the detector eyo we want to

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.340 
underneath the detector eyo we want to
place<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.280> thing<00:03:02.490> of<00:03:02.610> redstone<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.240> then<00:03:04.140> from

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
place a thing of redstone and then from

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.490 
place a thing of redstone and then from
there<00:03:04.560> we<00:03:05.130> want<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.460> do<00:03:06.060> repeaters<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:07.020> full

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
there we want to do repeaters on full

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.760 
there we want to do repeaters on full
tick<00:03:07.830> delay<00:03:08.100> as<00:03:08.690> long<00:03:09.690> as<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.110> want<00:03:10.350> because

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
tick delay as long as you want because

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.320 
tick delay as long as you want because
like<00:03:11.010> I<00:03:11.130> said<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.520> just<00:03:11.700> adds<00:03:11.940> more<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.270> a

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
like I said this just adds more of a

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.740 
like I said this just adds more of a
delay<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.710> time<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.060> can<00:03:15.390> have<00:03:15.720> a

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
delay to the time so you can have a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.570 
delay to the time so you can have a
longer<00:03:16.050> time<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.560> actually<00:03:16.830> get<00:03:17.070> off<00:03:17.220> we<00:03:17.400> won't

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
longer time to actually get off we won't

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.370 
longer time to actually get off we won't
do<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.820> there<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.210> course<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:18.750> because<00:03:19.260> you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
do it there of course like because you

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.020 
do it there of course like because you
can<00:03:19.410> see<00:03:19.770> that<00:03:20.010> there's<00:03:20.160> actually<00:03:20.640> that's<00:03:20.850> the

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
can see that there's actually that's the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.000 
can see that there's actually that's the
connection<00:03:21.270> for<00:03:21.600> this<00:03:21.690> one<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.500> we'll<00:03:22.620> turn<00:03:22.830> it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
connection for this one so we'll turn it

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.570 
connection for this one so we'll turn it
around<00:03:23.100> right<00:03:23.430> here<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:26.130> that's<00:03:26.310> a<00:03:26.400> pretty

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
around right here and that's a pretty

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.250 
around right here and that's a pretty
good<00:03:26.670> distance<00:03:26.970> now<00:03:27.600> we're<00:03:27.720> gonna<00:03:27.810> have<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.230> go

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
good distance now we're gonna have it go

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.590 
good distance now we're gonna have it go
ahead<00:03:28.470> right<00:03:28.800> here<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.340> it's<00:03:29.700> gonna<00:03:29.790> go<00:03:30.090> up

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
ahead right here and it's gonna go up

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.300 
ahead right here and it's gonna go up
one<00:03:32.360> like<00:03:33.360> this<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.840> then<00:03:34.500> from<00:03:34.860> here<00:03:34.950> we're

one like this and then from here we're

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.430 
one like this and then from here we're
gonna<00:03:35.400> have<00:03:35.490> it<00:03:35.790> go<00:03:35.820> like<00:03:36.240> that<00:03:36.480> and<00:03:36.780> let<00:03:37.410> me

that they'd add to Xbox version is to go

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.910 
that they'd add to Xbox version is to go
ahead<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.210> switch<00:03:51.360> time<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.440> day

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
ahead and switch time of day

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.460

conveniently<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.360> like<00:03:54.810> I<00:03:54.900> was<00:03:55.020> saying<00:03:55.080> we

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
conveniently so like I was saying we

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.530 
conveniently so like I was saying we
want<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.250> go<00:03:56.340> over<00:03:56.520> here<00:03:56.610> ahead<00:03:57.090> right<00:03:57.300> here

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
want to go over here ahead right here

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.300

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
and we want to place a powered rail not

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.790 
and we want to place a powered rail not
a<00:03:59.370> detector<00:04:00.150> rail<00:04:00.270> so<00:04:00.570> powered<00:04:00.960> rail<00:04:01.170> rail

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
a detector rail so powered rail rail

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.140 
a detector rail so powered rail rail
right<00:04:02.010> here<00:04:02.040> won't<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.490> have<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.670> thing<00:04:03.030> of

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
right here won't I have a thing of

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.150 
right here won't I have a thing of
redstone<00:04:03.480> right<00:04:03.810> next<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.470> then<00:04:04.950> our

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
redstone right next to it and then our

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.340 
redstone right next to it and then our
repeaters<00:04:05.790> turning<00:04:06.390> we<00:04:06.990> want<00:04:07.140> to<00:04:07.200> make<00:04:07.320> sure

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
repeaters turning we want to make sure

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.290 
repeaters turning we want to make sure
it's<00:04:07.590> going<00:04:07.740> in<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.980> same<00:04:08.130> direction<00:04:08.340> so<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
it's going in the same direction so the

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.730 
it's going in the same direction so the
current<00:04:09.630> can<00:04:09.750> actually<00:04:10.080> flow<00:04:10.350> all<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.620> way

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
current can actually flow all the way

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.680 
current can actually flow all the way
through<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.340> then<00:04:11.940> we<00:04:12.030> want<00:04:12.240> to<00:04:12.300> go<00:04:12.360> ahead<00:04:12.570> and

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
through and then we want to go ahead and

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.650 
through and then we want to go ahead and
add<00:04:12.780> the<00:04:12.990> rest<00:04:13.230> of<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.830> actual<00:04:14.280> rails<00:04:15.060> for<00:04:15.570> the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
add the rest of the actual rails for the

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.210 
add the rest of the actual rails for the
system<00:04:16.020> and<00:04:16.169> we<00:04:16.260> put<00:04:16.440> a<00:04:16.470> stopper<00:04:16.799> right<00:04:17.010> here

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
system and we put a stopper right here

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.760 
system and we put a stopper right here
so<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> minecarts<00:04:17.910> don't<00:04:18.120> get<00:04:18.239> lost<00:04:18.450> so<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.560> is

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
so a minecarts don't get lost so that is

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.590 
so a minecarts don't get lost so that is
actually<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.430> you<00:04:20.640> can<00:04:20.760> see<00:04:20.970> if<00:04:21.060> we<00:04:21.090> place<00:04:21.419> this

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
actually it you can see if we place this

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.960 
actually it you can see if we place this
right

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
right

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.280 
right
here<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:23.160> actually<00:04:24.160> on<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.670> track<00:04:24.910> it'll<00:04:25.660> go<00:04:25.810> by

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
here I actually on the track it'll go by

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.740 
here I actually on the track it'll go by
it'll<00:04:26.650> stop<00:04:26.950> it'll<00:04:27.940> wait<00:04:28.090> the<00:04:28.240> time<00:04:28.450> you<00:04:28.600> can

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
it'll stop it'll wait the time you can

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.480 
it'll stop it'll wait the time you can
get<00:04:28.900> out<00:04:29.080> and<00:04:29.290> then<00:04:29.650> it'll<00:04:29.800> keep<00:04:30.010> going<00:04:30.160> once

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
get out and then it'll keep going once

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.210 
get out and then it'll keep going once
here<00:04:30.820> once<00:04:31.150> you're<00:04:31.330> out<00:04:31.540> and<00:04:31.870> good<00:04:32.620> so<00:04:33.130> that's

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
here once you're out and good so that's

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.310 
here once you're out and good so that's
all<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.640> is<00:04:33.700> guys<00:04:33.970> that's<00:04:34.240> very<00:04:34.510> simple<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.170> do
