summer so this is pretty much what I

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.350

look like when I get out of the shower

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.750 
look like when I get out of the shower
it's<00:02:41.780> scary<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.470> always<00:02:42.769> use<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.280> piece<00:02:43.640> of

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
it's scary I always use a piece of

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.370 
it's scary I always use a piece of
another<00:02:43.910> makeup<00:02:44.180> wipe<00:02:44.480> and<00:02:44.750> then<00:02:44.810> wipe<00:02:45.230> off

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380

the<00:02:45.560> excess<00:02:45.860> makeup<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:47.390> then<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.690> use<00:02:47.810> this

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
the excess makeup and then I use this

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.810

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
this is a really good moisturizer I've

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.460 
this is a really good moisturizer I've
been<00:02:51.500> using<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.829> for<00:02:51.860> a<00:02:52.130> few<00:02:52.579> years<00:02:52.610> now<00:02:52.910> and

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
been using it for a few years now and

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.759 
been using it for a few years now and
this<00:02:54.470> towel<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.840> microfiber<00:02:56.840> towel<00:02:57.230> I<00:02:57.260> think

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
this towel is a microfiber towel I think

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.949 
this towel is a microfiber towel I think
it<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.040> cold<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:59.180> basically<00:02:59.269> just<00:02:59.720> dries

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
it is cold and it basically just dries

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.569 
it is cold and it basically just dries
really<00:03:00.230> fast<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:00.920> it's<00:03:01.070> really<00:03:01.220> good<00:03:01.430> for

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
really fast so it's really good for

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.640 
really fast so it's really good for
drying<00:03:01.790> your<00:03:01.940> hair<00:03:02.150> but<00:03:02.360> so<00:03:02.570> after<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:02.959> kind<00:03:03.500> of

using again this is retin-a and this is

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.509 
using again this is retin-a and this is
super<00:03:10.760> strong<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:11.660> it'll<00:03:12.290> basically<00:03:12.500> take<00:03:13.340> off

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
super strong so it'll basically take off

kind of flaky gross skin for a little
bit<00:03:17.299> but<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.840> really<00:03:17.930> does<00:03:18.140> a<00:03:18.170> job<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.620> taking

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
frizz free I'll put some product in it

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.770 
frizz free I'll put some product in it
which<00:04:00.459> can<00:04:00.610> just<00:04:00.790> be<00:04:00.910> a<00:04:00.940> leave-in<00:04:01.209> conditioner

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
which can just be a leave-in conditioner

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.440 
which can just be a leave-in conditioner
and<00:04:02.020> then<00:04:02.170> I'll<00:04:02.410> blow-dry<00:04:03.130> it<00:04:03.160> halfway<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:04.030> I

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
and then I'll blow-dry it halfway and I

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.150 
and then I'll blow-dry it halfway and I
find<00:04:04.690> that<00:04:04.780> when<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:04.930> do<00:04:05.050> this<00:04:05.319> my<00:04:05.650> hair<00:04:05.890> is<00:04:05.980> just

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
find that when I do this my hair is just

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.610 
find that when I do this my hair is just
a<00:04:06.340> lot<00:04:06.610> less<00:04:06.640> puffy<00:04:07.480> in<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.630> morning<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.350> I

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
a lot less puffy in the morning and I

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.890 
a lot less puffy in the morning and I
also<00:04:08.830> sleep<00:04:09.280> on<00:04:09.519> this<00:04:09.850> silk<00:04:10.150> pillowcase<00:04:10.690> I

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
also sleep on this silk pillowcase I

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.940 
also sleep on this silk pillowcase I
only<00:04:11.019> bought<00:04:11.230> one<00:04:11.260> because<00:04:11.680> they're<00:04:11.800> about

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
only bought one because they're about

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.070 
only bought one because they're about
twenty<00:04:12.370> dollars<00:04:12.610> on<00:04:12.790> Amazon<00:04:13.180> but<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:13.840> think

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
twenty dollars on Amazon but I think

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
twenty dollars on Amazon but I think
that<00:04:14.170> this<00:04:14.260> has<00:04:14.470> actually<00:04:14.590> made<00:04:14.860> a<00:04:14.920> big

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
that this has actually made a big

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.710 
that this has actually made a big
difference<00:04:15.220> for<00:04:15.730> helping<00:04:16.000> my<00:04:16.120> hair<00:04:16.359> become

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
difference for helping my hair become

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.380 
difference for helping my hair become
less<00:04:17.140> frizzy<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:18.250> always<00:04:18.609> moisturize<00:04:18.850> my

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
less frizzy and I always moisturize my

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.300 
less frizzy and I always moisturize my
lips<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:19.870> hands<00:04:20.140> before<00:04:20.530> bed<00:04:20.709> because<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.160> feel

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
lips and hands before bed because I feel

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.830 
lips and hands before bed because I feel
like<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:21.609> is<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.910> best<00:04:22.120> time<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.660> let<00:04:22.810> it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
like this is the best time to let it

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.310 
like this is the best time to let it
really<00:04:23.260> just<00:04:23.470> sink<00:04:23.770> into<00:04:23.919> your<00:04:24.280> skin<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:26.050> for
