00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello good day everyone today I'm going to 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.240
 teach to download a virtual pet 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.309
 and the virtual pet that I'm going to 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.160
 teach to download is the discoverer 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.719
 that dances on the desk good as 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.700
 always the link I leave it in the 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.920
 description of the video 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.710
 when you click on the link that I left 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.810
 in the description of the video 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.630
 that will send them to a page like this 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.039
 when this page appears only 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.380
 they have to wait for the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.780
 five seconds advertising as it passes 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.360
 the five seconds advertising give you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.850
 jump advertising and that would be 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.059
 sending directly up to mega like 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.309
 can see spit only weighs 4.4 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.739
 megabyte just have to give in 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.030
 download and start downloading to your 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.129
 computer 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.969
 I will cancel the download because I already 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.969
 I have downloaded 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.010
 When the download is complete, it will create a 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.390
 save file like this one 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.100

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.100

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.409
 and we open it and we have a file that 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.130

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.130

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.720

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.720
