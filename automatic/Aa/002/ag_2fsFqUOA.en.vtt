place and took out the third fourth
actual<00:01:08.760> shift<00:01:09.090> pack<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.080> these<00:01:10.260> need<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
actual shift pack so now these need to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.840 
actual shift pack so now these need to
be<00:01:10.619> updated<00:01:11.159> because<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.369> can't<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.729> buy

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
be updated because you can't just buy

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.310 
be updated because you can't just buy
this<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.990> forth<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.460> car<00:01:14.790> has<00:01:15.119> a

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
this one and so forth so this car has a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.679 
this one and so forth so this car has a
major<00:01:16.320> expensive<00:01:17.100> failure<00:01:17.549> cool<00:01:18.390> part<00:01:18.659> about

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
major expensive failure cool part about

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.480 
major expensive failure cool part about
seeing<00:01:19.110> all<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.350> stuff<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> lot<00:01:20.340> of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
seeing all this stuff it is is a lot of

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.789 
seeing all this stuff it is is a lot of
guys<00:01:20.610> don't<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:22.049> guy<00:01:22.259> that

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
guys don't get to see that guy that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.820 
guys don't get to see that guy that
would<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> center<00:01:23.790> diff<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.659> sucker<00:01:25.020> in

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
would be the center diff this sucker in

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.859 
would be the center diff this sucker in
association<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.000> output<00:01:27.540> right<00:01:27.840> here

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
association with this output right here

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.990 
association with this output right here
I'll<00:01:28.680> spin<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.880> front<00:01:30.270> or<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.860> spins<00:01:32.340> this

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
I'll spin the front or if it spins this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.390 
I'll spin the front or if it spins this
one<00:01:33.470> right<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.860> where<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> power<00:01:35.340> comes

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
one right there is where the power comes

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.359 
one right there is where the power comes
in<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.030> depending<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.570> how<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:37.079> diff<00:01:37.829> wants

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
in so depending on how this diff wants

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.080 
in so depending on how this diff wants
to<00:01:38.490> give<00:01:38.670> power<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:40.200> front<00:01:40.619> diff<00:01:41.130> equals

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
to give power to the front diff equals

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.319 
to give power to the front diff equals
out<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.270> your<00:01:42.450> four-wheel<00:01:42.899> drive<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:44.009> if<00:01:44.430> you

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
out to your four-wheel drive so if you

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.050 
out to your four-wheel drive so if you
remove<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.079> sucker<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.890> lock<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.460> lock<00:01:47.700> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
remove this sucker and lock it lock this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.840 
remove this sucker and lock it lock this
gear<00:01:48.479> out<00:01:48.689> right<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:50.009> get<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.460> rear-wheel

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
gear out right here you get a rear-wheel

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.819 
gear out right here you get a rear-wheel
drive<00:01:50.880> Subaru<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:52.140> what<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> lot<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.710> those

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
drive Subaru that's what a lot of those

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
drive Subaru that's what a lot of those
kits<00:01:53.159> are<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.520> you're<00:01:53.670> removing<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.659> diff

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
kits are is you're removing this diff

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.749 
kits are is you're removing this diff
locking<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.619> with<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.829> straight<00:01:56.189> shaft
