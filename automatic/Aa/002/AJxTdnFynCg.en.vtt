00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.230 
tell you this if I was in like charge of
designing<00:05:00.680> maps<00:05:01.069> I<00:05:01.370> would<00:05:01.610> be<00:05:01.729> like<00:05:01.909> you<00:05:02.060> do<00:05:02.150> it

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240

we're<00:05:02.750> gonna<00:05:02.840> design<00:05:03.319> new<00:05:03.530> guns<00:05:03.800> we're<00:05:04.099> gonna

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:04.219 
we're gonna design new guns we're gonna

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.760 
we're gonna design new guns we're gonna
put<00:05:04.430> new<00:05:04.550> guns<00:05:04.789> in<00:05:04.909> the<00:05:04.969> maps<00:05:05.150> so<00:05:05.620> certain<00:05:06.620> maps

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
put new guns in the maps so certain maps

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.399 
put new guns in the maps so certain maps
have<00:05:07.069> like<00:05:07.729> a<00:05:07.759> new<00:05:08.030> gun<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.599> the<00:05:08.750> other<00:05:09.139> maps

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
have like a new gun and the other maps

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.350 
have like a new gun and the other maps
don't<00:05:09.680> have<00:05:09.889> them<00:05:10.099> and<00:05:10.400> people<00:05:11.000> would<00:05:11.210> enjoy

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
don't have them and people would enjoy

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.300 
don't have them and people would enjoy
that<00:05:11.509> that's<00:05:11.900> what<00:05:12.139> would<00:05:12.409> make<00:05:12.590> like<00:05:12.830> I'm<00:05:13.039> map

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
that that's what would make like I'm map

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.240 
that that's what would make like I'm map
special<00:05:13.879> because<00:05:14.319> it's<00:05:15.319> just<00:05:15.440> not<00:05:15.710> a<00:05:15.740> new<00:05:15.949> area

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
special because it's just not a new area

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.279 
special because it's just not a new area
to<00:05:16.430> play<00:05:16.580> with<00:05:16.789> it's<00:05:17.029> a<00:05:17.210> new<00:05:17.419> gun<00:05:17.719> to<00:05:17.900> play<00:05:18.080> with

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
to play with it's a new gun to play with

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.529

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
and new guns are always key and making

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.830 
and new guns are always key and making
an<00:05:20.689> awesome<00:05:21.169> game<00:05:21.409> even<00:05:22.189> better<00:05:22.460> um<00:05:22.759> if<00:05:23.449> I<00:05:23.750> were

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
an awesome game even better um if I were

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
an awesome game even better um if I were
to<00:05:23.930> create<00:05:24.110> a<00:05:24.199> new<00:05:24.379> gun<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.919> would<00:05:25.250> like<00:05:25.479> combine

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
to create a new gun I would like combine

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.040 
to create a new gun I would like combine
maybe<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.069> odd<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:28.969> l9<00:05:29.150> so<00:05:29.750> it<00:05:29.840> just

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
maybe the odd and the l9 so it just

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.140 
maybe the odd and the l9 so it just
sprays<00:05:30.440> sniper<00:05:30.949> bullets<00:05:31.310> I'll<00:05:31.490> see<00:05:31.669> a<00:05:31.699> bear<00:05:32.000> it

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
sprays sniper bullets I'll see a bear it

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.939 
sprays sniper bullets I'll see a bear it
