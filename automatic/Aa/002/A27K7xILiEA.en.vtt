00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.159
 But 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.060
 I did this time 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.770
 I sent a lot 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.620
 Great deal 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.620
 71 said it was football life 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 After that the writer ran a series 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.340
 You can enjoy Takeya point 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.700
 Football u-22 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.100
 I care about me 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.170
 It was difficult to do well in practice 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.640
 We all seem to be pulling our feet 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.850
 But t 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.270
 Published 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.670
 This time the eyes of the region 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.060
 First work 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.530
 Although I was playing football and continued playing the piano 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.530
 I spent 1-September 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.010
 I want to use it for the contest 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
 I planned to extend my arms and legs for the first time in a while 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.610
 I'm leaving under this true 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.780
 I think recently 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.020
 I have always been 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.020
 You may not be sincere to Canon 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.550
 I think I was third 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.110
 Proclaiming victory or loss in music 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.420
 I don't like giving or losing 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.460
 I stopped listening in public 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.800
 It is inconsistent 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.440
 What about Omae 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.830
 It is said not to rely on him 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.149
 Is it accumulated? 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.239
 Do not you want to understand and do 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.579
 There is no such thing 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.649
 To you 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.509
 I feel like there is music of Omae 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:19.599
 It is good to connect it regardless of good and bad 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.609
 is not it 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:22.349
 Consolidation 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.859
 It looks like you 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.939
 Oita itself was 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.129
 I stretched my spine 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.879
 I say firmly with my feet 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.879
 Honest envy 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.119
 I will do my best
