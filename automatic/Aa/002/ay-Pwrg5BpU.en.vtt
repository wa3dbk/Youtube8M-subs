already<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> guess<00:00:39.239> just<00:00:40.200> snap<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
already so I guess just snap this on the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:51.389 
already so I guess just snap this on the
front<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.050> back

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.630 

so<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.000> just<00:00:52.120> snap<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.539> pieces<00:00:52.809> in<00:00:52.930> front<00:00:53.640> so

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
so you just snap the pieces in front so

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.170 
so you just snap the pieces in front so
you<00:00:54.730> kind<00:00:55.030> of<00:00:55.120> get<00:00:55.239> ultimate<00:00:55.690> Prime<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.550> parts
