I'm pretty sure you can guess what that
is

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
is

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.870 
is

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
lela lela i don't know and i guess turn

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.670 
lela lela i don't know and i guess turn
it<00:04:32.790> down<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:32.970> little<00:04:33.300> bit<00:04:33.450> is<00:04:34.140> it<00:04:34.350> this<00:04:34.440> cool

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
it down a little bit is it this cool

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.770 
it down a little bit is it this cool
brings<00:04:34.950> new<00:04:35.100> feel<00:04:35.310> then<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.090> usually<00:04:36.450> makes

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
brings new feel then this usually makes

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.630 
brings new feel then this usually makes
a<00:04:36.870> saturation<00:04:37.260> go<00:04:37.500> down<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.100> i'll<00:04:38.280> just<00:04:38.310> boost

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
a saturation go down so i'll just boost

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.280 
a saturation go down so i'll just boost
that<00:04:38.820> up<00:04:38.940> a<00:04:39.030> kind<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.300> it<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.630> that's<00:04:40.080> pretty

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
that up a kind of it and that's pretty

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.770 
that up a kind of it and that's pretty
much<00:04:40.410> all<00:04:40.710> i<00:04:40.770> do<00:04:41.070> on<00:04:41.370> after<00:04:41.640> light<00:04:41.820> next

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
much all i do on after light next

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.380 
much all i do on after light next
another<00:04:43.140> pretty<00:04:43.380> basic<00:04:43.590> app<00:04:43.950> of<00:04:44.280> the<00:04:44.340> SEO<00:04:45.120> cam

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
another pretty basic app of the SEO cam

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.660 
another pretty basic app of the SEO cam
and<00:04:45.720> in<00:04:46.410> there<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:46.680> guess<00:04:46.920> like<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.220> use<00:04:47.340> the

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
and in there I guess like to use the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.390 
and in there I guess like to use the
filters<00:04:48.030> s1<00:04:48.510> s2<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.840> s3<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.500> I<00:04:49.620> think<00:04:49.980> I'd<00:04:50.220> to

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
filters s1 s2 and s3 and I think I'd to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.650 
filters s1 s2 and s3 and I think I'd to
pay<00:04:50.580> for<00:04:50.790> this<00:04:50.910> it's<00:04:51.120> called<00:04:51.360> like<00:04:51.540> the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
pay for this it's called like the

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.540 
pay for this it's called like the
brightening<00:04:52.140> clean<00:04:52.410> pack<00:04:52.740> but<00:04:53.040> I<00:04:53.100> really<00:04:53.400> like

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:03.789 
similar to traffic rush if you ever

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:05.010 
similar to traffic rush if you ever
played<00:07:04.030> that<00:07:04.060> when<00:07:04.300> you're<00:07:04.419> younger<00:07:04.599> you<00:07:04.840> just

played that when you're younger you just

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.930 
played that when you're younger you just
get<00:07:05.169> the<00:07:05.379> red<00:07:05.590> a<00:07:05.620> block<00:07:05.979> through<00:07:06.610> the<00:07:06.639> other

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
get the red a block through the other

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.719 
get the red a block through the other
blocks<00:07:07.270> and<00:07:07.889> the<00:07:08.889> next<00:07:09.129> thing<00:07:09.219> I<00:07:09.250> have<00:07:09.460> is

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:09.729 
blocks and the next thing I have is

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.330 
blocks and the next thing I have is
geometry<00:07:10.419> dash<00:07:10.629> and<00:07:10.960> I<00:07:11.469> passed<00:07:12.099> all<00:07:12.250> the

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
geometry dash and I passed all the

geometry dash and I passed all the
levelness<00:07:12.789> before<00:07:13.150> too<00:07:13.330> but<00:07:13.539> I<00:07:13.569> think<00:07:13.810> there's

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:13.960
