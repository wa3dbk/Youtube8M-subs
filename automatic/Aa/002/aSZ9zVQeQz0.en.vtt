00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
many are also in reserve and were the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.559 
many are also in reserve and were the
other<00:02:17.540> ones<00:02:17.750> at<00:02:18.160> we<00:02:19.160> have<00:02:19.340> two<00:02:19.610> trucks<00:02:19.970> at<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
other ones at we have two trucks at the

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.930 
other ones at we have two trucks at the
training<00:02:20.780> center<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.350> there<00:02:21.980> are<00:02:22.250> also<00:02:22.670> two

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
training center and there are also two

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.580 
training center and there are also two
trucks<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.540> are<00:02:23.690> kept<00:02:23.959> at<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.140> maintenance

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
trucks that are kept at the maintenance

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.820 
trucks that are kept at the maintenance
shop<00:02:24.799> as<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.459> front<00:02:25.670> line<00:02:26.239> reserves<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.380> then

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
shop as the front line reserves and then

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.650 
shop as the front line reserves and then
so<00:02:28.010> these<00:02:28.160> are<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.910> basically<00:02:29.239> have<00:02:29.450> the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
so these are you basically have the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.660 
so these are you basically have the
complement<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.620> equipment<00:02:31.130> complement<00:02:31.610> it

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
complement of equipment complement it

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.190 
complement of equipment complement it
holds<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.090> these<00:02:32.209> are<00:02:32.390> radar<00:02:32.690> just<00:02:32.989> roll

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
holds it so these are radar just roll

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.830 
holds it so these are radar just roll
into<00:02:33.380> service<00:02:33.739> with<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:35.000> exception<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.810> few

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
into service with the exception of a few

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.809 
into service with the exception of a few
items<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.620> they<00:02:36.650> pull<00:02:36.950> off<00:02:37.130> of<00:02:37.310> their<00:02:37.459> trucks

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
items that they pull off of their trucks

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.509 
items that they pull off of their trucks
that<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:38.510> wouldn't<00:02:38.780> be<00:02:39.519> financially

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
that it just wouldn't be financially

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.370 
that it just wouldn't be financially
feasible<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:41.060> keep<00:02:41.330> on<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:41.660> reserves<00:02:41.959> as<00:02:42.200> well

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
feasible to keep on the reserves as well

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.610 
feasible to keep on the reserves as well

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
now and as they start loading this on

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.520 
now and as they start loading this on
this<00:03:25.850> one<00:03:26.060> will<00:03:26.239> stay<00:03:26.420> at<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.810> with<00:03:27.410> the
