on<00:03:02.989> just<00:03:03.290> this<00:03:03.470> little<00:03:03.709> metal

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
on just this little metal

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.770 
on just this little metal
it's<00:03:05.459> actually

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
it's actually

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.290 
it's actually
roller<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.650> I'm<00:03:08.610> just<00:03:08.760> going<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:08.970> work<00:03:09.120> on

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
roller and I'm just going to work on

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.840 
roller and I'm just going to work on
there<00:03:09.540> because<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:10.050> this<00:03:10.500> pendant<00:03:11.459> frame<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
there because the this pendant frame the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.670 
there because the this pendant frame the
bail<00:03:12.030> extends<00:03:12.690> out<00:03:12.840> behind

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
bail extends out behind

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.580 
bail extends out behind
so<00:03:14.129> I<00:03:14.159> just<00:03:14.400> need<00:03:14.549> to<00:03:14.670> make<00:03:14.819> it<00:03:14.879> flat<00:03:15.319> then<00:03:16.319> all

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
so I just need to make it flat then all

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.259 
so I just need to make it flat then all
I'm<00:03:16.709> going<00:03:16.890> to<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.189> is<00:03:17.519> I'm<00:03:17.700> going<00:03:17.849> to<00:03:17.909> add<00:03:18.090> the
