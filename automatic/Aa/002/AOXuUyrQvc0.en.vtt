00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
the vicinity of a lot of other specters

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.790 
the vicinity of a lot of other specters
then<00:01:13.000> everything<00:01:13.600> inside<00:01:14.020> up<00:01:14.200> since<00:01:14.470> he<00:01:14.530> will

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
then everything inside up since he will

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.380 
then everything inside up since he will
be<00:01:14.950> half<00:01:15.130> as<00:01:15.250> well<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:15.759> if<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:16.030> have<00:01:16.180> one

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
be half as well so if you have one

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.359 
be half as well so if you have one
Specter<00:01:16.810> then<00:01:17.259> you<00:01:17.440> can<00:01:17.560> have<00:01:17.650> like<00:01:17.830> two<00:01:18.340> or

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
Specter then you can have like two or

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.219 
Specter then you can have like two or
three<00:01:18.490> following<00:01:19.300> around<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:19.869> can<00:01:19.960> become

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
three following around so you can become

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.570 
three following around so you can become
kind<00:01:20.410> of<00:01:20.470> perspective<00:01:20.710> on<00:01:21.130> stuff<00:01:21.340> like<00:01:21.369> that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
kind of perspective on stuff like that
