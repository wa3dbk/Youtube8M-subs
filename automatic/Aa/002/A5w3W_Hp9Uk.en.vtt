00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.340
 good afternoon designers 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.619
 lovers 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:25.150
 who spend their free time 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:29.890
 on the invention we ask attention for 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:35.470
 separating the grains from the cobs is composed as 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:39.720
 seen at home guys have barrels 100 liter 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:41.790
 which is bolted using 3 bolts and 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:47.559
 Based later I will show 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:51.540
 two and two kilowatts below one and a half thousand 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.340
 revolutions and two pulleys that reduce 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.989
 turnovers 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.239
 about three times that is one and a half thousand 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:06.180
 a method with a turn a little further all 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.729
 him in a barrel like this I took off 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.830
 devices that make pupils 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.550
 actually one you are a slave on the top 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:21.539
 and it turned out such a device below 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:24.970
 as you can see the disk which installed the chips 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:30.270
 diameter to children is at 10 on a lathe 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:34.569
 sharpened and between these types 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:40.590
 19 and so it is clear that the bottom is 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:40.590
 engine skills and currency 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.760
 1 4 1 3 roughly a profile belt and 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.680
 a switch on the other side which 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.280
 the capacitor is running 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.920
 device from the mains 220 volts therefore 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.970
 engine power is about one and a half 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.260
 kilowatt loading is done with 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:16.020
 using a drill for the sake of up to half a bag of video 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.490
 have you seen this device working 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:25.500
 in about one to two minutes a floor 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:29.280
 bag in one or two minutes if more than half 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.600
 I always get a little bag 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.830
 longer does not always work pulls 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:42.620
 engine nude your attention given 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.620
 device in operation 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.200
 not 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.639
 but
