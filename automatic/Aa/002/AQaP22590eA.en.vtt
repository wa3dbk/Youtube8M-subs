00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello, I am Vladimir, and this is the fifth 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.730
 release of my video blog 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 jubal bushcraft today january 6 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:17.660
 unstable then frost to minus 25 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:20.910
 now small river to zero 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:26.600
 barely crusted ice but ice 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.600
 fragile I give a little fell here 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:39.010
 of snow 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:40.480
 knee-deep I'm now about 80 kilometers 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.250
 from the nearest town 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:50.230
 large from Saratov so let's see what 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.290
 here you can eat such a winter forest 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.590
 delicious 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:01.560
 so the first luck dried leaves 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.560
 nettle stalks naturally attached 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.320
 just a priceless find for those who 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.880
 lost in the woods 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.220
 their nutrition is beyond praise 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.220
 find banter of course not well in a pot with 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.290
 meat I would certainly add them for 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.290
 lack of potatoes but no more 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.909
 and again luck has smiled on us every 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.909
 a tree in this forest is covered 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.250
 thin layer 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.469
 frozen lichen from it can 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.240
 cook excellent teems how do you 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:57.159
 Landi and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.939
 sorry only nutritional value and yet 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.569
 here to aim for zero but anyway 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.569
 nicely 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.340
 almost ready and shelter 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.920
 and some little thing already lives here 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.519
 I went somewhere around half a kilometer 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:48.469
 through the snowy winter forest 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:55.420
 I'll tell you none even the fattest 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:55.420
 lichen to me after this does not help 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.290
 let and not the first time winter forest 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.560
 but every such trip is an invaluable experience. 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:36.489
 and understanding that 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:39.610
 Russia has a winter in the woods without equipment and 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:44.470
 food supply for all this time which 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.280
 planning to search here 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.280
 get down 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.900
 it will happen whether you like it or not 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.990
 Especially for those who refused 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.990
 from animal food 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.879
 and now I'll show you the nutritional one 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.879
 what can you find in the winter forest 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:20.120
 this is terrifying 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:20.120
 prickly shrub is a prune 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.970
 it still has berries and frost 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:36.910
 have u absolutely impossible too 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.910
 viscous but successively cold 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.620
 substances responsible for viscosity 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.020
 goes into carbohydrates 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.970
 we become less edible 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:55.090
 savory no you do not think a little 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:59.670
 edible calorie and is according to 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:05.260
 to different sources from 43 to 57 somewhere 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:12.910
 calories per 100 grams has 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:19.650
 holding action well in relation to 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:23.940
 Of course the intestines have a lot of grain 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.940
 here I am not on it is not very 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.940
 Now I will try this wonderful gift 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.940
 of nature 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.040
 inside the bone is like a cherry 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.210
 excuse me 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.830
 cardboard thread who tried 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.449
 mad tilde 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.830
 it would turn plum wild taste cardboard 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:18.990
 horror, I probably would be better lichens here 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.930
 how did this release turn out to 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.940
 grandma auto 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:28.710
 I certainly did not show you such kosher 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:35.180
 things like birch birch bark and 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:36.390
 limes there is still a very nutritious thing 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:45.710
 needles 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:45.710
 for example, but I think you caught the point 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.520
 I walked about a kilometer u got so 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.680
 someone worked all day 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:07:03.350
 a loader but I know what it is just 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:03.350
 and now about a kilometer ago 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:15.830
 in short, there is nothing to do here without equipment with 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:19.250
 delve into everyone with the last good luck 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.250
 all good
