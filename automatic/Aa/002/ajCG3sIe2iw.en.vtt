in<00:00:03.929> just<00:00:04.560> about<00:00:04.950> one<00:00:05.310> more<00:00:06.210> click<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:07.710> will

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
in just about one more click you will

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.250 
in just about one more click you will
recognize<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:08.940> organ<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.690> if<00:00:09.990> you

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
recognize what this organ is if you

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.009 
recognize what this organ is if you
haven't<00:00:10.559> already<00:00:11.030> if<00:00:12.030> your<00:00:12.269> eyes<00:00:12.480> are<00:00:12.780> good

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
haven't already if your eyes are good

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.660 
haven't already if your eyes are good
enough<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.620> picking<00:00:13.980> up<00:00:14.160> all<00:00:14.340> these<00:00:14.490> little

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
enough to be picking up all these little

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.750 
enough to be picking up all these little
ball<00:00:15.030> as<00:00:15.299> as<00:00:15.480> glomeruli<00:00:16.410> then<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.400> already

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
ball as as glomeruli then you already

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.359 
ball as as glomeruli then you already
know<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.240> we're<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> kidney<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.920> so<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
know that we're in the kidney and so you

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.550 
know that we're in the kidney and so you
could<00:00:20.609> see<00:00:20.850> glomeruli<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.230> could<00:00:22.380> see

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
could see glomeruli and you could see

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.529 
could see glomeruli and you could see
tubules<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.490> can<00:00:23.640> see<00:00:23.760> tubules<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
tubules and you can see tubules in the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.920 
tubules and you can see tubules in the
collecting<00:00:25.080> system<00:00:26.090> but<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.449> first<00:00:27.720> thing

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
collecting system but the first thing

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.679 
collecting system but the first thing
that<00:00:27.960> might<00:00:28.410> hit<00:00:28.650> your<00:00:28.830> eye<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:30.060> within

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
that might hit your eye is that within

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.819 
that might hit your eye is that within
the<00:00:30.810> area<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.769> predominantly<00:00:32.550> tubular

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
the area which is predominantly tubular

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.549 
the area which is predominantly tubular
perhaps<00:00:34.829> inside<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.820> medullary<00:00:36.480> inside<00:00:37.380> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
perhaps inside of a medullary inside the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.490 
perhaps inside of a medullary inside the
medulla<00:00:38.149> inside<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.270> deep<00:00:39.570> within<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.020> pyramid

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
medulla inside of deep within a pyramid

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.350 
medulla inside of deep within a pyramid
you<00:00:40.530> see<00:00:40.920> little<00:00:41.629> irregular<00:00:42.629> areas<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.530> well

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
you see little irregular areas as well

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.750 
you see little irregular areas as well
and<00:00:45.360> when<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> look<00:00:45.930> closely<00:00:46.289> at<00:00:46.590> these<00:00:47.190> areas

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and when you look closely at these areas

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.279 
and when you look closely at these areas
like<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.750> here<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.820> here

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
like here here here here here here here

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.600 
like here here here here here here here
relative<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.980> normal<00:00:53.399> surrounding

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
relative to the normal surrounding

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.360 
relative to the normal surrounding
tubules<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.199> first<00:00:55.469> thing<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.100> notice

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
tubules the first thing that you notice

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.580 
tubules the first thing that you notice
is<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.980> they<00:00:58.980> may<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.399> tubules<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
is that they may be tubules but you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.500 
is that they may be tubules but you
can't<00:01:01.859> really<00:01:02.039> make<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.609> their<00:01:02.850> cytoplasm

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
can't really make out their cytoplasm

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.920 
can't really make out their cytoplasm
and<00:01:04.019> nuclei<00:01:04.409> very<00:01:04.979> well<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.510> in

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and nuclei very well like you can in

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.929 
and nuclei very well like you can in
this<00:01:07.110> tubules<00:01:07.830> surrounding<00:01:08.549> them

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
this tubules surrounding them

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.929 
this tubules surrounding them
these<00:01:09.479> are<00:01:09.720> necrotic<00:01:10.229> tubules<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.610> isn't

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
these are necrotic tubules this isn't

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.480 
these are necrotic tubules this isn't
that<00:01:12.000> blood<00:01:12.619> it<00:01:13.619> doesn't<00:01:14.010> look<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.250> blood

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that blood it doesn't look like blood

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.490 
that blood it doesn't look like blood
but<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.180> about<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.630> red<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.110> blood

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
but it's about as red as blood

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.640 
but it's about as red as blood
these<00:01:17.159> are<00:01:17.369> necrotic<00:01:18.049> individual<00:01:19.049> tubules

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
these are necrotic individual tubules

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.560 
these are necrotic individual tubules
and<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.970> they're<00:01:21.420> all

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and now that you know that they're all

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.749 
and now that you know that they're all
over<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> place<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.560> they<00:01:22.680> represent<00:01:23.280> all<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
over the place and they represent all of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.010 
over the place and they represent all of
these<00:01:23.990> areas<00:01:25.040> within<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.340> medulla<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:27.810> might

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
these areas within the medulla you might

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350 
these areas within the medulla you might
go<00:01:28.170> out<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.860> cortex<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.329> a

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
go out to the cortex and what you see a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.090 
go out to the cortex and what you see a
good<00:01:30.689> number<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:33.170> glomeruli<00:01:34.170> as<00:01:34.470> well<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
good number of glomeruli as well and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.780 
good number of glomeruli as well and
look<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.549> some<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.759> those<00:01:36.000> tubules<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.790> you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
look at some of those tubules and you

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.600 
look at some of those tubules and you
can<00:01:38.939> see<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> glomerulus<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:41.159> could<00:01:41.340> see

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
can see a glomerulus here you could see

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.770 
can see a glomerulus here you could see
some<00:01:42.409> tubules<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:44.119> even<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.450> power

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
some tubules here even at this power

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.270 
some tubules here even at this power
what<00:01:46.170> you're<00:01:46.350> wondering<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.070> could

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
what you're wondering if you could

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.620 
what you're wondering if you could
discern<00:01:48.110> nuclei<00:01:49.110> or<00:01:49.560> nuts<00:01:50.060> no<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.119> really

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
discern nuclei or nuts no you really

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.289 
discern nuclei or nuts no you really
can't<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:53.009> could<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.430> completely<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
can't you could see completely the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.590 
can't you could see completely the
nuclei<00:01:54.720> within<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.950> within<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:57.060> but

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
nuclei within here and within here but

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.990 
nuclei within here and within here but
look<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.140> tubules<00:01:58.680> probably<00:01:59.280> proximal

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
look at these tubules probably proximal

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.560 
look at these tubules probably proximal
tubules<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:01.110> can't<00:02:01.380> see<00:02:01.790> nuclei<00:02:02.790> at<00:02:03.090> all<00:02:03.299> and

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
tubules you can't see nuclei at all and

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.810 
tubules you can't see nuclei at all and
furthermore<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.320> cytoplasm<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.490> lot

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
furthermore the cytoplasm is a lot

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.210 
furthermore the cytoplasm is a lot
redder<00:02:06.540> than<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> should<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:07.409> these<00:02:08.009> are

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
redder than it should be these are

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.570 
redder than it should be these are
necrotic<00:02:08.720> tubules<00:02:09.720> as<00:02:09.989> well<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
necrotic tubules as well in here is a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.150 
necrotic tubules as well in here is a
part<00:02:11.940> of

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
part of

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.700 
part of
to<00:02:12.280> bill<00:02:12.550> where<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.270> could<00:02:13.420> at<00:02:13.600> least<00:02:13.710> see

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
to bill where you could at least see

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.130 
to bill where you could at least see
some<00:02:15.010> residual<00:02:15.520> cells<00:02:15.910> but<00:02:16.510> almost<00:02:16.870> all<00:02:17.110> of

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
some residual cells but almost all of

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.500 
some residual cells but almost all of
this<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.590> bill<00:02:17.920> in<00:02:18.370> almost<00:02:18.760> all<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.210> one<00:02:19.480> is
