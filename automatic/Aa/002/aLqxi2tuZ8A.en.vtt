 telephone 67 3026 2680 as a way of 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.519
 contribute to the choice of vehicles and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.660
 machines that will be part of your day 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.030
 A day in the woods 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.410
 we created this year the test frame 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.140
 forest drive 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.540
 our first report for two 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.030
 car show novelties 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.489
 today we are going to literally test a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.950
 a truck that is widely used by 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.850
 forestry sector due to its robustness and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.489
 quality 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.390
 I'm talking about the mitsubishi l200 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.770
 outdoor 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.770
 Let's see how the test went. 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.070
 for our first test drive 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.229
 we chose to borrow the vehicle 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.400
 a company that has always been a 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.590
 forest panel 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.180
 the concessionaire hc vehicles in the field 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.180
 great mato grosso do sul 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.360
 the owner and the project is that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.400
 personally deliver the truck l200 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.450
 billboard for our first test 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.450
 forest drive 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.450
 the first sensation when driving is that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.940
 we are really piloting a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.729
 pickup truck holds firm our lack of 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.830
 fast and very robust responses that 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.289
 gives us a lot of security 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.020
 model has engine says vgt of eight 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.899
 easy select four 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.179
 four that allows quick coupling up to 100 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.270
 kilometers per hour and immobilizer 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.729
 engine differential lock brakes with 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.670
 abs total load capacity up to 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.100
 1800 lbs green glasses headlights 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.239
 halogen air conditioning and latch 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.980
 central electric 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.320
 but as the proposal of the forest panel 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.630
 is that the test drive be done with a 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.370
 producer so that the response comes 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.320
 who will actually use the vehicle 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.600
 your day to day we choose the 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.820
 cattle rancher and partner of the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.760
 brown river ribs stay in the valley 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.739
 owner of a truck 42 stay 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.660
 did not feel much difference when 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.549
 pickup truck drawn mainly on 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.150
 sand road that leads to their 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.150
 property 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.930
 but the test drive was also made in the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.240
 very busy asphalted road where 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.490
 every mile required a march 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.010
 different for both 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.780
 with the speed recovery were 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.090
 more than 100 kilometers 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.850
 between eucalyptus plantations along 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.030
 of br 262 connecting large field to three 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.030
 lagoons 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.989

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.420

 you have an autobahn net and no tracing 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.230
 It is much difference between a trace is 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.439
 a hot swiss antics has now 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.010
