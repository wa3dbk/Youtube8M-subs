floor or hiding them away in their hard
cases<00:00:52.670> I<00:00:53.019> used<00:00:54.019> these<00:00:54.320> guitar<00:00:54.859> holders<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.879> put

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
cases I used these guitar holders to put

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.209 
cases I used these guitar holders to put
them<00:00:56.270> up<00:00:56.359> on<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.570> wall<00:00:56.750> and<00:00:56.960> here's<00:00:57.710> where<00:00:58.039> the

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
them up on the wall and here's where the

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.520 
them up on the wall and here's where the
problem<00:00:58.370> comes<00:00:58.850> in<00:00:59.120> if<00:00:59.629> I<00:00:59.750> just<00:00:59.930> want<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.199> screw

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
problem comes in if I just want to screw

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.860 
problem comes in if I just want to screw
this<00:01:00.559> holder<00:01:01.250> anywhere<00:01:01.940> on<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:02.239> wall<00:01:02.539> and

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
this holder anywhere on this wall and

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.200 
this holder anywhere on this wall and
then<00:01:03.350> hang<00:01:03.590> a<00:01:03.620> guitar<00:01:03.980> on<00:01:04.009> it<00:01:04.339> I<00:01:04.550> would<00:01:04.940> take<00:01:05.149> a

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
then hang a guitar on it I would take a

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.930 
then hang a guitar on it I would take a
huge<00:01:05.810> risk<00:01:05.869> of<00:01:06.470> breaking<00:01:07.310> part<00:01:07.640> of<00:01:07.820> the

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
huge risk of breaking part of the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.290 
huge risk of breaking part of the
drywall<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.710> holder<00:01:10.399> with<00:01:10.429> guitar<00:01:11.090> would

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
drywall and the holder with guitar would

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.080 
drywall and the holder with guitar would
come<00:01:11.570> crashing<00:01:12.020> down<00:01:12.190> now<00:01:13.190> to<00:01:13.250> avoid<00:01:13.670> that<00:01:13.940> you

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
come crashing down now to avoid that you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.690 
come crashing down now to avoid that you
can<00:01:14.240> always<00:01:14.450> find<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:15.140> crossbar<00:01:15.920> behind<00:01:16.490> the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700
