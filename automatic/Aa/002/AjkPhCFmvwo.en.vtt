truth and so the concept of self love

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.150 
truth and so the concept of self love
should<00:03:23.670> be<00:03:23.880> an<00:03:24.060> easy<00:03:24.270> one<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.900> grasp<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:25.920> as

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
should be an easy one to grasp but as

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.860 
should be an easy one to grasp but as
you<00:03:26.370> have<00:03:26.550> been<00:03:26.730> well<00:03:26.910> trained<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.450> think<00:03:27.480> that

that no matter how hard you try you will

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.000 
that no matter how hard you try you will
never<00:03:32.850> be<00:03:33.330> good<00:03:33.540> enough<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:34.200> is<00:03:34.440> indeed<00:03:34.620> almost

never be good enough it is indeed almost

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.730 
never be good enough it is indeed almost
