00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
for you can just like search two parts

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
for you can just like search two parts
yourselves<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.260> get<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.649> nearest<00:00:43.860> or

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
yourselves and get like the nearest or

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.959 
yourselves and get like the nearest or
closest<00:00:45.350> similar<00:00:46.350> parts<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.460> anyway<00:00:47.760> we'll

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
closest similar parts but anyway we'll

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.520 
closest similar parts but anyway we'll
just<00:00:48.000> move<00:00:48.420> straight<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:48.809> into<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.200> system

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
just move straight on into the system

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.389 
just move straight on into the system
i'm<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> try<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.129> make<00:00:50.190> these<00:00:50.340> videos

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
i'm going to try and make these videos

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.369 
i'm going to try and make these videos
quite<00:00:51.120> short<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.420> snappy<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.199> guys

quite short and snappy so you guys
actually<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.949> enjoy<00:00:53.910> them<00:00:54.090> watch<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> whole

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
actually like enjoy them watch the whole

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.130 
actually like enjoy them watch the whole
thing<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.930> such<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:56.610> cpu<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.719> intel

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
thing and such so my cpu is the intel

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.189 
thing and such so my cpu is the intel
core<00:00:58.320> i5<00:00:58.640> 45<00:00:59.640> 90<00:01:00.329> that's<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.660> three<00:01:00.870> point<00:01:01.140> three

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
core i5 45 90 that's a three point three

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.590 
core i5 45 90 that's a three point three
gigahertz<00:01:01.649> quad-core<00:01:01.890> processor<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.149> can't

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
gigahertz quad-core processor it can't

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.370 
gigahertz quad-core processor it can't
be<00:01:03.690> overclocked<00:01:04.379> unfortunately<00:01:05.420> but<00:01:06.420> it's

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
be overclocked unfortunately but it's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
be overclocked unfortunately but it's
still<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.680> very<00:01:07.979> fast<00:01:08.340> processor<00:01:08.850> quad<00:01:09.180> core<00:01:09.420> is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
still a very fast processor quad core is

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.000 
still a very fast processor quad core is
more<00:01:09.780> than<00:01:09.930> enough<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.439> pretty<00:01:10.680> much<00:01:10.740> any

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
more than enough for pretty much any

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.820 
more than enough for pretty much any
game<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.510> will<00:01:12.630> work<00:01:12.900> perfectly<00:01:13.619> fine

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
game really it will work perfectly fine

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.940 
game really it will work perfectly fine
i<00:01:13.890> mean<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.310> quite<00:01:14.549> like<00:01:14.580> some<00:01:14.880> smoker

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
i mean it's not quite like some smoker

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.850 
i mean it's not quite like some smoker
4670k<00:01:16.950> or<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> 469<00:01:17.759> TK<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.659> overclockable<00:01:19.320> but

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
4670k or a 469 TK not overclockable but

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.469 
4670k or a 469 TK not overclockable but
it<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.220> still<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.460> very<00:01:20.729> fast<00:01:21.090> three<00:01:21.270> point

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
it is still a very fast three point

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.300 
it is still a very fast three point
three<00:01:21.509> gigahertz<00:01:21.960> quad-core<00:01:22.310> processor

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
three gigahertz quad-core processor

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.830 
three gigahertz quad-core processor
which<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.759> more<00:01:23.939> than<00:01:23.970> enough<00:01:24.299> for<00:01:24.420> gaming<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
which is more than enough for gaming and

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.940 
which is more than enough for gaming and
it's<00:01:25.229> very<00:01:25.590> very<00:01:26.100> good<00:01:26.400> price<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.619> i'm<00:01:28.619> going

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
it's very very good price and i'm going

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.440 
it's very very good price and i'm going
to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.130> pairing<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:29.909> an<00:01:30.180> asrock

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
to be pairing that up with an asrock

on pretty much max settings i mean i do

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.930 
on pretty much max settings i mean i do
some<00:02:50.860> games<00:02:51.070> i<00:02:51.190> do<00:02:51.280> have<00:02:51.370> to<00:02:51.520> turn<00:02:51.700> like

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
some games i do have to turn like

shadows down slightly or something like
that<00:02:54.490> just<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.300> get<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.959> 60<00:02:56.830> FPS<00:02:57.520> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
that just to get like that 60 FPS and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.060 
that just to get like that 60 FPS and
over<00:02:58.209> but<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.050> will<00:02:59.200> run<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.500> pretty<00:02:59.740> much<00:02:59.860> all

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
personal recommendation for me I do

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.260 
personal recommendation for me I do
personally<00:03:13.870> have<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.440> asus<00:03:14.680> version<00:03:15.430> but<00:03:16.030> I

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
personally have the asus version but I

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.300 
personally have the asus version but I
had<00:03:16.600> an<00:03:16.690> XFX<00:03:16.959> graphics<00:03:17.470> cut<00:03:17.620> before<00:03:17.769> and<00:03:18.190> it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
had an XFX graphics cut before and it

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.180 
had an XFX graphics cut before and it
served<00:03:18.700> me<00:03:18.790> beautifully<00:03:19.720> until<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.650> fam<00:03:20.920> went

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
served me beautifully until the fam went

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.820 
served me beautifully until the fam went
in<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.580> but<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.239> could<00:03:23.170> have<00:03:23.290> had<00:03:23.410> it<00:03:23.440> covered<00:03:23.680> by

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
in it but I could have had it covered by

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.530 
in it but I could have had it covered by
warranty<00:03:24.160> but<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.850> end<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.060> just<00:03:25.239> ended<00:03:25.450> up

warranty but in the end I just ended up

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.360 
warranty but in the end I just ended up
giving<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.959> away<00:03:26.050> to<00:03:26.140> a<00:03:26.320> friend<00:03:26.680> because<00:03:27.160> I

into<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.710> cost<00:04:46.040> because<00:04:46.540> it<00:04:47.540> is<00:04:48.260> about<00:04:48.470> 50

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
into the cost because it is about 50

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.310 
into the cost because it is about 50

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
pounds for an operating system now so I

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.040 
pounds for an operating system now so I
