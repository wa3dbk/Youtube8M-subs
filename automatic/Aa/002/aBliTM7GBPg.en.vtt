00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.260 
any water I pull mine for about 15
minutes<00:04:27.180> then<00:04:27.740> after<00:04:28.740> another<00:04:28.949> 5<00:04:29.759> 10<00:04:30.000> minutes

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
minutes then after another 5 10 minutes

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.210 
minutes then after another 5 10 minutes
or<00:04:30.330> so<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.479> add<00:04:30.720> like<00:04:31.229> a<00:04:31.259> half<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.530> pop-can<00:04:32.039> of

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
or so I add like a half a pop-can of

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.850 
or so I add like a half a pop-can of
water<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:34.199> then<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.440> little<00:04:34.650> bit<00:04:34.800> more

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
water to it and then a little bit more

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.439 
water to it and then a little bit more
over<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.550> course<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.880> about<00:04:35.970> an<00:04:36.150> hour<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:36.419> a

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
over the course of about an hour and a

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.760 
over the course of about an hour and a
half<00:04:36.539> these<00:04:36.750> have<00:04:36.900> been<00:04:36.990> in<00:04:37.139> this<00:04:37.229> bag<00:04:37.440> for

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
half these have been in this bag for

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.950 
half these have been in this bag for
about<00:04:37.800> probably<00:04:38.280> two<00:04:39.150> hours<00:04:39.509> and<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.690> finally

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
about probably two hours and I finally

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.200 
about probably two hours and I finally
just<00:04:40.110> filled<00:04:40.710> it<00:04:40.979> up<00:04:41.099> but<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.639> don't<00:04:41.849> start

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
just filled it up but you don't start

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.330 
just filled it up but you don't start
adding<00:04:42.509> water<00:04:42.720> in<00:04:42.960> my<00:04:43.110> opinion<00:04:43.590> until<00:04:43.770> the

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
adding water in my opinion until the

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.680 
adding water in my opinion until the
temperatures<00:04:44.729> are<00:04:44.849> the<00:04:44.880> same<00:04:44.970> in<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.509> out<00:04:45.569> of

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
temperatures are the same in and out of

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.180 
temperatures are the same in and out of
the<00:04:45.750> bag<00:04:45.900> then<00:04:46.229> you<00:04:46.259> add<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.620> different<00:04:46.919> water

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
the bag then you add a different water

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.800 
the bag then you add a different water
chemistry<00:04:47.580> from<00:04:47.849> other<00:04:48.000> thing<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:48.630> here's

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
chemistry from other thing so here's

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.629 
chemistry from other thing so here's
what<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.050> do<00:04:49.319> though<00:04:49.560> and<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:50.159> is<00:04:50.280> important

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
and I'm just gonna go ahead and say it

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.939
