00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.769
 there are very good today to 0 and we are in another 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.859
 minecraft video today is a video of 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.420
 mods and today it touches the mods streiter 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.730
 what he basically does is 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.839
 transfer inventory items to 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.400
 chest or from the chest to the inventory 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:28.249
 ie that instantly makes the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.189
 instant and good well here we have 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:34.370
 some chests here the first but 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.710
 first of all I want to teach then here 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.290
 normally to transfer things is 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.840
 do clicks or if we keep the 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.810
 shift on the keyboard and we click on it then 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.790
 to objects and it transfers like this but 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.800
 there are no buttons so we can 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.430
 transfer for example the entire line 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.150
 here or all this to the chest but it was good 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.330
 in this mod 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.540
 As you can see, there is the take out button and the 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.950
 button plays though means then put 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.750
 all pam 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.850
 we click and save a lot 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.549
 time in these things as you see for 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.590
 put here I have the same thing for 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.899
 catch and good 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.700
 line below because it also fills up 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.789
 the inventory fills it but the line of 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.860
 down but good serves the same we can 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.230
 take or leave things 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.360
 The good thing about this is that in the 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.000
 servers for example hunger 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.770
 games the hunger games there are many 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.510
 chests and such and you always have to have 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.510
 Hurry to catch everything because more than 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.180
 we would take take out from one chest to the other 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.580
 chest and so quickly because we take 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.740
 all things while the others 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.990
 came clicks clicks clicks clicks as 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.900
 we could do this 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.280
 enough things as you see and then more 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.619
 to equip and good the truth is that 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.930
 this serves very well already then if we want 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.840
 leave all things well place out and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.830
 we leave them or we take them, come on, this is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.920
 basically to save time 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.670
 let's say because time is very valuable 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.550
 and in hunger games or things like that 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.209
 style in competitions every second is 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.100
 very important so well that was the 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.260
 truth is that all this was very fast 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.260
 the explanation and now we go to the tutorial 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.269
 good the installation will be very easy as 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.650
 I always say it and well the first thing 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.450
 we do is go 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.480

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.120

 we can go out and this file well what 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.269
 we extract in 132 ryder in 12 we go for 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.299
 the version that we have here we have another 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.819
 folder that is from minecraft and good at 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.889
 she is the archives what 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.260
 next thing we do is go to the 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.799
 minecraft folder folder min folder 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.460
 we open the minecraft already with linking 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:32.060
 for example 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.670
 here we have the main kraft as well 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.650
 Normally when it's clean 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.739
 we delete the meta folder first 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:46.150
 and then we select all the files 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:49.090
 from charles ryder we selected them and 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.700
 we put here in the minecraft art in the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.040
 add and replace mode we give 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.420
 accept here has gotten everything 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.140
 we can correctly erase the two 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.540
 things and 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.280

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.630

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:14.250

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.700
