00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:10.020
 thank you master sheriff has a second 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.020
 name of a hamamelis report very well 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.760
 I would like to talk to you about the advice 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.439
 I do not know what you mean, I know that 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.990
 Founding families have a council 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.700
 secret then you will know that it is not spoken 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.070
 of the subject with people who are not 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.660
 I know that I refuse to be part of 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.310
 but because he wanted a life far from 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.489
 this town not because I did not believe in it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.870
 I know that vampires exist and you have 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.870
 two living in front of your noses 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.690
 and you have 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.920
 Damon and Stefan Salvatore 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.000
 that's impossible 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.460
 I know damon salvatore has done a lot 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.910
 for the people I know it costs to digest it not 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.520
 I have not seen him kill vampires since 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.770
 well just follow the iris advice when 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.230
 the attacks began when they arrived at the 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.559
 village the said saviors come out of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.430

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.730

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.230
 I do not know what you're surprised you knew that 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.800
 It was inevitable 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.800

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.450
 your mother knows what you are 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.500
 I'd love to tell you 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:13.040
 do not be silly, it does not cost me anything to kill her 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.040
 I can with you, we bet, yes, according 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.840

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.770
 against demon stefan salvatore 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.340
 I thought you would be glad if I told you 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.870
 that you do not approach them that takes us 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.800
 I do not want you to be distracted, you have to 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.800
 find the stone 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.590
 and I have it
