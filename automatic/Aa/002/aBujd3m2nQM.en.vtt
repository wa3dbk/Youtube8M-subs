00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
submarines because I'm relying on the

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.210 
submarines because I'm relying on the
epoxy<00:04:23.230> dark<00:04:23.410> ship<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:25.320> right<00:04:26.320> now<00:04:26.500> my<00:04:26.530> defense

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
epoxy dark ship and right now my defense

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.580 
epoxy dark ship and right now my defense
is<00:04:27.460> way<00:04:27.700> more<00:04:27.880> expensive<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.690> can<00:04:29.020> sell<00:04:29.320> off

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
is way more expensive I can sell off

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.220 
is way more expensive I can sell off
more<00:04:29.830> than<00:04:29.920> he<00:04:30.100> can<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.760> we<00:04:31.570> have<00:04:31.690> very

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
more than he can and we have very

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.190 
more than he can and we have very
similar<00:04:32.470> eco<00:04:32.980> so<00:04:33.670> it's<00:04:34.390> really<00:04:34.690> just<00:04:34.870> whoever

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
similar eco so it's really just whoever

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.680 
similar eco so it's really just whoever
dies<00:04:35.410> first<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.130> he's<00:04:37.120> selling<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.480> farm

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
dies first and he's selling the farm

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.720 
dies first and he's selling the farm
there<00:04:38.020> so<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:38.890> means<00:04:39.220> he's<00:04:39.340> probably<00:04:39.430> in<00:04:39.670> the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
there so that means he's probably in the

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.990 
there so that means he's probably in the
brush<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.300> he<00:04:41.020> sends<00:04:41.320> to<00:04:41.500> be<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.680> piece<00:04:41.980> so<00:04:42.430> I'm

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
brush and he sends to be a piece so I'm

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.910 
brush and he sends to be a piece so I'm
not<00:04:43.360> worrying<00:04:43.690> that<00:04:43.900> much<00:04:44.110> i<00:04:44.290> had<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.500> apology

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
not worrying that much i had the apology

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.760 
not worrying that much i had the apology
Guard<00:04:45.100> ship<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:45.750> one<00:04:46.750> hit<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.020> allergy<00:04:47.500> and

Guard ship and one hit the allergy and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.530 
Guard ship and one hit the allergy and
that<00:04:48.160> rush<00:04:48.400> will<00:04:48.610> be<00:04:48.760> defeated<00:04:49.470> so<00:04:51.540> right

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
that rush will be defeated so right

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.080 
that rush will be defeated so right
right<00:04:53.020> now<00:04:53.170> it's<00:04:53.350> just<00:04:53.500> outlasting<00:04:54.490> him<00:04:54.610> so

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
right now it's just outlasting him so
