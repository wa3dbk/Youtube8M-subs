just<00:01:59.310> maybe<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.609> slight<00:01:59.999> bulge<00:02:00.329> right<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:01.049> on

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
just maybe a slight bulge right here on

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.260 
just maybe a slight bulge right here on
the<00:02:01.289> outside<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:01.979> that's<00:02:02.579> because<00:02:02.820> that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
the outside of it that's because that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.760 
the outside of it that's because that
long<00:02:03.600> head<00:02:03.950> tendon<00:02:04.950> was<00:02:05.939> cut<00:02:06.359> and<00:02:06.770> reattached

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
long head tendon was cut and reattached

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.899 
long head tendon was cut and reattached
further<00:02:08.550> down<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.090> arm<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:10.500> been

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
further down the arm so it's been

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.160 
further down the arm so it's been
shortened<00:02:11.909> a<00:02:11.940> little<00:02:12.239> bit<00:02:12.360> therefore<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
shortened a little bit therefore the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.740 
shortened a little bit therefore the
belly<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.620> muscle<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.580> going<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.970> be

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
belly of the muscle is just going to be

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.570 
belly of the muscle is just going to be
a<00:02:15.780> little<00:02:16.050> more

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
a little more

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.610 
a little more
noticeable<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.450> guess<00:02:18.630> further<00:02:18.960> down<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.440> arm

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
noticeable I guess further down the arm

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.620 
noticeable I guess further down the arm
I<00:02:20.240> cost<00:02:21.240> us<00:02:21.510> said<00:02:21.750> he<00:02:21.870> had<00:02:22.020> more<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.410> a

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.120 
deformity but my doctor dr. Schaefer he
said<00:02:27.570> I<00:02:27.600> should<00:02:28.020> get<00:02:28.140> full<00:02:28.440> strength<00:02:28.800> you<00:02:29.010> know

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
said I should get full strength you know

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.650 
said I should get full strength you know
of<00:02:29.250> ninety-five<00:02:29.700> hundred<00:02:29.850> percent<00:02:30.360> strength

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
of ninety-five hundred percent strength

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.290 
of ninety-five hundred percent strength
and<00:02:31.130> I'm<00:02:32.130> not<00:02:32.340> too<00:02:32.490> concerned<00:02:32.850> with<00:02:32.940> what<00:02:33.180> it

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
and I'm not too concerned with what it

looks like really as long as I get full

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.740 
looks like really as long as I get full
strength<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.520> know<00:02:35.640> because<00:02:36.000> that's<00:02:36.540> just

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
strength you know because that's just

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.490 
strength you know because that's just
all<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.960> need

luck with things so let me show you now
real<00:02:45.480> quick<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.260> three<00:02:46.470> new<00:02:46.590> exercises

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
real quick the the three new exercises

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.570 
real quick the the three new exercises
I'm<00:02:47.460> doing<00:02:48.110> isometrics<00:02:49.110> okay<00:02:49.580> isometrics

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
I'm doing isometrics okay isometrics

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.920 
I'm doing isometrics okay isometrics
then<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.060> just<00:02:51.270> for<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.450> rotator<00:02:51.840> cuff

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
then this is just for the rotator cuff

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.990 
then this is just for the rotator cuff
muscles<00:02:52.530> okay<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.280> let<00:02:53.460> me<00:02:53.550> show<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.790> what

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
muscles okay so let me show you what

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.880 
muscles okay so let me show you what
those<00:02:54.120> look<00:02:54.390> like

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
those look like

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.260 
those look like
isometric<00:02:55.890> in<00:02:56.400> case<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.730> don't<00:02:56.970> know

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
isometric in case you don't know

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.920 
isometric in case you don't know
isometric<00:02:58.020> means<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:59.340> put<00:03:00.180> tension<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
isometric means you put tension on the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.470 
isometric means you put tension on the
muscle<00:03:01.010> but<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.460> don't<00:03:02.700> move<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.090> muscle

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
muscle but you don't move the muscle

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.540 
muscle but you don't move the muscle
it's<00:03:03.690> stayed<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.440> keep<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.310> tension

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
it's stayed you you keep the tension

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.110 
it's stayed you you keep the tension
tonic<00:03:06.150> or<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.600> in<00:03:06.810> one<00:03:07.110> position<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.820> you're

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
tonic or in in one position so you're

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.420 
tonic or in in one position so you're
not<00:03:09.270> lengthening<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.290> eccentrically<00:03:11.070> and

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
not lengthening it eccentrically and

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.520 
not lengthening it eccentrically and
you're<00:03:11.640> not<00:03:11.820> contracting<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.960> or<00:03:13.050> shorten<00:03:13.410> it

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
you're not contracting it or shorten it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.900 
you're not contracting it or shorten it
concentrically<00:03:14.130> okay

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
concentrically okay

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.290 
concentrically okay
you<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.390> keep<00:03:16.400> constant<00:03:17.400> tension<00:03:17.460> on<00:03:17.940> the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
you just keep constant tension on the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.190 
you just keep constant tension on the
muscles<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.410> first<00:03:19.710> one<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.989> forward<00:03:21.989> if

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
muscles so the first one is forward if

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.470 
muscles so the first one is forward if
flexion<00:03:23.010> basically<00:03:23.489> it's<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:23.820> I'm<00:03:24.090> pushing

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
flexion basically it's just I'm pushing

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.350 
flexion basically it's just I'm pushing
forward<00:03:24.870> I'm<00:03:24.989> I'm<00:03:25.200> pressing<00:03:26.040> into<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.790> bar

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
forward I'm I'm pressing into the bar

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.949 
forward I'm I'm pressing into the bar
here<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.720> hold<00:03:28.140> for<00:03:28.440> one<00:03:28.680> two<00:03:29.280> three<00:03:29.940> four<00:03:30.480> five

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
here I hold for one two three four five

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.890 
here I hold for one two three four five
and<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.470> release<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:32.180> really<00:03:33.180> can't<00:03:33.420> see<00:03:33.690> much

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
and I release you really can't see much

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.370 
and I release you really can't see much
but<00:03:34.530> I'm<00:03:35.070> feeling<00:03:35.550> in<00:03:35.670> the<00:03:35.760> shoulder<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.390> I'm

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
but I'm feeling in the shoulder and I'm

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.860 
but I'm feeling in the shoulder and I'm
doing<00:03:37.709> sets<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.160> ten<00:03:38.370> on<00:03:38.610> these<00:03:38.790> three<00:03:39.300> four

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
doing sets of ten on these three four

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.949 
doing sets of ten on these three four
five<00:03:40.380> okay<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.489> next<00:03:41.700> one<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:41.940> do<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.390> external

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
five okay the next one I do is external

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.260 
five okay the next one I do is external
rotation<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.739> just<00:03:43.980> put<00:03:44.160> my<00:03:44.280> hand<00:03:44.520> on<00:03:44.790> the

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
rotation so I just put my hand on the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.120 
rotation so I just put my hand on the
inside<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.020> bar<00:03:46.230> here<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.739> I'm<00:03:46.830> pressing

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
inside of the bar here and I'm pressing

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.970 
inside of the bar here and I'm pressing
outward<00:03:47.790> one<00:03:48.630> two<00:03:49.200> three<00:03:49.890> four<00:03:50.430> five<00:03:51.050> rest<00:03:52.050> one

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
outward one two three four five rest one

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.330 
outward one two three four five rest one
two<00:03:53.489> three<00:03:54.090> four<00:03:54.630> five<00:03:55.140> rest

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
two three four five rest

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.390 
two three four five rest
I<00:03:56.370> do<00:03:56.670> sets<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.209> ten<00:03:57.420> then<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.470> do<00:03:58.709> internal

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
I do sets of ten then I do internal

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.010 
I do sets of ten then I do internal
rotation<00:03:59.730> so<00:04:00.090> my<00:04:00.209> hand<00:04:00.450> goes<00:04:00.630> here
