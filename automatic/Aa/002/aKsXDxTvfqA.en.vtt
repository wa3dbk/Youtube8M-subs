 video games as you can as you 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.380
 show the images and videos that 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.970
 accompany the news that there is a source 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.220
 a re-registration 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.290
 these virtual reality gloves would be 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.150
 compatible with google glass promising 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.070
 unleash the full potential of this 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.810
 device or it can be used 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.340
 just to surf the net 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.840
 making use of the movement of 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.640
 our hands the truth is that it is one 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.740
 of the complements that more utilities 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 can offer for example to devices 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.620
 as curl 10 but the utilities that are 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.250
 can use in the future are 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.170
 quite broad, even if it's a 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.390
 logically recent project 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.400
 financing will have to wait a bit

 to know how all this progresses 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.910
 technology that without any doubt
