00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
keep up with that yeah the IMAX which is

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.190 
keep up with that yeah the IMAX which is
going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> fit<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.979> against<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.490> minute<00:01:27.200> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
going to fit it against in a minute and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.969 
going to fit it against in a minute and
it's<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.620> to<00:01:28.680> be<00:01:28.800> on<00:01:28.950> where<00:01:29.160> this<00:01:29.250> ladder<00:01:29.520> is

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
it's going to be on where this ladder is

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.090 
it's going to be on where this ladder is
gonna<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.040> on<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.250> base<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:33.830> pretty<00:01:34.830> fair

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
gonna be on that base there pretty fair

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.330 
gonna be on that base there pretty fair
test<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:36.350> looking<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.530> way<00:01:37.710> it's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
test to think looking that way it's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.200 
test to think looking that way it's
going<00:01:38.550> south

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
going south

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.120 
going south
come<00:01:40.200> towards<00:01:40.440> here<00:01:41.030> towards<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.090> UK<00:01:42.420> America

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
come towards here towards the UK America

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.500 
come towards here towards the UK America
and<00:01:44.130> finally<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.580> around<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.910> north<00:01:45.650> or<00:01:46.650> is<00:01:46.890> it

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
and finally go around is north or is it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.510 
and finally go around is north or is it
the<00:01:48.510> IMAX<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:49.229> little<00:01:49.500> bit<00:01:49.619> higher<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:49.950> go<00:01:50.220> south

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
the IMAX a little bit higher to go south

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.340 
the IMAX a little bit higher to go south
however<00:01:51.420> today<00:01:51.690> would<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:51.930> need<00:01:52.140> that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
however today would not need that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.660 
however today would not need that
because<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.770> propagation<00:01:53.190> we've<00:01:53.460> run<00:01:53.580> into

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
because the propagation we've run into

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.700

pretty<00:02:13.140> long<00:02:13.260> piece<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.560> kit<00:02:13.769> I<00:02:14.099> see<00:02:20.629> both

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
pretty long piece of kit I see both

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.259 
pretty long piece of kit I see both
