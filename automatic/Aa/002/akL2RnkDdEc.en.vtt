00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.149
 so that my neck a little people 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.770
 since you are going to be a little dark 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.440
 to offer me applying foundation 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.870
 I already notice that it is not going well 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.070
 it really feels super raven and brush in it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.539
 my left hand is always mine 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.539
 right hand used for lieke 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.860
 ok this really has to 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.860
 and it was so weird 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.450
 it is also not easy it is 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.100
 just i think it will be busy for weeks 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.820
 to the application of foundation 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.820
 to pick up 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.470
 asim b it just doesn't feel true 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.080
 I now feel that I am right now and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:25.610
 can apply because you are with your whole hand 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.610
 are busy with the nl 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.280
 you call when i feel my right hand 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.720
 just use a standard hand that 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.790
 my Paris just nice along 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.700
 be applied and now I have it 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.869
 feeling that I really pieces 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.869
 that I just couldn't reach it 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.620
 so good me anyway 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.820
 I still want a nice tap 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.770
 the family may be super shiny so 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.920
 I'm going to use a powder to 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.920
 Selecting 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:05.759

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:08.299
 system with this feels very very hair 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.299
 bad 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.080
 Yes 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.520
 this time for eyebrows and I think 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.200
 that will be very difficult 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.110
 since I was really precision 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.910
 normally also holding it now i put it 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.910
 in this hall 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.879
 do not refute 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.920
 is really very difficult this is it 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.920
 hardest of so far 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.329
 brought 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.600
 the time of the bronzer just feels whole 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.600
 of course if you go with your hands 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.710

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.710

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.040

 I will now apply eye shadow and me 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.080
 think that will be very difficult 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.900
 but i couldn't ride for my 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.200
 ecopelle or book in the query 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.200
 crease 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.920
 I just get muscle pain Indian hand 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.780
 because you never use 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:46.990

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:46.990

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:04.100
 when we used this flat brush and of course 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.100
 my left hand 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:20.650

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.550

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.480

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.090
