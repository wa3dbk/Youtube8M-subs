inside<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:25.690> other<00:01:25.810> ones<00:01:26.050> I<00:01:26.200> squeezed<00:01:26.530> didn't

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
inside the other ones I squeezed didn't

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.820 
inside the other ones I squeezed didn't
have<00:01:27.010> blood<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.930> he<00:01:28.930> just<00:01:29.140> hadn't<00:01:29.470> taken<00:01:29.620> to

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
have blood and he just hadn't taken to

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.430 
have blood and he just hadn't taken to
me<00:01:29.980> oh<00:01:30.010> okay<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.540> it's<00:01:31.870> okay

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
me oh okay this is the it's okay

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.470 
me oh okay this is the it's okay
but<00:01:32.620> it's<00:01:32.770> just<00:01:32.890> too<00:01:33.130> big<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:33.700> doesn't<00:01:34.060> it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
but it's just too big it just doesn't it

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.450 
but it's just too big it just doesn't it
doesn't<00:01:34.720> look<00:01:34.960> right<00:01:35.170> there's<00:01:35.980> this<00:01:36.190> size

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
doesn't look right there's this size

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.520 
doesn't look right there's this size
smaller<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.330> bands<00:01:37.630> okay<00:01:37.870> to<00:01:38.110> be<00:01:38.320> too

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
smaller that the bands okay to be too

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.380 
smaller that the bands okay to be too
big<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:39.610> not<00:01:39.670> okay<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.150> be<00:01:40.330> too<00:01:40.510> small<00:01:40.870> yep<00:01:41.530> I

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:02:17.400 

don't<00:01:46.390> like<00:01:46.630> them<00:01:46.870> real<00:01:47.080> snug<00:01:47.410> either<00:02:16.410> when

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
don't like them real snug either when

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.850 
don't like them real snug either when
the<00:02:17.940> bird<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:19.120> being<00:02:19.810> caught<00:02:20.140> or<00:02:20.380> handled<00:02:20.770> or

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
the bird is being caught or handled or

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.500 
the bird is being caught or handled or
something<00:02:21.600> they<00:02:22.600> can<00:02:22.810> sense<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.400> somehow

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
something they can sense it somehow

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.510 
something they can sense it somehow
probably<00:02:25.860> physiological<00:02:26.860> change<00:02:27.160> in<00:02:27.400> the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
probably physiological change in the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:38.550 
probably physiological change in the
bird<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:33.519> it's<00:02:33.820> much<00:02:34.000> easier<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.510> put<00:02:34.720> on<00:02:37.560> are

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
bird and it's much easier to put on are

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.020 
bird and it's much easier to put on are
you<00:02:38.650> talking<00:02:38.980> about<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.220> parasites<00:02:39.760> how<00:02:39.940> they

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
you talking about the parasites how they

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.830 
you talking about the parasites how they
just<00:02:40.209> kept<00:02:40.480> yeah<00:02:41.140> yeah<00:02:41.530> yeah<00:02:42.010> yeah<00:02:42.400> they

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
just kept yeah yeah yeah yeah they

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.660 
just kept yeah yeah yeah yeah they
they're<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:43.870> rats<00:02:44.590> in<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.040> sinking<00:02:45.370> ship

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
they're like rats in the sinking ship

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.300 
they're like rats in the sinking ship
they<00:02:46.269> detect<00:02:47.080> something<00:02:47.320> like<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.860> see<00:02:48.100> he's

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
they detect something like I see he's

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.070 
they detect something like I see he's
always<00:02:48.580> coming<00:02:49.180> out<00:02:49.269> here<00:02:49.510> too

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.490 

and<00:02:54.380> they're<00:02:54.830> specific<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:56.290> species<00:02:57.290> to

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
and they're specific to that species to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.700 
and they're specific to that species to
redtail<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.130> these<00:02:58.250> are<00:02:58.460> all<00:02:58.810> red<00:02:59.810> red<00:03:00.080> tail<00:03:02.710> it

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
redtail so these are all red red tail it

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:13.020 
redtail so these are all red red tail it
isn't<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.340> doesn't<00:03:04.790> want<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.090> die<00:03:09.370> inside<00:03:11.410> yeah

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
isn't a doesn't want to die inside yeah

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.460 
isn't a doesn't want to die inside yeah
yeah<00:03:14.030> but<00:03:14.510> well<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.900> only<00:03:15.080> way<00:03:15.170> they're<00:03:15.350> going

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
yeah but well the only way they're going

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.950 
yeah but well the only way they're going
to<00:03:15.530> get<00:03:15.680> passed<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.400> is<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.330> through<00:03:17.780> the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 
to get passed on and is is through the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.010 
to get passed on and is is through the
nest<00:03:18.200> or<00:03:19.190> social<00:03:19.910> interaction<00:03:20.540> with<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.810> same

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
nest or social interaction with the same

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.410 
nest or social interaction with the same
species<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:21.710> try<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.490> makes<00:03:22.760> sense<00:03:23.090> from<00:03:23.330> that

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
species so try it makes sense from that

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.100 
species so try it makes sense from that
evolutionary<00:03:24.230> sense<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.710> does<00:03:24.890> yes<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:26.110> little

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
evolutionary sense it does yes a little

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:56.880 
evolutionary sense it does yes a little
tight

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:32.230 

okay<00:03:57.890> this<00:03:58.400> was<00:03:58.610> also<00:03:59.180> be<00:03:59.390> Seto

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.890 

yes<00:04:33.240> he<00:04:33.720> is

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
yes he is

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.650 
yes he is
feather<00:04:34.380> moist<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.980> play<00:04:35.580> this<00:04:35.730> guy<00:04:35.970> is<00:04:36.030> really

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
feather moist to play this guy is really

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.200

big<00:04:36.930> see<00:04:37.919> there's<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.160> feather<00:04:38.430> amount<00:04:38.790> but

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
big see there's a feather amount but

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.690 
big see there's a feather amount but
