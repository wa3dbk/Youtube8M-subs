00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.419
 and until it boils that it bets so much on 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:06.419
 country 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.940
 hello all kinds of good and today 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.730
 Well, I bring you textures pack for your 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.100
 said master or becomes this these 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.110
 textures are not going to need the blog 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.460
 launcher that is the special thing that 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.619
 I bring today if you wish with block 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.690
 launcher she will leave you in the video 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.240
 something so they can go and visit them like this 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:34.930
 let's go with the first part 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.510
 textures that would be this the pack is called 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.430
 nations and obviously in order I'm going to 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.920
 leave listed each reading pack of 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.570
 textures that I put here numbered for 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.070
 that can be downloaded from the force 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.280
 Suarez 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.650
 then as you can see here that they have 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.020
 action different from the textures pack 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.020
 originals because the truth is not much 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.829
 it's just kind of like 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.670
 shader in which it can be all a little 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.979
 better more illuminated more so realistic 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.440
 and then I liked it a lot 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:12.580
 here you can observe more or less what 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.280
 is each of the items that make up 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.039
 the inventory as you can see 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 modified ones look different to all 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:22.390
 that we can see in the original texture 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.930
 look here see a small 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.940
 difference also in terms of the desire 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.420
 as for our characters too 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.380
 to monsters like he looks like cook and 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.030
 the eren derman the zombie the pig man 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.649
 and especially the skeleton look at the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.649
 skeleton as it looks nice for that 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:44.890
 that of the tron movie and there the 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.960
 creever black here the trees well no 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.789
 is that they have changed a lot the cow is 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.670
 the cow did seem strange to me but 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.710
 good good ready I think it would be all 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.450
 this pack of textures so if you have 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.420
 liked you already know in the description 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.420
 will be the link we go for the next 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:10.340
 this would be our next of textures 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.230
 and it is the poster shaders this port is 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.300
 poster charters I liked it a lot 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.850
 because it also gives a little more 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.209
 realism to our minecraft pocket 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.140
 edition and how can you see it 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.209
 see very very very nice we like quite 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.250
 the kind of realism the grass is 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.580
 quite real, the truth may not be 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.030
 can appreciate very well in the video but 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.130
 in our devices wow is something 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.700
 great fantastic what has not 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.230
 liked oasis idea a lot is how they have 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.810
 remained the chests because they have remained then 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.520
 a little I do not know pale I see it as very 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.989
 pale the rest I liked everything 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.209
 quite these are the leaves here here 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.160
 what about flowers do not have any kind 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.600
 of error or anything 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.410
 and another thing that I also wanted them 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.150
 to mention is that everything is about 0.9 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.220
 point 4 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.110
 so if any of you want in 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.000
 another different modality not only 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.640
 write me in the comments and that's 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.950
 everything already to finish with our 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.980
 latest delivery of texture packages 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.990
 then we are going to go with this one that is 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.580
 the dragon dance 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.640
 maybe you have seen elsewhere 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.320
 of the pc and this is the version of the cope 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.940
 Edit the truth I quite like it 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:31.850
 because it's very picturesque pretty nice 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.850
 everything there is very nice about 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.310
 plan animated cartoons as well as 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.290
 looney tunes if you can remember the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.420
 looney tunes box put and patolucas all 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.670
 that then then here you see that it 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.000
 sees everything more or less in that style the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.800
 truth is the one I liked the most 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.870
 although it has some small errors in 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.730
 As for the flowers, how am I going to use it? 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.910
 later on there you just saw the water 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.500
 that wow I love how the water looks 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.670
 see as a kind of chai to see very 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.890
 beautiful 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.200
 and this here the andigital the one of horita and 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.390
 the granite on this side the stones of 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.370
 black here the stairs 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.510
 I did not like the mistake now either 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.970
 is showing here the doors the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.910
 doors also tasted looks pretty 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.160
 in plan cowboy something else that also 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.810
 here I do not like the bed it has 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.400
 a little mistake or I do not know if it will be only in 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.040
 my device there are rollers where such 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.140
 time run much better and good as they 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.880
 he was saying then here they are going to be able to 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.800
 see the error of the flowers that has not 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.660
 liked although we go half and half the 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.210
 half of the flowers has come out very 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.490
 very nice everything and the others not here 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.380

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.620
 our work table the oven and what 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.870
 the rest 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.510

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.940

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.380

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.600
 other than 0.9 point 4 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.110
 then they leave me in the comments and 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.510

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.860
