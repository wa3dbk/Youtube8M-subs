00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.850
 women know how to make a lot of borscht 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.649
 have children in a game recently introduced 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.120
 female crew which is absolutely every 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.280
 can get for doing personal 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.559
 combat missions , if desired, can 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.219
 teach ride on such tanks as mx 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.460
 sidisi 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.680
 or amx-13 fifty seven tanks on 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.520

 they already know how 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.360
 but not a miracle 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.820
 French medium tank of the tenth level 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.220
 Batchat in reality served four 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.170
 crew member in the same combat game 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.480
 tasks on this tank cope only 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.700
 three tankers and are absent in this 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.530
 case it was the radio operator who transferred 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.990
 all his work on the tank commander 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.970
 that's how you think where within 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.760
 our favorite game with you, he could shine 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.010
 if we consider that in the Soviet crew 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.050
 unsinkable oh t28 about which we 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.520
 told in the last issue of the same 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.520
 two radio operators 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.230
 profukali moment of purchase t59 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.670
 do not worry we found an alternative 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.420
 just need to buy Chinese 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.730
 medium tank level 9 to 120 and nothing on 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.710
 it does not install stock Chinese 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.600
 there will be a notable copy taken out of the game 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.540
 premium tank really want you and 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.160
 250 strength points will be added but 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.760
 you will get a little wrong 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.760
 battle levels 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.010
 land cruiser over 1500 monster super heavy 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.770
 German car that existed 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.290
 only on paper was the project closed due to 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.180
 high cost is difficult to implement it sti 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.890
 great with skillful basic instrument 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.530
 Eight hundred and three millimeters 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.900
 the mass of 1 pellet would be 8 tons 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.550
 you could throw it about 40 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.710
 kilometers also on monsters 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.630
 supposed place under 2 150 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.120
 millimeter howitzers and plus for six 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.910
 or 10-15 millimeter automatic 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.740
 guns for defense machine weighing half 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.990
 thousand tons and had to service 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.610
 a crew of a hundred people so that she 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.410
 somehow moved planned 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.290
 install four engines of 6 thousand 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.850
 500 horsepower each with such 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.610
 The scenario is that she could go with 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.489
 speed of 20 kilometers per hour but even 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.380
 if b 1500 was built he did not find 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.830
 would practical application in the military 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.830
 actions 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.460
 it's no secret that some sau 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.990
 world of tanks possess towers 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.760
 horizontal pickup angles at 360 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.670
 degrees have su-26 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.480
 birch gun 24 he is one hundred fifty five 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.110
 fifty five 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.820
 and batilion 155 58 but none of 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.730
 listed machines do not have such 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.740
 module as in the tower of the Soviet art-sau all 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.990
 it is understandable and the shelter on the tower 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.150
 difficult to name the British horde at all 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.610
 even from the rain will not save 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.880
 batchat tower is called a tower not 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.020
 even denies wargaming and wikipedia 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.640
 the only artillery at the moment 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:40.660
 which has a tower module is 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:45.510
 German pz sfl 4b word and this is the turret 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.510
 can not turn 360 degrees 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.920
 now smoothly go to the final 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.140
 parts of the release last time we asked 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.990
 question which German planes are circling 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.010
 over the map the arc of fire is a place schmitas 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.290
 bf-109 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.910
 because of the low poly models to these 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.180
 airplanes as the right answer 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.739
 we took any video modification 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.840
