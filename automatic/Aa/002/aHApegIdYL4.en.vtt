00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.179 

naturally<00:00:04.210> we<00:00:04.330> we<00:00:04.540> expect<00:00:04.990> to<00:00:05.740> have<00:00:05.890> build<00:00:06.069> a

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:06.189 
naturally we we expect to have build a

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.580 
naturally we we expect to have build a
car<00:00:06.370> that<00:00:06.580> gives<00:00:07.390> us<00:00:07.599> the<00:00:07.779> ability<00:00:07.840> to<00:00:08.290> go<00:00:08.410> back

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
car that gives us the ability to go back

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.459 
car that gives us the ability to go back
to<00:00:08.710> the<00:00:08.830> winning<00:00:09.190> road<00:00:09.460> can<00:00:10.360> we<00:00:10.510> win<00:00:10.690> and<00:00:10.929> drive

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
to the winning road can we win and drive

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.409 
to the winning road can we win and drive
for<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:11.710> championship<00:00:12.099> this<00:00:12.339> year<00:00:12.400> I<00:00:12.849> think

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:13.419 
for the championship this year I think

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.509 
for the championship this year I think
it's<00:00:13.540> optimistic<00:00:14.169> but<00:00:14.559> let's<00:00:15.009> be<00:00:15.160> optimistic

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
it's optimistic but let's be optimistic

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.300 
it's optimistic but let's be optimistic
and<00:00:15.789> try<00:00:16.299> nevertheless<00:00:17.050> I<00:00:17.560> think<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.950> car<00:00:18.130> of

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
and try nevertheless I think the car of

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.849 
and try nevertheless I think the car of
this<00:00:18.430> year<00:00:18.760> should<00:00:19.029> allow<00:00:19.300> us<00:00:19.539> to<00:00:20.500> at<00:00:20.800> least

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
this year should allow us to at least

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.529 
this year should allow us to at least
five<00:00:21.400> four<00:00:21.670> podiums<00:00:22.090> and<00:00:22.510> victories<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:24.539> you

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
five four podiums and victories and you

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.630 
five four podiums and victories and you
have<00:00:25.689> to<00:00:25.810> see<00:00:25.990> it<00:00:26.140> in<00:00:26.320> a<00:00:26.740> development<00:00:27.130> process

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
have to see it in a development process

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.249 
have to see it in a development process
and<00:00:27.849> at<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.000> time<00:00:28.150> we<00:00:28.210> decided<00:00:29.080> for<00:00:29.109> a

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
and at the time we decided for a

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.950 
and at the time we decided for a
three-year<00:00:29.650> program<00:00:30.130> to<00:00:30.730> be<00:00:30.849> back<00:00:31.330> to<00:00:31.570> the

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
three-year program to be back to the

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.730 
three-year program to be back to the
championship<00:00:32.439> position<00:00:33.190> so<00:00:33.990> we'll<00:00:34.990> sort<00:00:35.620> of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:35.740 
championship position so we'll sort of

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.770 
championship position so we'll sort of
Oh<00:00:36.220> put<00:00:36.850> it<00:00:36.880> this<00:00:37.030> way<00:00:37.150> we<00:00:37.390> are<00:00:37.510> in<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.660> right

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
Oh put it this way we are in the right

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.980 
Oh put it this way we are in the right
direction<00:00:37.990> on<00:00:38.800> this<00:00:38.950> road<00:00:39.510> yeah<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.660> new<00:00:40.750> car

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 
direction on this road yeah the new car

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.980 
direction on this road yeah the new car
i<00:00:41.020> think<00:00:41.350> is<00:00:41.470> very<00:00:41.590> exciting<00:00:42.130> and<00:00:42.730> I<00:00:43.270> look

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
i think is very exciting and I look

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.450 
i think is very exciting and I look
forward<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.260> driving<00:00:44.440> it<00:00:45.040> you<00:00:45.190> know<00:00:45.280> it's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
forward to driving it you know it's

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.490 
forward to driving it you know it's
always<00:00:45.610> great<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.240> get<00:00:46.450> a<00:00:46.510> first<00:00:46.810> feel<00:00:47.080> for<00:00:47.410> it

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
always great to get a first feel for it

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.650 
always great to get a first feel for it
and<00:00:47.580> it's<00:00:48.580> impossible<00:00:49.060> to<00:00:49.090> say<00:00:49.330> though<00:00:49.480> how

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
and it's impossible to say though how

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.270 
and it's impossible to say though how
well<00:00:49.870> we're<00:00:50.080> going<00:00:50.200> to<00:00:50.260> do<00:00:50.380> for<00:00:50.980> sure<00:00:51.010> we're

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
well we're going to do for sure we're

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.100 
well we're going to do for sure we're
going<00:00:51.310> to<00:00:51.460> progress<00:00:51.690> compared<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.750> last<00:00:52.870> year

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
going to progress compared to last year

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.630 
going to progress compared to last year
and<00:00:53.200> that's<00:00:53.320> very<00:00:53.410> important<00:00:53.800> for<00:00:53.920> us<00:00:54.010> but

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
and that's very important for us but

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.330 
and that's very important for us but
we'll<00:00:55.150> see<00:00:55.300> how<00:00:55.420> much<00:00:55.480> you<00:00:56.440> never<00:00:56.560> because

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
we'll see how much you never because

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.340 
we'll see how much you never because
we're<00:00:57.520> all<00:00:57.610> during<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.060> winter<00:00:58.330> work<00:00:58.540> within

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
we're all during the winter work within

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.930 
we're all during the winter work within
the<00:00:59.560> team's<00:00:59.830> wouldn't<00:01:00.250> see<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.520> other<00:01:00.610> teams

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
the team's wouldn't see the other teams

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.700 
the team's wouldn't see the other teams
cars<00:01:01.240> and<00:01:01.660> it's<00:01:01.840> always<00:01:02.020> difficult<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.530> make<00:01:02.680> a

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
cars and it's always difficult to make a

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.380 
cars and it's always difficult to make a
comparative<00:01:03.340> judgment<00:01:03.760> but<00:01:03.850> we've<00:01:04.000> made<00:01:04.180> a

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
comparative judgment but we've made a

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.190 
comparative judgment but we've made a
lot<00:01:04.449> of<00:01:04.629> progress<00:01:04.900> with<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.350> new<00:01:05.500> car<00:01:05.740> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
lot of progress with the new car and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.730 
lot of progress with the new car and
lighter<00:01:09.119> lower<00:01:10.119> center<00:01:10.509> of<00:01:10.539> gravity<00:01:10.740> we've

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
lighter lower center of gravity we've

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.050 
lighter lower center of gravity we've
also<00:01:11.890> have<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.250> adapt<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.700> all<00:01:12.789> in<00:01:12.939> your

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
also have to adapt to all in your

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.749 
also have to adapt to all in your
regulation<00:01:13.570> so<00:01:13.899> we<00:01:14.859> reasonably<00:01:15.250> pleased<00:01:15.520> with

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
regulation so we reasonably pleased with

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.099 
regulation so we reasonably pleased with
what<00:01:15.880> we've<00:01:16.060> got<00:01:16.090> but<00:01:16.479> as<00:01:16.600> I<00:01:16.689> say<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:16.929> never

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
what we've got but as I say you never

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.169 
what we've got but as I say you never
know<00:01:17.380> until<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.740> hit<00:01:17.829> the<00:01:17.950> track<00:01:18.189> what<00:01:19.090> we

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
know until you hit the track what we

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.300 
know until you hit the track what we
have<00:01:19.359> what<00:01:19.899> we<00:01:19.929> have<00:01:20.140> next<00:01:20.320> week<00:01:20.590> in<00:01:20.770> Valencia

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
have what we have next week in Valencia

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.700 
have what we have next week in Valencia
will<00:01:21.429> be<00:01:21.579> the<00:01:21.880> early<00:01:22.210> version<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:23.259> I<00:01:23.380> think<00:01:23.590> by

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
will be the early version and I think by

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.190 
will be the early version and I think by
the<00:01:23.770> time<00:01:23.799> we<00:01:24.100> get<00:01:24.219> to<00:01:24.280> Bahrain<00:01:24.729> will<00:01:25.600> have<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
the time we get to Bahrain will have the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.749 
the time we get to Bahrain will have the
definitive<00:01:26.679> version<00:01:26.979> which<00:01:27.399> you<00:01:27.490> can<00:01:27.609> put<00:01:27.729> a

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
definitive version which you can put a

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.149 
definitive version which you can put a
lot<00:01:27.880> different<00:01:28.240> to<00:01:28.329> where<00:01:28.479> we<00:01:28.570> start<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.950> next

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
lot different to where we start but next

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.459 
lot different to where we start but next
week<00:01:30.399> we<00:01:30.549> have<00:01:30.579> cursed<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.569> sort<00:01:32.020> out<00:01:32.170> we<00:01:32.350> have

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
week we have cursed to sort out we have

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.469 
week we have cursed to sort out we have
the<00:01:32.590> tires<00:01:32.799> new<00:01:33.159> Pirelli<00:01:33.429> tires<00:01:33.729> for<00:01:34.060> that<00:01:34.210> so

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
the tires new Pirelli tires for that so

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.779 
the tires new Pirelli tires for that so
there's<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.350> lot<00:01:35.469> of<00:01:35.530> benefit<00:01:36.249> in<00:01:36.280> getting<00:01:36.670> out

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
there's a lot of benefit in getting out

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:38.340 
there's a lot of benefit in getting out
early<00:01:37.149> and<00:01:37.270> getting<00:01:37.719> those<00:01:37.899> things<00:01:37.960> so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
early and getting those things so

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.539 
early and getting those things so
they're<00:01:38.619> so<00:01:38.799> when<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.009> get<00:01:39.130> all<00:01:39.249> the<00:01:39.369> proper

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
they're so when we get all the proper

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.250 
they're so when we get all the proper
bit<00:01:39.789> later<00:01:40.149> on

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
bit later on

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.560 
bit later on
then<00:01:41.410> we<00:01:41.950> can<00:01:42.130> have<00:01:42.400> all<00:01:42.580> those<00:01:42.730> things<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.180> I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
then we can have all those things that I

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.300 
then we can have all those things that I
think<00:01:44.290> it's<00:01:44.500> important<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:44.950> have<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.100> good

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
think it's important you have a good

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.650 
think it's important you have a good
system<00:01:45.490> because<00:01:46.030> if<00:01:46.150> it<00:01:46.270> doesn't<00:01:46.420> work

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
system because if it doesn't work

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.730 
system because if it doesn't work
properly<00:01:46.840> you're<00:01:47.170> going<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.350> have<00:01:47.440> to<00:01:47.500> be<00:01:47.530> at<00:01:47.680> a

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
properly you're going to have to be at a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.990 
properly you're going to have to be at a
big<00:01:47.860> disadvantage<00:01:48.100> I<00:01:48.790> think<00:01:49.450> we<00:01:49.600> need<00:01:49.810> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
big disadvantage I think we need to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.550 
big disadvantage I think we need to
consider<00:01:52.000> that<00:01:52.420> it's<00:01:52.600> completely<00:01:53.050> adjustable

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
consider that it's completely adjustable

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.310 
consider that it's completely adjustable
and<00:01:53.800> how<00:01:54.250> it's<00:01:54.430> used<00:01:54.670> can<00:01:55.570> be<00:01:55.720> decided<00:01:56.020> between

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
and how it's used can be decided between

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.250 
and how it's used can be decided between
the<00:01:56.620> FI<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.280> team<00:01:57.490> so<00:01:57.880> if<00:01:58.570> we<00:01:58.780> feel<00:01:58.990> it's

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
the FI in the team so if we feel it's

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.410 
the FI in the team so if we feel it's
it's<00:01:59.980> providing<00:02:00.430> too<00:02:00.580> much<00:02:00.760> effect<00:02:01.090> we<00:02:01.270> can

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
it's providing too much effect we can

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.330 
it's providing too much effect we can
show<00:02:01.600> me<00:02:01.660> back<00:02:01.900> of<00:02:02.050> it<00:02:02.170> so<00:02:02.830> it's<00:02:03.010> a<00:02:03.100> very<00:02:03.130> very

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
show me back of it so it's a very very

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.260 
show me back of it so it's a very very
adaptable<00:02:04.150> system<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:04.870> I<00:02:05.380> think<00:02:06.150> there<00:02:07.150> will

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
adaptable system and I think there will

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.030 
adaptable system and I think there will
give<00:02:07.480> some<00:02:07.660> interesting<00:02:08.140> opportunity<00:02:08.979> to

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
give some interesting opportunity to

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.800 
give some interesting opportunity to
some<00:02:09.250> interesting<00:02:09.490> strategy<00:02:10.180> so<00:02:10.450> we're

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
some interesting strategy so we're

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.990 
some interesting strategy so we're
looking<00:02:11.140> forward<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.560> trying<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:11.890> well<00:02:12.850> that's

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
looking forward to trying it well that's

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.450 
looking forward to trying it well that's
our<00:02:13.150> plan<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.900> think<00:02:14.350> we've<00:02:14.890> got<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> much

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
our plan and I think we've got a much

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.150 
our plan and I think we've got a much
stronger<00:02:15.700> effort<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:17.170> coming<00:02:17.560> season<00:02:17.740> and

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
stronger effort this coming season and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.970 
stronger effort this coming season and
we<00:02:18.250> had<00:02:18.400> last<00:02:18.550> year<00:02:19.350> but<00:02:20.350> as<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.530> say<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:20.800> never

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
we had last year but as I say you never

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.590 
we had last year but as I say you never
know<00:02:21.250> what<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.490> others<00:02:21.700> do<00:02:21.880> but<00:02:22.060> whatever<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
know what the others do but whatever the

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.670 
know what the others do but whatever the
others<00:02:22.900> do<00:02:23.080> we're<00:02:23.230> going<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.380> be<00:02:23.470> fighting

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
others do we're going to be fighting

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.040 
others do we're going to be fighting
very<00:02:23.920> hard
