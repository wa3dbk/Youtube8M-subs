AT&amp;T<00:01:52.920> might<00:01:53.369> nano<00:01:53.850> SIM<00:01:54.240> card<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.920> this<00:01:55.920> only

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
AT&amp;T might nano SIM card and this only

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.719 
AT&amp;T might nano SIM card and this only
works<00:01:56.549> with<00:01:56.790> gsm<00:01:57.450> iphone<00:01:58.020> 5s<00:01:58.500> which<00:01:58.799> means<00:01:59.070> you

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
works with gsm iphone 5s which means you

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.209 
works with gsm iphone 5s which means you
can't<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.270> on<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.780> iphone<00:02:01.380> 5<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:01.920> doesn't

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
can't do this on a iphone 5 but doesn't

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.130 
can't do this on a iphone 5 but doesn't
have<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> sim<00:02:02.640> card<00:02:02.670> such<00:02:03.149> as<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.329> verizon<00:02:04.049> iphone

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
have a sim card such as a verizon iphone

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.620 
have a sim card such as a verizon iphone
5<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:04.890> you're<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.189> America<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.270> basically

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
5 if you're in America so basically

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.540 
5 if you're in America so basically
that's<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.049> positive<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.770> having<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.310> gsm

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
that's the positive of having a gsm

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.200 
that's the positive of having a gsm
because<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.479> can<00:02:10.630> put<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:11.080> sim<00:02:11.920> cards<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:12.880> here

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
because you can put in sim cards so here

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.800 
because you can put in sim cards so here
you<00:02:14.020> have<00:02:14.050> your<00:02:14.170> nano<00:02:14.950> SIM<00:02:15.280> from<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:16.090> celcom

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
you have your nano SIM from this celcom

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.290 
you have your nano SIM from this celcom
carrier<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.530> in<00:02:17.710> Israel<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.880> put<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.180> in

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
carrier here in Israel and you put it in

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.070 
carrier here in Israel and you put it in
just<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:21.090> well<00:02:22.090> as<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.570> see<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.870> sim

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
just like so well as you can see the sim

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.880 
just like so well as you can see the sim
card<00:02:23.110> is<00:02:23.470> put<00:02:23.680> in<00:02:23.800> like<00:02:24.010> this<00:02:24.220> it's<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.300> nano-sim

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
card is put in like this it's a nano-sim

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.470 
card is put in like this it's a nano-sim
that's<00:02:26.890> what<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.130> iphone<00:02:27.310> 5<00:02:27.490> takes<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.240> then

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
that's what the iphone 5 takes and then

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.960 
that's what the iphone 5 takes and then
you<00:02:28.540> just<00:02:28.690> align<00:02:29.020> this<00:02:29.410> little<00:02:30.250> tray<00:02:30.610> into

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
you just align this little tray into

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.540 
you just align this little tray into
your<00:02:31.330> phone<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.980> once<00:02:32.980> again<00:02:33.130> it's<00:02:33.400> works

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
your phone and once again it's works

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.000 
your phone and once again it's works
with<00:02:33.700> any<00:02:33.910> iPhone<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:34.660> some<00:02:35.200> smartphones<00:02:35.560> if

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
with any iPhone and some smartphones if

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.740 
with any iPhone and some smartphones if
your<00:02:36.250> smartphone<00:02:36.610> isn't<00:02:36.760> unlocked<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.630> when

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
your smartphone isn't unlocked so when

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.590 
your smartphone isn't unlocked so when
you<00:02:37.810> put<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.080> in<00:02:38.170> now<00:02:38.380> basically<00:02:39.370> if<00:02:40.360> your

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
you put it in now basically if your

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.750 
you put it in now basically if your
unlocked<00:02:40.930> it'll<00:02:41.830> say<00:02:42.100> it'll<00:02:42.370> give<00:02:42.550> you<00:02:42.640> the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
unlocked it'll say it'll give you the

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.120 
unlocked it'll say it'll give you the
carrier<00:02:43.210> up<00:02:43.480> at<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.870> top<00:02:44.020> left<00:02:44.260> corner<00:02:44.530> if<00:02:44.890> I

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
carrier up at the top left corner if I

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.340 
carrier up at the top left corner if I
take<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.490> off<00:02:45.580> airplane<00:02:46.000> mode<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:46.930> took<00:02:47.170> it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
take it off airplane mode so I took it

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.840 
take it off airplane mode so I took it
out<00:02:47.410> airplane<00:02:47.740> mode<00:02:47.860> now<00:02:48.010> it's<00:02:48.190> searching<00:02:48.610> for

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
out airplane mode now it's searching for

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.650 
out airplane mode now it's searching for

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.000 
sim card from the carrier celcom in
Israel<00:03:08.800> anyways<00:03:09.610> guys<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:11.200> works<00:03:11.680> with

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
Israel anyways guys so this works with

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.370 
Israel anyways guys so this works with
any<00:03:12.250> carrier<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:13.270> doesn't<00:03:13.570> have<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.750> be<00:03:13.870> celcom

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
any carrier it doesn't have to be celcom

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.860 
any carrier it doesn't have to be celcom
in<00:03:14.500> Israel<00:03:14.890> it<00:03:15.250> could<00:03:15.430> be<00:03:15.610> Vodafone<00:03:16.390> in<00:03:16.630> the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
in Israel it could be Vodafone in the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.190 
in Israel it could be Vodafone in the
United<00:03:17.200> Kingdom<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:18.220> could<00:03:18.670> be<00:03:18.970> orange<00:03:19.780> it

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
United Kingdom it could be orange it

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.560 
United Kingdom it could be orange it
could<00:03:20.530> be<00:03:20.680> basically<00:03:21.070> anything<00:03:21.400> in<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:22.420> could

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
could be basically anything in it could

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.740 
could be basically anything in it could
be<00:03:22.690> tmobile<00:03:23.340> anything<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.489> has<00:03:24.760> a<00:03:25.120> sim<00:03:25.720> card

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
be tmobile anything that has a sim card

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.100 
be tmobile anything that has a sim card
and<00:03:26.290> as<00:03:26.950> long<00:03:27.310> as<00:03:27.489> it's<00:03:27.640> nano<00:03:27.940> SIM<00:03:28.300> then<00:03:28.930> that

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
and as long as it's nano SIM then that

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.530 
and as long as it's nano SIM then that
would<00:03:29.230> work<00:03:29.440> but<00:03:30.100> if<00:03:30.340> it's<00:03:30.520> not<00:03:30.610> nano<00:03:31.030> SIM<00:03:31.360> you

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
would work but if it's not nano SIM you

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.930 
would work but if it's not nano SIM you
could<00:03:31.690> always<00:03:31.810> cut<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.380> sim<00:03:32.650> card<00:03:32.680> their<00:03:33.459> sim

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
could always cut the sim card their sim

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.000 
could always cut the sim card their sim
there's<00:03:34.540> micro<00:03:34.900> sim<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.320> there's<00:03:35.500> nano<00:03:35.739> SIM

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
there's micro sim and there's nano SIM

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.370 
there's micro sim and there's nano SIM
you<00:03:36.220> can<00:03:36.370> easily<00:03:36.790> cut<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.360> micro<00:03:37.930> sim<00:03:38.140> to<00:03:38.290> an

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
you can easily cut in micro sim to an

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.979 
you can easily cut in micro sim to an
Allison<00:03:38.800> or<00:03:38.980> or<00:03:39.550> a<00:03:39.670> normal<00:03:40.090> sim<00:03:40.300> to<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.540> nano-sim

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
Allison or or a normal sim to a nano-sim

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.860 
Allison or or a normal sim to a nano-sim
so<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.739> very<00:03:41.950> easy<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.880> iphone<00:03:43.270> 4s<00:03:43.690> and

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
so this is very easy the iphone 4s and

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.530 
so this is very easy the iphone 4s and
iphone<00:03:44.170> 4<00:03:44.410> take<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:44.980> a<00:03:45.190> micro<00:03:45.640> sim<00:03:45.820> card<00:03:46.150> which

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
iphone 4 take in a micro sim card which
