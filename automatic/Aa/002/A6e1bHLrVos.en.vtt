00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.190
 well what's a great mood with 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.740
 I am Anthony and how ironic it is 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.210
 studied but this issue since the same 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.660
 places from which you started your previous 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 release in general then with this cool red 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.449
 pipes 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.779
 one who does not remember my previous 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.250
 the release was about this beautiful home 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.250
 you know the type he built himself 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.770
 praised well, in general, in my style, and I 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.600
 still in that issue in principle but whoever 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.750
 so attentive can already noticed something 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.120
 what I promised about the fact that I will build the subway 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 in this issue but i'm actually this 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.530
 did that is i built the metro for now 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.270
 build urka just one line but i 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.800
 I will gradually continue that is what 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.539
 the more buildings the more will be 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.000
 Accordingly, the subway but it is logical 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.829
 In general, a small city so that the subway 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.270
 I built not very big and I have everything 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.250
 while two entrances to this metro 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.410
 the first one is about my 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.570
 residential building and in general in the place where 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.729
 I have n't understood why but wildly 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.080
 lags here now well here you are 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.990
 surely noticed 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.450
 Here I am just moving here and things with 20 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.430
 just not something like a computer not 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.490
 the weakest I now I do not understand why 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.860
 Well, I hope that this is because 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.750
 buildings because as I understand it very much 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.670
 a lot of buildings a lot of things manually 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.590
 did that there are a lot of items very much 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.900
 such it turns out all this somehow 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.119
 most likely affects here that there are two 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.700
 Entry absolutely identical very similar 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.060
 the doors are open 24 hours a day be kind 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.790
 go to the subway while saying that these two 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.530
 entrance that is all at the subway, it is absolutely 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.360
 for free that is, imagine what 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.180
 freebie people in general that is they can 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.850
 calmly here we go down here yes and 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.680
 it turns out here we have a man 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.000
 who just looks after the guards then 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.570
 have it accordingly also receive 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.920
 money, that is , he has such a job 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.689
 ordinary people can calm now 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.549
 it can only go through 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.219
 that here he controls not to enter 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.079
 with all kinds of suspicious objects 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.140
 or suspicious individuals there for sure 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.970
 learn how it is usually done in principle 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.500
 in many cities so well in general 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.600
 go to the most 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.010
 what a complicated station are complicated because 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.330
 I really lag here and you don't 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.400
 imagine how hard it was for me here 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.500
 build honestly in general went a 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.300
 here we have the usual guard which 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.360
 Generally the wall is not looking for why he 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.160
 there hoo hoo everything smile smile look 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.810
 us but she has such a face 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.610
 facial expression that feels like that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.560
 he just got up and came on 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.720
 work and he is not entirely satisfied will seem 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.430
 his life but maybe he 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.650
 smiles i don't know and maybe he does 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.810
 hides so well that we go in and start 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.360
 go down we go down and see 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.730
 To go nuts yes it's a car that is nothing in 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.680
 Generally such supernatural 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.690
 ordinary metro station the name of this 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.209
 the station has not yet come up with but in 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.850
 In general, I want to say that the length 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.530
 that's how ska width is more accurate than this car 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.540
 only three blocks that is, I have it 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.580
 turned out very small but 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.100
 compact because essentially people he 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.790
 will not be very much to transport that is 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.940
 there is only 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.520
 very little space and will have to stand up 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.190
 have to stand of course it is very such 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.830
 big minus but I think in principle for 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.900
 people who will ride here alone 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.519
 two minutes because the city and the small 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.730
 in fact it will not be very big 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.310
 the problem also made here two inputs 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.780
 there are absolutely identical ones from the right 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.590
 sides and left as the next 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.570
 station 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.180
 we have the same entrance will be on the left 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.519
 hand, well, in general, the driver's cabin 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.190
 where we put the aircraft mod 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.290
 understandably see the entire tunnel through 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.720
 which we will go but it is logical yes and 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.160
 in general, you can go to the next 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.310
 well next year has not yet built 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.260
 because in general it seems to me more 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.390
 it is not necessary to build but one is completely here too 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.030
 enough how many people there but I have something 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.890
 all this in the city is not very much 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.690
 living here so i thought that 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.310
 hang on until one car is enough 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.200
 whether there will be a very big it 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.660
 we will complete it at all a problem 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.340
 absolutely if minus what i like 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.500
 would essentially in the car part because 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.780
 There is not yet invented on what to do it 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.970
 so that he moved on the tracks here 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.940
 Well look still learning invented yet 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.950
 as they say this is not the latest version 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.710
 so I'll think about it 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.020
 came up with the clear thing that we are there either 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.130
 anthony ribbon there i have it all built everything 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.010
 it is more or less decorated as we are 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.900
 and let me point out, in principle, probably 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.850
 second station that's how you see i am all 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.500
 time x6 block because this block is me 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.200
 this case has already been prepared that I am here 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.240
 from here now I will run there more accurately I will fly 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.400
 and that is, I'm going to fly around 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.230
 here you will see a tunnel here 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.630
 these types of lighting yes and here are the various 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.490
 all mechanisms these mechanisms are generally from 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.320
 my past buildings then all this 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.060
 of course it would seem to someone 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.430
 seem unnatural that damn what 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.620
 this is garbage let's build there all that 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.920
 but for me, I thought it would be 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.600
 very good because due to this 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.280
 the reality is that we are here 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.960
 we are in the tunnel usually just in 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.180
 right tunnels hold all sorts of cables 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.740
 conduct all sorts of mechanisms that 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.510
 something connects me so 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.520
 it seemed it would be just very 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.050
 really and in something I already on the second 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.090
 stations which have noticed 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.250
 it was a slight digression but 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.710
 very much I came to what I wanted 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.980
 this is our second station is also very 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.660
 similar to the previous also here there is 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.400
 small file what if for example 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.140
 accelerate our car to, respectively 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.730
 he will have to slow down 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.500
 have time to slow down and crash here in 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.450
 the end of the tunnel but this is still the end of the tunnel 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.980
 because the stations are only 2 that is the line 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.410
 1 and stations only 2 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.170
 Well, let's see, I will understand it. 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.260
 expand as I said here in 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:46.090
 in general, it is built just like 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.280
 previous that is very similar 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.380
 built but it makes no sense to me to do them 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.180
 different there is something to come up with such 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.830
 especially because it seemed to me that 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.490
 here is all I wanted 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.410
 accommodated 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.360
 here is a man here too 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.390
 which stupa looks into the wall I do not know 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.580
 what is looking for there what is trying to find about 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.590
 as soon as I came right away 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.770
 clicked on the mouse button immediately turned 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.050
 immediately felt real resident 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.060
 there is everywhere feels the benefit as soon as 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.420
 I realized that it really smells like something 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.710
 so immediately turned to customers 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.510
 in general, here we have such 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.370
 farmer stands up 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.380
 who controls this whole thing 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.600
 some as i said the same money for 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.360
 it gets well basically 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.290
 let's just turn on the day now 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:35.200
 what have I got somehow with a loss with time 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.510
 the date is already as if the night was 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.940
 Basically what I wanted I told you 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.630
 because I built the distance built 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.120
 I am really 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.830
 I will say very much that I will not say that I 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.620
 not much time invested in them 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.430
 I will say that I am already very there 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.200
 overzealous like for example when 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.470
 creating this whole apartment building 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.840
 but I basically liked the stations 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.210
 that is, they are so small but cozy 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.560
 but both compact and in principle and 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.380
 practical as it seemed to me 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.300
 so that they are just a small lot 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.980
 I will not take places I can essentially 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.380
 to build in any part of the city that is 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.940
 whether there are northern and eastern there but 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.440
 I and although honestly here fig 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.510
 where are there any parts 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.800
 cities in general, that's all I wanted 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:19.780
 showed everything he wanted told everything 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.090
 subscribe to channel like and 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.430
 subscribe to the group vkontakte all 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:28.420
 thanks for waiting for the next video 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.950
 write by the way about these metro where 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.840
 would you like me to still these subways 

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.400
 built ie connected some lines 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.950
 maybe you will have some thoughts 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.940
 On this occasion, I basically only here 

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:42.270
 well that's all thank you all good luck 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.270
 bye everyone
