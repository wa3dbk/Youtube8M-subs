00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
cow's milk in which the water has been

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.220 
cow's milk in which the water has been
removed<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:10.490> highly<00:02:11.209> concentrated<00:02:11.390> and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
removed and it's highly concentrated and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.880 
removed and it's highly concentrated and
super<00:02:12.680> sweet<00:02:12.980> don't<00:02:13.970> confuse<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.810> with

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
super sweet don't confuse this with

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.660 
super sweet don't confuse this with
evaporated<00:02:15.890> milk<00:02:15.920> though<00:02:16.280> because<00:02:16.430> there's

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
evaporated milk though because there's

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.729 
evaporated milk though because there's
typically<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.750> same<00:02:17.930> section<00:02:18.410> so<00:02:18.680> you

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
typically in the same section so you

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.190 
typically in the same section so you
want<00:02:18.950> condensed<00:02:19.520> milk<00:02:19.700> once<00:02:20.540> your<00:02:20.750> coffee<00:02:20.989> is

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
want condensed milk once your coffee is

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.290 
want condensed milk once your coffee is
completed<00:02:21.739> with<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> drip<00:02:22.280> remove<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
completed with the drip remove the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.690 
completed with the drip remove the
coffee<00:02:23.540> filter<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.410> then<00:02:24.950> take<00:02:25.280> about<00:02:25.640> a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
coffee filter and then take about a

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.180 
coffee filter and then take about a
tablespoon<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.840> condensed<00:02:27.230> milk<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:27.739> stir<00:02:28.130> it

you want it over ice just pour the
coffee<00:02:47.170> mixture<00:02:47.650> directly<00:02:48.430> over<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:49.000> glass
