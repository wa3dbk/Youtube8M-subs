00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
a Vitamix and then the one thing that I

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.519 
a Vitamix and then the one thing that I
didn't<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.299> about<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.719> aesthetically<00:00:16.199> was

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
didn't like about it aesthetically was

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.939 
didn't like about it aesthetically was
it<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.400> tall<00:00:17.670> really<00:00:18.390> tall<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.500> it<00:00:19.650> would<00:00:19.800> not

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
it was tall really tall and it would not

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.300 
it was tall really tall and it would not
fit<00:00:20.369> underneath<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.500> cabinet<00:00:22.500> like<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.039> it

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
fit underneath a cabinet like this it

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.950 
fit underneath a cabinet like this it
was<00:00:23.430> just<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.910> would<00:00:24.029> just<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.390> really

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
was just it would just be like really

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.439 
was just it would just be like really
high<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:26.369> plunger<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.880> everything<00:00:27.150> sticks

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
high the plunger and everything sticks

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.439 
high the plunger and everything sticks
up<00:00:28.070> so<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.340> just<00:00:29.460> inconvenient<00:00:30.269> but

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
up so that was just inconvenient but

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
just using a Blendtec like if you can't

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.920 
just using a Blendtec like if you can't
get<00:01:13.680> both<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> juicer<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.939> blender<00:01:15.720> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
get both the juicer and a blender I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.480 
get both the juicer and a blender I
would<00:01:16.080> highly<00:01:16.439> recommend<00:01:16.470> getting<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.159> blender

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
would highly recommend getting a blender

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
would highly recommend getting a blender
because<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.110> much<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.590> this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
because you can do so much with this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
put in this then you would just strain

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.819 
put in this then you would just strain

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
amazing only rarely does it get jammed a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.569 
amazing only rarely does it get jammed a
little<00:01:57.780> bit<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.560> might<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.189> open<00:01:59.490> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
little bit and you might have to open it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
little bit and you might have to open it
but<00:02:00.060> that's<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.540> like<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.719> said<00:02:00.899> rarely

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
but that's just like I said rarely

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.780 
but that's just like I said rarely
that's<00:02:01.710> maybe<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.250> don't<00:02:02.430> put<00:02:02.610> enough

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
that's maybe if I don't put enough

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.679 
that's maybe if I don't put enough
liquid<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.299> something<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.149> don't<00:02:06.390> need<00:02:06.659> a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
liquid in something so you don't need a

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.809

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
bucket up here and so what I do is I

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.330

long in water and then I drain it out
and<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.989> sprouts<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.910> just<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.480> releases

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
and it sprouts and that just it releases

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.050

that makes it more digestible it creates

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.580 
that makes it more digestible it creates

their<00:03:44.700> standard<00:03:45.440> being<00:03:46.440> organic<00:03:46.859> I<00:03:47.250> think<00:03:47.670> it

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
their standard being organic I think it

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.900 
their standard being organic I think it
only<00:03:47.910> costs<00:03:48.359> and<00:03:48.540> costed<00:03:49.290> me<00:03:49.320> like<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:50.040> think<00:03:50.760> it

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
only costs and costed me like I think it

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.319 
only costs and costed me like I think it
cost<00:03:51.120> like<00:03:51.329> $10<00:03:52.079> or<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:53.670> might<00:03:53.880> have<00:03:54.000> been<00:03:54.090> I

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
cost like $10 or it might have been I

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.699 
cost like $10 or it might have been I
don't<00:03:54.540> think<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:54.780> went<00:03:54.900> as<00:03:55.079> high<00:03:55.290> higher<00:03:55.680> than

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
don't think I went as high higher than

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.920 
don't think I went as high higher than
19<00:03:56.430> bucks<00:03:56.609> like<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:57.030> can't<00:03:57.269> remember<00:03:57.480> exactly

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
19 bucks like I can't remember exactly

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.390 
19 bucks like I can't remember exactly
it<00:03:58.140> might<00:03:58.290> have<00:03:58.380> been<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.590> spelt<00:03:58.920> grain<00:03:59.220> that

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
it might have been the spelt grain that

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.099 
it might have been the spelt grain that
was<00:03:59.519> 19<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.359> might<00:04:00.600> have<00:04:00.690> been<00:04:00.810> 10

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
was 19 and this might have been 10

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.259 
was 19 and this might have been 10
something<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:02.160> it's<00:04:02.370> very<00:04:02.640> cheap<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:02.970> get<00:04:03.209> a

that is one thing about the Blendtec it
is<00:05:20.810> very<00:05:21.050> loud<00:05:21.430> okay<00:05:22.430> so<00:05:22.490> I'm<00:05:22.669> gonna<00:05:22.789> start<00:05:22.910> off

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
is very loud okay so I'm gonna start off

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.950 
is very loud okay so I'm gonna start off
with<00:05:23.300> the<00:05:23.810> ice<00:05:24.110> crush<00:05:24.789> for<00:05:25.789> this<00:05:25.970> grain<00:05:26.240> um<00:05:26.660> you

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
with the ice crush for this grain um you

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.779 
with the ice crush for this grain um you
could<00:05:27.110> use<00:05:27.320> actually<00:05:27.800> probably<00:05:28.070> any<00:05:28.430> button

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:28.789 
could use actually probably any button

00:05:28.789 --> 00:06:23.150 
could use actually probably any button
but<00:05:28.970> I<00:05:29.000> just<00:05:29.270> like<00:05:29.510> to<00:05:29.660> use<00:05:29.780> this<00:05:29.900> one

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.700 

so<00:06:24.160> this<00:06:24.460> actually<00:06:24.910> should<00:06:25.419> be<00:06:25.620> should<00:06:26.620> be

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
so this actually should be should be

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.390 
so this actually should be should be
good<00:06:26.860> enough<00:06:27.100> I<00:06:27.250> think<00:06:28.560> was<00:06:29.560> that<00:06:29.590> loud<00:06:30.040> and

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
good enough I think was that loud and

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.110 
good enough I think was that loud and
funny<00:06:30.870> there<00:06:31.870> we<00:06:31.960> go

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
funny there we go

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.930 
funny there we go
yeah<00:06:34.120> so<00:06:34.540> that's<00:06:34.780> actually<00:06:38.699> it's<00:06:39.699> a<00:06:39.820> little

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
yeah so that's actually it's a little

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.159 
yeah so that's actually it's a little
bit<00:06:40.090> warm<00:06:41.970> from<00:06:42.970> the<00:06:43.120> friction<00:06:43.360> I<00:06:43.750> will<00:06:44.050> in<00:06:44.110> a

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
bit warm from the friction I will in a

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.129 
bit warm from the friction I will in a
minute<00:06:44.260> baby<00:06:44.590> and<00:06:45.430> so<00:06:46.120> yeah<00:06:46.300> it's<00:06:46.570> perfectly

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139 
minute baby and so yeah it's perfectly

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.790 
minute baby and so yeah it's perfectly
ground<00:06:47.530> flour<00:06:48.780> and<00:06:49.780> now<00:06:50.260> I'm<00:06:50.380> gonna<00:06:50.470> go<00:06:50.680> ahead

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
ground flour and now I'm gonna go ahead

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.580 
ground flour and now I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:06:51.160> make<00:06:51.370> some<00:06:51.760> bread<00:06:51.970> in<00:06:52.120> my<00:06:52.210> bread<00:06:52.389> machine

and make some bread in my bread machine

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.409 
and make some bread in my bread machine
and<00:06:53.639> that's<00:06:54.639> how<00:06:54.850> you<00:06:54.910> do<00:06:55.060> it

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:55.419 
and that's how you do it

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.070 
and that's how you do it
