00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 hello in this new video I 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.890
 will share with you simply 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.450
 a book that was very useful to me when 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.760
 I recruited people in my first 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.790
 company and that is 45 method for 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.830
 recruit with discernment so here is it 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.719
 be aware that it is very important to 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.180
 to recruit well in a company a 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.189
 recruitment and it can cost 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.869
 tens of thousands of euros or more 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.609
 to a company a bad recruitment 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.900
 why because there are two hits 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.070
 when you 're wrong 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.789
 people and possessions already you have the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.900
 opportunity cost 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.980
 ie you will hire 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.599
 someone bad then you would have 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.920
 could hire someone good the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.660
 good person could have brought 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.649
 tremendously to your business and she 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.850
 can not reach because this 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.350
 deceive you took someone from 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.719
 bad so already the opportunity cost 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.910
 then there is the cost of training 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.309
 direct from this of this bad 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.300
 person of salary that 's all of the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.649
 time you will spend 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.989
 personally that someone your 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.550
 company will go on to recruit to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.899
 manager that person and who sees there 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.699
 is completely wasting what 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.140
 you will have to separate from this 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.420
 bad employees after three to six 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.430
 months a year to sail to six was not in 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.719
 no longer detected during the death period 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.149
 it's going to cost me a lot of money 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.519
 defensively and that's so it's 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.979
 really very important to maximize our 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.299
 chances when we recruit a candidate that 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.920
 this is to make sure that it is 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.950
 really the best person possible 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.960
 to reach taxes for for this post 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.509
 and so this book really gives it 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.570
 excellent technique for that since 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.220
 it actually allows two filters 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.060
 and more then obviously the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.659
 recruitment it's not a science 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.799
 correct 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.869
 there are people doing recruiting 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.369
 for thirty years and it happens to them 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.229
 always to be wrong this is clear 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.729
 so we can not reach a score of 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.020
 100% in recruitment it's completely 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.700
 impossible by cons what we can 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.470
 do it's like in entrepreneurship one 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.970
 can minimize risks 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.409
 that is to say here to make sure 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.610
 to have more chances to have a 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.560
 good candidate rather than bad and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.899
 I had used the techniques 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.250
 of this book to recruit two candidates 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.270
 in the first company I found 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.579
 really very effective 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.240
 so this book is written in very 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.430
 big here is really very very very very 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.680
 easy to read there are pictures ya everything 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.329
 and in red or black and in the end there are 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.340
 even a summary of giving everything from 45 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.630
 technique is really they are very 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.030
 very very simple to put into practice 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.520
 so strongly encourages you 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.720
 to take it and read it if you are 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.790
 a contractor and you count 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.520
 hired it really can the book there 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.490
 costs about twenty euros in my opinion 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.140
 and it can save you money but 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.030
 tens of thousands of euros 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.069
 literally then just a technique 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.239
 very friendly very simple drawn from 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.470
 this book that I would like to share with 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.510
 you it's just the technique 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.800
 columbo so what is it 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.000
 columbo technique so for those who 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.739
 have who have seen some episodes of 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.600
 this series how a little bit to me 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.070
 to say anyway coolus word is good 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.600
 the columbo technique it was always 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.970
 here are the links there has been a 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.410
 murder he begins to investigate there 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.970
 interrogated suspects is including 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.800
 the main suspect that we know 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.120
 since we saw the scene of the crime 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.910
 as a viewer but as 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.440
 ball do not know and so the suspect does 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.410
 everything to look the most innocent 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.030
 possible really that's it and colombo it's going 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.370
 ask questions he will do mine 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.550
 to actually get caught at 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.110
 the person's game of the murderer in 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.519
 doing so saying yes actually good 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.519
 what you look innocent he is going 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:11.780
 to leave and when he goes 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:14.239
 well he's gonna he say to the fact 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.280
 I have one last question is there he is going 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.160
 ask a question that is completely 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.730
 formidable when the person 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.920
 wait the least 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.570
 and it's going in general in general 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.480
 allow to really break through a 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.360
 little bit the person and confirm or 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.340
 not these suspicions and in fact so 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.049
 the author pierre marne she proposes to 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.790
 do an equivalent this technique 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.180
 that is, in fact at the end of 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.130
 maintenance 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.600
 you're already going to announce five 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.950
 minutes before the end of interview that 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.540
 the interview will end what will 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.150
 allow the candidates to give them 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.560
 a chance to say something that 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.790
 would like to say is that they did not have 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.810
 the time so far and then you 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.340
 go what are you going to do c 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.079
 accompanied by that is something that 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.420
 very few people who will recruit 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.760
 you will go with the candidate 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.930
 to the car or at least to 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.370
 less the door of the company 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.019
 in any case that's the goal 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.840
 walk maybe a few moments with 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:06.920
 him and you enjoy this moment a little 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.530
 quieter a little more relaxed for 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.640
 ask him more questions and 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.269
 especially when you go 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.159
 say goodbye 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.540
 you say to the fact I forgot about you 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.269
 ask and there you ask him a 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.500
 question relevant to the position 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.569
 this is this year it's a 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.220
 excellent technique to try to 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:24.919
 find out a little bit about your candidate 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.940
 beyond the facade of the mask that has 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.319
 given then obviously that does not mean 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.610
 that they know how to completely fall 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.520
 it's obvious but it will allow you 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.870
 undoubtedly to return more by 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.039
 know a little bit better this 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.449
 person who is still very helpful 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.490
 because not only are you hiring 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.590
 skills and you also hire 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.000
 a personality to it is really 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.860
 very important there is this difference 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.930
 between know-how and know-how 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.610
 you hire a know how do you 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.940
 know you are hiring too a knowledge 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.949
 be 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.750
 so of course we can not know 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.860
 like that completely a person with 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.900
 just an interview not hired 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.190
 possible but by posing while doing 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.740
 taking refuge in this technique it allows to 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.550
 break a little more up to date the mas 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.349
 so that's what I wanted 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.000
 to share with you today 45 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:03.860
 effective methods to recruit with 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.509
 discernment of stone morel a book 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.860
 who you twenty euros with 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.930
 lots of concrete actions simple to 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.759
 perform if you have to hire 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.810
 someone and who can really really 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.520
 make a big difference in your 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.460
 business because that's so thanks to this 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.810
 book you avoid a candidate a bad 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.250
 candidate that you take a good one 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.819
 will make all the difference in the world in 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.870
 your company 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.250
 so that's what I wanted 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.090
 to share with you today so 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.440
