00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.669
 in 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.370
 actually have different people 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.719
 to 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.270
 referees drivers players 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.710
 coaches called you together 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.679
 so mainly a very positive one 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.679
 meeting in the form of a competition 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.619
 they just had a warm help and one 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.320
 preliminary discussion 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.540
 after the participants are now the competition 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.559
 entered either the first half 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:44.210
 immediately there will be a rest with some tea and 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:47.780
 the sweet lemonade and afterwards there is still 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.980
 an extension and a follow-up discussion 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.980
 and then we enter the third half 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.890
 I've always come to that insight 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.090
 more people are happy 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.710
 you who worry about how it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.900
 goes into the football 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.060
 keep humor in it and that is there anyway 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.890
 just from your perspective 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.330
 do it all for a referee 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.950
 is not on the field 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.900
 some say yes I don't feel like it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.259
 more in i can i ca n't intention 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.040
 I think that whistling is great fun 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.380
 it is usually not occasionally 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.790
 and sometimes there is sharing with you 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.790
 experience and especially in conversation with each other 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.530
 are not alone and between the camera 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.539
 in the clips but also the clips themselves 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.640
 and I think that is incredibly important 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.030
 and the amateur football really good 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.130
 coming 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.560
 it's a nicest I thought no but I 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.110
 really eh yes yes 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.979
 in terms of football and if so very enthusiastic 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.310
 people 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.530
 nice female people yes 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 such people I was actually my 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.689
 collaborate 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.689
