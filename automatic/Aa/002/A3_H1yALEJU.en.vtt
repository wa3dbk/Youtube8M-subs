00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.300
 that's right the situation in discipline 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.900
 jd hayworth from news.de and here with the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.420
 new htc evo ix lust this is one 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.520
 revised version of the unix we have 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.080
 take a new processor here 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.890
 I give them in gap 37 tegra 3 plus with 1 7 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.779
 ghz instead of the 1.5 gg than the tegra 3 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.010
 quad-core processor otherwise had 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.050
 Also new is the photosensitive 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.510
 16 megapixel front camera 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.700
 the display stayed the same 47 inches 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.120
 super lcd 2 hd display with a 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.520
 resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 but new is that gorilla-glass 2 installed 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.180
 so the display became a bit 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.489
 is more resistant down here 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.450
 we also have red touch buttons 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.920
 let's look at devices of all 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.070
 on the side we have here on the right 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.440
 put the volume button on once 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.660
 the left side then the micro usb port 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.489
 who can now also accept peripherals 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.100
 So keyboard or mouse a new one 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.559
 smartphone above we have the power 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.750
 button sim card slot and the headset 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.700
 port on the back we have 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.590
 unchanged the 8 megapixel camera with 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.159
 fotolicht with which we also have videos in 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.500
 can turn full-hd and synonymous with the mix 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.000
 plus is beats audio integrated we 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.350
 have installed a new processor here 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.090
 So the benchmark 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.930
 We've got a squared quadrant here 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.090
 and you get 7520 points you do not see 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.229
 with the old only nothing much faster 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.979
 you can do that with your device 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.500
 to compare 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.079
 and right after that still does to 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.960
 benchmark the result is coming now too 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.200
 welcome here 14,200 62 points 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.150
 and that 's an extremely good value 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.090
 software is running here the new android 4.1 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.509
 jelly bean thanks the project better like 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.740
 you can see it runs extremely smoothly 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.310
 we also have the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.810
 latest htc sense version 4 plus the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.360
 of course comes with all the features 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.270
 from jelly bean we have google now though 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.340
 htc touch also decided 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.040
 bad to keep what jenny am 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 yes actually missing but htc has 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.069
 thought so good 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.300
 maybe there is still and 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.819
 is also still used by many sides 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.859
 So let's just put it in there 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.999
 and let's take a look at the camera here 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:19.799
 app we have the right here 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:25.049
 search bar we have a digital 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:28.549
 zoom you can zoom in so easily 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:31.170
 top right we have some effects 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:35.189
 you see real time 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.280
 you see now is the result 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.510
 different effects here on each one 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.879
 case look cool 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.769
 I personally set the effects 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.480
 only after I have the original picture 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.040
 but you can do it 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.260
 you can do whatever you want 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:54.540
 shoot direct image with effect then 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.790
 we have here in video mode too 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.299
 the possibility of slow motion videos too 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.540
 rotate 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.419
 this is definitely 1 that in any case 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.040
 nice feature and if you have yours 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.569
 pictures and videos directly on the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.489
 you want to transfer tv 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.659
 Simply use your smartphone with htc media 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.209
 connect link hd 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.000
 a size comparison may not be missing 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:19.769
 we have the htc explorer here 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.220
 iphone 5 and an iphone 4s 4.7 inch for 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:29.909

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.009
 millimeter wide 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.540
