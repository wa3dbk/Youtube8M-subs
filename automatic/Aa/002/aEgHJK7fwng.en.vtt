to<00:03:23.210> be<00:03:23.300> able<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.540> write<00:03:23.690> like<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:25.610> did<00:03:26.000> that<00:03:26.150> and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
to be able to write like so did that and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.580 
to be able to write like so did that and
then<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.630> wanted<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.900> add<00:03:26.960> a<00:03:26.990> little<00:03:27.350> bit<00:03:27.560> of

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
then I wanted to add a little bit of

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.400 
then I wanted to add a little bit of
shading<00:03:27.920> around<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:29.420> main<00:03:29.630> image<00:03:29.870> here<00:03:30.170> so<00:03:30.380> I

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
shading around the main image here so I

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.700 
shading around the main image here so I
just<00:03:30.620> used<00:03:30.800> my<00:03:30.860> W<00:03:31.250> 3<00:03:31.610> W<00:03:32.000> 1<00:03:32.210> and<00:03:32.240> W<00:03:32.450> 0<00:03:32.750> zero<00:03:33.410> marker

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
just used my W 3 W 1 and W 0 zero marker

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.290 
just used my W 3 W 1 and W 0 zero marker
and<00:03:34.310> when<00:03:34.520> you're<00:03:34.610> coloring<00:03:34.760> on<00:03:34.970> any<00:03:35.150> other

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
and when you're coloring on any other

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.030 
and when you're coloring on any other
cardstock<00:03:35.810> but<00:03:36.170> white<00:03:36.350> it's<00:03:36.680> always<00:03:36.920> gonna

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
cardstock but white it's always gonna

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.710 
cardstock but white it's always gonna
love<00:03:37.190> darker<00:03:37.640> because<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.180> wetness<00:03:38.450> of

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
love darker because of the wetness of

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.300 
love darker because of the wetness of
the<00:03:38.840> marker<00:03:39.140> and<00:03:39.380> then<00:03:39.500> it'll<00:03:39.710> dry<00:03:40.040> lighter

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
the marker and then it'll dry lighter

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.680 
the marker and then it'll dry lighter
than<00:03:40.550> you<00:03:40.640> think<00:03:40.880> so<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.240> need<00:03:41.390> to<00:03:41.480> kind<00:03:41.660> of

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
than you think so you need to kind of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.840 
than you think so you need to kind of
experiment<00:03:42.080> with<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.470> but<00:03:43.130> I<00:03:43.160> knew<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:43.490> combo

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
experiment with it but I knew that combo

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.670 
experiment with it but I knew that combo
would<00:03:44.000> work<00:03:44.180> really<00:03:44.390> well<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.870> then<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:45.440> just

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
would work really well and then I just

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.160 
would work really well and then I just
adhered<00:03:46.250> my<00:03:46.550> little<00:03:46.790> cutout<00:03:47.210> image<00:03:47.540> over<00:03:47.960> that

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
adhered my little cutout image over that

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.350 
adhered my little cutout image over that
with<00:03:48.350> some<00:03:48.530> tombow<00:03:48.800> mono<00:03:49.040> multi<00:03:49.460> they<00:03:50.180> just

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
with some tombow mono multi they just

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.910 
with some tombow mono multi they just
love<00:03:50.570> how<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.900> pops<00:03:51.230> like<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.680> could<00:03:51.830> have

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
love how it pops like you could have

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.350 
love how it pops like you could have
stamped<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.310> we're<00:03:52.430> just<00:03:52.580> onto<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:52.910> tag<00:03:53.120> and

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
stamped it we're just onto the tag and

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.610 
stamped it we're just onto the tag and
colored<00:03:53.600> it<00:03:53.720> with<00:03:53.750> markers<00:03:54.320> that<00:03:54.440> would've

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
colored it with markers that would've

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.100 
colored it with markers that would've
been<00:03:54.710> fine<00:03:54.950> but<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.940> get<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:56.420> vibrant<00:03:56.960> it

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
been fine but to get it so vibrant it

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.330 
been fine but to get it so vibrant it
works<00:03:57.290> better<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.680> stamp<00:03:57.920> it<00:03:58.010> on<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.190> white

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
works better to stamp it on the white

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.430 
works better to stamp it on the white
and<00:03:58.610> then<00:03:59.060> you<00:03:59.180> get<00:03:59.300> that<00:03:59.450> great<00:03:59.810> vibrant

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
and then you get that great vibrant

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.050 
and then you get that great vibrant
color<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:00.710> then<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:00.980> cat<00:04:01.160> is<00:04:01.640> obviously

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
color and then the cat is obviously

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.420 
color and then the cat is obviously
white<00:04:02.270> as<00:04:02.450> well<00:04:02.600> so<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:02.990> just<00:04:03.020> in<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:04.100> end<00:04:04.220> I

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
white as well so it just in the end I

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.450 
white as well so it just in the end I
just<00:04:04.460> find<00:04:04.940> it<00:04:05.060> easier<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.660> then<00:04:06.500> I<00:04:06.530> used<00:04:07.070> my

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
just find it easier and then I used my

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.340 
just find it easier and then I used my
orange<00:04:07.970> wink<00:04:08.270> of<00:04:08.390> Stella<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.990> coat<00:04:09.200> the

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
orange wink of Stella to coat the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.780 
orange wink of Stella to coat the
pumpkin<00:04:09.740> some<00:04:10.040> of<00:04:10.160> the<00:04:10.220> wink<00:04:10.400> of<00:04:10.520> Stella

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
pumpkin some of the wink of Stella

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.210 
pumpkin some of the wink of Stella
colors<00:04:11.120> are<00:04:11.300> too<00:04:11.650> dark<00:04:12.650> like<00:04:12.860> they<00:04:13.010> will

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
colors are too dark like they will

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.780 
colors are too dark like they will
obscure<00:04:13.850> any<00:04:14.570> detail<00:04:15.110> but<00:04:15.140> orange<00:04:16.040> is<00:04:16.310> not<00:04:16.580> bad

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
obscure any detail but orange is not bad

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.760 
obscure any detail but orange is not bad
at<00:04:16.880> all<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.210> just<00:04:17.239> kind<00:04:17.540> of<00:04:17.630> deepened<00:04:18.080> the

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
at all it just kind of deepened the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.110 
at all it just kind of deepened the
coloring<00:04:19.130> but<00:04:19.220> you<00:04:19.310> can<00:04:19.430> still<00:04:19.609> see<00:04:19.850> all<00:04:19.880> the

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
coloring but you can still see all the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.360 
coloring but you can still see all the
shading<00:04:20.359> everything<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:20.960> did<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.950> gives<00:04:22.190> it

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
shading everything I did and it gives it

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.880 
shading everything I did and it gives it
the<00:04:22.850> most<00:04:23.240> amazing<00:04:23.720> sparkle<00:04:24.140> so<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.410> use<00:04:24.740> the

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
the most amazing sparkle so I use the

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.409 
the most amazing sparkle so I use the
orange<00:04:25.130> from<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.340> pumpkin<00:04:25.760> and<00:04:25.970> then<00:04:26.060> I<00:04:26.120> use

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
orange from the pumpkin and then I use

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.590 
orange from the pumpkin and then I use
the<00:04:26.570> black<00:04:26.810> for<00:04:27.320> the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
the black for the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.300 
the black for the
jack-o'-lantern<00:04:28.290> face<00:04:28.500> being<00:04:28.800> really

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
jack-o'-lantern face being really

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.580 
jack-o'-lantern face being really
careful<00:04:29.490> with<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:29.880> because<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:31.110> black<00:04:31.350> has<00:04:31.560> a

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
careful with it because the black has a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.890 
careful with it because the black has a
tendency<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.250> get<00:04:32.430> everywhere<00:04:33.270> but<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.750> can

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
tendency to get everywhere but you can

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.720 
tendency to get everywhere but you can
just<00:04:34.050> see<00:04:34.140> how<00:04:34.200> much<00:04:34.230> like<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.770> black<00:04:35.040> is<00:04:35.340> dark

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
just see how much like the black is dark

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.180 
just see how much like the black is dark
and<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.090> really<00:04:36.450> deepens<00:04:37.050> whatever<00:04:37.500> you<00:04:37.650> coat

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
and it really deepens whatever you coat

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.510 
and it really deepens whatever you coat
it<00:04:38.220> with<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:39.530> Kona<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.650> jackal<00:04:40.950> interface<00:04:41.310> and

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
it with so Kona the jackal interface and

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.250 
it with so Kona the jackal interface and
I'm<00:04:41.640> gonna<00:04:41.820> turn<00:04:42.090> on<00:04:42.150> my<00:04:42.570> overhead<00:04:43.020> light

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
I'm gonna turn on my overhead light

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.600 
I'm gonna turn on my overhead light

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.610 
because it naturally you can't really

the<00:04:54.600> clear<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.290> doesn't<00:04:55.950> match<00:04:56.490> at<00:04:56.820> all<00:04:56.940> so

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
the clear just doesn't match at all so

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.320

perfect<00:05:10.980> for<00:05:11.010> those<00:05:11.190> cards<00:05:11.580> so<00:05:11.820> I<00:05:12.030> threaded<00:05:12.750> it

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
perfect for those cards so I threaded it

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.180 
perfect for those cards so I threaded it
through<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.140> hole<00:05:13.290> in<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.500> tag<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:13.980> then<00:05:14.100> I

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
through the hole in the tag and then I

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.680 
through the hole in the tag and then I
just<00:05:14.310> used<00:05:14.520> some<00:05:14.640> heavyweight<00:05:15.090> black<00:05:15.390> thread

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
just used some heavyweight black thread

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.360 
just used some heavyweight black thread
to<00:05:15.990> wrap<00:05:16.290> around<00:05:16.590> it<00:05:16.740> and<00:05:16.800> tighten<00:05:17.010> a<00:05:17.130> little

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
to wrap around it and tighten a little

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.550 
to wrap around it and tighten a little
bow<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.760> then<00:05:18.630> there's<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.020> pattern<00:05:19.380> paper

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
bow and then there's the pattern paper

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.260 
bow and then there's the pattern paper
from<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:19.950> pack<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.490> I<00:05:20.610> just<00:05:20.850> trimmed<00:05:21.120> them

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
from the pack and I just trimmed them

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.410

little border of it in the end and I was

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.680 
little border of it in the end and I was
gonna<00:05:50.550> keep<00:05:50.820> everything<00:05:51.090> flat<00:05:51.420> and<00:05:51.450> then

bit<00:05:53.220> fun<00:05:53.400> with<00:05:53.550> it<00:05:53.670> so<00:05:53.790> I<00:05:54.210> popped<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:54.960> tag<00:05:55.140> up

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
on some foam tape to give it a little

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.920

bit<00:05:58.140> of<00:05:58.380> dimension<00:05:58.620> and<00:05:59.310> then<00:06:00.090> I<00:06:00.120> die<00:06:00.270> cut<00:06:00.690> some

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
bit of dimension and then I die cut some

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.470
