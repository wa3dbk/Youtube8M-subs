packs we asked ourselves what hasn't
been<00:00:51.210> done<00:00:51.329> before<00:00:51.539> dinosaurs<00:00:52.730> but<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> course

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
been done before dinosaurs but of course

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060 
been done before dinosaurs but of course
that's<00:00:54.239> ridiculous<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.469> decided<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.920> do

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
that's ridiculous so we decided to do

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.040 
that's ridiculous so we decided to do
something<00:00:56.340> that's<00:00:56.579> much<00:00:56.969> more<00:00:57.210> realistic<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
something that's much more realistic and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.680 
something that's much more realistic and
actually<00:00:58.410> happens<00:00:58.859> fire<00:00:59.550> fights<00:01:00.000> during

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
actually happens fire fights during

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.020 
actually happens fire fights during
volcanic<00:01:01.219> eruptions<00:01:02.219> so<00:01:02.520> that's<00:01:02.699> what<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.000> did

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
volcanic eruptions so that's what we did

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.630 
volcanic eruptions so that's what we did
with<00:01:03.329> magma<00:01:04.100> although<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.129> guess<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.460> probably

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
with magma although I guess we probably

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.460 
with magma although I guess we probably
should<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.000> called<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.360> lava<00:01:06.570> since<00:01:06.990> magmas

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
should have called it lava since magmas

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.740 
should have called it lava since magmas
underneath<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> crust<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.729> earth<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.270> we

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
underneath the crust of the earth but we

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.390 
underneath the crust of the earth but we
just<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:10.080> make<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.439> sounded<00:01:10.799> cooler<00:01:11.130> but

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
