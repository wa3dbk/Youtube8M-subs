layer<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.560> this<00:00:28.680> photo<00:00:28.950> because<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.700> want<00:00:29.880> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
layer to this photo because I want to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.880 
layer to this photo because I want to
brighten<00:00:30.180> up<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.660> increase<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.260> contrast<00:00:31.680> in

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
brighten up and increase the contrast in

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.800 
brighten up and increase the contrast in
the<00:00:31.980> foreground<00:00:32.340> elements<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.510> want<00:00:33.750> to

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
the foreground elements but I want to

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.960 
the foreground elements but I want to
leave<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.110> sky<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> detail

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
leave the sky as it is I like the detail

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.940 
leave the sky as it is I like the detail
in<00:00:36.150> the<00:00:36.239> clouds<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.590> add<00:00:37.710> an<00:00:37.860> adjustment

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
in the clouds there to add an adjustment

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.590 
in the clouds there to add an adjustment
layer<00:00:38.340> I'll<00:00:38.670> go<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> top<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> layers

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
layer I'll go to the top of the layers

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
layer I'll go to the top of the layers
panel<00:00:39.720> I'll<00:00:40.290> click<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> black<00:00:41.400> and<00:00:41.610> white

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
panel I'll click the black and white

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.510 
panel I'll click the black and white
circle<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.360> I'll<00:00:42.900> choose<00:00:43.140> levels<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
circle and I'll choose levels the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.920 
circle and I'll choose levels the
histogram<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> levels<00:00:45.480> adjustment

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
histogram and the levels adjustment

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.080 
histogram and the levels adjustment
layer<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.370> referencing<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.520> entire<00:00:47.820> image

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
layer is referencing the entire image

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.150 
layer is referencing the entire image
and<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.930> looks<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:49.650> is<00:00:49.680> content

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and so it looks like there is content

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.710 
and so it looks like there is content
over<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> bright<00:00:51.030> part<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.420> histogram

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
over on the bright part of the histogram

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.840 
over on the bright part of the histogram
as<00:00:52.050> well<00:00:52.290> as<00:00:52.380> the<00:00:52.500> dark<00:00:52.710> part<00:00:52.980> but<00:00:53.579> I'm

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
as well as the dark part but I'm

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.060 
as well as the dark part but I'm
interested<00:00:54.450> only<00:00:54.630> in<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.170> foreground<00:00:55.649> area

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
interested only in this foreground area

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.370 
interested only in this foreground area
and<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.760> doesn't<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.300> enough<00:00:57.510> bright<00:00:57.960> areas

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
and it doesn't have enough bright areas

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.680 
and it doesn't have enough bright areas
so<00:00:59.010> despite<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.610> histogram<00:01:00.149> I'm<00:01:00.329> going<00:01:00.600> to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
so despite the histogram I'm going to

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.959 
so despite the histogram I'm going to
take<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.260> white<00:01:01.440> triangle<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.250> drag<00:01:02.520> over<00:01:02.730> to

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
take the white triangle and drag over to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.780 
take the white triangle and drag over to
the<00:01:03.120> left<00:01:03.329> until<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.710> barn<00:01:04.949> looks<00:01:05.399> good<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.759> me

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the left until the barn looks good to me

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.969 
the left until the barn looks good to me
and<00:01:06.090> then<00:01:06.660> I'll<00:01:06.750> do<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.930> same<00:01:07.229> with<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> black

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and then I'll do the same with the black

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
and then I'll do the same with the black
triangle<00:01:08.479> then<00:01:09.479> I'll<00:01:09.600> take<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> gray

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
triangle then I'll take the gray

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.690 
triangle then I'll take the gray
triangle<00:01:10.410> and<00:01:10.890> I'll<00:01:11.100> drag<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.399> the<00:01:11.460> left

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
triangle and I'll drag to the left

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.580 
triangle and I'll drag to the left
slightly<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.630> brighten<00:01:12.960> up<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.229> barn<00:01:13.440> and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
slightly to brighten up the barn and

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.770 
slightly to brighten up the barn and
then<00:01:14.009> I'll<00:01:14.250> close<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.759> adjustments<00:01:15.270> panel<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
then I'll close the adjustments panel I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.930 
then I'll close the adjustments panel I
like<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.770> effect<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.190> that<00:01:17.310> adjustment<00:01:17.700> on

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
like the effect of that adjustment on

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.700 
like the effect of that adjustment on
the<00:01:18.149> barn<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:19.050> other<00:01:19.170> foreground

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
the barn and the other foreground

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.160 
the barn and the other foreground
elements<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.700> notice<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:21.660> blown<00:01:21.960> out

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
elements but notice that it's blown out

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.500 
elements but notice that it's blown out
all<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.590> detail<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:23.310> clouds<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
all the detail in the clouds and in the

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.080 
all the detail in the clouds and in the
snow-capped<00:01:24.960> mountains<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:26.340> bring<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.790> back

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
snow-capped mountains to bring that back

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.700 
snow-capped mountains to bring that back
I'm<00:01:27.390> going<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:27.780> hide<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:27.990> adjustment<00:01:28.619> from

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
I'm going to hide the adjustment from

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.280 
I'm going to hide the adjustment from
those<00:01:28.979> areas<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.670> I'll<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.600> by<00:01:31.049> adding

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
those areas and I'll do that by adding

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.500 
those areas and I'll do that by adding
black<00:01:31.650> paint<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.760> layer<00:01:33.000> mask<00:01:33.240> thumbnail

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
black paint to the layer mask thumbnail

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.080 
black paint to the layer mask thumbnail
that<00:01:33.900> comes<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.890> adjustment<00:01:35.369> layer<00:01:35.520> we

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
that comes with my adjustment layer we

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
that comes with my adjustment layer we
talked<00:01:36.330> about<00:01:36.450> layer<00:01:36.780> masks<00:01:37.200> earlier<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
talked about layer masks earlier in the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.990 
talked about layer masks earlier in the
course<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> context<00:01:38.760> of<00:01:38.850> making

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
course in the context of making

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.359 
course in the context of making
composites<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.500> told<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.220> can

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
composites and I told you that you can

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.250 
composites and I told you that you can
add<00:01:41.610> black<00:01:41.939> paint<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> layer<00:01:42.659> mask<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:43.200> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
view well the same is true of adjustment

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.640 
view well the same is true of adjustment
layers<00:01:47.790> adding<00:01:48.600> black<00:01:48.780> paint<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> layer

the adjustment from the corresponding

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.240 
the adjustment from the corresponding
area<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.090> adding<00:01:54.930> gray<00:01:55.200> paint<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> layer

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
area and adding gray paint to a layer

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.399 
area and adding gray paint to a layer
mask<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:57.000> partially<00:01:57.330> hide<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.900> adjustment

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
mask will partially hide the adjustment

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.620 
mask will partially hide the adjustment
so<00:01:58.799> let's<00:01:59.009> do<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.220> now<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.330> are<00:02:00.420> several

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
so let's do that now there are several

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.600 
so let's do that now there are several
ways<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.140> could<00:02:01.439> add<00:02:01.680> black<00:02:02.009> paint<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
ways that I could add black paint to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.330 
ways that I could add black paint to
this<00:02:02.909> adjustment<00:02:03.479> layer<00:02:03.509> mask<00:02:04.200> one<00:02:05.009> way<00:02:05.159> would

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
this adjustment layer mask one way would

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.550 
this adjustment layer mask one way would
be<00:02:05.400> to<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.119> with<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.570> brush<00:02:06.720> tool<00:02:07.020> or<00:02:07.259> I

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
be to do it with the brush tool or I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.229 
be to do it with the brush tool or I
could<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.100> gradient<00:02:08.310> tool<00:02:08.729> as<00:02:09.090> I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
could do it with a gradient tool as I

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.449 
could do it with a gradient tool as I
showed<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.570> earlier<00:02:09.630> in<00:02:10.049> the<00:02:10.140> course<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.739> this

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
showed you earlier in the course in this

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.550 
showed you earlier in the course in this
case<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.880> think<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.269> fastest<00:02:12.750> way<00:02:12.930> would<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.170> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
case I think the fastest way would be to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.039 
case I think the fastest way would be to
quickly<00:02:13.920> select<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.730> sky<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.299> just<00:02:15.720> fill

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
quickly select the sky and just fill

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.319 
quickly select the sky and just fill
that<00:02:16.290> area<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.950> mask<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.400> black<00:02:17.549> so

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
that area of the mask with black so

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.900 
that area of the mask with black so
let's<00:02:18.510> try<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.959> I'm<00:02:19.280> going<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.310> use<00:02:20.370> my<00:02:20.670> quick

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
let's try that I'm going to use my quick

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.420 
let's try that I'm going to use my quick
selection<00:02:20.970> tool<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.010> then<00:02:23.010> I'll<00:02:23.130> move<00:02:23.280> into

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
selection tool and then I'll move into

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.979 
selection tool and then I'll move into
the<00:02:23.610> image<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.060> I'll<00:02:24.239> click<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.450> drag<00:02:24.600> over

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
the image and I'll click and drag over

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.170 
the image and I'll click and drag over
the<00:02:25.230> sky<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:26.040> does<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> pretty<00:02:26.549> good<00:02:26.639> job<00:02:26.970> of

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
the sky that does a pretty good job of

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.390 
the sky that does a pretty good job of
selecting<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.169> sky<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.709> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
selecting just the sky and the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.470 
selecting just the sky and the
white-capped<00:02:29.970> mountains<00:02:30.450> I

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
white-capped mountains I

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.210 
white-capped mountains I
could<00:02:31.569> spend<00:02:31.780> time<00:02:32.019> refining<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.739> selection

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
could spend time refining the selection

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.410 
could spend time refining the selection
but<00:02:33.459> I'm<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:33.640> going<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.909> leave<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.120> rough<00:02:34.390> for
