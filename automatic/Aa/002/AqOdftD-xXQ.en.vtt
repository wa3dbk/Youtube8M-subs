00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
stations that's something I'm

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.020 
stations that's something I'm
particularly<00:03:19.530> pleased<00:03:19.950> about<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:20.880> think

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
particularly pleased about so I think

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.110 
particularly pleased about so I think
top<00:03:21.570> marks<00:03:21.870> fit<00:03:22.080> well<00:03:22.590> done<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.850> there's<00:03:24.000> also

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
top marks fit well done and there's also

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.880 
top marks fit well done and there's also
another<00:03:24.390> couple<00:03:24.960> of<00:03:25.020> design<00:03:25.320> flourishes<00:03:25.860> that

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
another couple of design flourishes that

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.350 
another couple of design flourishes that
Swift<00:03:26.250> has<00:03:26.370> done<00:03:26.550> which<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.790> think<00:03:27.060> are<00:03:27.150> worthy

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
Swift has done which I think are worthy

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.480 
Swift has done which I think are worthy
of<00:03:27.480> comment<00:03:27.810> now<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.500> LED<00:03:28.740> lighting<00:03:29.310> is

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
of comment now the LED lighting is

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.790 
of comment now the LED lighting is
dimmable<00:03:29.910> there's<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.750> chrome<00:03:31.050> effect<00:03:31.200> overlay

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.070 
sockets are actually turned through 90
degrees<00:03:35.490> so<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> cables<00:03:36.450> don't<00:03:36.570> get<00:03:36.750> snagged
