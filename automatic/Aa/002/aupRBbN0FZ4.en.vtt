the<00:02:56.900> idea<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:58.519> put<00:02:58.549> the<00:02:59.000> card<00:02:59.540> in<00:02:59.780> like

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
the idea is you put the card in like

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.910 
the idea is you put the card in like
that<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.650> hold<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.100> top<00:03:01.989> hold<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.140> like<00:03:03.320> this

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.160 

and<00:03:06.920> then<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.220> spin<00:03:07.579> it<00:03:08.620> like<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.900> it's

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
and then you spin it like that and it's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.370 
and then you spin it like that and it's
still<00:03:12.380> spinning<00:03:12.950> its<00:03:13.250> way<00:03:13.459> through<00:03:14.350> still<00:03:15.350> a
