there's nothing you can really do about
it<00:01:34.850> that's<00:01:35.850> why<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.180> need<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> magic<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:38.570> Oscar

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
probably just put a burr on that point

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.729 
probably just put a burr on that point
just<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.100> everybody<00:01:44.520> else
