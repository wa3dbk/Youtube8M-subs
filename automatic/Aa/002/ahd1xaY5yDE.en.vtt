00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.149
 i 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.700
 after 10 years of the invited process 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.790
 visual and then the festival 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.880
 international in vitro visual move from 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.650
 that first stage as a sample 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.770
 alternative that becomes a 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.930
 festival this is the time where in 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:56.260
 we want there is a transformation still 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.390
 greater and is that the first element is the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.130
 appropriation of the city and from there the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.230
 appropriation of the city and to collect 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.629
 all that experience around the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.479
 disclosure of the short film is where 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.259
 born bogota charfi festival festival 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.259
 bodies of will 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.710
 no no 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.170
 new shorts is to believe in the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.289
 Colombian short film are ten years of 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.990
 history ten years of short films ten 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.140
 years of believing in directors 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.479
 Colombians and then the most interesting thing is 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.740
 the coolest thing you have is that many of 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.890
 the directors who now have 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.950
 feature films in Colombia showed by 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.609
 first time his shorts in burgos shorts 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.020
 then this festival is not just a 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:43.969
 where the shorts are shown but 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.009
 it is an open space for 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.349
 filmmakers space to talk about cinema 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.829
 a space to get up to 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.829
 work 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.930
 I have great expectations about 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.510
 for 8 hours because I think it's 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.320
 the start of an event but a 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.900
 movement that is the evolution of something 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.650
 that happened about which a lot of people 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.680
 rode and now let's say this becomes 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.840
 in something that includes the city ​​from its 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.580
 own name that includes as more 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.080
 people that include even then as as 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.100
 epicenter is the city but includes 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.500
 everyone is a festival 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.650
 international then let's say that about 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.959
 those those guidelines what is proposed 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.090
 it's a very big thing now are these 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.680
 expectations of how big really 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.680
 it can be this festival 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.720
 the santa lucia was born for the completion of 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.220
 in vitro visuals in the year 2007 when 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.700
 We saw the need for 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.190
 to deliver an item that was 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.540
 strong enough 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:02.420
 and the virgin is also associated with 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.490
 in the December festivities 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.010
 additional to it then we could take it 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.660
 as the appointment of every Tuesday that ate 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.810
 it almost became a ritual 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.810
 religious 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.270
 a little crooked is a transmedia event 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.430
 so we can see it on the internet for 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.220
 that we can later pass on 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.970
 television so that we can have a 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:35.180
 window that the shorts also need 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:37.230
 and be able to link people who 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.420
 they have always worked around the 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.370
 cut then is a good time to 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.510
 that few shorts have 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.510
 an event after a minute 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.219
 i 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.870
 we want people to be 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.090
 approach the short format from 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.370
 different angles that we want to be 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.200
 approach from music festivals from 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.719
 artist encounters in squares 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.420
 public that people live the festival 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:17.359
 with the city we are going to ask the 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.609
 people if you like the short or how 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.799
 short likes it or how long should 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.660
 be the short good time and I can not 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.660
 ask a question for vogue or short tv 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.620
 the discards 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.490
 clear what is 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.490
 psn
