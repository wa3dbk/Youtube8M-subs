00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
kind of important and it'll be really

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.670 
kind of important and it'll be really
quick<00:00:15.450> i'm<00:00:15.690> getting<00:00:15.990> straight<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.470> point

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
quick i'm getting straight to the point

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.590 
quick i'm getting straight to the point
so<00:00:17.340> many<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:17.699> probably<00:00:17.760> confused<00:00:18.449> as

so many of you are probably confused as

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.540 
so many of you are probably confused as
to<00:00:18.630> why<00:00:18.900> F<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.350> edited<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.770> came<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.490> of

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
to why F is edited this came out of

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.000 
to why F is edited this came out of
nowhere<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.300> my<00:00:21.510> opinion<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.960> should<00:00:22.010> now

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
nowhere and in my opinion it should now

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.230 
nowhere and in my opinion it should now
you<00:00:23.100> may<00:00:23.220> ask<00:00:23.340> why<00:00:23.670> should<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.000> come<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:24.210> of

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
you may ask why should have come out of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.439 
you may ask why should have come out of
nowhere<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.600> I'll<00:00:25.260> tell<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.529> why<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.449> if

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
nowhere and I'll tell you why it's if if

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.570 
nowhere and I'll tell you why it's if if
it<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.230> noticeable<00:00:28.650> team<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.220> about<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.460> end

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
it is noticeable team is about to end

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.519 
it is noticeable team is about to end
then<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.570> obvious<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.109> they<00:00:31.289> don't<00:00:31.439> at

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
then it is obvious that they don't at

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.139 
then it is obvious that they don't at
the<00:00:31.619> level<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:31.949> which<00:00:32.040> they<00:00:32.250> used<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> be<00:00:32.700> at<00:00:32.850> it

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the level in which they used to be at it

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
the level in which they used to be at it
means<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.630> gotten<00:00:33.930> much<00:00:34.110> worse<00:00:34.140> than

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
means they have gotten much worse than

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.530 
means they have gotten much worse than
when<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:34.920> were<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.160> their<00:00:35.340> best<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
when they were at their best and I

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.330 
when they were at their best and I
personally<00:00:36.960> believe<00:00:37.020> AF<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.680> at<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> high<00:00:38.070> point

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
personally believe AF is at a high point

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.130 
personally believe AF is at a high point
but<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> highest<00:00:39.420> point<00:00:39.629> being<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.960> about

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
but the highest point being of about

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.020 
but the highest point being of about
four<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.469> five<00:00:40.500> months<00:00:40.829> ago<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.370> didn't<00:00:41.820> want<00:00:41.969> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
four to five months ago I didn't want it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.889 
four to five months ago I didn't want it
to<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.480> point<00:00:42.629> where<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> was

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
to get to the point where I was

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.479 
to get to the point where I was
noticeable<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.590> were<00:00:43.680> about<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.890> end<00:00:44.129> meaning

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
noticeable we were about to end meaning

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.520 
noticeable we were about to end meaning
we<00:00:44.579> weren't<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.300> near<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.899> peak<00:00:46.110> or<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
we weren't at or near the peak or the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.619 
we weren't at or near the peak or the
best<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.579> came<00:00:47.730> apparent<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> me<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.300> AF

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
best if you came apparent to me that AF

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.970 
best if you came apparent to me that AF
was<00:00:48.809> heading<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.140> bit<00:00:49.289> downhill<00:00:49.469> when<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.860> had

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
was heading a bit downhill when we had

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.470

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
trying to be rude to samer infamous but

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.630 
trying to be rude to samer infamous but
when<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> leader<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> team<00:01:13.979> does<00:01:14.250> leave<00:01:14.490> it's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
when a leader of a team does leave it's

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.820 
when a leader of a team does leave it's
just<00:01:14.820> kind<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> same<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.619> don't

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
just kind of not the same and I don't

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.969 
just kind of not the same and I don't
find<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:17.909> surprising<00:01:18.570> because<00:01:18.979> some

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
find this very surprising because some

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.620 
find this very surprising because some
more<00:01:20.100> examples<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:20.939> vadik<00:01:21.390> left

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
more examples like if vadik left

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.570 
more examples like if vadik left
relative<00:01:22.140> mines<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.650> would<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.950> be<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.400> bit

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
relative mines it would not be one bit

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.090 
relative mines it would not be one bit
the<00:01:23.700> same<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.020> temporarly<00:01:25.470> phase<00:01:25.830> or

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the same just as if temporarly phase or

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.890 
the same just as if temporarly phase or
ended<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:27.000> ended<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.570> left

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
ended it or not ended it but just left

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.130

community and then the idea of me being
co-leader<00:03:12.030> fractals<00:03:12.629> brought<00:03:12.810> up<00:03:12.989> and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
co-leader fractals brought up and

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.690 
co-leader fractals brought up and
everyone<00:03:13.500> was<00:03:13.650> down<00:03:13.859> for<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:14.400> I'll<00:03:14.519> be
