00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.010 

I've<00:01:52.320> been<00:01:52.500> using<00:01:52.830> this<00:01:53.100> swather<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.020> tractor

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I've been using this swather and tractor

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.480 
I've been using this swather and tractor
for<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.799> last<00:01:56.010> 10<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.580> 11<00:01:57.150> years<00:01:58.400> but<00:01:59.400> it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
for the last 10 or 11 years but it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.249 
for the last 10 or 11 years but it
probably<00:01:59.670> about<00:01:59.940> a<00:02:00.000> thousand<00:02:00.540> hours<00:02:00.630> cutting

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
probably about a thousand hours cutting

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.950 
probably about a thousand hours cutting
on<00:02:01.740> both<00:02:02.130> which<00:02:02.490> isn't<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.850> whole<00:02:02.970> lot<00:02:03.030> if

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
on both which isn't a whole lot if

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.719 
on both which isn't a whole lot if
you're<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.170> big-time<00:02:04.409> hey<00:02:04.770> farmer<00:02:05.190> but<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you're a big-time hey farmer but with a

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.779 
you're a big-time hey farmer but with a
couple<00:02:06.119> hundred<00:02:06.390> acres<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:07.429> enough<00:02:08.429> hours

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
couple hundred acres it's enough hours

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.449 
couple hundred acres it's enough hours
for<00:02:09.000> me<00:02:09.410> really<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.920> both<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.220> them

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
about 3,000 hours on and now I think in

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.120 
about 3,000 hours on and now I think in
the<00:02:17.100> last<00:02:17.250> 10<00:02:17.520> years<00:02:17.550> our<00:02:18.000> swather<00:02:18.720> has<00:02:19.130> also

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
very little problem with either this

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.390

which side of the tractor it is on from
Weber<00:03:55.019> in<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.319> cab<00:03:55.530> here

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
Weber in the cab here

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.850 
Weber in the cab here
this<00:03:56.610> allows<00:03:56.879> me<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.299> cut

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
this allows me to cut

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.580 
this allows me to cut
my<00:03:59.400> field<00:03:59.760> back<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.330> forth<00:04:00.570> here<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:01.320> start

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
my field back and forth here to start

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.430 
my field back and forth here to start
out<00:04:01.740> we've<00:04:01.980> cut<00:04:02.190> our<00:04:02.340> six<00:04:02.670> rows<00:04:02.970> around<00:04:03.960> to

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
out we've cut our six rows around to

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.680 
out we've cut our six rows around to
make<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.620> headland<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.520> gives<00:04:05.880> us<00:04:06.060> room

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
make a headland and that gives us room

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.100 
make a headland and that gives us room
to<00:04:06.960> turn<00:04:07.140> around<00:04:08.420> for<00:04:09.420> our<00:04:09.510> back<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.900> forth

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
to turn around for our back and forth

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.020 
to turn around for our back and forth
rows<00:04:10.350> I<00:04:10.530> cut<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:10.860> rest<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.220> my<00:04:11.310> field<00:04:11.610> back<00:04:11.820> and

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
rows I cut the rest of my field back and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.650 
rows I cut the rest of my field back and
forth<00:04:12.270> it<00:04:12.450> just<00:04:12.600> works<00:04:12.780> out<00:04:12.930> better<00:04:13.170> with

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
forth it just works out better with

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.890 
forth it just works out better with
we'll<00:04:15.200> rake<00:04:15.470> in<00:04:15.770> my<00:04:16.010> round<00:04:16.550> baler<00:04:16.910> to<00:04:17.090> do<00:04:17.209> that

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:29.130 

so<00:04:20.139> we<00:04:20.290> will<00:04:20.440> turn<00:04:20.620> around

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.080 

by<00:04:29.650> doing<00:04:29.710> it<00:04:30.070> this<00:04:30.160> way<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.490> don't<00:04:30.700> have<00:04:30.910> to

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
by doing it this way I don't have to

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.710 
by doing it this way I don't have to
have<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.640> bunch<00:04:33.640> of<00:04:33.820> corners<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.480> when<00:04:34.630> you

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
have a bunch of corners and when you

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.740 
have a bunch of corners and when you
have<00:04:34.870> an<00:04:34.990> irregular<00:04:35.470> shape<00:04:35.500> it<00:04:36.340> just<00:04:36.630> works<00:04:37.630> a

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
have an irregular shape it just works a

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.190 
have an irregular shape it just works a
lot<00:04:37.900> nicer

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.140

yields cut I just wanted to show you a
couple<00:06:03.490> things<00:06:03.520> about<00:06:03.850> the<00:06:04.180> swath<00:06:04.420> that<00:06:04.630> well

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
couple things about the swath that well

the<00:06:04.870> tract<00:06:05.080> is<00:06:05.260> cooling<00:06:05.590> down<00:06:05.740> here<00:06:06.040> I

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
the tract is cooling down here I

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.930 
the tract is cooling down here I
mentioned<00:06:07.300> earlier<00:06:07.570> it's<00:06:07.750> a<00:06:07.840> disc<00:06:08.050> fine

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
mentioned earlier it's a disc fine

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.830 
mentioned earlier it's a disc fine
that<00:06:10.510> means<00:06:10.750> this<00:06:11.050> swather<00:06:11.800> uses<00:06:12.220> these<00:06:13.180> discs

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
that means this swather uses these discs

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.130 
that means this swather uses these discs
with<00:06:14.800> two<00:06:15.070> knives<00:06:15.280> per<00:06:15.670> side<00:06:15.910> to<00:06:16.300> cut<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:17.020> hay

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
with two knives per side to cut the hay

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.250 
with two knives per side to cut the hay
instead<00:06:17.530> of<00:06:17.680> the<00:06:17.890> old-fashioned<00:06:18.790> or<00:06:19.260> sicko

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260

instead of the old-fashioned or sicko
bar<00:06:20.500> that's<00:06:20.710> it's<00:06:21.310> still<00:06:21.580> in<00:06:21.760> a<00:06:22.090> butte<00:06:22.480> wide

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
bar that's it's still in a butte wide

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.570 
bar that's it's still in a butte wide
use<00:06:22.930> but<00:06:23.320> this<00:06:23.710> is<00:06:23.890> a<00:06:23.920> little<00:06:24.160> bit<00:06:24.310> newer

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
use but this is a little bit newer

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.570 
use but this is a little bit newer
design<00:06:24.940> probably<00:06:25.980> probably<00:06:26.980> fifteen<00:06:27.400> years

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
design probably probably fifteen years

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.780 
design probably probably fifteen years
old<00:06:27.700> or<00:06:27.910> so<00:06:28.770> just<00:06:29.770> very<00:06:29.920> efficient<00:06:30.430> cutting

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790 
old or so just very efficient cutting

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.030 
old or so just very efficient cutting
these<00:06:31.420> are<00:06:31.600> the<00:06:31.690> rollers<00:06:32.230> and<00:06:32.590> back<00:06:32.740> there

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
these are the rollers and back there

these are the rollers and back there
that<00:06:33.220> I<00:06:33.250> was<00:06:33.430> talking<00:06:33.610> about<00:06:33.790> earlier<00:06:33.940> they're

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
that I was talking about earlier they're

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.420 
that I was talking about earlier they're
said<00:06:34.570> about<00:06:34.780> 3/16<00:06:35.500> apart<00:06:35.830> so<00:06:36.010> they'll<00:06:36.160> crimp

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
said about 3/16 apart so they'll crimp

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.670 
said about 3/16 apart so they'll crimp
the<00:06:36.550> stems<00:06:36.820> as<00:06:37.030> they<00:06:37.150> run<00:06:37.330> between<00:06:37.510> them<00:06:37.870> they

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:38.680 
the stems as they run between them they

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.610 
the stems as they run between them they
don't<00:06:38.860> actually<00:06:39.010> touch<00:06:39.340> but<00:06:40.330> it'll<00:06:41.170> crimp<00:06:41.440> all

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
don't actually touch but it'll crimp all

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.230 
don't actually touch but it'll crimp all
the<00:06:41.740> stems<00:06:41.980> and<00:06:42.220> really<00:06:42.490> speed<00:06:42.760> down<00:06:42.940> the<00:06:43.090> dry

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
the stems and really speed down the dry

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.420 
the stems and really speed down the dry
time<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:44.500> other<00:06:44.620> thing<00:06:44.830> I<00:06:44.890> wanted<00:06:45.130> to<00:06:45.220> show

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
time the other thing I wanted to show

time the other thing I wanted to show
you<00:06:45.490> was<00:06:45.900> this<00:06:46.900> tractor<00:06:47.380> and<00:06:47.680> swather<00:06:48.400> of<00:06:48.610> this

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:48.940 
you was this tractor and swather of this

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.690 
you was this tractor and swather of this
swather<00:06:49.360> is<00:06:49.540> a<00:06:50.040> hydro<00:06:51.040> sling<00:06:51.220> swather<00:06:51.550> like<00:06:51.670> I

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:51.700 
swather is a hydro sling swather like I

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.660 
swather is a hydro sling swather like I
showed<00:06:51.940> you<00:06:52.000> earlier<00:06:52.800> this<00:06:53.800> is<00:06:53.860> the<00:06:54.160> pivot

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:54.670 
showed you earlier this is the pivot

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.400 
showed you earlier this is the pivot
mount<00:06:54.850> on<00:06:55.180> the<00:06:55.300> tractor<00:06:55.540> to<00:06:55.900> allow<00:06:56.140> it<00:06:56.380> to

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
mount on the tractor to allow it to
