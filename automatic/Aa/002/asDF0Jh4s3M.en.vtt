last five years and that you know that
stability<00:01:07.369> of<00:01:07.759> the<00:01:07.850> platform<00:01:08.330> for<00:01:08.869> them<00:01:09.050> to

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
stability of the platform for them to

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.020 
stability of the platform for them to
have<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.740> consistent<00:01:10.100> take<00:01:10.460> off<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:10.850> be<00:01:10.940> able

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
have a consistent take off and be able

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.490 
have a consistent take off and be able
to<00:01:11.180> do<00:01:11.330> their<00:01:11.479> very<00:01:11.720> hard<00:01:11.960> dives<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:12.320> they're

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
to do their very hard dives that they're

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.800 
to do their very hard dives that they're
now<00:01:12.619> doing<00:01:12.680> is<00:01:13.090> one<00:01:14.090> of<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.240> most<00:01:14.360> important

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
now doing is one of the most important

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.999 
now doing is one of the most important
things<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.320> that's<00:01:15.560> something<00:01:15.770> they<00:01:15.979> can

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
things so that's something they can

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.190 
things so that's something they can
count<00:01:16.340> on<00:01:16.460> it's<00:01:16.580> level<00:01:17.000> it's<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:17.840> know<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.110> it

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
count on it's level it's you know and it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.680 
count on it's level it's you know and it
doesn't<00:01:18.410> bounce<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:19.039> doesn't<00:01:19.640> give<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.180> this

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
doesn't bounce it doesn't give so this

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.150 
doesn't bounce it doesn't give so this
is<00:01:20.810> exactly<00:01:21.200> what<00:01:21.380> they're<00:01:21.500> looking<00:01:21.800> for<00:01:24.160> the

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.160 
is exactly what they're looking for the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.880 
is exactly what they're looking for the
sports<00:01:25.550> nature<00:01:26.300> is<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.780> dangerous<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:27.649> know

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
sports nature is is dangerous you know

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.529 
sports nature is is dangerous you know
we're<00:01:28.070> jumping<00:01:28.250> from<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.610> high<00:01:28.759> place<00:01:29.090> at<00:01:29.509> a

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
we're jumping from a high place at a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.030 
we're jumping from a high place at a
high<00:01:29.780> rate<00:01:29.990> of<00:01:30.020> speed<00:01:30.259> by<00:01:30.530> the<00:01:30.619> time<00:01:30.830> we<00:01:30.950> hit

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
high rate of speed by the time we hit

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.609 
high rate of speed by the time we hit
the<00:01:31.100> water<00:01:31.369> a<00:01:31.729> mistake<00:01:32.689> can<00:01:32.840> be<00:01:32.960> really

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
the water a mistake can be really

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.520 
the water a mistake can be really
dangerous<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:35.810> makes<00:01:36.229> me<00:01:36.350> feel<00:01:36.500> a

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
dangerous and so it makes me feel a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.260 
dangerous and so it makes me feel a
little<00:01:36.710> bit<00:01:36.860> safer<00:01:37.369> to<00:01:37.520> know<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:37.909> okay

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
little bit safer to know that okay

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.260 
little bit safer to know that okay

there's a whole team behind the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.429 
there's a whole team behind the
construction<00:01:41.510> of<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.900> platform<00:01:42.229> to<00:01:42.350> make

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
construction of the platform to make

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.320 
construction of the platform to make
sure<00:01:42.590> it's<00:01:42.830> a<00:01:42.979> solid<00:01:43.340> as<00:01:43.430> possible<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:44.060> gives

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
sure it's a solid as possible that gives

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.600 
sure it's a solid as possible that gives
us<00:01:44.450> a<00:01:44.509> good<00:01:44.689> start<00:01:45.200> point<00:01:45.500> and<00:01:45.710> then<00:01:46.369> when<00:01:46.520> you
