be<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.950> yeah<00:02:17.519> you're<00:02:17.700> right<00:02:17.790> i<00:02:17.849> guess<00:02:18.060> if<00:02:18.209> the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
be that yeah you're right i guess if the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
blind side ended up being kind of an

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.190 
blind side ended up being kind of an
Oscar<00:02:20.310> yeah<00:02:20.610> it'd<00:02:20.970> be<00:02:21.180> an<00:02:21.450> oscar<00:02:21.750> bri<00:02:21.840> movie
