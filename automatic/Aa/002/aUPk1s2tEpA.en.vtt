00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.829
 start to put a little thicker and 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.030
 begins to grasp the color of nutella 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.979
 this means that it is almost 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.759
 finished and is almost ready to put it 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.759
