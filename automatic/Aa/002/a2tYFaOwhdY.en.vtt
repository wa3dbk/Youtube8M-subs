hopefully you can see that when I lift

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.650 
hopefully you can see that when I lift
it<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:04.950> there's<00:02:05.370> a<00:02:05.610> mirror<00:02:05.970> at<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.450> back

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
it out there's a mirror at the back

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.719 
it out there's a mirror at the back
where<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.380> rest<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.800> chain<00:02:08.039> gets<00:02:08.220> sort<00:02:08.640> of

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
where the rest of the chain gets sort of

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.660 
where the rest of the chain gets sort of
stored<00:02:09.590> so<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.890> carefully<00:02:11.099> hang<00:02:11.549> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
stored so you have to carefully hang the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.860 
stored so you have to carefully hang the
chain<00:02:11.909> down<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.299> there

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
chain down in there

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.790 
chain down in there
and<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.500> hangs<00:02:14.239> I'll<00:02:15.239> show<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.110> low<00:02:16.319> on

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and it hangs I'll show you that low on

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.960 
and it hangs I'll show you that low on
these<00:02:17.670> little<00:02:17.879> hooks<00:02:19.459> so<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.519> gotta<00:02:20.700> try<00:02:20.910> and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
these little hooks so you gotta try and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.910 
these little hooks so you gotta try and
make<00:02:21.150> sure<00:02:21.330> they<00:02:21.510> are<00:02:21.569> even<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.290> displays

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
make sure they are even so it displays

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.440 
make sure they are even so it displays
in<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.129> middle<00:02:23.480> and<00:02:24.590> they<00:02:25.590> won't<00:02:25.800> pop<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.129> out

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
in the middle and they won't pop it out

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.949 
in the middle and they won't pop it out
it<00:02:27.450> only<00:02:27.540> comes<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.790> then<00:02:29.910> you<00:02:29.940> see<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.690> chain

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
it only comes and then you see the chain

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.910 
it only comes and then you see the chain
itself<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> time<00:02:34.410> Turner<00:02:34.799> we're

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
itself so this is the time Turner we're

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.830 
itself so this is the time Turner we're
going<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.099> take<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.430> off<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.269> display<00:02:36.569> now

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
going to take it off of the display now

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.479 
going to take it off of the display now
so<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.470> wear<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.799> if<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.040> want

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
so you can wear it if you want

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.190 
so you can wear it if you want
I<00:02:38.519> think<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.330> looks<00:02:39.450> really<00:02:39.690> pretty<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.019> this

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
I think it looks really pretty and this

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.820 
I think it looks really pretty and this

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
is flavor I want to play and wear it

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.900 
is flavor I want to play and wear it

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
from time to time

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.479 
from time to time
I<00:02:44.940> just<00:02:45.239> want<00:02:45.450> got<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.780> there<00:02:46.799> you've<00:02:47.370> got

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
the Harry Potter logo etched into the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.589 
the Harry Potter logo etched into the
mirror<00:02:50.519> at<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.670> back<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:52.650> yeah<00:02:52.890> let's<00:02:53.160> would

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
mirror at the back so yeah let's would

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.550 
mirror at the back so yeah let's would
don't<00:02:54.599> know<00:02:54.660> what<00:02:54.810> would<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.319> think<00:02:55.470> it's

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
don't know what would and I think it's

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.100 
don't know what would and I think it's
posh<00:02:55.739> would<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.610> pop<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.810> prepared

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
posh would but just pop it just prepared

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.449 
posh would but just pop it just prepared
on<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.260> way<00:02:58.379> here<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.010> can<00:02:59.190> see<00:02:59.340> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
on the way here just so you can see the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.170 
on the way here just so you can see the
time<00:02:59.700> Turner<00:03:00.000> clearly<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:02.640> time<00:03:02.849> center

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
time Turner clearly the time center

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.890 
time Turner clearly the time center
itself<00:03:04.640> covered<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.819> metal<00:03:06.209> I'm<00:03:06.540> not<00:03:06.690> sure

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
itself covered in a metal I'm not sure

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.259 
itself covered in a metal I'm not sure
us<00:03:07.250> can<00:03:08.250> take<00:03:08.459> off<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.640> top<00:03:08.849> my<00:03:08.970> head<00:03:09.000> whether

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
us can take off the top my head whether

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.759 
us can take off the top my head whether
it's<00:03:09.510> gold<00:03:10.410> plated<00:03:10.890> or<00:03:11.010> not<00:03:11.190> but<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.629> have<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
it's gold plated or not but you have the

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.680 
it's gold plated or not but you have the
middle<00:03:14.010> bit<00:03:14.160> feels<00:03:14.900> possibly<00:03:15.900> plastic<00:03:17.690> and

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
middle bit feels possibly plastic and

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.300 
middle bit feels possibly plastic and
it's<00:03:18.810> got<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.959> bit<00:03:19.109> of<00:03:19.139> sand<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.829> which

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
it's got a bit of sand in it which

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.030 
it's got a bit of sand in it which
quickly<00:03:21.209> flips<00:03:21.600> through<00:03:21.859> pretty<00:03:22.859> much

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
quickly flips through pretty much

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.860 
quickly flips through pretty much
instantly<00:03:23.519> it's<00:03:23.760> quite<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> big<00:03:24.209> hole<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:24.660> the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
instantly it's quite a big hole in the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.699 
instantly it's quite a big hole in the
middle<00:03:26.389> we've<00:03:27.389> got<00:03:27.510> little<00:03:27.720> holes<00:03:27.900> around

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
middle we've got little holes around

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.259 
middle we've got little holes around
here<00:03:29.160> for<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.639> it<00:03:30.209> sort<00:03:30.359> of<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.480> star<00:03:31.340> look<00:03:32.340> and

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
here for that it sort of a star look and

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.870 
here for that it sort of a star look and
you<00:03:33.450> can<00:03:33.630> rotate<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.410> middle<00:03:34.650> bit<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:35.010> don't

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
you can rotate the middle bit I don't

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.819 
you can rotate the middle bit I don't
think<00:03:36.319> yeah<00:03:37.319> there<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.650> go<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.549> middle<00:03:38.760> bit

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
think yeah there you go the middle bit

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:46.159 
think yeah there you go the middle bit
it's<00:03:40.829> bit<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:42.239> then<00:03:43.069> it's<00:03:44.069> bit<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.930> universe

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
it's bit and then it's bit the universe

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.199 
it's bit and then it's bit the universe
it<00:03:47.180> you've<00:03:48.180> got<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:50.310> nice<00:03:50.459> inscription<00:03:51.120> I
