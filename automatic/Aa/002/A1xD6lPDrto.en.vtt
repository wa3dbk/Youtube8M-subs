can tho the one thing that bugs me about
the<00:02:12.890> gameplay<00:02:13.100> is<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.880> perspective<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.990> I

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
the gameplay is the perspective and I

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.720 
the gameplay is the perspective and I
understand<00:02:15.620> why<00:02:15.770> they<00:02:16.040> did<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.280> but<00:02:16.490> at<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
understand why they did it but at the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.550 
understand why they did it but at the
same<00:02:16.910> time<00:02:17.060> it<00:02:17.240> really<00:02:17.510> throws<00:02:17.960> me<00:02:18.020> off<00:02:18.290> and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
same time it really throws me off and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.290 
same time it really throws me off and
distorts<00:02:19.010> my<00:02:20.470> immersion<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.740> guess<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.090> on

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
just moving you have this kind of I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.200 
just moving you have this kind of I
usually<00:02:36.710> call<00:02:36.860> second<00:02:37.460> person<00:02:37.850> even<00:02:38.150> though

it just got added to scene which means

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.970 
it just got added to scene which means
the<00:04:21.880> potential<00:04:22.880> for<00:04:23.030> hackers<00:04:23.270> just

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
the potential for hackers just

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.530 
the potential for hackers just
skyrocketed<00:04:24.980> but<00:04:25.460> I<00:04:25.490> think<00:04:25.610> we<00:04:25.820> should<00:04:25.850> be<00:04:26.330> all

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
skyrocketed but I think we should be all

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.090 
skyrocketed but I think we should be all
right<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.350> of<00:04:27.440> course<00:04:27.650> if<00:04:27.770> you<00:04:27.860> do<00:04:27.949> encounter
