 he faces here opponents of 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.400
 quality of 105 4 and 1 for the choice 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.830
 priority and xavier thomas thomas

 the quintés in flat and of course the 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.150
 Pau hurdles won him both 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.720
 first releases their discipline before 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.340
 to show up and fall it was in 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.630
 the price camille duboscq a list must 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.160
 to play at pau she had won race 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.320
 that day when she injected her 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.000
 partner here she starts in auteuil 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.890
 with serious claims in my opinion 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.830
 she is a laureate in power on the 405 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.810
 highway in the sixth bedtime 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.550
 is very confident with the 601 honor at 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.080
 king a horse that he believes is a good 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.150
 jumper he according to him the horse possesses 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.709
 a very first chance 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.090
 the race needs to be sufficiently 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.320
 pace and if so it should not 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.180
 not be far from the truth anyway 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.560
 serge foucher very confident you should 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.420
 find serge foucher's interview 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.400
 on our website in the section of 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.470
 interviews and news in this 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.810
 test one will be wary however due 604.5 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.730
 hall that starts on the steeple but who 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.050
 in the light of what he showed to help 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.120
 must be able to do well 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.000
 from the outset 626 in four races at 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:30.900
 Targets and Auteuil 2nd 4th and 6th 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.420
 with the second 205 4 the 4th 405 and 6th 6 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.740
 in 1 604 beaumont lomagne I could 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.940
 talk to christophe have he is 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.500
 very confident that the blood has acquired the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.540
 beautiful horse that ran very well 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.890
 lately in Toulouse to be beaten that 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.340
 by five years estimated by the family 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.720
 martens 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.340
 In particular, he was the winner 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.290
 Eastern a safe bet in the region 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.820
 so the 120 kg new first chance 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.380
 according to christophe is who would 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.209
 disappointed not to fight for victory 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.630
 in the second I advise you 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.100
 101 amerigo vespucci who stays on a 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.450
 second place in strasbourg his last 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.970
 coming to the southwest had ended 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.770
 by a success in Bordeaux on February 8 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.600
 the opposition is in its young ropes 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.580
 kristofferson the coach's son 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.989
 hacker kristofferson 20 the driver in 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.000
 trust it will oppose him sells his 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.550
 proof the protégé of daniel vialelle 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.560
 205 atos of the regular pistol shaped and 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.940
 the 202nd apollo stars who stay on a 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.329
 success in the region on the racecourse 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.290
 so auch ch so 200 1 205 202 priority 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.770
 for me at 201 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.930
 finally in the city 6th christophe is 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.700
 not negative with the 617 at zero rate which 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.169
 makes his return to trotting his 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.910
 last run on 2000 m at 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.380
 bordeaux aimed to perfect its 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.570
 condition for this race and for 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.770
 this commitment aimed here he can do 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.600
 the arrival at good odds and why not 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.060
 win an interesting odds 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.900
 617 to few euros beware in his 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.310
 coach is confident 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.020
 besides christophe is also 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.700
 confident with the 705 briochine down 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.740
 according to him the lot is in his strings 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.360
 the horse faced a beautiful engagement 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.680
 who would be disappointed not to finish 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.150
 on the podium of this race 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.680
 so pay attention to christophe payet at 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.410
 course of this meeting subscription with 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.880
 the 101 useful lebel with the 617 viola 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.280
 euros for a nice odds 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.500
 and with the 705 Brioude low favorite 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.150
 logic concerning the meeting iii to 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.010
 Rouen I know that Michel Deniau is 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.180
 confident that 518 to this blu a choice that 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.860
 is delicate in the first meters of 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.180
 race also during the course but 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.190
 it's a quality horse if it does not 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.320
 do not compromise his chances at the start 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.680
 he has the perfect means to make a 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.210
 good 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.979
 kilometers and why not come 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.350
 dictate his law in the final phase 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.699
 the 518 at this blu a horse that is worth a 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.350
 lot like that according to his 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.750
 entourage meeting three weapons have 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.550
 crossed the 518 excellent Sunday at all 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.550
 very good games very soon on say
