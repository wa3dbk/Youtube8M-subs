00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.100
 you know that I bought bread neither more nor 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.480
 less but not anywhere in the 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.550
 forn vilamala of the old quarter of 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.079
 barcelona you know what you think of me 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.430
 bakers of barcelona the first prize 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.399
 of the city ​​is that bread is a 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.500
 very old food that flour salt and 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.480
 water that can have this bad because 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.400
 nothing is that frankly I do not understand by 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.930
 what sometimes we organize so much maybe 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.000
 because it is fattening because it has been eaten 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.860
 too much you're in a lot of 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.659
 nonsense about bread for example that 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.180
 toast fatten less than bread 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.610
 cool that is to say i catch this 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.979
 last piece of bread is a bit like that and 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.899
 statutes are the one that theoretically are 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.509
 the same what you would say that fattens more 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.550
 fresh bread certainly not true as 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.220
 because there is more water here and water does not 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.660
 fattening other nonsense that is said to 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.250
 you have to remove the crumb from the bread and how 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.050
 Let's remove the crumbs friend if it 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.220
 that has more water is that the bread the 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.070
 poor this they say a lot of nonsense 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.649
 like it fattens a lot but if they are 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.470
 250 calories the 100 grams and each 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.570
 slice of these does not reach 10 but 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.830
 how to make bread so bad we do it 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.690
 aims the bread can enter 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.890
 perfectly within this diet 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.550
 daily is pure Mediterranean diet 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.800
 some gastronomic suggestion takes two 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.229
 slices of bread a few slices 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.320
 of tomato and a little mozzarella between 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.000
 bread and bread you close and you taste is for 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.479
 true that I do not have much fabric now 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.479
