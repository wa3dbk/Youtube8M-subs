make your bow drill but we kind of

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.749 
make your bow drill but we kind of
separate<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.860> three<00:01:53.040> parts<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.399> know<00:01:53.520> this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
separate in three parts you know this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.280 
separate in three parts you know this

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
to do that the skill set itself the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.490 
to do that the skill set itself the

skill set of actually carving the right

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.719 
skill set of actually carving the right
kit<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.979> also<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> skill<00:01:59.520> set<00:01:59.700> of

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
kit and also the skill set of

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.670 
kit and also the skill set of
identifying<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> proper

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
identifying the proper

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.580 
identifying the proper
no<00:02:02.510> pieces<00:02:03.510> of<00:02:03.690> equipment<00:02:04.050> or<00:02:04.260> proper

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
no pieces of equipment or proper

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.800 
no pieces of equipment or proper
material<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.190> to<00:02:05.310> say<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:06.090> construct<00:02:06.510> the<00:02:06.600> kit

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
material is to say to construct the kit

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.350 
material is to say to construct the kit
so<00:02:07.620> what<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:08.009> do<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.190> actually<00:02:08.490> we<00:02:08.729> first

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so what we do is actually we first

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.910 
so what we do is actually we first
starts<00:02:09.630> you<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:09.720> with<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.960> premade<00:02:10.410> kit<00:02:10.710> with

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
starts you out with a premade kit with

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.220 
starts you out with a premade kit with
ideal<00:02:11.310> materials<00:02:11.880> and<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:12.660> we're<00:02:12.810> just<00:02:12.840> focus

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
ideal materials and so we're just focus

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.930 
ideal materials and so we're just focus
on<00:02:13.350> your<00:02:13.500> form<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.130> establishing<00:02:14.910> that

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
on your form and establishing that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.510 
on your form and establishing that
muscle<00:02:15.240> memory<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.990> make<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.800> primitive<00:02:17.280> fire

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
muscle memory to make the primitive fire

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.970 
muscle memory to make the primitive fire
and<00:02:17.790> then<00:02:18.270> from<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.410> go<00:02:19.560> on<00:02:19.770> to

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
and then from that that we go on to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.170 
and then from that that we go on to
actually<00:02:20.310> you're<00:02:20.400> carving<00:02:20.790> your<00:02:20.850> kit<00:02:21.030> with

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
actually you're carving your kit with

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.880 
actually you're carving your kit with
the<00:02:21.270> idea<00:02:21.540> materials<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.260> last<00:02:22.500> part<00:02:22.740> of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the idea materials and the last part of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.320 
the idea materials and the last part of
courses<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.490> went<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:23.940> finding

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
courses you went out there and finding

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.150 
courses you went out there and finding
the<00:02:24.450> ideal<00:02:24.570> materials<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.740> reason<00:02:26.040> being

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
the ideal materials and the reason being

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.740 
the ideal materials and the reason being
is<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.520> work<00:02:26.670> at<00:02:26.790> back<00:02:26.940> versus<00:02:27.330> because<00:02:27.600> by

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
is you work at back versus because by

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.230 
is you work at back versus because by
the<00:02:27.840> time<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.530> are<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.850> rely<00:02:30.120> on

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
the time that you are to rely on

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.520 
the time that you are to rely on
yourself<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.630> go<00:02:30.720> out<00:02:30.810> there<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:30.959> find<00:02:31.230> ideal

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
yourself to go out there and find ideal

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.620 
yourself to go out there and find ideal
materials<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.520> should<00:02:32.670> have<00:02:32.790> almost<00:02:33.180> not

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
materials you should have almost not

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.570 
materials you should have almost not
match<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.260> skill<00:02:34.470> but<00:02:34.680> amisha<00:02:34.980> of<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.220> really

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
match the skill but amisha of a really

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.270 
match the skill but amisha of a really
good<00:02:35.850> grasp<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:37.110> skill<00:02:37.440> set<00:02:37.680> well<00:02:38.220> I

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
good grasp of that skill set well I

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.949 
good grasp of that skill set well I
think<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.790> makes<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.150> all<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.360> more<00:02:39.540> with

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
think that it makes it all the more with

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.660 
think that it makes it all the more with
while<00:02:40.170> because<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.890> hardest<00:02:41.190> part<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.459> course

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
while because the hardest part of course

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.640 
while because the hardest part of course
is<00:02:41.820> getting<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.120> flame<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.600> once<00:02:42.780> you've<00:02:42.959> if

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
is getting the flame and once you've if

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.170 
is getting the flame and once you've if
you<00:02:43.770> put<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.980> hardest<00:02:44.250> part<00:02:44.520> put<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
you put the hardest part put it up the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.270 
you put the hardest part put it up the
front<00:02:45.510> and<00:02:45.690> then<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.440> know<00:02:46.560> everything<00:02:47.160> else

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
front and then you know everything else

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.650 
front and then you know everything else
kind<00:02:47.459> of<00:02:47.580> comes<00:02:47.850> naturally<00:02:47.940> because<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.450> know

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
kind of comes naturally because you know

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.180 
kind of comes naturally because you know
already<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.140> know<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.680> do<00:02:49.770> this<00:02:49.800> I've<00:02:50.040> done

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
already I know I can do this I've done

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.160 
already I know I can do this I've done
this<00:02:50.250> before<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.209> just<00:02:51.360> need<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.480> find<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
this before so I just need to find the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.360 
this before so I just need to find the
proper<00:02:52.470> materials<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:54.680> pollinated<00:02:55.680> to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
proper materials and pollinated to

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.340 
proper materials and pollinated to
construct<00:02:56.850> my<00:02:57.000> kit<00:02:57.510> properly<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.110> get<00:02:58.230> that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
construct my kit properly to get that

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.370 
construct my kit properly to get that
fire<00:02:58.560> anyway<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.720> I've<00:03:00.930> never<00:03:01.140> bought

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
fire anyway so I've never bought

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.870 
fire anyway so I've never bought
something<00:03:01.650> like<00:03:01.830> this<00:03:01.950> before<00:03:02.130> but<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.610> thought

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
something like this before but I thought

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.580 
something like this before but I thought
oh<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.390> not<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.540> bad<00:03:03.780> idea<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.170> people<00:03:04.500> are

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
oh this is not a bad idea and people are

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.110 
oh this is not a bad idea and people are
you<00:03:04.650> interesting<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.130> try<00:03:05.730> out<00:03:05.910> some<00:03:06.090> new

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
you interesting to try out some new

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.289 
you interesting to try out some new
stuff<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:06.780> pretty<00:03:06.959> cool<00:03:07.110> idea<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:07.650> school

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
stuff so it's pretty cool idea so school
