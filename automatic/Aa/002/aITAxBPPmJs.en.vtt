the finished comb makes sense it's very

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.940 
the finished comb makes sense it's very
straightforward<00:03:00.170> he's<00:03:01.170> got<00:03:01.319> really<00:03:01.650> nice

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
straightforward he's got really nice

just<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:09.120> kind<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.390> get<00:03:09.480> everything<00:03:09.750> to<00:03:09.989> sit

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
just to kind of get everything to sit

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.710 
just to kind of get everything to sit
and<00:03:11.370> once<00:03:11.550> again<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:11.819> is<00:03:11.970> just<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.300> rough<00:03:12.480> comb

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
and once again this is just a rough comb

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.720 
and once again this is just a rough comb
so<00:03:13.650> we're<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:13.860> kind<00:03:14.159> of<00:03:14.220> quickly

the<00:03:20.459> details<00:03:20.879> are<00:03:21.390> very<00:03:21.629> key<00:03:21.959> in<00:03:22.140> these<00:03:22.319> cuts

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
the details are very key in these cuts

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.199 
the details are very key in these cuts
kind<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.170> work<00:03:25.349> this<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:26.459> area<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.879> always

callek area and kind of comb through the
hair<00:03:35.420> quick<00:03:37.310> consistent

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.560 

some<00:03:42.130> of<00:03:42.220> these<00:03:42.310> flyaways<00:03:42.820> just<00:03:43.240> a<00:03:43.330> quick

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
some of these flyaways just a quick

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.300 
some of these flyaways just a quick
trail<00:03:43.870> with<00:03:44.020> your<00:03:44.170> finger<00:03:44.470> get<00:03:44.800> some<00:03:44.980> just<00:03:45.130> sit

trail with your finger get some just sit
right<00:03:45.460> into<00:03:45.700> place

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.010 

got<00:03:54.100> it<00:03:56.580> so<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.610> benefit<00:03:58.090> of<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.240> water-based

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
got it so the benefit of the water-based

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.430 
got it so the benefit of the water-based
pomades<00:04:00.540> first<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.660> all<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.870> it<00:04:01.930> washes<00:04:02.260> out

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
pomades first of all that it washes out

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.480 
pomades first of all that it washes out
the<00:04:02.940> second<00:04:03.940> of<00:04:04.030> all<00:04:04.740> it's<00:04:05.740> got<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:05.950> set<00:04:06.220> time

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
the second of all it's got a set time

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.570 
the second of all it's got a set time
and<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:07.540> really<00:04:07.720> gets<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.140> its<00:04:08.380> nice<00:04:09.100> tacky

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
and it really gets to its nice tacky

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.020 
and it really gets to its nice tacky
stage<00:04:10.470> too<00:04:11.470> much<00:04:11.650> water<00:04:11.950> it's<00:04:12.550> not<00:04:12.730> good

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
stage too much water it's not good

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.870 
stage too much water it's not good
because<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.720> is<00:04:13.750> water-based<00:04:14.610> so<00:04:15.610> you<00:04:15.670> get

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
because it is water-based so you get

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.530 
because it is water-based so you get
that<00:04:16.030> nice<00:04:17.790> perfect<00:04:18.790> balance<00:04:19.180> between<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
that nice perfect balance between the

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.230 
that nice perfect balance between the
two<00:04:20.040> gives<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.160> maximum<00:04:21.370> control<00:04:22.030> that's

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
two gives you maximum control that's

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.600 
two gives you maximum control that's
what<00:04:22.420> the<00:04:23.110> labor<00:04:23.320> at<00:04:23.440> original<00:04:24.100> pomade<00:04:24.400> gives

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
what the labor at original pomade gives

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.670 
what the labor at original pomade gives
you<00:04:24.730> is<00:04:24.790> maximum<00:04:25.300> control<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.440> I'm<00:04:26.530> really

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
you is maximum control so I'm really

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.720 
you is maximum control so I'm really
liking<00:04:26.920> that<00:04:27.040> a<00:04:27.160> lot<00:04:27.340> I'm<00:04:27.400> going<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.580> go<00:04:27.640> ahead

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
liking that a lot I'm going to go ahead

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.250 
liking that a lot I'm going to go ahead
and<00:04:27.940> use<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.150> fine<00:04:28.390> side<00:04:28.690> of<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:28.870> comb<00:04:29.050> just

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
and use the fine side of the comb just

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.320 
and use the fine side of the comb just
to<00:04:29.440> drape<00:04:30.040> off<00:04:30.250> some<00:04:30.520> of<00:04:30.550> these<00:04:30.730> areas<00:04:31.090> here
