00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
problem at all this exact same thing

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.649 
problem at all this exact same thing
the<00:01:50.159> reason<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.759> got<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> spike<00:01:51.420> thing

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the reason it's like got the spike thing

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.670 
the reason it's like got the spike thing
is<00:01:51.869> first<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.439> all<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:54.049> well<00:01:55.049> I've<00:01:55.439> seen

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
is first of all because well I've seen

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530 
is first of all because well I've seen
like<00:01:55.860> bowel<00:01:56.100> songs<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.640> customs<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.270> stuff

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
like bowel songs like customs and stuff

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.600 
like bowel songs like customs and stuff
that<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> spike<00:01:58.649> appear<00:01:58.979> at<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> tag<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.579> a

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that have a spike appear at the tag is a

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.450 
that have a spike appear at the tag is a
spike<00:02:00.350> like<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.950> were<00:02:02.040> holding<00:02:02.189> like

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
spike like so if you were holding like

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.420 
spike like so if you were holding like
this<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.729> could<00:02:02.820> actually<00:02:02.909> whack<00:02:03.360> someone

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
this you could actually whack someone

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.609 
this you could actually whack someone
and<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:06.390> thought<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.719> was<00:02:06.930> cool<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.350> added

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
and I thought that was cool so I added

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.520 
and I thought that was cool so I added
it<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.509> wasn't<00:02:09.810> like<00:02:10.050> designing<00:02:10.379> anything

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
it but I wasn't like designing anything

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.160 
it but I wasn't like designing anything
around<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.039> or<00:02:11.730> anything<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.629> because<00:02:12.810> I

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
around that or anything is because I

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.760 
around that or anything is because I
just<00:02:13.200> haven't

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
just haven't

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
just haven't
more<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.130> these<00:02:14.280> long<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.420> these<00:02:15.600> like

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
more of these long have these like

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.470 
more of these long have these like
pretty<00:02:16.860> long<00:02:17.100> pieces<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:17.970> not<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> way

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
pretty long pieces but not all the way

piece which was this huge one so I

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.150

see T latch part of it here is the over
piece<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.350> put<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.650> washer<00:04:37.979> between<00:04:38.610> this<00:04:38.820> and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
piece I put a washer between this and

piece I put a washer between this and
the<00:04:39.150> handle<00:04:39.570> so<00:04:39.810> would<00:04:40.400> have<00:04:41.400> enough<00:04:41.760> space

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
the handle so would have enough space

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.580

with<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.360> latch<00:04:42.540> going<00:04:42.870> but<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:43.260> does<00:04:43.410> gonna

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
with the latch going but it does gonna

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.040 
with the latch going but it does gonna
work<00:04:44.870> cool<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:46.080> mean<00:04:46.470> I<00:04:46.530> really<00:04:47.000> like<00:04:48.050> lock
