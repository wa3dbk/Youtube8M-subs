this is kind of the time where the whole
of<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.079> system<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.530> get<00:00:52.739> rid<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
of the the system just get rid of the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.010 
of the the system just get rid of the
almost<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.640> even<00:00:53.940> third<00:00:54.210> party<00:00:54.809> games

almost like even third party games
example<00:00:55.680> made<00:00:55.860> for<00:00:56.010> speed<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.489> starting<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> be

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
example made for speed as starting to be

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.790 
example made for speed as starting to be
like<00:00:57.750> no<00:00:57.780> we're<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.440> develop<00:00:58.590> for

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
like no we're not going to develop for

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.680 
like no we're not going to develop for
those<00:00:58.920> anymore<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.910> not<00:01:00.180> worth<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
those anymore because it's not worth the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.630 
those anymore because it's not worth the
time<00:01:00.930> as<00:01:01.140> much<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.649> was<00:01:01.770> before<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.340> a

development<00:01:09.780> time<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.560> places<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.280> Xbox

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
development time on the places for Xbox

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.850 
development time on the places for Xbox
one<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.790> PC<00:01:11.970> versions<00:01:12.479> alone<00:01:12.810> means<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.619> better

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
one and PC versions alone means a better

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.859 
one and PC versions alone means a better
product<00:01:14.460> overall<00:01:15.119> because<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> think

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
product overall because if you think

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.289 
product overall because if you think
about<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.530> when<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.369> make<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.850> game<00:01:18.090> that's

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
about this when you make a game that's

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.320 
about this when you make a game that's
on<00:01:18.450> last<00:01:18.930> gen<00:01:19.259> also<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.909> make<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
on last gen also you have to make the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.210 
on last gen also you have to make the
game<00:01:21.479> optimized<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.229> those<00:01:22.680> platforms<00:01:22.890> as

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
game optimized for those platforms as

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.190 
game optimized for those platforms as
well<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.700> whether<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.540> design<00:01:24.930> choices

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
well so whether that be design choices

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.749 
well so whether that be design choices
along<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.650> whole<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.130> development<00:01:26.610> which

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
along the whole of development which

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.429 
along the whole of development which
will<00:01:26.939> degrade<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.570> game<00:01:27.780> on<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> better

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
will degrade the game on the better

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.950 
will degrade the game on the better
systems<00:01:29.009> or<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> last<00:01:30.360> moment<00:01:30.810> of

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
systems or if it's the last moment of

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.480 
systems or if it's the last moment of
yeah<00:01:31.380> we've<00:01:31.530> got<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.799> spend<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.100> good<00:01:32.220> few

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
yeah we've got to spend a good few

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.620 
yeah we've got to spend a good few
months<00:01:32.820> getting<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.210> thing<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.479> actually

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
months getting this thing to actually

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.319 
months getting this thing to actually
work<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.590> last<00:01:34.770> gen<00:01:35.040> consoles<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.000> yeah<00:01:36.180> we

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
