00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
back at ESPN 2k5 and my source for all

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.369 
back at ESPN 2k5 and my source for all
of<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.590> game<00:00:41.010> fact<00:00:41.399> com

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
of this is game fact com

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.760 
of this is game fact com
so<00:00:43.379> if<00:00:43.739> they<00:00:44.309> were<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.610> add<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:45.770> 2004-2005

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
so if they were to add a 2004-2005

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.700 
so if they were to add a 2004-2005
Seattle<00:00:47.219> SuperSonics<00:00:47.610> team<00:00:48.059> into<00:00:48.989> NBA<00:00:49.110> 2k15

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
Seattle SuperSonics team into NBA 2k15

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.360 
Seattle SuperSonics team into NBA 2k15
or<00:00:50.449> possibly<00:00:51.449> add<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:52.170> Seattle<00:00:53.039> SuperSonics

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
or possibly add a Seattle SuperSonics

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.029 
or possibly add a Seattle SuperSonics
version<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.940> Ray<00:00:54.120> Allen<00:00:54.360> into<00:00:54.809> NBA<00:00:55.079> 2k15<00:00:55.739> my

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
version of Ray Allen into NBA 2k15 my

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.670 
version of Ray Allen into NBA 2k15 my
team<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.879> think<00:00:57.570> his<00:00:57.870> ratings<00:00:58.199> would<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.440> very

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
team I think his ratings would be very

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.770 
team I think his ratings would be very
similar<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.340> I'm<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.180> gonna<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.449> ahead<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
similar so I'm not gonna go ahead and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.299 
similar so I'm not gonna go ahead and
give<00:01:00.899> him<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> 92<00:01:01.500> overall<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.070> after

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
give him the 92 overall because after

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.880 
give him the 92 overall because after
looking<00:01:02.520> at<00:01:02.609> all<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.030> his<00:01:03.149> stats<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:04.680> can

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
looking at all of his stats you can

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.219 
looking at all of his stats you can
clearly<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:06.119> many<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.479> his<00:01:06.630> stats

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
clearly see that not many of his stats

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.160 
clearly see that not many of his stats
are<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.189> 90s<00:01:08.670> except<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> lot<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.049> his

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
are in the 90s except for a lot of his

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.230 
are in the 90s except for a lot of his
jump<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.590> well<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> shooting<00:01:11.640> stats<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
jump as well of a shooting stats this is

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.820 
jump as well of a shooting stats this is
the<00:01:12.420> two-point<00:01:12.840> shot<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.229> mid-range<00:01:13.530> shot

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the two-point shot the mid-range shot

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.670 
the two-point shot the mid-range shot
and<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.760> shoot<00:01:15.090> off<00:01:15.240> dribble<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.530> gonna

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
and the shoot off dribble so I'm gonna

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.770 
and the shoot off dribble so I'm gonna
go<00:01:16.799> ahead<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.130> give<00:01:17.220> him<00:01:17.310> an<00:01:17.430> 89<00:01:17.970> overall<00:01:18.479> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
go ahead and give him an 89 overall I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.109 
go ahead and give him an 89 overall I
feel<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.619> reason<00:01:20.159> will<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.310> reasonable

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
feel like that reason will be reasonable

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.149 
feel like that reason will be reasonable
because<00:01:21.290> Ray<00:01:22.290> Allen<00:01:22.799> never<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
because Ray Allen never really was a

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.429 
because Ray Allen never really was a
superstar<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.400> mean<00:01:26.659> superstars<00:01:27.659> always<00:01:28.140> make

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439

the<00:01:28.650> all-nba<00:01:28.979> first<00:01:29.189> team<00:01:29.600> superstars<00:01:30.600> are

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the all-nba first team superstars are

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.499 
the all-nba first team superstars are
players<00:01:31.500> who<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.100> lead<00:01:32.790> their<00:01:33.000> teams<00:01:33.240> through

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
players who can lead their teams through

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.370 
players who can lead their teams through
the<00:01:33.630> playoffs

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the playoffs

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.270 
the playoffs
I<00:01:34.470> mean<00:01:34.979> Kobe<00:01:35.369> Bryant<00:01:35.909> LeBron<00:01:36.479> James<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.070> many

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
I mean Kobe Bryant LeBron James so many

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.800 
I mean Kobe Bryant LeBron James so many
superstars<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:39.030> been<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> league<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.780> I

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
superstars have been in the league and I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.359 
superstars have been in the league and I
don't<00:01:39.960> think<00:01:40.200> Ray<00:01:40.320> Allen<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.220> I'm

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
don't think Ray Allen is one so I'm

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.819

gonna give him an 89 overall now I feel

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.100 
gonna give him an 89 overall now I feel
like<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.040> pretty<00:01:44.189> reasonable<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:45.090> am<00:01:45.869> gonna

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
because I think that's only right so at

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.420 
because I think that's only right so at
the<00:02:13.170> end<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.470> day

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
the end of the day

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.119
