we're<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.120> look<00:02:15.240> at<00:02:15.390> now<00:02:17.360> okay<00:02:18.360> now<00:02:18.510> here

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
we're going to look at now okay now here

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.280 
we're going to look at now okay now here
we<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:19.080> an<00:02:19.320> image<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.370> little<00:02:20.640> bit

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
we have an image that is a little bit

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.160 
we have an image that is a little bit
underexposed<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.630> little<00:02:24.660> bit<00:02:24.870> dark

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
underexposed that it's a little bit dark

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.470 
underexposed that it's a little bit dark
and<00:02:25.580> there's<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.640> few<00:02:26.850> ways<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.330> actually

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
and there's a few ways we can actually

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.290 
and there's a few ways we can actually
fix<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.200> now<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:29.010> program<00:02:29.490> i'm<00:02:29.700> using<00:02:29.730> is

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
fix that now the program i'm using is

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.370 
fix that now the program i'm using is
adobe<00:02:30.900> photoshop<00:02:31.470> elements<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:33.140> when<00:02:34.140> you

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
adobe photoshop elements and when you

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.410 
adobe photoshop elements and when you
buy<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:35.010> digital<00:02:35.340> camera<00:02:35.820> or<00:02:36.030> one<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.270> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
buy a digital camera or one of the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.180 
buy a digital camera or one of the
better<00:02:36.630> digital<00:02:36.870> cameras<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.680> actually<00:02:38.010> get

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
better digital cameras you actually get

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.710 
better digital cameras you actually get
this<00:02:38.400> thrown<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:39.000> it's<00:02:39.240> basically<00:02:39.600> a

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
this thrown in it's basically a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.130 
this thrown in it's basically a
watered-down<00:02:40.140> version<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:41.040> photoshop<00:02:42.140> okay

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
watered-down version of photoshop okay

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.910 
watered-down version of photoshop okay
so<00:02:43.200> what<00:02:43.500> we'll<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:44.100> there's<00:02:44.790> two<00:02:45.030> ways<00:02:45.209> of

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
so what we'll do is there's two ways of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.580 
so what we'll do is there's two ways of
with<00:02:46.920> an<00:02:47.160> exposure<00:02:47.940> one<00:02:48.750> ways<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.230> do<00:02:49.410> what's

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
with an exposure one ways to do what's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.070 
with an exposure one ways to do what's
called<00:02:49.800> an<00:02:50.010> auto<00:02:50.250> enhancement<00:02:51.150> now<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.780> just

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
called an auto enhancement now we just

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.590 
called an auto enhancement now we just
came<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.590> top<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.070> screen<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:54.150> advance

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
came to the top of the screen in advance

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.630 
came to the top of the screen in advance
and<00:02:56.120> from<00:02:57.120> there<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.780> can<00:02:57.810> go<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.320> auto<00:02:58.950> levels

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
and from there we can go to auto levels

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.240 
and from there we can go to auto levels
and<00:02:59.850> if<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.660> click<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.680> watch<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
and if I click on that just watch the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.910 
and if I click on that just watch the
image<00:03:04.459> takes<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.580> little<00:03:05.700> while<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.770> as<00:03:07.770> you

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
image takes a little while and as you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.250 
image takes a little while and as you
can<00:03:08.070> see<00:03:08.100> what<00:03:08.610> it's<00:03:08.730> done<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:08.970> it's

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
can see what it's done is it's

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.230 
can see what it's done is it's
brightened<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.320> up<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:11.370> problem<00:03:11.940> with<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
brightened it up the problem with the

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.479 
brightened it up the problem with the
auto<00:03:12.770> with<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.920> auto<00:03:15.200> auto<00:03:16.200> levels<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.250> that

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
auto with the auto auto levels is that

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.110 
auto with the auto auto levels is that
sometimes<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.720> over<00:03:19.080> does<00:03:19.290> them<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:20.430> we'll<00:03:20.970> go

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
sometimes it over does them so we'll go

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.960 
sometimes it over does them so we'll go
a<00:03:21.180> step<00:03:21.480> backwards<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.430> what<00:03:23.430> we'll<00:03:23.580> do<00:03:23.730> from

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
a step backwards and what we'll do from

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.400 
a step backwards and what we'll do from
there<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.390> i'll<00:03:24.660> show<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:24.959> how<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.230> do<00:03:25.380> it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
there is i'll show you how to do it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.960 
there is i'll show you how to do it
manually<00:03:25.890> because<00:03:26.070> sometimes<00:03:26.640> you<00:03:26.790> might

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
manually because sometimes you might

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.240 
manually because sometimes you might
want<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.390> do<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.600> manually<00:03:27.980> but<00:03:28.980> especially

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
want to do it manually but especially

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.790 
want to do it manually but especially
because<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.000> computer<00:03:30.420> overdoes<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.870> now<00:03:31.680> to

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
because the computer overdoes it now to

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.160 
because the computer overdoes it now to
do<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.100> manually<00:03:32.630> once<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.750> give<00:03:33.900> you<00:03:33.989> go<00:03:34.110> to

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
do it manually once you give you go to

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.780 
do it manually once you give you go to
the<00:03:34.290> top<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.680> screen<00:03:34.800> we<00:03:35.340> click<00:03:35.640> on

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the top of the screen we click on

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.100 
the top of the screen we click on
enhance<00:03:37.340> then<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.580> go<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.820> adjust<00:03:39.720> brightness

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
enhance then we go to adjust brightness

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.430 
enhance then we go to adjust brightness
contrast<00:03:41.450> then<00:03:42.450> we<00:03:42.660> click<00:03:42.900> down<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.320> this

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
contrast then we click down to this

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.780 
contrast then we click down to this
option<00:03:43.890> here<00:03:43.920> which<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.430> levers

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.430 

now<00:03:47.790> what<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.270> does<00:03:48.540> is<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.780> brings<00:03:49.200> up

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
now what that does is it brings up

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.850 
now what that does is it brings up
what's<00:03:49.830> called<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.310> histogram<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.620> what<00:03:52.620> that

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
what's called a histogram and what that

do is we want to just lighten it a
little<00:04:23.730> bit<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.750> click<00:04:25.320> on<00:04:25.470> that<00:04:26.000> take<00:04:27.000> it

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
little bit so click on that take it

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.530 
little bit so click on that take it
across<00:04:27.510> to<00:04:28.140> about<00:04:28.650> there<00:04:29.010> and<00:04:29.460> as<00:04:30.180> you<00:04:30.330> can<00:04:30.510> see

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
across to about there and as you can see

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.830 
across to about there and as you can see
that<00:04:31.050> sense<00:04:31.640> let's<00:04:32.640> increase<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.420> exposure

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
that sense let's increase the exposure

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.610 
that sense let's increase the exposure
maybe<00:04:34.590> even<00:04:34.890> a<00:04:35.040> little<00:04:35.070> bit<00:04:35.310> more<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.820> then

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
maybe even a little bit more and then

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.270 
maybe even a little bit more and then
I'll<00:04:37.620> simply<00:04:38.220> okay<00:04:38.580> that<00:04:39.800> okay<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:40.860> what<00:04:41.130> we've

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
I'll simply okay that okay so what we've

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.460 
I'll simply okay that okay so what we've
got<00:04:41.310> here<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.940> on<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.300> side<00:04:42.540> here<00:04:42.930> on<00:04:43.320> this

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
got here is on this side here on this

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.680 
got here is on this side here on this
side<00:04:43.710> we've<00:04:43.950> got<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.250> original<00:04:44.340> image<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.360> as

side we've got the original image and as

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.940 
side we've got the original image and as
you<00:04:45.810> can<00:04:45.990> see<00:04:46.020> it's<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.440> little<00:04:46.620> bit<00:04:46.710> under

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
you can see it's a little bit under

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.320 
you can see it's a little bit under
exposed<00:04:47.340> on<00:04:48.300> this<00:04:48.630> side<00:04:48.870> here<00:04:49.320> we've<00:04:49.590> had<00:04:49.920> the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
exposed on this side here we've had the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.850 
exposed on this side here we've had the
edited<00:04:51.330> photo<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:52.020> what<00:04:52.380> we've<00:04:52.530> done<00:04:52.680> is

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
edited photo and what we've done is

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.500 
edited photo and what we've done is
we've<00:04:53.010> actually<00:04:53.160> increase<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.820> exposure<00:04:54.210> and

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
we've actually increase the exposure and

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.200 
we've actually increase the exposure and
brightened<00:04:55.470> it<00:04:55.530> up<00:04:55.590> a<00:04:56.040> little<00:04:56.250> bit<00:04:56.460> now<00:04:56.700> my

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
brightened it up a little bit now my

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.880 
brightened it up a little bit now my

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
does the store colors a little bit but

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.450 
does the store colors a little bit but
I'm<00:05:03.840> sure<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.200> can<00:05:04.350> see<00:05:04.530> that<00:05:04.710> that's<00:05:04.890> much

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
I'm sure you can see that that's much

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.620 
I'm sure you can see that that's much
brighter<00:05:05.820> just<00:05:06.600> one<00:05:06.780> point<00:05:07.110> though<00:05:07.610> what

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
brighter just one point though what

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.730 
brighter just one point though what
professional<00:05:09.630> digital<00:05:09.810> photographers<00:05:10.620> will

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
professional digital photographers will

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.560 
professional digital photographers will
sometimes<00:05:11.220> do<00:05:11.490> is<00:05:11.700> they'll<00:05:11.880> deliberately

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
sometimes do is they'll deliberately

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.710 
sometimes do is they'll deliberately
under<00:05:13.200> expose<00:05:13.710> a<00:05:14.210> photograph<00:05:15.210> when<00:05:15.540> they

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
under expose a photograph when they

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.810 
under expose a photograph when they
shoot<00:05:15.990> the<00:05:16.170> photo<00:05:16.410> that's<00:05:17.220> because<00:05:17.640> it's

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
shoot the photo that's because it's

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.630 
shoot the photo that's because it's
always<00:05:18.180> easier<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:18.960> to<00:05:19.650> increase<00:05:20.400> the

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
always easier to to increase the

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.480 
always easier to to increase the
exposure<00:05:21.030> that<00:05:21.180> is<00:05:21.420> to<00:05:21.570> add<00:05:21.750> lightness<00:05:22.430> into<00:05:23.430> a

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
exposure that is to add lightness into a

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.410 
exposure that is to add lightness into a
dark<00:05:23.760> image<00:05:24.180> then<00:05:25.050> it<00:05:25.380> is<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.920> darken<00:05:26.790> an

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
dark image then it is to darken an

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.230 
dark image then it is to darken an
overexposed<00:05:28.350> photo<00:05:28.860> that's<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.760> cause<00:05:29.970> in<00:05:30.150> an

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
overexposed photo that's the cause in an

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.660 
overexposed photo that's the cause in an
area<00:05:30.420> that's<00:05:30.630> very<00:05:30.990> white<00:05:31.380> you<00:05:32.130> can't<00:05:32.460> really

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
area that's very white you can't really

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.220 
area that's very white you can't really
add<00:05:32.910> detail<00:05:33.420> but<00:05:34.280> an<00:05:35.280> area<00:05:35.640> that<00:05:35.670> Starks<00:05:36.300> I<00:05:36.510> say

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
add detail but an area that Starks I say

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.990 
add detail but an area that Starks I say
girls<00:05:37.410> place<00:05:37.650> here<00:05:38.040> is<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.250> little<00:05:38.520> bit<00:05:38.730> dark

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
girls place here is a little bit dark

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.870 
girls place here is a little bit dark
it's<00:05:39.870> quite<00:05:40.170> easy<00:05:40.230> to<00:05:40.590> much<00:05:41.310> easier<00:05:41.670> to

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
it's quite easy to much easier to

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.850 
it's quite easy to much easier to
lighten<00:05:42.390> it<00:05:45.200> okay<00:05:46.200> now<00:05:46.350> here<00:05:46.560> we<00:05:46.680> have<00:05:46.710> a

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
lighten it okay now here we have a

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.790 
lighten it okay now here we have a
photograph<00:05:47.490> that's<00:05:47.790> over-exposed<00:05:48.530> as<00:05:49.530> you

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
photograph that's over-exposed as you

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.230 
photograph that's over-exposed as you
can<00:05:49.950> see<00:05:50.250> if<00:05:50.940> we<00:05:51.180> zoom<00:05:51.210> in<00:05:51.630> or<00:05:51.960> zoom<00:05:52.770> in<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:54.180> the

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
can see if we zoom in or zoom in to the

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.210 
can see if we zoom in or zoom in to the
actual<00:05:54.480> pixels<00:05:54.990> that's<00:05:55.980> too<00:05:56.190> big<00:05:57.830> keep<00:05:58.830> sania

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
actual pixels that's too big keep sania

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.290 
actual pixels that's too big keep sania
okay<00:06:00.090> if<00:06:00.330> we<00:06:00.510> zoom<00:06:01.310> zoom<00:06:02.310> as<00:06:02.550> you<00:06:02.760> can<00:06:02.880> see<00:06:03.090> it's

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
okay if we zoom zoom as you can see it's

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.900 
okay if we zoom zoom as you can see it's
much<00:06:03.540> too<00:06:03.840> bright<00:06:04.200> there's<00:06:05.190> too<00:06:05.370> much<00:06:05.550> white

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
much too bright there's too much white

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.840 
much too bright there's too much white
on<00:06:06.480> the<00:06:06.810> face<00:06:07.050> around<00:06:07.440> here<00:06:07.590> it's<00:06:08.520> just<00:06:08.700> way

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
on the face around here it's just way

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.420 
on the face around here it's just way
too<00:06:08.910> bright<00:06:09.260> now<00:06:10.260> what<00:06:10.620> we<00:06:10.770> can<00:06:10.950> do<00:06:11.070> is<00:06:11.220> once

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
too bright now what we can do is once

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.200 
too bright now what we can do is once
again<00:06:11.550> we<00:06:12.090> can<00:06:12.480> reduce<00:06:13.320> the<00:06:13.500> exposure<00:06:14.150> so<00:06:15.150> I'm

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
again we can reduce the exposure so I'm

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.430 
again we can reduce the exposure so I'm
going<00:06:15.570> in<00:06:15.690> to<00:06:15.720> enhance<00:06:18.230> let's<00:06:19.230> do<00:06:19.380> it

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
going in to enhance let's do it

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.050 
going in to enhance let's do it
automatically<00:06:19.980> first<00:06:20.310> and<00:06:20.580> we'll<00:06:20.670> see<00:06:20.820> what

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
automatically first and we'll see what

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.950 
automatically first and we'll see what
we<00:06:21.210> get<00:06:21.390> we<00:06:21.630> go<00:06:21.780> auto<00:06:22.080> levels<00:06:22.590> and<00:06:23.660> as<00:06:24.660> you<00:06:24.780> can

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
we get we go auto levels and as you can

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.900 
we get we go auto levels and as you can
see<00:06:24.990> that's<00:06:25.470> that<00:06:25.800> started<00:06:26.340> it<00:06:26.460> a<00:06:26.550> little<00:06:26.730> bit

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
see that's that started it a little bit

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.340 
see that's that started it a little bit
will<00:06:29.910> undo<00:06:30.210> that<00:06:30.390> and<00:06:30.600> this<00:06:30.780> one<00:06:30.990> will<00:06:31.110> do<00:06:31.260> it

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
will undo that and this one will do it

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.460 
will undo that and this one will do it
manually<00:06:31.680> so<00:06:32.040> we're<00:06:32.190> going<00:06:32.370> to<00:06:32.640> enhance

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
manually so we're going to enhance

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.220 
manually so we're going to enhance
adjust<00:06:34.470> brightness<00:06:34.830> contrast<00:06:35.960> back<00:06:36.960> to

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
adjust brightness contrast back to

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.140 
adjust brightness contrast back to
levels<00:06:38.510> okay<00:06:39.510> so<00:06:39.570> as<00:06:39.780> you<00:06:39.900> can<00:06:40.020> see<00:06:40.580> if<00:06:41.580> I<00:06:41.820> grab

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.150 
levels okay so as you can see if I grab

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.680 
levels okay so as you can see if I grab
this<00:06:42.480> marquee<00:06:43.140> here<00:06:43.380> and<00:06:43.680> slide<00:06:44.370> it<00:06:44.400> across

this marquee here and slide it across
you'll<00:06:45.690> see<00:06:45.960> that<00:06:46.110> it's<00:06:46.260> darkening<00:06:46.890> it<00:06:47.070> now

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
you'll see that it's darkening it now

this<00:06:47.970> little<00:06:48.150> little<00:06:48.540> triangle<00:06:49.230> here<00:06:49.470> what

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
this little little triangle here what

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.300 
this little little triangle here what
that<00:06:50.280> does<00:06:50.580> is<00:06:50.880> that<00:06:50.970> adjust<00:06:51.570> your<00:06:51.720> contrast

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
that does is that adjust your contrast

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:54.590 
that does is that adjust your contrast
shouldn't<00:06:53.310> mention<00:06:53.430> that<00:06:53.700> earlier<00:06:53.760> from<00:06:54.420> a

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
shouldn't mention that earlier from a

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.290 
shouldn't mention that earlier from a
lot<00:06:54.870> of<00:06:54.990> contrast<00:06:55.530> to<00:06:56.490> a<00:06:56.730> little<00:06:57.060> bit<00:06:57.180> of

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
lot of contrast to a little bit of

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.500 
lot of contrast to a little bit of
contrast<00:06:58.550> I'll<00:06:59.550> just<00:06:59.670> cancel<00:06:59.880> out<00:07:00.180> of<00:07:00.300> the<00:07:00.360> end

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510 
contrast I'll just cancel out of the end

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.800 
contrast I'll just cancel out of the end
and<00:07:00.630> just<00:07:00.690> do<00:07:00.870> that<00:07:00.960> one<00:07:01.020> more<00:07:01.170> time<00:07:01.320> and

and just do that one more time and

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.980 
and just do that one more time and

here<00:07:10.700> across<00:07:11.139> that's<00:07:12.139> darkening<00:07:12.860> it<00:07:14.080> then<00:07:15.080> I'm

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:15.230 
here across that's darkening it then I'm

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.810 
here across that's darkening it then I'm
okaying<00:07:15.740> it<00:07:16.389> now<00:07:17.770> I'll<00:07:18.770> federal<00:07:19.400> onto<00:07:19.700> the

screen is that as you can see that's

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.960 
screen is that as you can see that's
improved<00:07:22.850> the<00:07:23.770> exposure<00:07:24.770> a<00:07:24.919> little<00:07:25.250> bit<00:07:25.430> just

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970 
improved the exposure a little bit just

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:28.600 
improved the exposure a little bit just
go<00:07:26.120> back<00:07:26.360> to<00:07:26.480> what<00:07:26.630> I<00:07:26.660> said<00:07:26.750> before<00:07:27.610> with

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.610 
go back to what I said before with

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.570 
go back to what I said before with
digital<00:07:29.090> photographs<00:07:29.720> always<00:07:30.350> better<00:07:31.160> to

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
digital photographs always better to

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.460 
digital photographs always better to
have<00:07:31.730> the<00:07:32.150> photograph<00:07:32.720> a<00:07:32.900> little<00:07:33.290> bit

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.470 
have the photograph a little bit

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.100 
have the photograph a little bit
underexposed<00:07:34.370> that<00:07:35.120> is<00:07:35.300> have<00:07:35.510> the<00:07:35.630> photo<00:07:35.870> a

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110 
underexposed that is have the photo a

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.980 
underexposed that is have the photo a
little<00:07:36.169> bit<00:07:36.680> too<00:07:36.919> dark<00:07:37.389> rather<00:07:38.389> than<00:07:38.720> having

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:38.990 
little bit too dark rather than having

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.719 
little bit too dark rather than having
it<00:07:39.200> too<00:07:39.410> bright<00:07:39.770> because<00:07:40.130> it's<00:07:40.310> not<00:07:40.460> all<00:07:40.580> what

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:40.729 
it too bright because it's not all what

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:43.240 
it too bright because it's not all what
you<00:07:40.880> can<00:07:41.060> do
