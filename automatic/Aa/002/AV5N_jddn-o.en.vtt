really like this one
and<00:00:17.900> here<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:18.960> go<00:00:19.109> yeah<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:19.830> was<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.250> was<00:00:20.430> medium

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
and here we go yeah I was I was medium

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.519 
and here we go yeah I was I was medium
but<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.910> don't<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.570> actually<00:00:22.080> wrote<00:00:22.439> it

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
but I don't think I actually wrote it

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.019 
but I don't think I actually wrote it
fast<00:00:22.769> enough<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.130> really<00:00:23.580> put<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.820> through<00:00:23.939> his

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
fast enough to really put it through his

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.470 
fast enough to really put it through his
paces<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:24.720> didn't<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.170> like<00:00:25.230> about<00:00:25.380> it

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
paces so what didn't you like about it

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.570 
paces so what didn't you like about it
it<00:00:27.480> didn't<00:00:28.260> feel<00:00:28.500> super<00:00:28.800> snappy<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.279> me<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:29.550> I

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
it didn't feel super snappy to me but I

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.189 
it didn't feel super snappy to me but I
think<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.330> would<00:00:30.449> come<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.840> speed<00:00:31.050> on

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
think that that would come with speed on

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.479 
think that that would come with speed on
this<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:31.859> bike<00:00:32.099> needed<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.399> be

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
this but I think this bike needed to be

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.639 
this but I think this bike needed to be
run<00:00:32.550> faster<00:00:33.059> than<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:34.020> gonna<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.260> riding<00:00:34.559> it

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
run faster than I was gonna be riding it

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.799 
run faster than I was gonna be riding it
yeah<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.010> totally<00:00:35.190> agree<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.880> was<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.329> good<00:00:36.600> point

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
yeah I totally agree I was a good point

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.430 
yeah I totally agree I was a good point
I<00:00:37.370> just<00:00:38.370> like<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.270> RockShox<00:00:40.050> vivid

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
sped it up a little bit more than who

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.990 
sped it up a little bit more than who
ever<00:00:46.289> been<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.680> previously<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> helps

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000

low slung that bike and that shock just

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.520 
low slung that bike and that shock just
adds<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> responsiveness<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.350> bike

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
at the two different styles of riding

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.969 
at the two different styles of riding
and<00:01:51.840> how<00:01:51.960> well<00:01:52.140> they<00:01:52.229> complement<00:01:52.710> each<00:01:52.770> other

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and how well they complement each other

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
and how well they complement each other
and<00:01:53.250> how<00:01:53.490> amazing<00:01:54.090> both<00:01:54.479> those<00:01:54.659> guys<00:01:54.810> aren't

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and how amazing both those guys aren't

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.350 
and how amazing both those guys aren't
riding<00:01:55.229> bikes<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.270> this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
riding bikes and it just that this

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.020 
riding bikes and it just that this
proves<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.229> me<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.530> plate<00:01:58.710> can<00:01:58.799> do<00:01:59.040> both

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
proves to me that this plate can do both

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.429 
proves to me that this plate can do both
disciplines<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.750> figure<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.290> race

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
disciplines and figure out in the race

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.830 
disciplines and figure out in the race
so<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.189> definitely<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.060> best<00:02:03.689> of

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
so I definitely think that it's best of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.749 
so I definitely think that it's best of
both<00:02:03.930> worlds<00:02:04.229> degree<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.310> very<00:02:05.490> playful
