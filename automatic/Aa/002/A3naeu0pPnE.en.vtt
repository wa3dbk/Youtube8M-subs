00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.650
 we also explain what is a 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.410
 exoskeleton because look at my being is a 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.480
 exoskeleton is an external skeleton by 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.860
 of fibers and validate the redundancy and it 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.570
 try that all the people who 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.130
 they have an affectation in their medullar zone 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.660
 that they can not move for example from here 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.970
 below you can experiment again 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.400
 or for the first time experiencing it the 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.490
 stand up and be able to walk this is a 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.390
 technology that is now applied to health 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.039
 originally an exoskeleton was 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.840
 applied for war for issues 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.640
 war but fortunately already what 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.860
 brought to the daily life of the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.570
 people is a mixture an alloy of 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.239
 metals that it does not weigh so much 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.040
 this costume is a kind of robocop that 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.019
 they put you can apply to 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.600
 anyone who looks from about 50 to 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.460
 1 90 tall and not weighing more than 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.229
 100 kilograms very well already adapts to your 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.879
 weight and you can coordinate the three 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.799
 different ways is very good 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.120
 because many of the therapies that have 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:55.729
 than suffering from people who are 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.320
 paralyzed and come to place them is 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.320
 say that move the whole body and here from 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.940
 some help is not a robot that 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.979
 helps to exercise your own body that 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.810
 I was hurt or I also hurt them 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.680
 can help them be able to move is very 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.500
 returns life from another perspective 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.020
 exoskeleton 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.240
 gentlemen this is cutting edge technology is 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.740
 a wonderful bionic team that 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.590
 allows people with spinal cord damage 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.120
 back to stand chequen what 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.120
 wonder and how it works 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.180
 is focused on people who have 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.550
 limitation in movement and 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.860
 specifically to stand up and 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.960
 walk what this robot does 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.960
 we are replacing what there is the 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.360
 musculoskeletal system does it for 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.250
 that is, it is a skeleton that is 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.930
 outside and it will give you the support so that 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.430
 you can stand up and you can 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.820
 walk if you lost this 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.320
 capacity is a mixture of metals is 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.370
 an alloy of metals and fiber 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.260
 carbon has a weight of 25 kilos but 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.030
 is designed in such a way that the 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.550
 patient does not have to charge the team 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.789
 but on the contrary the equipment charges 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.250
 patient 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.920
 you told me that originally the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.900
 technology that has the exoskeleton 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.760
 was then applied in the war the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.370
 technology was initially designed 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.560
 so that these sailors could do 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.620
 heavier jobs with less effort 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.780
 physical at the beginning if it scares you 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.209
 the same you do not know if you are going to be able to have 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.730
 enough control to keep you from 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.200
 foot or you can fall but already being of 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.540
 foot you realize that if you are 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.519
 stopping the device then you get 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.140
 forget fear and you feel a lot 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.290
 joy and you enjoy it very much 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.069
 my panorama opened again and life 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.950
 as I saw her from above in front of 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.870
 These equipments are designed in USA but 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.390
 fortunately today we have one here in 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.860
 Mexico and it's good for everyone 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.520
 those who want to approach us 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.520
 here to the clinic 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.709
 and not return all the life that I had 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.870
 sense that I had lost but already the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.049
 I have back 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.260
 align your leg so that the 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.580
 knee joint hip 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.319
 aligned with the joints of the 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.959
 robot and we can have a good pattern of 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.129
 movement there is your also of all 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.560
 ways you have to do rehabilitation 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:28.190
 in your legs to keep the muscle 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.200
 in motion not if my legs and in my 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.650
 arms and in my trunk and in the rest of 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.540
 my body in all my court here are already 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.090
 placing what would be this strip that 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.090
 directly adjusting the lower back 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.430
 team and actually this team is going to 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.410
 be as part of your muscles your 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.760
 integrated bones so that the work is 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.760
 can stop by italo to nabil 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.380
 and they are stretching their 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.390
 legs from the lower area of ​​the 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.760
 calf to fit a bit 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.099
 better the equipment and so you can walk 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.590
 every time I pick a button the team gives 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:12.019
 one step another way to control the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.269
 equipment is by means of a control that the 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.310
 patient drives here on the crutch 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.199
 then it has a series of buttons for 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.190
 that when the patient presses a button 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.320
 the team take a step 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.710
 impressive just with the change of 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.140
 weight the self exoskeleton controls the 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.240
 Aura movement up can change 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.280
 of direction really good we can give 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.050
 turns right now like you can see 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.830
 Now let's go for a spin 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.830
 go out 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.020
 this is applied science for the 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.580
 well-being of all gentlemen is already possible 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.850
 that a person who has lost 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.150
 mobility for core issues can 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:56.930
 recover standing and move this 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:00.080
 it's so phenomenal literal goes alone 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.180
 it also requires domain the matter is 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.730
 that you take confidence with the team 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.010
 so I'm sure and that you know him 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.010
 already dominating that is enough 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.610
 It is important to mention that people 

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.819
 who can use the exoskeleton 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.279
 they should measure about 50 to 1 90 of 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:25.580
 stature and also do not weigh more than 100 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.580
 kilograms 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.090
 this team is really very sophisticated 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.470
 is the latest technology that 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.139
 returns the desire to the people who 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.509
 they have spinal damage to move on and 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.150
 look here is the time to stand and apart 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.260
 trusting like this can be no if always that 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.210
 Market Stall 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.170
 and a blue dress tabata Jalil and together 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.170
 we make brief
