00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:04.168
 This is the tea that Srisophon. He will serve like this. 

00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:06.677
 I was confused. 

00:00:06.677 --> 00:00:08.347
 It spins 

00:00:08.347 --> 00:00:11.546
 He will put the glass upside down. 

00:00:11.546 --> 00:00:13.784
 I am very confused how to eat? 

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:16.457
 Saw another table and put it for a while 

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:18.923
 He would put the tea on. 

00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:21.217
 In the glass, then take this off. 

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:25.449
 Put the tea in the glass, put the water on and then put this off and upside down 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.690
 But was surprised that the time .. why had to be overturned And how do you eat 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:30.779
 Or wait for it ... 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.356
 Permeate here And then pour it here. I think that would be like that. 

00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:36.558
 Do not chuck If some people might be 

00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:40.156
 Can't take a turn. This water must be six. This one I calculated. 

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:43.133
 If we catch up on the face This water must be six 

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.965
 Therefore, the principle is similar to Vietnamese coffee. 

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:50.138
 Let the pressure of the water Push the tea out below 

00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:51.393
 Into the plate 

00:00:51.393 --> 00:00:52.891
 When there is tea in the dish 

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:55.436
 You put it here. Like this 

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:58.583
 Put it here! There is a little dirty thing. It's a mechanic. 

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:00.472
 here! Eat it right. 

00:01:00.472 --> 00:01:02.805
 I think myself. Hopefully, yes. 

00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:05.468
 Otherwise, another table will probably face up and eat. 

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:08.643
 This is another food. 

00:01:08.643 --> 00:01:11.360
 Another drink Another thing that Mr. Hotzia recommends 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.693
 If born at .. 

00:01:12.693 --> 00:01:14.063
 dress! 

00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:16.176
 Cambodia Srisophon. Wait! 

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.137
 I let it 

00:01:17.137 --> 00:01:19.274
 Come out first and then pour out I'll take the clip to watch. 

00:01:19.274 --> 00:01:21.369
 Now I have to wait before eating. 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.165
 Yes 

00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:24.318
 One 

00:01:26.673 --> 00:01:28.932
 Waiting out for about fifteen minutes 

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:30.645
 It doesn't flow out 

00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:32.043
 Concluded that ... 

00:01:32.043 --> 00:01:34.051
 Let you wait one day and don't come out. 

00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:37.845
 Because it is completely attached and has tea 

00:01:37.845 --> 00:01:39.560
 I went to see another table. 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.515
 He used to reveal and pour out. 

00:01:41.515 --> 00:01:46.256
 I will try it. Use this method 

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:49.688
 Hey! It doesn't flow 

00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:53.435
 It's not flowing, right? We reveal it. 

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:56.849
 Hey 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.437
 here! I do it. 

00:01:59.437 --> 00:02:04.227
 But must slowly reveal it. Reveal fast. It will come out a lot. Then the tea will become more intense 

00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:06.475
 Then placed 

00:02:06.475 --> 00:02:08.554
 At first I saw the first thing. 

00:02:08.554 --> 00:02:10.487
 I saw him upside down. I was "Huo". 

00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:15.678
 "Why do you have to finish eating the glass?" 

00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:17.240
 Why do you have to overturn the glass? 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.578
 Think that the model is finished Will know that finished Full but really not. 

00:02:21.578 --> 00:02:24.552
 He had already poured it, and it would have left the tea that he had dropped. 

00:02:24.552 --> 00:02:26.469
 Then came to see that the tea tastes 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.139
 How do you do this? 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:29.809
 OK 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:36.205
 This is my first time eating tea in Khmer. 

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:38.282
 hot! 

00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:43.698
 Like it is dark 

00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:49.361
 Enough, I don't like to eat tea. 

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.512
 But it's fragrant 

00:02:51.512 --> 00:02:54.240
 Aromatic 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.808
 But it is dark But it's bitter. I don't like to eat 

00:02:56.808 --> 00:03:01.922
 But I give it to my friends to eat
