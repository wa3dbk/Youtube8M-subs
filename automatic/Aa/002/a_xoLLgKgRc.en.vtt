at<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> end<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.850> how<00:02:00.780> many<00:02:00.960> bullets<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.350> get

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
at the end is how many bullets you get

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.969 
at the end is how many bullets you get
so<00:02:02.570> let's<00:02:03.570> call<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.049> anyway<00:02:04.500> I'm<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.890> gonna

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
so let's call it anyway I'm just gonna

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.260 
so let's call it anyway I'm just gonna
do<00:02:05.250> an<00:02:05.340> example<00:02:05.789> that's<00:02:05.880> probably<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> really

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
do an example that's probably a really

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.259 
do an example that's probably a really
bad<00:02:06.600> call<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.229> oh<00:02:07.469> well<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.579> you<00:02:08.850> see<00:02:09.000> here<00:02:09.179> we

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
bad call but oh well so you see here we

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:10.910 
bad call but oh well so you see here we
got<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> pair<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.929> we've<00:02:10.140> got<00:02:10.289> two<00:02:10.530> bullets<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
got a pair so we've got two bullets to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.830 
got a pair so we've got two bullets to
use<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:11.940> let's<00:02:12.120> see<00:02:12.269> what<00:02:12.360> everyone<00:02:12.600> else<00:02:12.630> has

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
use now let's see what everyone else has

those guys have got to that guy's got
three<00:02:24.420> let's<00:02:25.170> spin<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.500> chamber<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.160> cock<00:02:26.459> it

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
three let's spin the chamber and cock it

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.290 
three let's spin the chamber and cock it
so<00:02:28.050> as<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.680> see<00:02:28.860> very<00:02:29.129> interesting<00:02:29.220> very<00:02:29.940> kind

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
so as you see very interesting very kind

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.790 
so as you see very interesting very kind
of<00:02:30.390> new<00:02:30.540> concept<00:02:31.110> of

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
of new concept of

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.170 
of new concept of
aiming<00:02:32.220> at<00:02:32.310> each<00:02:32.370> other<00:02:32.610> now<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.060> to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
aiming at each other now you have to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.150 
aiming at each other now you have to
wait<00:02:33.300> for<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> signal<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.770> once<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.100> starts

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
wait for the signal and once that starts

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:43.090 
wait for the signal and once that starts
you<00:02:35.940> hit<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.450> fire<00:02:37.310> come<00:02:38.310> on

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.460 

so<00:02:44.100> there<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.310> go<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.670> got<00:02:45.150> shot<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.690> died

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
so there you go I got shot I died

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.100 
so there you go I got shot I died

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
up here and I mean that's probably gonna

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.000 
up here and I mean that's probably gonna
be<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.360> sort<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:52.290> know<00:02:52.380> paid<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.830> keep

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
playing kind of aspect but at the moment

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.870 
playing kind of aspect but at the moment
it<00:02:55.170> refills<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:55.650> fast<00:02:56.070> I've<00:02:56.310> never<00:02:56.520> even<00:02:56.640> seen

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
it refills so fast I've never even seen

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.180 
it refills so fast I've never even seen
it<00:02:57.030> drop<00:02:57.210> below<00:02:57.330> nine<00:02:57.660> or<00:02:57.870> eight<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:59.070> not

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
it drop below nine or eight so it's not

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.190 
it drop below nine or eight so it's not
really<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.460> problem<00:03:00.000> so<00:03:00.750> I've<00:03:00.870> just<00:03:00.900> read

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
really a problem so I've just read

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.180 
really a problem so I've just read
bought<00:03:01.350> back<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.730> we've<00:03:02.730> got<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.420> pair<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.290> ten<00:03:04.890> so

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.390 
bought back in we've got a pair a ten so
let's<00:03:05.370> call<00:03:05.520> that<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.920> basically<00:03:07.920> at<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.280> end

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
let's call that and basically at the end

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.220 
let's call that and basically at the end
of<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.670> hand<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.330> whenever<00:03:09.570> on<00:03:09.690> show<00:03:09.840> cards

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
of the hand and whenever on show cards

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.390 
of the hand and whenever on show cards

have to be alive so it's some really

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.060 
have to be alive so it's some really
interesting<00:03:20.580> gameplay<00:03:21.150> here<00:03:21.830> right<00:03:22.830> let's

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
interesting gameplay here right let's

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.190 
interesting gameplay here right let's
see<00:03:23.580> what<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.730> can<00:03:23.820> do<00:03:23.910> with<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.090> pair<00:03:25.760> it's

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.690 
and it's one of the most interesting
ideas<00:03:48.810> I've<00:03:48.990> ever<00:03:49.200> seen<00:03:49.380> very<00:03:50.010> simplistic<00:03:50.580> in

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
ideas I've ever seen very simplistic in

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.250 
ideas I've ever seen very simplistic in
its<00:03:50.850> nature<00:03:51.060> but<00:03:51.390> it<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.510> quite<00:03:51.810> fun

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
its nature but it is quite fun

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.840 
its nature but it is quite fun
obviously<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.130> lot<00:03:53.280> all<00:03:53.400> there<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:53.730> know

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
obviously the lot all there you know

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.550 
obviously the lot all there you know
clicking<00:03:54.180> at<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.330> right<00:03:54.510> moment<00:03:54.930> if<00:03:55.290> you

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
clicking at the right moment if you

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.830 
clicking at the right moment if you
actually<00:03:55.860> click<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.310> trigger<00:03:56.550> before<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
actually click the trigger before the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.800 
actually click the trigger before the
call<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.310> if<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.940> click<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.300> before<00:04:00.600> you

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
call so if you click it before you

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.140 
call so if you click it before you
basically<00:04:01.140> lose<00:04:01.410> a<00:04:01.440> life<00:04:01.880> so<00:04:02.880> there's<00:04:03.120> a

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
basically lose a life so there's a

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.390 
basically lose a life so there's a
little<00:04:03.330> bit<00:04:03.450> of<00:04:03.540> actual<00:04:04.380> action<00:04:04.950> in<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.190> but

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
little bit of actual action in it but

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.370 
little bit of actual action in it but
it's<00:04:06.000> just<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:06.510> just<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.780> really<00:04:07.020> cool<00:04:07.170> idea

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
it's just it's just a really cool idea

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.830 
it's just it's just a really cool idea
right<00:04:08.100> so<00:04:08.280> that's<00:04:08.459> guys<00:04:08.610> got<00:04:09.300> four<00:04:09.510> bullets

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
right so that's guys got four bullets

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.590 
right so that's guys got four bullets
