and then over the top to another one

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.190 
and then over the top to another one
notice<00:00:51.610> that<00:00:52.180> what<00:00:52.480> I<00:00:52.510> want<00:00:52.720> you<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.810> know<00:00:53.020> is

notice that what I want you to know is

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.020 
notice that what I want you to know is
he's<00:00:53.350> gonna<00:00:54.010> probably<00:00:54.340> really<00:00:54.760> very

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
he's gonna probably really very

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.730 
he's gonna probably really very
different<00:00:55.480> yeah<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:58.120> words<00:00:58.360> are<00:00:58.960> not

00:00:59.730 --> 00:00:59.740 
different yeah because the words are not

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.720 
different yeah because the words are not
going<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.100> be<00:01:00.250> exactly<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:01.090> same<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.640> the

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
going to be exactly the same and the

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.189 
going to be exactly the same and the
reason<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:04.239> words<00:01:04.449> aren't<00:01:04.809> going<00:01:05.020> to<00:01:05.080> be

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
reason the words aren't going to be

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.070 
reason the words aren't going to be
exactly<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:05.830> same<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:07.270> because<00:01:07.690> what<00:01:07.930> you

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
exactly the same is because what you

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:19.260 
exactly the same is because what you
tell<00:01:08.320> me

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.930
