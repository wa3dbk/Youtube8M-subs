00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
admission really that they still trying

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100 
admission really that they still trying
to<00:00:38.160> find<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.520> balance<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:38.969> know<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
to find a balance and know that the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.209 
to find a balance and know that the
thing<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> they've<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.129> bit

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
thing is that they've got a little bit

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.740 
thing is that they've got a little bit
of<00:00:41.399> time<00:00:41.610> before<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.059> World<00:00:42.239> Cup<00:00:42.450> which<00:00:42.629> I

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
of time before the World Cup which I

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.200 
of time before the World Cup which I
guess<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> next<00:00:43.440> biggest<00:00:43.700> big<00:00:44.700> tournament

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
guess is the next biggest big tournament

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.900 
guess is the next biggest big tournament
but<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:46.289> know<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.500> saying<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.489> think

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
but you know in saying that I think

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.729 
but you know in saying that I think
they're<00:00:48.030> pretty<00:00:48.210> close<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.530> just

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
they're pretty close it's just it's just

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.110 
they're pretty close it's just it's just
getting<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> balance<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> what<00:00:50.789> they<00:00:50.879> want<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
getting the balance of what they want to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.170 
getting the balance of what they want to
do<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> guess<00:00:52.050> maybe<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> top<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> order

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
do I guess maybe at the top of the order

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
do I guess maybe at the top of the order
and<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> little<00:00:54.660> bit<00:00:54.780> sort<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.770> between

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
and then a little bit sort of between

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.950 
and then a little bit sort of between
six<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.430> seven<00:00:56.550> exactly<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.570> balance

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
six and seven exactly that that balance

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200 
six and seven exactly that that balance
that<00:00:58.050> they<00:00:58.710> want<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.100> but<00:00:59.309> it'd<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.879> nice<00:01:00.180> if

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
that they want to do but it'd be nice if

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.970 
that they want to do but it'd be nice if
they<00:01:00.480> could<00:01:00.660> settle<00:01:01.170> on<00:01:01.379> something<00:01:01.620> as<00:01:01.829> soon

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
they could settle on something as soon

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.590 
they could settle on something as soon
as<00:01:02.100> possible<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.000> know<00:01:03.210> give<00:01:03.420> those

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.359 
off to a good start in a series and you
know<00:01:18.689> every<00:01:18.990> game<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.439> pressure<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.979> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
know every game this pressure and you

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.550 
know every game this pressure and you
know<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> don't<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:22.020> see<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
know so I don't see I don't see that

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890 
know so I don't see I don't see that
being<00:01:22.770> too<00:01:23.400> much<00:01:23.610> different<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.479> think

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
being too much different but I think

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.480 
being too much different but I think
from<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.110> public<00:01:25.290> spawn<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.830> view<00:01:26.009> where<00:01:26.220> we're
