00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:16.307
Whoever lets only the dear God reign

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:26.817
and hopes in him at all times,

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:35.159
in every cross and sadness.

00:00:36.037 --> 00:00:45.037
he will preserve in a marvelous way

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:54.379
Whoever trusts in almighty God

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
has not built upon sand.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:14.799
He knows the right hours of joy,

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:23.942
he knows well when it will be useful

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:33.651
if he has only found us faithful

00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:43.060
and notices no hypocrisy,

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:53.000
then God comes, before we expect

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:02.580
and allows much good to happen to us.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:14.860
Sing, pray and go on God's way,

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:24.740
Perform your part only faithfully

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:34.650
and trust in the rich blessing of heaven,

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:44.520
then he will be with you anew;

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:54.430
For who places his confidence

00:02:55.042 --> 00:03:04.040
in God, he does not abandon.
