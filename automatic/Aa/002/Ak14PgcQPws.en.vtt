00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
think a lot of people have somewhat

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.960 
think a lot of people have somewhat
forgotten<00:02:57.140> in<00:02:57.440> at<00:02:57.590> this<00:02:57.799> point<00:02:58.099> I<00:02:58.340> mean<00:02:58.819> we

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
forgotten in at this point I mean we

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.600 
forgotten in at this point I mean we
just<00:02:59.120> got<00:02:59.329> this<00:02:59.510> news<00:02:59.810> today<00:03:00.410> but<00:03:00.739> at<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.400> same

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.059 
time you know the news for this game has
been<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:05.540> scarce<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.380> think<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.769> lot<00:03:07.040> of

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
been so scarce that I think a lot of

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.970 
been so scarce that I think a lot of
people<00:03:07.250> have<00:03:07.700> probably<00:03:08.349> kind<00:03:09.349> of<00:03:09.500> flew<00:03:09.829> it

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
people have probably kind of flew it

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.400 
people have probably kind of flew it
away<00:03:10.250> now<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:10.910> pretty<00:03:11.299> much<00:03:11.450> forgotten<00:03:12.049> so

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.650 
away now and pretty much forgotten so
