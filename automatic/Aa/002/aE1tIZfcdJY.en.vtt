one<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.340> my<00:00:11.430> recent<00:00:11.820> videos<00:00:12.270> I<00:00:12.360> think<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.600> was

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
one of my recent videos I think it was

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.869 
one of my recent videos I think it was
less<00:00:12.900> than<00:00:12.930> ten<00:00:13.469> on<00:00:13.740> how<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> learn<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.730> play

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:14.879 
less than ten on how to learn to play

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.460 
less than ten on how to learn to play
the<00:00:15.000> piano<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.570> said<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.049> was<00:00:16.170> going<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.379> be

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
the piano I said I was going to be

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.290 
the piano I said I was going to be
teaching<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:16.980> sort<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.850> next<00:00:18.030> step<00:00:18.150> on

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.270 
teaching you sort of the next step on
which<00:00:18.480> would<00:00:19.080> be<00:00:19.170> actually<00:00:19.440> how<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.949> read

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
would do that is by using this referring

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.250 
would do that is by using this referring
to<00:03:07.519> this<00:03:07.820> you<00:03:08.390> would<00:03:08.450> pick<00:03:08.690> up<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.900> piece<00:03:09.080> of

used in the lessons because it has some
letters<00:03:17.870> written<00:03:18.140> in<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.250> if<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.459> can<00:03:19.670> get<00:03:19.760> a

mention<00:05:02.450> now<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:02.990> might<00:05:03.200> have<00:05:03.380> notes

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
mention now is that you might have notes

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.320 
mention now is that you might have notes
above<00:05:03.920> and<00:05:04.100> below<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.490> stave<00:05:04.760> so<00:05:05.000> I'll<00:05:05.120> just

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
above and below the stave so I'll just

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.980 
above and below the stave so I'll just
show<00:05:05.600> just<00:05:05.960> give<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.170> an<00:05:06.260> example<00:05:06.590> so<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:08.840> is

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
show just give you an example so this is

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.720 
show just give you an example so this is
a<00:05:09.020> note<00:05:09.260> here<00:05:09.500> that<00:05:09.680> I've<00:05:09.800> written<00:05:09.980> then<00:05:10.280> this

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
a note here that I've written then this

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.330 
a note here that I've written then this
is<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.360> D<00:05:11.780> it's<00:05:12.140> just<00:05:12.530> underneath

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
is that D it's just underneath

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.790 
is that D it's just underneath
the<00:05:14.060> line<00:05:14.270> but<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:14.990> mean<00:05:15.170> really<00:05:15.380> if<00:05:15.500> you<00:05:15.620> can

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
the line but I mean really if you can

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.410 
the line but I mean really if you can
see<00:05:15.950> that<00:05:16.100> this<00:05:16.220> is<00:05:16.490> actually<00:05:17.000> on<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.210> line

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
see that this is actually on the line

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.160 
see that this is actually on the line
this<00:05:18.140> is<00:05:18.350> one<00:05:18.830> space<00:05:19.370> lower<00:05:19.790> than<00:05:20.030> E<00:05:20.300> and<00:05:20.750> then

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:21.170 
this is one space lower than E and then

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.630 
this is one space lower than E and then
we've<00:05:21.320> got<00:05:21.440> our<00:05:21.470> middle<00:05:21.890> C<00:05:22.100> which<00:05:22.310> we<00:05:22.460> should

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:22.640 
we've got our middle C which we should

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.670 
we've got our middle C which we should
know<00:05:22.850> where<00:05:23.000> there<00:05:23.150> is<00:05:23.240> anyway<00:05:23.660> same<00:05:24.350> is<00:05:24.500> true

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
know where there is anyway same is true

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.890 
know where there is anyway same is true
of<00:05:24.740> the<00:05:24.980> top<00:05:25.250> you've<00:05:25.850> got<00:05:26.030> this<00:05:26.150> new<00:05:26.420> note<00:05:26.630> here

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
of the top you've got this new note here

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.070 
of the top you've got this new note here
that<00:05:27.080> I've<00:05:27.170> written<00:05:27.350> in<00:05:27.560> so<00:05:28.010> f<00:05:28.190> is<00:05:28.370> on<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.580> line

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
that I've written in so f is on the line

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.510 
that I've written in so f is on the line
G<00:05:30.080> is<00:05:30.140> just<00:05:30.410> a<00:05:30.500> fraction<00:05:30.890> above<00:05:31.160> it<00:05:31.280> in<00:05:31.400> the

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
G is just a fraction above it in the

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.890 
G is just a fraction above it in the
space<00:05:31.790> so<00:05:32.360> therefore<00:05:32.810> after<00:05:33.530> F<00:05:34.310> becomes<00:05:35.270> G<00:05:35.600> so

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
space so therefore after F becomes G so

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.320 
space so therefore after F becomes G so
we<00:05:36.050> know<00:05:36.170> this<00:05:36.320> is<00:05:36.380> G<00:05:36.740> also<00:05:37.550> enough<00:05:37.970> another

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
we know this is G also enough another

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.880 
we know this is G also enough another
quick<00:05:38.570> little<00:05:38.690> pattern<00:05:39.080> is<00:05:39.200> that<00:05:39.350> we've<00:05:39.470> got<00:05:39.650> e

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
quick little pattern is that we've got e

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:46.120 
quick little pattern is that we've got e
f<00:05:40.220> g<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:41.870> b<00:05:42.620> c<00:05:43.250> d<00:05:43.970> so<00:05:44.810> we've<00:05:44.960> got<00:05:45.140> line<00:05:45.440> space<00:05:46.100> line

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
f g a b c d so we've got line space line

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.880 
f g a b c d so we've got line space line
space<00:05:46.730> line<00:05:47.360> so<00:05:48.200> if<00:05:48.260> they're<00:05:48.410> going<00:05:48.620> up<00:05:48.770> in

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
space line so if they're going up in

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.320 
space line so if they're going up in
alphabetical<00:05:49.490> order<00:05:49.640> it's<00:05:49.940> always<00:05:50.180> going<00:05:50.300> to

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
alphabetical order it's always going to

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.260 
alphabetical order it's always going to
be<00:05:50.390> line<00:05:50.660> space<00:05:50.990> line<00:05:51.020> space<00:05:51.290> line<00:05:51.590> space

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
be line space line space line space

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.270 
be line space line space line space
exactly<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.480> same<00:05:53.690> is<00:05:53.810> true<00:05:53.840> of<00:05:54.560> the<00:05:54.890> bass

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
exactly the same is true of the bass

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.460 
exactly the same is true of the bass
clef<00:05:55.310> as<00:05:55.790> well<00:05:56.000> so<00:05:56.750> I'll<00:05:56.840> just<00:05:56.990> quickly<00:05:57.170> draw

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
clef as well so I'll just quickly draw

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.570 
clef as well so I'll just quickly draw
one<00:05:57.890> of<00:05:57.980> those<00:05:58.130> in<00:05:58.190> for<00:05:58.580> you<00:05:58.760> so<00:05:59.980> one<00:06:00.980> note<00:06:01.280> just

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
one of those in for you so one note just

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.850 
one of those in for you so one note just
higher<00:06:01.880> than<00:06:02.120> a<00:06:02.300> is<00:06:02.630> B<00:06:02.870> which<00:06:03.320> is<00:06:03.440> just<00:06:03.620> want<00:06:03.800> to

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
higher than a is B which is just want to

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.070 
higher than a is B which is just want to
hear<00:06:04.040> if<00:06:04.190> you<00:06:04.310> come<00:06:04.460> across<00:06:04.670> it<00:06:04.940> and<00:06:05.660> one<00:06:05.900> note

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
hear if you come across it and one note

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.080 
hear if you come across it and one note
just<00:06:06.380> lower<00:06:06.650> than<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:06.980> lines<00:06:07.190> is<00:06:07.550> F<00:06:07.730> down<00:06:08.000> here

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
just lower than the lines is F down here

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.400 
just lower than the lines is F down here
okay<00:06:11.090> so<00:06:11.120> that's<00:06:11.420> it<00:06:11.600> thanks<00:06:11.930> very<00:06:12.110> much<00:06:12.230> for

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:18.980 
perhaps what I've said it's very

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.170 
perhaps what I've said it's very

difficult to explain something in a
