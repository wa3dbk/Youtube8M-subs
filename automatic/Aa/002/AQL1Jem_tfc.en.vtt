00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:11.479
 in gt 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:14.329
 this state where we need and mass media 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.400
 his fate visit 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.990
 because in addition that's what I said at the moment that's what I like 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.109
 a lot is that it is this said that 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.109
 the center there is reality and fiction 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.149
 the sound is obviously to define what is needed and models 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.749
 this sentimental chronicle of a character includes at different 

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:34.970
 moments according to its development 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.640
 the suspect is instant about his life 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.640
 I love that 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.140
 then the others then I want 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 when I'm an actor 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.540
 a surprise that were associated and it's someone who cares about 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.640
 labels his faithful servants 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.450
 in each case to play everything 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.470
 I'm not able to play anything it's always a question of 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.470
 role of circumstantial writing of director 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.510
 the mayor now if you if you give me a turn role will be played 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.590
 first of all I could that the greatest pleasure 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.170
 still I should not ask myself questions after saying areva in 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.230
 the movie you kill our dogs 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.890
 percent and a few words of your friends did he appreciate why not 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.130
 why not kill someone 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.640
 2 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.830
 for this segment lcd pontiff 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.990
 his rivals and peremptory why not names names anything 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.990
 raphaÃ«l 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.350
 when one suffers thinks one can laugh at just all the plans for 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.229
 his side close to power 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.250
 not with anyone that's certain 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.460
 benmouna well 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.460
 I think there was no risk of taboo 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.280
 after all time the art and the way i think caen channel 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520
 I understand that it is an enchanted parenthesis in the fields the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.829
 television is great 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.789
 I have you I do not think it's the tariff of simply in relation to 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.649
 a guy like a coluche who embodied in himself a form of resistance and 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.909
 absolute insubordination and two 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.989
 anarchists through humor in the face of power 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.019
 that's spread kirkman indeed the gents that rots during the 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.379
 two hours we went into a very high humor community Haitian ball 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.959
 niche book as advertisers say 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.969
 who read the names are full of people today who pushes the cork 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.629
 but m yesterday% can not say we entered 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.379
 because we always complain about politically correct it's true 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.309
 than today if you're fooling the mouths of black eyes the Arabs of 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:43.759
 jews get all the edges of the disabled all my time on him 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:44.779
 on the range 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.179
 but at the same time if we do not stop doing it 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:50.359
 that's not a reason 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.039
 yes but I would say it's a good reason to do it 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.279
 I just go back what I told you at the beginning it depends everything 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.279
 depends on how it's done 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:02.719
 we could see I'm aghast I'm interested I'm working but I'm working 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.639
 a lot and internet 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.079
 the niger something that me 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.859
 you terrify me on the internet literally it's lille 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:15.669
 the anonymity of people who express themselves 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.669
 and teams on condition of anonymity 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:21.699
 I know it's not very pretty what I see 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.219
 they have that the dominant tone of this dÃ©fouloir is quite creepy 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:29.679
 I write relationships this moment between the ships and let them cut themselves and 

00:03:29.679 --> 00:03:33.219
 company I find it exciting what's going on exciting but 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:35.650
 yes yes yes yes I want it 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.919
 as an object of experimentation of what I know and I work on 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.599
 again I swear to you 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.309
 sir happily married 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.309
 malaga are very loyal 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.869
 wicker listen to me what I like schoentjes at the belgians 

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:54.029
 as generic 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:56.119
 it is that 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.949
 and we did not take the last steps at all prevented seriousness of mind 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.439
 we have in France 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.489
 where they are found showed all digital 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.209
 all the objects of debate 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.819
 a slope that's the hand of thierry henry is an anecdote but% 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.619
 and a serious crash 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:14.950
 Yes Yes 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:16.150
 we take ourselves in 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.370
 terribly seriously we bet elsewhere in belgium the things I 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.710
 would have missed a very Anglo-Saxon lightness besides a piece of 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.099
 a taste of nonsense a convent 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:27.979
 has the taste of the absurd
