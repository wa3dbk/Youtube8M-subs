00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.680
 yes 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.379
 hello everyone how about in this video we're going 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.920
 to make a natural homemade scrub 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:16.189
 to activate the circulation of the skin and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.199
 clean the skin you will see that it is 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:21.539
 great and we did an exfoliant 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.270
 home time ago in that case was more 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.650
 moisturizing this is an exfoliant more 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.130
 stimulating 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.860
 we are going to need fat salt or coarse salt 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.629
 you know for homemade scrubs 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.030
 we usually use the thick fat 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.310
 because the granules exfoliate 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.930
 much more than the fine but if not what 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.850
 you find thick fat you can use 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.239
 fine but good to look for the one that is better 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.730
 thick or fat after we will use 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.969
 an orange because we're going to use the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.640
 orange zest that will also give a 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.469
 the rich scent can scrub 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.969
 do it the same with lemon, I'm going to 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.489
 do it with orange but you can do it 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.489
 with orange and lemon and we're going to 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.710
 use thyme you can also use 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.689
 Rosemary is worth so you can combine 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.280
 of rosemary and orange rosemary and lemon 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.860
 thyme and lemon orange 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.440
 and then we're going to use a little bit of 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.479
 extra virgin olive oil moisturizing 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.540
 with the vitamin is great for the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.380
 good skin will take a container 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.250
 this exfoliant is going to be preserved 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.440
 perfectly without any problem 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.270
 for a month in the bathroom with which 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.140
 let's do to have for several 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.130
 Applications 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.560
 I have taken this container that comes to 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.720
 be like a cup more or less and I'll 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.799
 to toss as if it were a cup of 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.799
 fat salt or coarse salt 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.330
 more or less like a cup would be a 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.000
 shortcut is like a cup of coarse salt 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.299
 now we are going to add a teaspoon 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.470
 for good dessert that is not very big 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:03.710
 thyme and rosemary thyme tell you you can 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.119
 use it dry or cool but if you 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.979
 you are going to keep for a long time 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.550
 it is better to use it dry jce vale 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:14.840
 then so we add it there is a 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.940
 teaspoon now let's grate the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.790
 orange and we're going to add a spoonful 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.520
 of orange zest for nothing coges 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.160
 a grater and grate 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.200
 if you do not have a grater I do this 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.300
 I have because good for the pastry if 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.250
 you like the truth is that it comes very well 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.430
 but if you do not have a grater 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.700
 you can just try with a 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.590
 knife and removing like this you see a capita 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.320
 very fine this grater the truth is that 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.690
 stripe of wonder and doing nothing of 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.530
 strength you are giving a little bit and 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.530
 great stripe 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:56.330
 look there you can see the scratch 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.760
 I'm adding that to the cup 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.340
 waiting for a minute that when finished 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.160
 of grating the return is like the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.990
 TV programs of recipes 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.240
 well nothing here is a minute 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.740
 youtube and this will reduce back 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.260
 now 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.580
 Look , I already have the grated 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.400
 orange 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.490
 and finally we are going to add the oil 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.560
 of olive we take virgin olive oil 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.120
 as I always tell you because it is richer 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.640
 in vitamin e today is the one that is 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.310
 truly rich in vitamin and we were going 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.920
 to take like two tablespoons more 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.459
 or less 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.459
 one 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.590
 and God, I always tell you more or less 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.269
 because good also depends on the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.359
 amount of salt that you have done I tell you 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.430
 about one cup but good each 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.170
 one then equal use a larger cup or 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.599
 less about two tablespoons of 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.769
 olive oil and now we 're going to 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.769
 mix everything well 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.140
 I have been a little dry I do not know 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.290
 if you see him then I'm going to take a 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.190
 little bit more olive oil as another 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.190
 scoop 3 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.319
 because we have to get a texture 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.370
 as a little bit sandy so that it does not 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.370
 get sticky 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.470
 I hope to be given a bit Kingdom and is 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.470
 that's how cool it looks 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.260
 and we already have our homemade scrub 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.720
 this with the recipe that we already have 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.930
 our great homemade scrub is 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.060
 a wonder you have to try it with 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.830
 with lemon orange zest 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.600
 rosemary thyme any of the 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.700
 options I sometimes use it with a few times 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.890
 with another one is a wonder form 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.010
 application then in the shower when we 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.690
 let's go to shower we apply myself 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.150
 I always use the exfoliant before 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.020
 of the gel that is to say I get into the 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.600
 shower I get wet and with wet skin 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.060
 we take a little and we rub around 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.970
 the body by the legs by the culete 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.410
 by the belly by the arms especially 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.030
 influencing those areas a little bit 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.760
 rougher ones that are the ones that need 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.700
 more plunder as are the elbows 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.010
 knees is there we hit the heels and 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.990
 we decided a little more and nothing more 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.760
 let's give there a light massage with 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.680
 it is also super nice 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.510
 because it smells wonderful, imagine another 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.910
 mix of good orange thyme is a 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.160
 wonder and then an average we 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.750
 we found it spoiled well we clarified 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.550
 with a little water and then 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.290
 we use the 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.600
 in what we are going to use because if 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.610
 we do the foliation first so it goes to 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.470
 penetrate the gel much better or what 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.940
 let's apply later so the solution 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.580
 the first thing to eliminate the cells 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.270
 dead and the skin will recover again 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.070
 Its natural shine and softness as os 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.820
 I say now, we can just do this 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:53.520
 save I have it in these containers 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.590
 they have a cap like that and now what 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.020
 I have in the bathroom like this when I go to 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.780
 shower I use the exfoliations already 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.980
 you know that it is not convenient to do them all 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.210
 the days we go in fact do not have to 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.520
 do them every day can be done 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.050
 because every ten or fifteen days is worth 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.670
 how you have the skin if the 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.830
 you have more fats you can always 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.050
 allow yourself to be leafed more often than if 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.630
 you have it more dry, so it is 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.910
 our wonderful homemade scrub 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.410
 you will see as if you try it 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.210
 will love it because it is that the 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:25.710
 skin that is wonderful because it is there 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.480
 luminous of pretty in general and as it is 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.340
 so easy and everything to do you will have it 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.590
 always in your bathroom with the 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.380
 different options that I have given you good 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.620
 Well, nothing else, I hope you liked it 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.720
 if you try it 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.130
 and not work the next video a 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.130
 needed chao
