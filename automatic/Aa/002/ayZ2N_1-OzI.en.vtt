00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.580
 let's build a snow house more 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.250
 known as igloo a structure 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.900
 associated with Eskimo culture all 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.520
 Anyone who has had to spend the night 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.960
 outdoors in freezing terrain 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.150
 will appreciate this technique of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.189
 survival either in the form of 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.170
 burrow cave, trench or igloo 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.110
 the snow will be our best ally for 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.120
 survive any of these about 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.560
 a whole igloo if they are well built 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.350
 they will keep a pretty temperature 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.059
 stable and not lower than 0 degrees and not 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.649
 isolate from the wind which we 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.600
 will allow to carry a sack of minor 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.750
 scale and dispense with the cover of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.570
 life is to say go lighter hands to the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.000
 work that we need with at least one 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.649
 shovel we will have enough if there are several 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.839
 and some other ice ax we will go more 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.179
 fast a probe can help us 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.680
 assess the depth and type of snow and 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.260
 a master builder of course the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.610
 coordination is fundamental 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.070
 first of all we will choose a 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.730
 surface of 2 to 3 meters in diameter and 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.010
 unless we can sleep stretched 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.540
 we can is to dig an initial hole 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.820
 these dimensions to win some 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.380
 centimeters of compartment caking 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.900
 we have the surface of the igloo and 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.430
 we will start to lift the walls 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.470
 next to the bivouac we will establish the 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.500
 quarry instead of where we have to extract 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.910
 blocks of compacted snow or ice 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.740
 and the snow is not transformed 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.410
 we recommend compacting with skis 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.820
 First shovel rackets or kicks if 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.500
 it was very hard or freezing 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.900
 We recommend the use of a saw 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.420
 hand pruning we have foresee this 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.250
 situation and have this tool 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.260
 previously the blocks can be of 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.700
 two by three or two by four spans 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.500
 approximately security though 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.720
 the bigger is better before 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.160
 we will end up using fewer parts and 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.410
 it will be easier to compact them come on let's go 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.270
 This quarry Eskimo manuals 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.430
 construction say that the blocks have 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.440
 from being smaller to larger and they have to 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.320
 spiral until it ends in 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.700
 the dome that is the theory the ideal is 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.470
 that these bricks are the most 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.140
 regular possible though on the 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.790
 almost anything goes, we'll raise the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.220
 walls and we will narrow the circle 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.200
 until you reach the vault 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.210
 with hands protected by gloves 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.190
 we will complete with snow the gaps between 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.040
 the blocks and we will treat them strongly 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.630
 to compact and weld the pieces on 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.760
 closure of the shelter is perhaps the most 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.220
 delicate and the difficulty increases with the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.750
 bivy size and we will try to tell 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.880
 with the maximum workforce in this 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.680
 moment you have to hold the blocks 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.260
 while they are filling their gaps and 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.480
 soldering based on fort I'm also going to 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.209
 close is now 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.970
 and which goes to death above finally 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.790
 we closed the dome the igloo is almost 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.769
 built the door is not a simple 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.690
 hole on one side should be 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.790
 oriented to leeward and we advise that 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.379
 is flanked by blocks of snow from 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.450
 such a way that a tunnel of 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.310
 entrance the least exposed to the wind in 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.280
 which we will place the backpacks to mode 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.230
 of the gate we also recommend drilling 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.910
 a pair of holes with the ice ax in the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.500
 top of the igloo 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.239
 these will allow the evacuation of 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.579
 gases that can produce stoves 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.879
 candles and the human being himself what 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.860
 we got and now to spend the night and 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.049
 there is already a bivouac protected from the wind 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.220
 with a constant temperature that never 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.290
 will lower the 0 degrees a few tips 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.629
 to finish to spend a night 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.599
 Comfortable tried and clear floor 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.700
 with mats the rope the backpack and if 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.890
 you do not have these elements sitting in 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.920
 the center separated from the walls and what 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.099
 more pegadito is possible 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.670
 remember, help us make the mountains 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.670
 more secure
