workaround on our forum our plugin is
structured<00:01:06.970> in<00:01:07.240> three<00:01:07.659> modules<00:01:08.080> there<00:01:08.799> is<00:01:08.950> a

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
structured in three modules there is a

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.249 
structured in three modules there is a
base<00:01:09.250> module<00:01:09.729> there<00:01:10.299> is<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.479> vertex<00:01:10.900> feeding

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
base module there is a vertex feeding

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.529 
base module there is a vertex feeding
module<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.830> a<00:01:12.070> generalisation<00:01:12.969> module<00:01:13.359> and

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
module and a generalisation module and

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.389 
module and a generalisation module and
the<00:01:13.960> last<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.560> vertex<00:01:14.859> feeding<00:01:15.219> and

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
the last to the vertex feeding and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.389 
the last to the vertex feeding and
veneration<00:01:15.939> modules<00:01:16.479> are<00:01:16.840> just<00:01:17.140> add-ons<00:01:17.710> to

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
veneration modules are just add-ons to

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.399 
veneration modules are just add-ons to
the<00:01:18.429> base<00:01:18.729> module<00:01:18.999> so<00:01:19.689> they<00:01:19.869> cannot<00:01:20.109> work

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
the base module so they cannot work

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.289 
the base module so they cannot work
independently<00:01:21.070> without<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.640> base<00:01:21.820> module

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
independently without the base module

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.709 
independently without the base module
let's<00:01:23.079> have<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.350> look<00:01:23.560> at<00:01:23.679> the<00:01:23.799> toolbars<00:01:24.719> since

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
let's have a look at the toolbars since

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.539 
let's have a look at the toolbars since
we<00:01:25.960> wanted<00:01:26.319> you<00:01:26.469> guys<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.710> be<00:01:26.950> able<00:01:27.219> to<00:01:27.310> test
