00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.980
 I choose 11 that does not have house bucks 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.300
 very good everyone has a lot of equipment 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.829
 that moves a team that moves me around 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.510
 example the green bay packers and I know if 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.129
 go back there I go there not the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.899
 useful molan but the green bay packers 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.879
 as it is cooler, they also go green 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.250
 which is my favorite color and I do not care 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.690

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.280
 Big big fat and with the exact face 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.620
 My face is not fistula 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.710
 is that it is accurate is a designed player 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.200
 created to be scary to 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.850

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.560
 I want good you have to simulate 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.349
 hey we 're in the second room 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.069
 now now I do something to some film 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:20.459
 that I'm going to the left I'm in the 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.989
 left and they will pass me or not good 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.989
 I have to block an uncle 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.510
 well come on let's simulate I think 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.040
 that would have some not finished the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.049
 party and there has not been much nothing 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.760
 Well , nothing happens either, this is a 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:41.080
 preseason game we go with another 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.320
 there simulating against the rams 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.390
 and I do not go out the game is over I'm not going 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.590
 to try to improve my player to see if 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.080
 that 's what I'm going to do a little more 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.540
 strong a little better match against 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.150
 the raiders 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.969
 a fourth room saved us and also 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:02.739
 we lose against Kansas City Chiefs 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:06.220
 it does not look like it's going to go against 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.640
 the seahawks either 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.560
 they pass the rooms and nothing 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.819
 well I will train to train there to 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.170

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.000
 72 to see if simulating the season 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.280

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.050
 come to play or have play off 12 4 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.420

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.160
 match against the buccaneers playoff to 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.950

 play or we will fight hard to get 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.780
 So far we only need one 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.510

 look at it look at it - try to try it 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.490

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.830
 we go simulation eye eye eye that we 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.990

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.310
 this is a story of overcoming this 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.080
 it's a story of if you want you can of 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.550
 Nobody tell you that you can not 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.139
 get some that are too much 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.690
 tall too fat to play in the 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:09.700
 nfl the balls give me another chance 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.700
 give me another chance and you're going to shit 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.960
 give the whole drive value and you will see what 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.150
 what happens on the ball during 8 9 10 11 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.039
 played in a row and you will see what happens is 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.720
 I do not care about the tactic coach 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.000
 it needs to pose is a good attack 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.580
 is that it does not matter I catch the ball and throw 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.210
 palante palante palante palante and who 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.610
 be in the middle 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.009
 I feel for him is that I'm moving forward and 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.780
 advancing and every time I'm closer to 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.759
 the touchdown line is that I'm going to win 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.430
 this match I just do not care what it is 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:42.240
 look at me look at me look at me a friendly palante 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:45.389
 the 56 can not the 60 can not come 123 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.310
 45 and I'm getting closer palpating 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.460
 the touchdown looks if I even receive 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.970
 until I get passes Now Now 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.460

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:14.370
