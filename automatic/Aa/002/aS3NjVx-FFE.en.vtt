will<00:00:22.320> need<00:00:22.680> cydia<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.070> basically<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.090> devices

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
will need cydia so basically I devices

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.930 
will need cydia so basically I devices
to<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.140> jailbroken<00:00:31.340> so<00:00:32.340> we're<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.520> going<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
to be jailbroken so we're just going to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:46.660 
to be jailbroken so we're just going to
load<00:00:33.120> up<00:00:33.300> cydia
