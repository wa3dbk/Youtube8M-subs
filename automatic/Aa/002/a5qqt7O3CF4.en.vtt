00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.360
 I'm in my circle I'm 28 years old 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.969
 have been doing old in berlin for five years 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.950
 modo so I'm in 2008 after studying 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.440
 came directly to Berlin as 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.960
 young designer seriously and worked 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.360
 In 2010 I finally decided 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.430
 to become self-employed 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.100
 I just had so many 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.700
 Ideas that I do not implement elsewhere 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.640
 could 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.020
 and then somehow the situation 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.239
 I have the right partner 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.010
 found to start businesses and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.010
 then also equal losgelegt 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.280
 Making fashion is not a nine to five job 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.100
 you need your passion for one 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.530
 life has to work, of course 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.360
 a lot of phases, but then it is 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.920
 great if you see the results 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.020
 It's also great to see you like that 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.690
 Many motivated women work for me 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.640
 and really full operational afford it 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.580

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.150
 what we have already done 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.330
 for me it was she was like that 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.640
 plausible cooperation because it is not 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.280
 only to be a sponsor 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.780

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.410
