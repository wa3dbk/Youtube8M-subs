plug them into a transformer which I'll
include<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:38.149> link<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:38.660> you<00:00:38.720> can<00:00:38.930> buy<00:00:39.079> that<00:00:39.260> as

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
include the link so you can buy that as

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.530 
include the link so you can buy that as
well<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:39.950> I've<00:00:40.370> put<00:00:40.579> them<00:00:40.700> just<00:00:41.149> on<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.300> back

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
well and I've put them just on the back

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.600 
well and I've put them just on the back
of<00:00:41.720> my<00:00:41.810> tank<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.380> blow<00:00:42.500> air<00:00:42.890> across<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.250> top<00:00:43.579> of

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
of my tank to blow air across the top of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.610 
of my tank to blow air across the top of
my<00:00:43.850> tank<00:00:44.120> now<00:00:44.870> I'm<00:00:45.020> not<00:00:45.170> going<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.320> go<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:45.470> the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
my tank now I'm not going to go to the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.500 
my tank now I'm not going to go to the
physics<00:00:46.010> of<00:00:46.100> how<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.340> system<00:00:47.000> works<00:00:47.239> but

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
physics of how the system works but

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.910 
physics of how the system works but
basically<00:00:47.660> it<00:00:48.020> just<00:00:48.079> uses<00:00:48.530> evaporative

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
basically it just uses evaporative

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.220 
basically it just uses evaporative
cooling<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.940> cool<00:00:50.149> your<00:00:50.270> tank<00:00:50.540> that<00:00:50.840> means<00:00:51.079> as

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
cooling to cool your tank that means as

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.260 
cooling to cool your tank that means as
the<00:00:51.260> air<00:00:51.860> blows<00:00:52.280> across<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.670> top<00:00:52.969> of<00:00:53.149> your

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
the air blows across the top of your

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.569 
the air blows across the top of your
tank<00:00:53.450> evaporates<00:00:54.410> off<00:00:54.590> some<00:00:54.800> water<00:00:55.040> pulls

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
tank evaporates off some water pulls

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.180 
tank evaporates off some water pulls
down<00:00:55.760> your<00:00:55.969> tank<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.110> I've<00:00:57.320> got<00:00:57.500> two<00:00:57.710> fans<00:00:57.950> up

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
down your tank so I've got two fans up

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.160 
down your tank so I've got two fans up
here<00:00:58.219> to<00:00:58.940> blow<00:00:59.149> air<00:00:59.300> across<00:00:59.540> the<00:00:59.629> top<00:00:59.930> of<00:00:59.960> my

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170
