gotta say that this is the one I like
the<00:03:04.870> most<00:03:05.019> it's<00:03:05.769> not<00:03:05.950> a<00:03:06.010> film<00:03:06.400> that's<00:03:06.489> shrouded

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
the most it's not a film that's shrouded

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.229 
the most it's not a film that's shrouded
in<00:03:07.599> mystery<00:03:08.200> like<00:03:08.829> those<00:03:09.040> other<00:03:09.310> two<00:03:09.639> films<00:03:10.090> I

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
in mystery like those other two films I

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.509 
in mystery like those other two films I
I<00:03:10.450> know<00:03:10.599> those<00:03:10.870> two<00:03:11.109> films<00:03:11.470> were<00:03:11.620> mystery

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
I know those two films were mystery

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.330 
I know those two films were mystery
films<00:03:12.940> like<00:03:13.540> mystery<00:03:13.989> action<00:03:14.200> films<00:03:14.829> but<00:03:15.250> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
films like mystery action films but the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.750 
films like mystery action films but the
thing<00:03:15.400> is<00:03:15.519> that<00:03:15.639> those<00:03:16.480> two<00:03:16.720> films<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:18.220> thought

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
thing is that those two films I thought

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.030 
thing is that those two films I thought
were<00:03:18.910> weak<00:03:19.209> because<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
were weak because of the the

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.000 
were weak because of the the
believability<00:03:21.669> or<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.180> lack<00:03:22.389> of

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
believability or the lack of

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.619 
believability or the lack of
believability<00:03:24.010> they<00:03:24.940> spell<00:03:25.329> out<00:03:25.359> everything

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
believability they spell out everything

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.930 
believability they spell out everything
at<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.470> end<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.040> movie<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:27.370> explain

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
at the end of the movie and explain

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.030 
at the end of the movie and explain
everything<00:03:27.970> to<00:03:28.569> you<00:03:28.599> let<00:03:29.139> as<00:03:29.290> if<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.680> was<00:03:29.889> like

very very well I mean sure that was

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.909 
very very well I mean sure that was
quite<00:05:19.160> a<00:05:19.220> number<00:05:19.430> of<00:05:19.610> years<00:05:19.700> ago<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.919> Liam

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
quite a number of years ago and Liam

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.710 
quite a number of years ago and Liam

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
than that I felt that the movies pretty

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.330 
than that I felt that the movies pretty
standard<00:05:41.479> action<00:05:41.780> fair<00:05:41.960> nothing<00:05:42.440> special<00:05:42.890> I

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
standard action fair nothing special I

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.310 
standard action fair nothing special I
mean<00:05:43.790> we've<00:05:43.940> seen<00:05:44.210> a<00:05:44.240> lots<00:05:44.540> of<00:05:44.720> these<00:05:44.870> types<00:05:45.140> of

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
mean we've seen a lots of these types of

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.500 
mean we've seen a lots of these types of
films<00:05:45.620> before<00:05:45.890> it<00:05:46.160> was<00:05:46.340> nothing<00:05:46.820> that<00:05:46.850> it<00:05:47.270> I

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
films before it was nothing that it I

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.020 
films before it was nothing that it I
felt<00:05:48.080> was<00:05:48.229> anything<00:05:48.890> that<00:05:49.040> stood<00:05:49.400> out<00:05:49.550> but<00:05:50.000> I

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
felt was anything that stood out but I

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.730 
felt was anything that stood out but I
