00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
campground and meantime I figured I kept

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.410 
campground and meantime I figured I kept
my<00:00:33.570> neighbor's<00:00:33.870> mower<00:00:34.760> going<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:36.000> thought<00:00:36.300> it

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
my neighbor's mower going I thought it

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.790 
my neighbor's mower going I thought it
might<00:00:36.540> be<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.690> little<00:00:36.899> easier<00:00:36.960> if<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.290> got<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.620> on

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
might be a little easier if I got up on

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.910 
might be a little easier if I got up on
the<00:00:37.920> lift<00:00:38.600> so<00:00:39.600> instead<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.020> climbing<00:00:40.350> down<00:00:40.710> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the lift so instead of climbing down and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.650 
the lift so instead of climbing down and
walking<00:00:41.309> around<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> ground<00:00:41.969> maybe<00:00:42.270> just

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
walking around on the ground maybe just

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.110 
walking around on the ground maybe just
kind<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:43.040> work<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.250> run<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> front<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
kind of work up run to the front of it

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.850 
kind of work up run to the front of it
and<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.300> sitting<00:00:45.570> belts<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.050> things<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.649> nice

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
and get sitting belts and things be nice

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.920 
and get sitting belts and things be nice
like<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.309> get<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> slip<00:00:48.210> back<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.690> there

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
like just get that to slip back on there

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.139 
like just get that to slip back on there
oh<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.320> would<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.590> something<00:00:49.860> sweet<00:00:50.219> three

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
oh that would be something sweet three

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:31.499 
oh that would be something sweet three
doggies<00:00:51.660> let's<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.559> do

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.279 

okay<00:01:32.509> I<00:01:32.539> was<00:01:32.750> looking<00:01:33.049> at<00:01:33.140> this<00:01:33.229> thing

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
okay I was looking at this thing

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.139 
okay I was looking at this thing
thinking<00:01:33.920> there<00:01:34.100> must<00:01:34.310> be<00:01:34.460> an<00:01:34.579> easier<00:01:34.729> way<00:01:34.970> to

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
thinking there must be an easier way to

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.300 
thinking there must be an easier way to
get<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.569> on<00:01:35.750> there<00:01:35.990> well<00:01:36.530> I<00:01:36.560> figured<00:01:36.979> out<00:01:37.130> that

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
get it on there well I figured out that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.240 
get it on there well I figured out that
there's<00:01:37.579> a<00:01:38.110> rod<00:01:39.110> that<00:01:39.649> goes<00:01:39.710> through<00:01:39.920> this

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
there's a rod that goes through this

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.730 
there's a rod that goes through this
hole<00:01:40.520> with<00:01:41.479> a<00:01:41.509> pin<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.110> one<00:01:42.560> of<00:01:42.649> these

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
hole with a pin in it one of these

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.830 
hole with a pin in it one of these
compounds<00:01:43.689> and<00:01:44.689> there's<00:01:44.960> two<00:01:45.140> rods<00:01:45.439> -<00:01:46.840> these

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
compounds and there's two rods - these

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.429 
compounds and there's two rods - these
two<00:01:48.429> here<00:01:49.429> go<00:01:50.390> up<00:01:50.479> into<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.750> thing<00:01:50.959> here<00:01:51.289> with<00:01:51.409> a

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
two here go up into a thing here with a

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.490 
two here go up into a thing here with a
pin<00:01:51.740> in<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.869> that's<00:01:53.869> all<00:01:54.080> there<00:01:54.200> is<00:01:54.289> one

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
pin in it and that's all there is one

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.719 
pin in it and that's all there is one
two<00:01:54.619> three<00:01:54.649> and<00:01:54.890> then<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.159> can<00:01:55.310> slide<00:01:55.549> the

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
two three and then you can slide the

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.240 
two three and then you can slide the
thing<00:01:55.909> forward<00:01:56.530> now<00:01:57.530> all<00:01:57.709> I<00:01:57.740> have<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:58.039> do<00:01:58.130> is

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
thing forward now all I have to do is

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.690 
thing forward now all I have to do is
slide<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:58.610> back<00:01:59.349> and<00:02:00.349> put<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.039> pins<00:02:01.280> back<00:02:01.520> in

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
slide it back and put the pins back in

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.749 
slide it back and put the pins back in
it<00:02:01.819> and<00:02:01.970> should<00:02:02.479> be<00:02:02.630> good<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:02.869> go<00:02:03.250> I'm<00:02:04.250> thinking

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
it and should be good to go I'm thinking

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.639 
it and should be good to go I'm thinking
it<00:02:04.880> might<00:02:04.909> not<00:02:05.270> be<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.479> hard<00:02:05.989> to<00:02:06.110> slide<00:02:06.349> back

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
it might not be that hard to slide back

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.020 
it might not be that hard to slide back
because<00:02:06.890> there's<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:07.130> pretty<00:02:07.340> deep<00:02:07.549> knotch

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
because there's a pretty deep knotch

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.710 
because there's a pretty deep knotch
in<00:02:08.509> this<00:02:09.259> pulley<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:10.099> I<00:02:10.729> did<00:02:10.940> put<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.180> bar<00:02:11.450> right

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
in this pulley and I did put a bar right

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.009 
in this pulley and I did put a bar right
here<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:12.650> apprise<00:02:12.920> this<00:02:13.280> spring-loaded<00:02:14.060> pull

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
here to apprise this spring-loaded pull

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.660 
here to apprise this spring-loaded pull
it<00:02:15.170> here<00:02:15.349> open<00:02:15.799> to<00:02:16.130> give<00:02:16.310> me<00:02:16.400> a<00:02:16.430> little<00:02:16.579> bit

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
it here open to give me a little bit

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.819 
it here open to give me a little bit
more<00:02:16.880> wiggle<00:02:17.060> room<00:02:17.209> so<00:02:17.569> now<00:02:18.470> I'm<00:02:18.560> going<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.709> try

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
more wiggle room so now I'm going to try

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.559 
more wiggle room so now I'm going to try
to<00:02:18.860> slide<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.430> back<00:02:19.579> with<00:02:19.819> the<00:02:19.910> pins<00:02:20.120> back<00:02:20.329> in

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
to slide it back with the pins back in

00:02:20.569 --> 00:03:03.460 
to slide it back with the pins back in
it's<00:02:20.750> that<00:02:20.900> worse<00:02:21.049> we'll<00:02:21.319> be<00:02:21.410> done<00:02:21.819> push<00:02:22.819> me<00:02:22.970> up

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.860 

well<00:03:04.470> that<00:03:04.620> was<00:03:04.739> easy

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
well that was easy

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.360 
well that was easy
last<00:03:06.870> time<00:03:07.080> we<00:03:07.230> did<00:03:07.410> one<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.620> his<00:03:07.769> mowers<00:03:08.130> I

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
last time we did one of his mowers I

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.960 
last time we did one of his mowers I
think<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.269> was<00:03:09.390> his<00:03:09.540> older<00:03:09.870> John<00:03:10.140> Deere<00:03:10.700> we<00:03:11.700> had

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
think it was his older John Deere we had

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.880 
think it was his older John Deere we had
a<00:03:12.000> heck<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.690> wrestling<00:03:13.170> match<00:03:13.380> seems<00:03:13.739> like

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
a heck of a wrestling match seems like

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.610 
a heck of a wrestling match seems like
we<00:03:14.010> laid<00:03:14.190> on<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.400> ground<00:03:14.580> both<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:15.060> us<00:03:15.209> and

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
we laid on the ground both of us and

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.930 
we laid on the ground both of us and
moaned<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.830> groaned<00:03:16.890> and<00:03:17.310> pulled<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.730> pushed

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
it wasn't easy but this one went on

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.190
