basically you do that for each chord and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.140 
basically you do that for each chord and
just<00:02:02.600> depending<00:02:02.810> where<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:04.490> court<00:02:04.760> starts

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
just depending where the court starts

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.780 
just depending where the court starts
like<00:02:05.420> say<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:06.260> E<00:02:06.290> chord<00:02:06.680> this<00:02:07.250> doesn't<00:02:07.610> start

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
like say the E chord this doesn't start

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.880

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
on the a string it starts on the B so

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.070 
on the a string it starts on the B so
you're<00:02:09.979> gonna<00:02:10.100> pick<00:02:10.250> those<00:02:10.550> two<00:02:10.810> down<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:12.050> E

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
you're gonna pick those two down the E

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.580 
you're gonna pick those two down the E
and<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.530> a<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.920> then<00:02:13.850> you're<00:02:14.420> gonna<00:02:14.540> hit<00:02:14.690> D<00:02:15.560> B

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590
