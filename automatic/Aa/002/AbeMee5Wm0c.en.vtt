00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.570 
versions of tons of hearts for the DS
one<00:00:28.359> was<00:00:28.570> an<00:00:28.720> animated<00:00:29.289> cutscene<00:00:29.949> girl<00:00:30.189> where

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.580 
one was an animated cutscene girl where

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.700 
one was an animated cutscene girl where
they<00:00:30.670> had<00:00:30.820> like<00:00:31.000> multiple<00:00:31.420> what<00:00:32.230> the<00:00:32.320> cutscene

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
they had like multiple what the cutscene

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.280 
they had like multiple what the cutscene
were<00:00:32.890> basically<00:00:33.340> all<00:00:33.670> anime<00:00:34.420> style<00:00:34.690> and<00:00:35.079> then

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
were basically all anime style and then

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.139 
were basically all anime style and then
they<00:00:35.469> had<00:00:35.620> a<00:00:35.649> CG<00:00:36.100> version<00:00:36.129> with<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:36.640> cutscenes

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
they had a CG version with the cutscenes

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.660 
they had a CG version with the cutscenes
was<00:00:37.390> just<00:00:37.629> cg<00:00:38.379> styles<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.070> I<00:00:39.160> think<00:00:39.430> pretty

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
was just cg styles and I think pretty

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.779 
was just cg styles and I think pretty
much<00:00:39.790> everyone<00:00:40.300> agrees<00:00:40.780> that<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:41.110> nma

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
much everyone agrees that the nma

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.090 
much everyone agrees that the nma
version<00:00:42.789> was<00:00:43.450> better<00:00:43.480> than<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.110> CG<00:00:44.530> version<00:00:44.559> the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
version was better than a CG version the

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.360 
version was better than a CG version the
CG<00:00:45.520> version<00:00:45.550> is<00:00:46.149> elliptic<00:00:47.039> ridiculous<00:00:48.039> it<00:00:48.250> was

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
CG version is elliptic ridiculous it was

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.729 
CG version is elliptic ridiculous it was
like<00:00:48.550> it<00:00:48.940> looked<00:00:49.180> it<00:00:49.570> kind<00:00:49.899> of<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.379> me<00:00:50.530> look

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
like it looked it kind of to me look
