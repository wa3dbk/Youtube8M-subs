00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
a pipe on or something like that to make

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.100 
a pipe on or something like that to make
a<00:01:14.420> little<00:01:14.659> faster<00:01:15.110> rev<00:01:15.319> faster<00:01:19.990> overall<00:01:20.990> I

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
a little faster rev faster overall I

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.930 
a little faster rev faster overall I
definitely<00:01:21.679> like<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.950> Honda<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.429> felt<00:01:22.789> like

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
definitely like the Honda I felt like

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.730 
definitely like the Honda I felt like
the<00:01:23.030> power<00:01:23.240> he<00:01:23.720> had<00:01:23.840> definitely<00:01:24.229> revved<00:01:24.500> out

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
the power he had definitely revved out

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.919 
the power he had definitely revved out
to<00:01:25.520> where<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.700> felt<00:01:26.030> in<00:01:26.119> years<00:01:26.240> past<00:01:26.569> the<00:01:26.780> thing

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
to where I felt in years past the thing

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.840 
to where I felt in years past the thing
would<00:01:27.050> just<00:01:27.110> kind<00:01:27.409> of<00:01:27.470> drop<00:01:27.740> off<00:01:27.950> but<00:01:28.550> overall

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
would just kind of drop off but overall

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.760 
would just kind of drop off but overall
like<00:01:29.119> I<00:01:29.240> said<00:01:29.450> I<00:01:29.479> think<00:01:29.750> all<00:01:29.960> these<00:01:30.140> bikes<00:01:30.409> I

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
like I said I think all these bikes I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.560 
like I said I think all these bikes I
can<00:01:31.549> I<00:01:31.819> could<00:01:32.330> go<00:01:32.420> race<00:01:32.630> tomorrow

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.999 

really<00:01:36.570> liked<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.929> love<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.350> way<00:01:37.469> it<00:01:37.590> handled
