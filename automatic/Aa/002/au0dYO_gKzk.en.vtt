00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello everyone and welcome to the new 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.260
 release we are on the old zone today we are with 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.429
 talk about you wonderful 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.940
 unbelievable of them 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.050
 and left pepper sort which will 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.050
 Rostov tailoring 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.960
 your grams 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.420
 this with trepidation is quite a reserve 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.340
 completely autonomously do not require your 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.620
 interventions is the beginning therefore very 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.630
 a lot of free time for that 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.390
 busy with what's really important 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.100
 tired disciplines okay without further 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.470
 right away let's not try it with salt 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.980
 build build literally without two 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.230
 a piece 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.650
 this very system and all of us 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:49.180
 need to put under this way 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:52.240
 comparator repeaters sweat with clamped 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.820
 Shifty I put two over them two 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.290
 puzzle block extend 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:03.070
 it's all here to put here 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:06.040
 temporary block put the chest and suck it 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.200
 neighbors chest connecting funnels to them 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.040
 which are already automatically blocked 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.070
 these ration torches further put on 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.020
 temporary block we have chests and doing 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.869
 funnels are directed somewhere in the side of 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.910
 side this is important they in these funnels here 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.900
 temporary blocks we remove them more 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:31.920
 not needed 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:40.150
 and add comparators and comparator 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:44.560
 a moment we connect from knitwear from 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:48.460
 the comparator we connect here are three pieces 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.220
 Redstone why exactly 3 and not two how 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.610
 used in all the previous ones i 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.460
 now one second I will add the actual 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.409
 material feed line which by the way 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.640
 must necessarily be from funnels 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.369
 because even a powerful protection system 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.290
 which we have protection from before 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.640
 the content that we have on these 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.910
 in this design 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.180
 filters on the funnels, even she will not hold 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.950
 you unfortunately if you have here 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.750
 flow of items nino funnels she 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.600
 objects floating in water 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.630
 they unfortunately can clog the system and 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.060
 all break but okay let's not about 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.099
 bad 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.940
 we'll talk good why is this system 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:39.500
 more reliable than ordinary filters 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.470
 because here in these funnels we 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.330
 filter out a few more items 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.010
 we make these trash here 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.120
 items that block all items 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.959
 except for what we need is not 18 or 19 as 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.250
 usually a-41 why is it done this way 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.890
 we will put the item itself which 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.880
 We want the chest and got the same 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.880
 do the most here 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:15.080
 perfect 40 is not here we will have in every 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:20.569
 so that's why this hope system 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.849
 now if i ask for enough stone 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.239
 or framework system 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.860
 one thing can fill right here down to 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:34.470
 two three or four units 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.200
 earlier this led to the fact that this 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.790
 here is the block here is this piece of the diet 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.579
 activated this piece next 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.180
 ration and broke the filter in this in this 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.620
 the chest 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.140
 but now the momentum he did he extended 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.030
 save this distance for one block 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.510
 there used to be two blocks now there are three 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.620
 block 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.209
 and accordingly, if there will be 2 1 2 3 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.470
 or even 4 pieces of material 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.440
 the system is still not full of perry 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.000
 this piece of redstone is activated but 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.280
 this one is not activated 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.680
 the whole body becomes how comparators work 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.810
 comparators do not update do not consider 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.209
 each piece is a red piece of an item each 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.030
 the item that you put the chest they are 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.740
 only note the difference if you dream between 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.830
 a comparator which gives a signal in two 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.169
 block and comparators which hijacked three 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.090
 block more than the difference between 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.380
 a comparator which gives a signal in one 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.260
 block and comparator which issues 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.599
 signal in two blocks then this difference is 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.919
 we use the second one more 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.919
 thank you very much 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.620
 winter next video to you good bye 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.620
 until
