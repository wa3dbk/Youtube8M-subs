00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139 
to turn that on and we will see our hub

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:34.209 
to turn that on and we will see our hub
pop-up<00:01:32.259> and<00:01:33.259> I'm<00:01:33.619> just<00:01:33.740> going<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:33.950> tap<00:01:34.189> that

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
pop-up and I'm just going to tap that

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.660 
pop-up and I'm just going to tap that
and<00:01:34.880> I'm<00:01:35.329> going<00:01:35.569> to<00:01:35.630> push<00:01:36.469> the<00:01:36.829> button<00:01:37.249> on<00:01:37.459> the

and I'm going to push the button on the
back<00:01:38.499> for<00:01:39.499> the<00:01:40.130> device<00:01:40.399> and<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:41.090> should<00:01:41.929> make

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
back for the device and that should make

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:47.080 
back for the device and that should make
it<00:01:42.319> be<00:01:42.499> able<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.679> be<00:01:42.829> seen<00:01:43.069> and<00:01:44.349> doops<00:01:45.349> I<00:01:46.090> pushed

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
it be able to be seen and doops I pushed

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.910 
it be able to be seen and doops I pushed
it<00:01:47.209> a<00:01:47.270> little<00:01:47.299> too<00:01:47.569> late

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.550 

and<00:01:54.340> now<00:01:54.880> let's<00:01:55.659> try<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.869> do<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.020> right<00:01:56.170> first

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
and now let's try to do it right first

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.830 
and now let's try to do it right first
time

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
time

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:12.010 
time
scan<00:01:58.840> for<00:01:59.110> it<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:03.720> connect<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.810> it

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.060 

and<00:02:12.530> now<00:02:13.460> we<00:02:13.520> have<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:13.940> on<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.090> TV<00:02:14.530> now<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
and now we have it on the TV now the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.030 
and now we have it on the TV now the
reason<00:02:16.460> why<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:17.030> really<00:02:17.780> nice<00:02:18.080> is<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.890> has

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
reason why this is really nice is it has

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.210 
reason why this is really nice is it has
a<00:02:19.070> couple<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.850> really<00:02:20.720> nice<00:02:21.110> parts<00:02:21.560> about<00:02:21.680> it

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
a couple of really nice parts about it

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.050 
a couple of really nice parts about it
one<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:24.020> obviously<00:02:24.200> have<00:02:24.770> mirroring<00:02:25.580> so

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
one is you obviously have mirroring so

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.950 
one is you obviously have mirroring so
you<00:02:26.120> can<00:02:26.600> see<00:02:26.870> your<00:02:27.080> device<00:02:27.380> just<00:02:28.810> like<00:02:29.810> you

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
you can see your device just like you

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.920 
you can see your device just like you
would<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.140> your<00:02:30.500> phone<00:02:31.090> however<00:02:32.090> one<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
would on your phone however one of the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.490 
would on your phone however one of the
big<00:02:33.290> parts<00:02:33.560> about<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.490> that<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:36.020> have

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
big parts about this is that you have

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.830 
big parts about this is that you have
the<00:02:36.680> ability<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.070> do<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:37.430> without<00:02:37.910> Wi-Fi

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
the ability to do this without Wi-Fi

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.320 
the ability to do this without Wi-Fi
this<00:02:39.560> uses<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:39.950> technology<00:02:40.610> called<00:02:40.820> Wi-Fi

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
this uses the technology called Wi-Fi

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.230 
this uses the technology called Wi-Fi
direct<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:42.200> these<00:02:42.890> two<00:02:43.340> devices<00:02:43.850> are

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
direct so these two devices are

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.820 
direct so these two devices are
connecting<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.720> each<00:02:44.930> other<00:02:45.110> without

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
connecting to each other without

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.260 
connecting to each other without
actually<00:02:46.460> needing<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:47.210> Wi-Fi<00:02:47.840> signal<00:02:49.270> they're

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
actually needing a Wi-Fi signal they're

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.270 
actually needing a Wi-Fi signal they're
directly<00:02:50.750> connecting<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.890> each<00:02:52.010> other

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
directly connecting it to each other

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.180 
directly connecting it to each other
with<00:02:52.970> Wi-Fi<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.560> nice<00:02:54.680> part<00:02:54.890> about<00:02:54.920> this

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
with Wi-Fi so the nice part about this

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
this and it's really nice for that

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.990 
this and it's really nice for that
factor<00:03:12.710> that<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.010> can<00:03:13.130> take<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.430> anywhere<00:03:13.640> and

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
factor that you can take it anywhere and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.720 
factor that you can take it anywhere and
use<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.480> with<00:03:14.570> any<00:03:14.720> TV<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:16.250> essentially

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
makes any TV a smart TV so it's really

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.820 
makes any TV a smart TV so it's really
nice<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.700> you<00:03:19.880> have<00:03:20.060> that<00:03:20.180> ability<00:03:20.830> now

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
nice that you have that ability now

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.690 
nice that you have that ability now
another<00:03:22.520> thing<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:22.820> can<00:03:22.940> do<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.090> course<00:03:23.210> is

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
another thing you can do of course is

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.160 
another thing you can do of course is
you<00:03:25.700> have<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.970> ability<00:03:26.330> to<00:03:26.390> do<00:03:26.570> a<00:03:26.600> couple<00:03:27.080> of

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
you have the ability to do a couple of

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.890 
you have the ability to do a couple of
different<00:03:27.470> things<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.430> one<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.720> can

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
different things so one is you can

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.660 
different things so one is you can
actually<00:03:31.150> play<00:03:32.150> games<00:03:32.560> so<00:03:33.560> as<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.040> can<00:03:34.160> see<00:03:34.430> I

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
actually play games so as you can see I

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.270 
actually play games so as you can see I
can<00:03:35.300> play<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.630> game<00:03:35.900> while<00:03:36.470> looking<00:03:36.860> at<00:03:37.100> the

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
can play this game while looking at the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.430 
can play this game while looking at the
TV<00:03:38.800> now<00:03:39.800> just<00:03:40.730> letting<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.090> know<00:03:41.270> if<00:03:42.020> you<00:03:42.200> have

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
TV now just letting you know if you have

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.040 
TV now just letting you know if you have
any<00:03:42.620> like<00:03:43.100> ever<00:03:43.490> using<00:03:44.000> this<00:03:44.180> wireless

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
any like ever using this wireless

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.160 
any like ever using this wireless
technology<00:03:45.830> it's<00:03:46.520> because<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.150> you<00:03:47.570> have<00:03:48.140> a

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
technology it's because you you have a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.530 
technology it's because you you have a
Wi-Fi<00:03:48.950> signal<00:03:49.220> that's<00:03:49.670> kind<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:49.880> interfering

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
Wi-Fi signal that's kind of interfering

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.230 
Wi-Fi signal that's kind of interfering
with<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:51.070> so<00:03:52.070> if<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.250> have<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.370> lot<00:03:52.670> of<00:03:52.700> Wi-Fi

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
with it so if you have a lot of Wi-Fi

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.340 
with it so if you have a lot of Wi-Fi
s--<00:03:53.350> stuff<00:03:54.350> on<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:56.180> it's<00:03:56.420> distorting<00:03:57.200> it

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
s-- stuff on and it's distorting it

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.000 
s-- stuff on and it's distorting it
might<00:03:58.010> be<00:03:58.130> a<00:03:58.160> little<00:03:58.250> fuzzy<00:03:58.610> um<00:03:59.350> that<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:00.710> is

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
might be a little fuzzy um that that is

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.590 
might be a little fuzzy um that that is
why<00:04:01.220> it's<00:04:01.580> because<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:01.880> have<00:04:01.970> too<00:04:02.090> many<00:04:02.180> Wi-Fi

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
why it's because you have too many Wi-Fi

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.090 
why it's because you have too many Wi-Fi
signals<00:04:02.930> around<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.200> area<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.620> it's<00:04:03.740> kind<00:04:04.070> of

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
signals around the area and it's kind of

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.350 
signals around the area and it's kind of
storing<00:04:04.520> the<00:04:04.580> image<00:04:05.080> but<00:04:06.080> if<00:04:06.740> you<00:04:07.040> don't

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
storing the image but if you don't

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.410 
storing the image but if you don't
and<00:04:08.960> you'll<00:04:09.170> have<00:04:09.320> a<00:04:09.380> pretty<00:04:09.680> clear<00:04:10.130> image<00:04:10.420> and

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
and you'll have a pretty clear image and

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.060 
and you'll have a pretty clear image and
then<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.780> can<00:04:11.900> just<00:04:12.050> go<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.770> see<00:04:12.890> that

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
then you can just go you see that

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.600 
then you can just go you see that
jaggedness

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
jaggedness

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.190 
jaggedness
I<00:04:13.730> actually<00:04:13.970> have<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.210> router<00:04:14.480> right<00:04:14.750> next<00:04:15.080> to

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
I actually have a router right next to

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.539 
I actually have a router right next to
it<00:04:15.230> so<00:04:15.500> that's<00:04:15.590> why<00:04:15.800> it's<00:04:15.950> causing<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.340> little

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
it so that's why it's causing a little

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.370 
it so that's why it's causing a little
delay<00:04:17.680> but<00:04:18.680> you<00:04:19.610> can<00:04:19.730> basically<00:04:19.970> play<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:20.930> I

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
delay but you can basically play and I

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.130 
delay but you can basically play and I
cannot<00:04:21.709> look<00:04:21.890> at<00:04:22.010> my<00:04:22.160> phone<00:04:22.670> and<00:04:23.120> just<00:04:23.210> watch

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
cannot look at my phone and just watch

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:31.720 
cannot look at my phone and just watch
the<00:04:24.380> TV<00:04:29.140> and<00:04:30.140> there's<00:04:31.130> going<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.340> be<00:04:31.400> of<00:04:31.520> course

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
the TV and there's going to be of course

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.030 
the TV and there's going to be of course
really<00:04:31.940> enjoyable<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:33.500> other<00:04:33.650> thing<00:04:33.860> you<00:04:33.950> can

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
really enjoyable the other thing you can

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.160 
really enjoyable the other thing you can
do<00:04:34.190> of<00:04:34.340> course<00:04:34.400> is<00:04:34.850> watch<00:04:35.510> things<00:04:35.870> like

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
do of course is watch things like

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.760 
do of course is watch things like
Netflix<00:04:36.560> or<00:04:37.630> any<00:04:38.630> video<00:04:38.960> on<00:04:39.020> your<00:04:39.290> device<00:04:39.560> so

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
Netflix or any video on your device so

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.990 
Netflix or any video on your device so
I'm<00:04:39.860> going<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.070> go<00:04:40.160> ahead<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.550> play<00:04:40.730> a<00:04:40.760> video

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
I'm going to go ahead and play a video

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.880 
I'm going to go ahead and play a video
on<00:04:41.480> my<00:04:41.780> device<00:04:44.170> and<00:04:45.490> let<00:04:46.490> me<00:04:46.610> play<00:04:46.880> this<00:04:47.120> one

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.670 

and<00:04:51.890> this<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:52.790> a<00:04:52.820> 1080p<00:04:53.390> video<00:04:53.810> which<00:04:54.260> is

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
and this is a 1080p video which is

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.950 
and this is a 1080p video which is
really<00:04:54.710> nice<00:04:55.400> now<00:04:56.090> again<00:04:56.360> you<00:04:56.540> see<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.720> little

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
really nice now again you see a little

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.530 
really nice now again you see a little
bit<00:04:57.080> of<00:04:57.370> jaggedness<00:04:58.370> on<00:04:58.760> there<00:04:58.970> again<00:04:59.150> it's

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
bit of jaggedness on there again it's

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.170 
bit of jaggedness on there again it's
because<00:04:59.720> I<00:04:59.840> have<00:05:00.050> my<00:05:00.770> router<00:05:01.160> right<00:05:01.550> Nexus

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
because I have my router right Nexus

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.710 
because I have my router right Nexus
