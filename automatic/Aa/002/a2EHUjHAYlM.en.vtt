Rodriguez hopefully Albert Pujols isn't

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.979 
Rodriguez hopefully Albert Pujols isn't
on<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.649> dirty<00:02:08.099> list<00:02:08.599> hopefully<00:02:09.599> doesn't

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
on that dirty list hopefully doesn't

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.690 
on that dirty list hopefully doesn't
have<00:02:10.289> any<00:02:10.440> secrets<00:02:10.770> but<00:02:11.160> make<00:02:11.340> Don

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
have any secrets but make Don

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.520 
have any secrets but make Don
think<00:02:11.849> about<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.420> more<00:02:12.690> home<00:02:12.989> runs<00:02:13.020> he

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
think about it the more home runs he

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.740 
think about it the more home runs he
hits<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.099> more<00:02:14.280> milestones<00:02:15.030> he<00:02:15.239> reaches

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
hits and the more milestones he reaches

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.259 
hits and the more milestones he reaches
the<00:02:16.319> more<00:02:16.560> people<00:02:17.069> are<00:02:17.190> going<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.550> dig<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:18.239> find

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
the more people are going to dig to find

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.500 
the more people are going to dig to find
out<00:02:18.690> if<00:02:18.870> he<00:02:18.989> ever<00:02:19.170> did<00:02:19.500> use<00:02:19.769> steroids<00:02:20.250> or<00:02:20.700> HGH

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
out if he ever did use steroids or HGH

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.770 
out if he ever did use steroids or HGH
or<00:02:22.110> whatever<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.370> hopefully<00:02:23.640> pools<00:02:24.390> doesn't

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
or whatever so hopefully pools doesn't

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.259 
or whatever so hopefully pools doesn't
have<00:02:24.900> any<00:02:25.080> secrets<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.920> hide<00:02:26.160> because<00:02:27.000> if<00:02:27.120> he

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
have any secrets to hide because if he

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.990 
have any secrets to hide because if he
does<00:02:27.569> they're<00:02:28.530> going<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.920> get<00:02:29.040> exposed<00:02:29.580> I'm

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
does they're going to get exposed I'm

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.890 
does they're going to get exposed I'm
Brian<00:02:30.540> now<00:02:30.900> that's<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.739> no-brainer
