00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.480
 let's make a cardboard hen 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.610
 that will help us to collect the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.160
 eggs in an exam if we are going to do or 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.570
 to store the decorated eggs for 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.150
 we are going to use a box of 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.529
 cereals or if you have some a little 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.509
 wider than this one that I am using 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.210
 better but not once you cereal 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.800
 the first thing is to remove the caps 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.540
 one side and now with a 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.329
 marker, let's go slowly 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.000
 we make this kind of oval until a 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.980
 little more than half 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.660
 we make the crest and the tail 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.440
 you are simply copying what I 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.440
 I'm drawing here 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.100
 a little bit for you to see 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 now for the wing we are going to draw this 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.559
 kind of trapeze a rectangle that does not 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.140
 I ended up doing the other 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.600
 side we do exactly the same 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.269
 keep in mind that where was the tail 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.739
 to be at the crest is now worth the 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.550
 tail is left and the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.560
 ridge on the right 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.850
 do it more or less the same because it is not going to 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.240
 be equal 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 and on the sides you draw this species 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.740
 of inverted triangle 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.390
 now let's cut through the lines 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880
 that we have drawn to be very careful 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.750
 here when you get down the wing to not 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.750
 cut the base 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.330
 it's not that difficult just if you want 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.520
 you stop the video at the same time you go 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.950
 drawing 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.960
 You see the wing we are stuck here 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.190
 the ridge to a side with three small pickets 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.080
 or with those you want 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.410
 and the tail you give the curvature that 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.410
 you want 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.270
 then we will adjust it a little bit more 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.270
 cuts 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.740
 and almost we have it is already good and 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.050
 we have trimmed by the lines now 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.510
 we do the lateral and you have to get 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.790
 down to the whole triangle in 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.350
 straight line if you can not do it with the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.940
 scissor the fis with a cutter like me 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.060
 because this part will then be stuck to if 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.040
 you see 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.440
 you have to be able to put a lid on the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.330
 cereal over the other 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.970
 on the other side we do exactly what 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.650
 same we truncated the triangle first and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.360
 then we come all the way down 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.350
 straight line from the vertex of the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.060
 triangle 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.860
 We do this as you can see on both sides 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.560
 to do the front part and the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.180
 back of the hen now let's go 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.260
 to paste it I'm going to use tape 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.580
 double sided but you can use 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.350
 glue we are going to put 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.080
 one lid over the other as we have 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.920
 seen before beige so that we 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.920
 stand on top 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.330
 see how well you will not be there 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.590
 do not worry if it is not the same as what 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.810
 let's cut a little better 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.130
 we do the same on both sides in the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.130
 part in front and in the back 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.340
 once these two sides have arrived we will 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.050
 paste the crest of the hen to the 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.220
 little head we have exactly the same 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.220
 we put glue 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.850
 and we squeeze 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.530
 the three little triangles are left together 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.080
 and we will do the same in the part of the 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.790
 tail we put glue and put the 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.560
 two tips that we have in the part of 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.140
 forward leaving the back free 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.240
 we have a third triangulation because that 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.200
 we leave it free then we will give it a 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.200
 little bent form 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.480
 well that is well stuck 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.950
 and now what we're going to do is touch up 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.360
 a bit since when you paste it you may not 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.590
 has remained the same because we have 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.150
 done before a little bit of ozone 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.610
 it is now that we already have the parties 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.040
 together we cut it well so that 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.900
 remain the same 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.730
 now for the peak we take a piece of 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.889
 cardboard that we have left over and we are going to 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.139
 draw a hexagon me the easiest 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.789
 meeting is to make triangles like 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.850
 you are seeing a triangle above 2 a 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:26.650
 the sides and two more beige we 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.830
 this figure will remain 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.420
 we do not make the last triangle below 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.420
 we cut the piece 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.029
 I always do it a little bit 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.949
 you can do with a rule and now we go 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:49.960
 to start folding a triangle on the 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.960
 another as you see we are hitting 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.080
 a little the current form is a little bit 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:58.030
 hard 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.220
 then we will have a kind of 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.800
 prism as you are seeing you see when you turn 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.879
 one over the other with a gap in the middle 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.870
 cut a little bit so I can stay 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:09.189
 just the triangles and this would be the 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.550
 beak of the hen a kind of 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:13.680
 pyramid 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.770
 I'm going to join the last triangulation with the 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.930
 first with some glue tape 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.630
 double-sided that I'm using myself and 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.770
 now you see that we are going to place in the 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.210
 front part below the ridge 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.550
 let's put a little bit of 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.669
 glue again to stick the peak of 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.669
 side 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.930
 I put the flat part down and the 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.930
 vertex on the side of the triangle 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.690
 Well look, we have the chicken 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.510
 what is the basis and now what are we going to 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.370
 to do is to paint it, I'm going to paint it 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.780
 white color with acrylic paint but 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.220
 you can paint the color you most 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.199
 Like I'm going to make it white and then 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.210
 and to draw blue polka dots you can 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.190
 do it upside down blue and it is or good 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.520
 yellow brown heat quote that 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.520
 you want 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.130
 do not forget to paint the wings for 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:11.249
 both sides and I'm going to leave the inside 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.649
 unpainted cardboard color 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:15.829
 will have to give several layers and here and 

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:18.179
 I have it painted with several layers and dry 

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:21.479
 what I'm going to do is proceed to 

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:24.179
 paint the crest to decorate it with the 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:26.069
 blue polka dots and the beak and yellow keko 

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:27.779
 in the red presita and make polka dots 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.680
 you can make stripes or just nothing 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:31.539
 leave the white 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.389
 that I 'm going to do a few dots like that 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:38.370
 simply with a thin brush of 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:39.690
 tip I'm doing dots 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.600
 so that you remain the same too 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.440
 you can use the stick a skewer or 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.570
 something like that 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.990
 but good with a little brush more or less 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.990
 it fits well 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.370
 more or less at the same distance some of 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.389
 others and I would have it here ready for 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.099
 peak as I said I will use 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:01.770
 yellow color you can also use 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:04.500
 Orange 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.970
 Temperas also serve us and with 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.580
 very careful not to paint what is the 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.610
 hen we painted the beak for the four 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.610
 sides 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:20.979
 3 pardon 3 33 no 4 what am I thinking 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.900
 good and now the cres red date or good 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.360
 also red naranjita but that remains 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.400
 well now and put some eyes the 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.599
 you can draw or put these little eyes of 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.860
 plastic that move that make me 

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:32.319
 a lot of grace that also have a 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.880
 blue eyelid and I 'm going to put a 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:35.289
 little bit of glue and you can put them 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.340
 or in the front just above 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:40.740
 of the peak or on the sides 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.150
 I'm going to settle here juntitos the 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.960
 hens always man his little face 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.030
 contour more 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.800
 Things that I have and my friend have done 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.050
 and it helps us to put inside what 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.940
 we want and here I leave you two other ideas 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.190
 for an easter rabbit that is a 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.569
 little bag and some eggs decorated 

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.530
 several ways with various techniques 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:58.530
 various
