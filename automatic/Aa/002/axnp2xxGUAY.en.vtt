hello this is ric KY D Android another

hello this is ric KY D Android another
hidden<00:00:08.639> feature<00:00:09.030> came<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:10.650> me<00:00:10.799> something

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
hidden feature came for me something

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.820 
hidden feature came for me something
that<00:00:11.459> I<00:00:11.490> really<00:00:11.940> wanted<00:00:12.270> and<00:00:12.449> that<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.049> hate

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
that I really wanted and that is I hate

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.189 
that I really wanted and that is I hate
seeing<00:00:14.129> a<00:00:14.340> blank<00:00:14.639> screen<00:00:14.879> on<00:00:15.090> my<00:00:15.119> watch<00:00:15.389> it's

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
seeing a blank screen on my watch it's

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.660 
seeing a blank screen on my watch it's
annoying<00:00:16.529> because<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:17.039> kind<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.250> takes<00:00:17.430> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
annoying because it kind of takes the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.470 
annoying because it kind of takes the
benefit<00:00:18.180> away<00:00:18.300> from<00:00:18.650> having<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.740> regular<00:00:20.160> watch

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
benefit away from having a regular watch

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.070 
benefit away from having a regular watch
so<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.690> gear<00:00:21.900> s<00:00:22.140> if<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.980> swipe<00:00:23.220> up<00:00:23.900> go<00:00:24.900> into

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
so on the gear s if you swipe up go into

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.500 
so on the gear s if you swipe up go into
settings<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:26.360> go<00:00:27.360> into<00:00:27.539> style<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.330> then<00:00:30.330> go

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
settings then go into style and then go

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.459 
settings then go into style and then go
into<00:00:30.690> clocks<00:00:31.730> you<00:00:32.730> can<00:00:32.940> have<00:00:33.210> clock<00:00:33.629> always<00:00:33.989> on

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
into clocks you can have clock always on

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.220 
into clocks you can have clock always on
it's<00:00:35.190> really<00:00:35.460> weird<00:00:36.060> hidden<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.900> think<00:00:37.140> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
it's really weird hidden you think it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.680 
it's really weird hidden you think it
would<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.350> under<00:00:37.650> display<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.540> some

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
would be under display but for some

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.770 
would be under display but for some
reason<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.200> under<00:00:40.410> style<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:42.300> once<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.630> turn

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
reason it's under style so once you turn

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.410 
reason it's under style so once you turn
it<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.130> this<00:00:44.130> will<00:00:44.700> tell<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.239> will

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it on this will tell you that it will

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.740 
it on this will tell you that it will
decrease<00:00:45.870> your<00:00:46.350> battery<00:00:47.010> consumption<00:00:47.750> just

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
decrease your battery consumption just

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.930 
decrease your battery consumption just
to<00:00:48.840> give<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.050> an<00:00:49.110> idea<00:00:49.470> in<00:00:49.770> my<00:00:50.040> experience<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
to give you an idea in my experience I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.290 
to give you an idea in my experience I
used<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:52.230> 40%<00:00:52.850> at<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.030> end<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
used to get about 40% at the end of the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.330 
used to get about 40% at the end of the
day<00:00:54.450> for<00:00:54.510> my<00:00:54.960> battery<00:00:55.320> life<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.130> could

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
day for my battery life so I could

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.160 
day for my battery life so I could
pretty<00:00:57.059> much<00:00:57.149> use<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.630> for<00:00:57.750> another<00:00:57.870> day<00:00:58.050> it

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
pretty much use it for another day it

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.670 
pretty much use it for another day it
was<00:00:58.260> 40<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.680> 45<00:00:59.070> now<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.270> more<00:01:00.690> end<00:01:00.899> up<00:01:01.050> at<00:01:01.230> 20

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
was 40 to 45 now I'm more end up at 20

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.249 
was 40 to 45 now I'm more end up at 20
to<00:01:01.770> 25<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.420> takes<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.719> good<00:01:03.870> amount<00:01:03.930> of

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
to 25 so it takes a good amount of

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.479 
to 25 so it takes a good amount of
battery<00:01:04.619> especially<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.159> you're<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> heavy

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
battery especially if you're a heavy

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.849 
battery especially if you're a heavy
user<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.060> me<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.689> you're<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.899> light<00:01:07.109> user<00:01:07.380> you

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:07.859 
user like me if you're a light user you

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:09.770 
user like me if you're a light user you
probably<00:01:08.189> won't<00:01:08.369> notice<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.789> too<00:01:09.030> much<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
probably won't notice it too much and

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.819 
probably won't notice it too much and
you'll<00:01:09.929> still<00:01:10.139> get<00:01:10.289> through<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:10.619> days

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:10.829 
you'll still get through two days

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.859 
you'll still get through two days
however<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.789> you<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.060> heavy<00:01:12.240> user<00:01:12.509> this

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
however if you are a heavy user this

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.929 
however if you are a heavy user this
will<00:01:13.109> definitely<00:01:13.469> make<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.979> charge<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.639> every

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
will definitely make you charge it every

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.399 
will definitely make you charge it every
night<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:16.259> now<00:01:16.409> when<00:01:17.159> your<00:01:17.280> screen<00:01:17.520> goes<00:01:17.670> off

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
night so now when your screen goes off

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.660 
night so now when your screen goes off
you<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.679> have<00:01:20.279> a<00:01:21.799> constant<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.950> watch<00:01:23.340> that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you will have a constant on watch that

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.519 
you will have a constant on watch that
we<00:01:23.759> can<00:01:23.909> always<00:01:24.270> look<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.719> see<00:01:24.929> what<00:01:25.109> time<00:01:25.319> it

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:25.529 
we can always look and see what time it

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:28.309 
we can always look and see what time it
is<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.829> like<00:01:26.459> this<00:01:26.609> so<00:01:26.969> much<00:01:27.209> better<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.289> other

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
is I like this so much better the other

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.260 
is I like this so much better the other
thing<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.799> like<00:01:29.100> about<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.639> is<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.149> it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
thing I like about this is that it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.179 
thing I like about this is that it
personalizes<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.170> whichever<00:01:31.469> clock<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.159> have

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
personalizes to whichever clock you have

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.469 
personalizes to whichever clock you have
it<00:01:32.609> on<00:01:32.789> so<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.139> on<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.409> clock<00:01:35.479> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it on so if I have it on this clock the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.309 
it on so if I have it on this clock the
off<00:01:36.749> feature<00:01:37.729> will<00:01:38.729> look<00:01:38.939> different<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> this

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
off feature will look different and this

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.230 
off feature will look different and this
is<00:01:40.380> something<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.459> like<00:01:41.670> about<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
is something that I really like about it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.389 
is something that I really like about it
that<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.719> actually<00:01:43.079> does<00:01:43.289> isn't<00:01:43.679> one<00:01:44.009> o'clock

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that it actually does isn't one o'clock

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.879 
that it actually does isn't one o'clock
it<00:01:44.939> will<00:01:45.119> actually<00:01:45.329> change<00:01:45.840> upon<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.649> clock

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
it will actually change upon the clock

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:49.580 
it will actually change upon the clock
that<00:01:47.099> you<00:01:47.279> have<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.819> there<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:48.779> if<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.499> an

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that you have on there so if you have an

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.139 
that you have on there so if you have an
analog<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.249> it's<00:01:50.429> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.639> different

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
analog one it's going to be different

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.940 
analog one it's going to be different
from<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.419> digital<00:01:51.779> one<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.169> it's<00:01:52.590> everything

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
from a digital one and it's everything

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.509 
from a digital one and it's everything
is<00:01:53.279> different<00:01:53.549> which<00:01:53.819> I<00:01:53.939> really<00:01:54.270> like
