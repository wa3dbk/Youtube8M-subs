00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
for an anti-sea to rock up in the mail

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.180 
for an anti-sea to rock up in the mail
and<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.780> did<00:00:12.929> today<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> meantime<00:00:13.950> I

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
and it did today so in the meantime I

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.910 
and it did today so in the meantime I
was<00:00:14.400> using<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.790> wireless<00:00:15.120> adapter<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:16.470> play<00:00:16.680> you

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
was using a wireless adapter to play you

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.130 
was using a wireless adapter to play you
know<00:00:16.949> play<00:00:17.250> games<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.730> do<00:00:17.820> what<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.000> do<00:00:18.140> did

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
know play games and do what I do did

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.230 
know play games and do what I do did
work<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> computer<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.939> sucked

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
work on the computer and it just sucked

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.179 
work on the computer and it just sucked
like<00:00:21.539> for<00:00:21.779> gaming<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.260> sucked<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.039> was

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
like for gaming it sucked and this was

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.800 
like for gaming it sucked and this was
probably<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:23.820> had<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> really<00:00:24.359> thick

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
probably because I had a really thick

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.779 
probably because I had a really thick
wall<00:00:25.199> in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.680> way<00:00:25.830> anyway<00:00:26.400> I'll<00:00:26.550> take<00:00:26.699> you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
wall in the way anyway I'll take you

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.670 
wall in the way anyway I'll take you
over<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.000> some<00:00:27.210> gameplay<00:00:27.599> footage<00:00:27.869> I'll<00:00:28.230> talk

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
over to some gameplay footage I'll talk

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
over to some gameplay footage I'll talk
about<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:29.010> catch-22<00:00:29.400> involved<00:00:30.179> here<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
about the catch-22 involved here and

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.849 
about the catch-22 involved here and
also<00:00:31.019> at<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> end<00:00:31.439> I'll<00:00:31.560> make<00:00:31.679> some

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
also at the end I'll make some

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.139 
also at the end I'll make some
recommendations<00:00:32.009> for<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.759> guys<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.030> let's

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
recommendations for you guys so let's

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.430 
recommendations for you guys so let's
move<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.719> gameplay<00:00:33.960> video<00:00:34.440> anyway<00:00:36.440> so

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
move on to the gameplay video anyway so

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.139 
move on to the gameplay video anyway so
this<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.920> game<00:00:38.190> called<00:00:38.399> heroes<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.000> newerth

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
this is a game called heroes of newerth

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.030 
this is a game called heroes of newerth
now<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> perfect<00:00:40.379> game<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.559> showing

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
now this is a perfect game for showing

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.600 
now this is a perfect game for showing
why<00:00:41.309> games<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.899> suck<00:00:43.230> if<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.829> getting<00:00:44.219> packet

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
why games can suck if you getting packet

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
why games can suck if you getting packet
loss<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.539> as<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.170> I'm<00:00:46.260> getting

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
loss so as you can see here I'm getting

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.319 
loss so as you can see here I'm getting
packet<00:00:46.860> loss<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.160> my<00:00:47.280> wireless<00:00:47.520> adapter<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
packet loss on my wireless adapter and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.840 
packet loss on my wireless adapter and
heroes<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.370> things<00:00:50.670> are<00:00:50.820> just

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
heroes and you know things are just

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.639 
heroes and you know things are just
jumping<00:00:51.420> around<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> screen<00:00:52.050> pretty<00:00:52.469> much

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
jumping around on the screen pretty much

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.740 
jumping around on the screen pretty much
teleporting<00:00:53.430> from<00:00:53.610> time<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.940> time<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.390> this

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
teleporting from time to time and this

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.569 
teleporting from time to time and this
is<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:54.930> due<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.199> packet<00:00:55.949> loss<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.340> since

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
is just due to packet loss and since

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.700 
is just due to packet loss and since
it's<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> server-side<00:00:57.239> based<00:00:57.690> game<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it's a server-side based game when the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.410 
it's a server-side based game when the
packets<00:00:59.070> come<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.550> client<00:01:00.000> side<00:01:00.180> where

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
packets come to the client side where

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.229 
packets come to the client side where
I'm<00:01:00.600> at<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.469> know<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.789> data<00:01:03.030> just

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I'm at you know that this the data just

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.880 
I'm at you know that this the data just
says<00:01:03.449> well<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.780> meant<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.199> now<00:01:04.409> banks

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
says well you meant to be here now banks

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
says well you meant to be here now banks
or<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.189> teleport<00:01:05.640> smell<00:01:05.850> across<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> screen

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
or just teleport smell across the screen

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.260 
or just teleport smell across the screen
it's<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.770> jaggedy<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.610> pretty<00:01:09.180> much

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
it's really just jaggedy and pretty much

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.289 
it's really just jaggedy and pretty much
unplayable<00:01:09.900> now<00:01:10.650> I'm<00:01:10.770> sure<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.220> had<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> lot

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
unplayable now I'm sure if I had a lot

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.600 
unplayable now I'm sure if I had a lot
better<00:01:12.450> wireless<00:01:13.049> setup<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:14.220> wouldn't

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
better wireless setup this wouldn't

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.460 
better wireless setup this wouldn't
happen<00:01:14.790> now<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.180> did<00:01:15.509> test<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.110> my<00:01:16.229> wife's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
happen now I did test this on my wife's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
happen now I did test this on my wife's
laptop<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:17.970> only<00:01:18.180> about<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.450> meter<00:01:18.810> and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
laptop and I was only about a meter and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
laptop and I was only about a meter and
a<00:01:19.049> half<00:01:19.080> away<00:01:19.470> two<00:01:19.890> meters<00:01:20.220> from<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> router

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
a half away two meters from the router

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.060 
a half away two meters from the router
and<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.960> know<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.350> no<00:01:22.500> walls<00:01:22.830> or

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and you know there was no walls or

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
and you know there was no walls or
anything<00:01:23.130> blocking<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> gameplay<00:01:24.659> was

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
anything blocking and the gameplay was

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.289 
anything blocking and the gameplay was
really<00:01:25.080> smooth<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.820> goes<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.270> show

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
really smooth so this just goes to show

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.810 
really smooth so this just goes to show
that<00:01:27.570> yeah<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.500> wall<00:01:28.740> is<00:01:29.009> sort<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.340> blocking

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that yeah the wall is sort of blocking

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.580 
that yeah the wall is sort of blocking
the<00:01:29.909> wireless<00:01:30.270> signal<00:01:30.659> at<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:30.810> house<00:01:31.079> but

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the wireless signal at my house but

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.080 
the wireless signal at my house but
let's<00:01:31.770> contrast<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.970> I've

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
let's contrast this now that I've

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.819 
let's contrast this now that I've
installed<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> NAC<00:01:33.900> let's<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.470> look<00:01:34.650> now

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
installed the NAC let's have a look now

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
installed the NAC let's have a look now
so<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.490> popping<00:01:36.270> over<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.509> me

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
so this is just popping over to me

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.690 
so this is just popping over to me
installing<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> icings<00:01:37.829> here<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
installing the icings here the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.280 
installing the icings here the
disconnect<00:01:39.210> symbols<00:01:39.540> are<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.810> gone<00:01:40.049> away

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
disconnect symbols are just gone away

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.530 
disconnect symbols are just gone away
completely<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:41.159> there's<00:01:41.759> no<00:01:42.000> interrupts

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
completely so there's no interrupts

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.469 
completely so there's no interrupts
there's<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.530> smooth<00:01:44.420> now<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
there's it's just smooth now the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.840 
there's it's just smooth now the
catch-22<00:01:45.990> involved<00:01:46.829> with<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.640> if

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
catch-22 involved with this is that if

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.760 
catch-22 involved with this is that if
you<00:01:48.030> generally<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.840> too<00:01:49.049> difficult<00:01:49.259> to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
you generally if it's too difficult to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289 
you generally if it's too difficult to
route<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> cable<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.820> there's<00:01:50.970> lots<00:01:51.090> of

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
route a cable and there's lots of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.120 
route a cable and there's lots of
barriers<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.960> walls<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.439> between<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
barriers of walls in between you and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.249 
barriers of walls in between you and
your<00:01:53.220> router<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.180> wireless<00:01:54.600> signal<00:01:55.049> is

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
your router then the wireless signal is

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.490 
your router then the wireless signal is
most<00:01:55.530> likely<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.310> bad<00:01:56.729> as<00:01:56.969> well<00:01:57.500> so

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
most likely going to be bad as well so

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.690 
most likely going to be bad as well so
that's<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:58.979> that's<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.399> catch-22

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that's you know that's the catch-22

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.420 
that's you know that's the catch-22
involve<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> always<00:02:00.780> recommend<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.770> cable<00:02:02.340> if

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
involve so I always recommend a cable if

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.420 
involve so I always recommend a cable if
you<00:02:02.520> can<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.899> conclusion<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.560> will<00:02:04.829> say<00:02:05.159> if

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
you can so in conclusion I will say if

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.459 
you can so in conclusion I will say if
you<00:02:05.670> guys<00:02:05.939> want<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.750> go<00:02:06.930> with<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.140> wireless

mini ITX build then you don't have to
worry<00:02:32.680> about<00:02:32.770> those<00:02:33.070> adapters<00:02:33.550> what<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.820> will

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
worry about those adapters what you will

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.100 
worry about those adapters what you will
have<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.210> worry<00:02:34.360> about<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.630> getting<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.960> good
