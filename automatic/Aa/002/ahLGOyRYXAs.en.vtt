a very big surprise and but it was a
good<00:01:52.829> thing<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.460> did<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:54.180> at

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
good thing that we did that because at

good thing that we did that because at
the<00:01:54.479> end<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.930> two-month<00:01:55.439> time<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.979> had<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the end of that two-month time we had a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.330 
the end of that two-month time we had a
we<00:01:56.850> had<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.060> legitimate<00:01:57.570> budget<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.409> based<00:01:59.100> on
