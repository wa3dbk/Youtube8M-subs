00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.080
 over the past few years samsung and 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.860
 honor and a number of other android 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.080
 manufacturers 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.299
 finally discredited the console 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.880
 I will not speak for everyone but personally 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.119
 when i see the notorious mini in title 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.980
 devices then imagine something simple 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.080
 simplified version saying pass 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.970
 no miniature version of the flagship 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.920
 so no wonder that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.980
 sony when picked up the name for 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.899
 miniature version of xperia z1 looking 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.149
 all this obscurantism decided to refuse 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.250
 from mini to compact 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.710
 actually this is the smartphone we are today and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.050
 see for yourself spots sergey this review 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.450
 sony xperia z1 compact 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.700
 I confess to me honest appearance in 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.379
 sony product line such 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.000
 the smartphone turned out to be complete 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.760
 by surprise after the company 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.860
 released ph ultra z it seemed that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.590
 the Japanese like all other manufacturers 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.359
 set off in all serious and begin to rivet 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.789
 device for mutants with huge 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.460
 long fingers and thereâ€™s a smartphone on you 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.860
 with a diagonal of only four and three inches yes 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.310
 also with flagship characteristics though 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.010
 body 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.500
 xperia z1 compact not really 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.479
 compact as the name implies 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.850
 huge frames spoil the overall impression 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.430
 in the same case it was easily possible 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.920
 squeeze the display and more dimensions 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.350
 xperia are comparable to moto x 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.150
 and then the display is 4 and 7 inches 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.640
 use z1 compact 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.009
 one hand is still not very comfortable 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.990
 even me with my not very small paw 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.360
 I can hardly reach the top 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.310
 the left corner of the display so in this plan 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.799
 how the bodies of the smartphone part are 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.350
 certain questions otherwise everything 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.780
 excellent branded power button all 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.149
 also pleases the eye although it is like all 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.130
 other controls became a bit 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.500
 smaller in size it's not at all 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.810
 interferes with its functionality below it 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.119
 there is a volume rocker and a button 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.939
 cameras on the other hand under the plugs 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.549
 there is a micro usb slot for 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.930
 memory cards and slot for micro sim card 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.180
 on 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.700
 place and dock connector which in 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.429
 Alas, the kit does not go as a whole for sony 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.800
 everything is very standard and I like it 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.050
 but what other Android smartphone will you find 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.510
 today a camera button and a mount for 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.480
 strap and expired and that is 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.820
 for a long time this approach is not to my liking 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.640
 mentioned stubs means need to mention 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.180
 and waterproof smartphone though it 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.470
 too already becoming something by itself 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.500
 for mobile devices 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.300
 sony unlike galaxy s5 smartphones 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.730
 Japanese company can be subjected 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.830
 moderate effects of water treatments 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.750
 no risk of losing the warranty left 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.730
 just think where and why 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.100
 and ending with the body will not forget 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.410
 scold sony for using plastic 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.570
 if the frame on the sides of the device is left 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.970
 metal then the back cover is now 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.400
 her glass and plastic when 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.230
 feel it is unlikely because 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.810
 it is like the front safety glass 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.060
 covered with a special film both of these 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.910
 films very quickly collect small 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.610
 scratches lose their product appearance all 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.280
 already tired of asking sony to stop this 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.530
 engage but they persistently bend their line 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.380
 and seal your gadgets with films 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.570
 forgetting about oleophobic coating would be better 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.489
 Instead , they gave a bundled case 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.209
 if they are so worried about preservation 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.519
 devices 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.530
 go to the iron fillings and start with 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.660
 the display here is normal I 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.269
 I emphasize the normal display and and 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.310
 permits do not go to the blue if 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.920
 him look at an angle like it did with 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.690
 xperia z1 and generally leaves only 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.120
 positive impressions 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.820
 great that did not just put 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.739
 full hd matrix after all on such a diagonal 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.049
 the human eye won't see anyway 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.150
 no difference the extra processor board 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.950
 just do not strain that positive 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.900
 affects battery life 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.820
 but more on that later for 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.370
 performance responds like he 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.820
 snapdragon 800 with graphics accelerator 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.160
 adreno 320 and 2 gigabyte operational 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.530
 memory as a whole solution for now 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.330
 one of the most 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.100
 the country and the majority 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.140
 software and 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.600
 games will run as it should without visible 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.150
 delayed and given the display I'm sure that 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.950
 compact has a much larger margin 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.230
 performance than models on 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.310
 similar to the chipset but with huge full 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.530
 hd display 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.690
 play on this smartphone more than 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.090
 comfortable the only moment which 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.520
 somewhat darkens the action this is what 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.350
 the hand closes the speaker which is already not 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.780
 very thunder we go further inside android 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.760
 4.4.2 with sony branded shell 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.500
 Considering that this is nissens and even more so 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.210
 not touchwiz one hundred two gigabytes 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.000
 RAM for comfortable work 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.940
 more than enough I like the shell 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.770
 from sony there are no 2,500 thousand possibilities 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.050
 but everything is simple and tasteful 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.150
 standard solutions from android head 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.460
 neatly up to the shroud and wrapped in 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.930
 beautiful shell everything is so good 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.690
 I don't even want to bet 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.880
 alternative keyboard from google play 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.130
 do you already know achievements plus 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.960
 the absence of a bunch of unnecessary services from 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.540
 the boxes are very much affected 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.330
 autonomous device with the accumulator 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.250
 at 2300 milliamps per hour smartphone is easy 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.290
 stand one and a half days average 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.660
 operation and if zamorochitsya with 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.700
 proprietary power mode 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.180
 stamina then you can reach and steeper 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.950
 numbers 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.130
 xperia compact main camera 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:27.190
 migrated from the progenitor z1 here already 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.500
 as many as 27 megapixels true if you shoot 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.200
 in automatic mode, it turns out 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.760
 all the same eight all the power of the xperia camera 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.919
 compact can only be felt 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.050
 switching to manual quality settings 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.360
 photos no claims all on 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.370
 the best level but problems with software 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.660
 there are a first video finder 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.060
 periodically behaving strangely 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.310
 showing some noises and which ones 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.320
 Gon photo never happens in the second 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.330
 there is a time delay when you 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.700
 clicked on the trigger and when saved 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.620
 photo is annoying plus cold 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.960
 sometimes it takes a long time to start the camera 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.240
 seconds so miss a good shot 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.520
 sex before compact is easier than ever 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.300
 but I repeat the quality of the photos 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.849
 an abundance of shooting modes and 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.710
 Settings undoubtedly pleased summing up 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.960
 sony z1 compact 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.300
 it is almost the only current 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.800
 moment device running 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.020
 android where sizes are not reduced 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.569
 excuse mediocre at 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.800
 iron top processor top camera 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.840
 excellent display 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.909
 the presence of a memory card slot 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.919
 this smartphone simply has no weak points 

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:30.409
 but except perhaps the prices 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:33.740
 recommended retail price for xperia 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.750
 z compact is 22 thousand rubles a 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.990
 the smartphone itself is available in four color 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.909
 making black yellow pink and white 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.370
 how we have it all we wanted 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.389
 tell you about sony xperia z1 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.610

 subscribe to our youtube channel than
