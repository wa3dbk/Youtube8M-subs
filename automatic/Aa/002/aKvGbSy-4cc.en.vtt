person's opinion over a next so it's
really<00:00:40.230> hard<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.980> think<00:00:41.010> we're<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.180> something

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
really hard I think we're with something

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.970 
really hard I think we're with something
like<00:00:43.460> like<00:00:44.629> baseball<00:00:45.629> it's<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.989> obviously

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
like like baseball it's like obviously

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.200 
like like baseball it's like obviously
the<00:00:47.129> team<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> most<00:00:47.730> amount<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.059> points

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
the team with the most amount of points

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.270 
the team with the most amount of points
is<00:00:48.449> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> win<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:49.410> very<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.949> black<00:00:50.250> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
is going to win it's very like black and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
is going to win it's very like black and
white<00:00:50.519> where<00:00:51.000> we're<00:00:51.180> surfing<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.019> black

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
white where we're surfing it's not black

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.780 
white where we're surfing it's not black
and<00:00:52.410> white<00:00:52.470> it's<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.860> Technicolor<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.670> can

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
and white it's like Technicolor it can

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.310 
and white it's like Technicolor it can
be<00:00:53.910> anything<00:00:54.330> you<00:00:54.540> know<00:00:54.660> what<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.899> mean<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
be anything you know what I mean and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.319 
be anything you know what I mean and
it's<00:00:55.800> subjective<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.760> your<00:00:56.940> personal

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it's subjective to like your personal

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.940 
it's subjective to like your personal
preference<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.770> it's

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
preference so I really think that it's

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.959 
preference so I really think that it's
hard<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.520> put<00:01:00.120> surfing<00:01:00.660> into<00:01:01.579> that<00:01:02.579> sort<00:01:02.910> of

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
hard to put surfing into that sort of

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.670 
hard to put surfing into that sort of
box<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.629> know<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.899> mean<00:01:04.050> it'll<00:01:04.259> always<00:01:04.530> be

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
box you know what I mean it'll always be

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.830 
box you know what I mean it'll always be
they'll<00:01:05.009> always<00:01:05.190> be<00:01:05.550> something<00:01:05.790> missing<00:01:06.270> but

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
they'll always be something missing but

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.719 
they'll always be something missing but
it's<00:01:07.020> important<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.800> because<00:01:08.340> like

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it's important to have that because like

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.540 
it's important to have that because like
you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.830> world<00:01:11.009> needs<00:01:11.280> free

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
you know just as the world needs free

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.670 
you know just as the world needs free

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
surfers the world needs competitive

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.170

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
surfers because that's something that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.139 
surfers because that's something that
like<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.810> easy<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.979> benchmark<00:01:17.310> something<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
like is easy to benchmark something and

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.480 
like is easy to benchmark something and
say<00:01:18.300> like<00:01:18.509> oh<00:01:18.660> this<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.140> why<00:01:19.440> it<00:01:19.800> deserves<00:01:20.250> this

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
say like oh this is why it deserves this

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.249 
say like oh this is why it deserves this
because<00:01:20.910> these<00:01:21.119> people<00:01:21.360> are<00:01:21.539> doing<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.990> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
because these people are doing this you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.260 
because these people are doing this you
know<00:01:22.289> it's<00:01:22.560> like<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.890> need<00:01:23.039> one<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:24.030> needs

know it's like you need one one needs
the<00:01:24.479> other<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.560> competitive<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
the other if it was just competitive I

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.130 
the other if it was just competitive I
think<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.299> people<00:01:27.540> wouldn't<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> into

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
think a lot of people wouldn't be into

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.140 
think a lot of people wouldn't be into
it<00:01:28.260> if<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.830> researching<00:01:29.310> there

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
it if it was just researching there

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.429 
it if it was just researching there
wouldn't<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> lot<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.720> people<00:01:30.869> into<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.320> you

because I think that's what's important
you<00:03:26.610> know<00:03:26.760> rather<00:03:27.030> than<00:03:27.180> being<00:03:27.569> like<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:28.200> is

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
you know rather than being like this is

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.199 
you know rather than being like this is
my<00:03:28.530> goal<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.160> like<00:03:29.310> I'm<00:03:29.520> gonna<00:03:29.610> work<00:03:29.849> so<00:03:30.060> hard

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
my goal and like I'm gonna work so hard

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.089 
my goal and like I'm gonna work so hard
to<00:03:30.330> make<00:03:30.510> that<00:03:30.690> it's<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:31.019> sometimes<00:03:31.500> if<00:03:31.739> you

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
to make that it's like sometimes if you

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.770 
to make that it's like sometimes if you
have<00:03:32.280> such<00:03:32.489> tunnel<00:03:32.910> vision<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.540> miss

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
have such tunnel vision you miss

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.240 
have such tunnel vision you miss
everything<00:03:34.080> else<00:03:34.380> that's<00:03:34.620> around<00:03:34.830> you<00:03:35.099> and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
everything else that's around you and
