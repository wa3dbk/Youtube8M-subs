00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 Our clinic is the Salon of Beauty, located in Melbourne, Australia 

00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:09.802
 It has existed for 28 years, and I myself have been working there for 10 years. 

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.404
 My specialty is skin treatment. 

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:17.005
 We are 10 employees who work with the skin of the salon. 

00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:23.006
 And we introduced Beauté Pacifique two years ago. 

00:00:23.807 --> 00:00:30.207
 Before we started negotiating Beauté Pacifique, we led six different product ranges, 

00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:32.908
 each of which was suitable for each skin type. 

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:40.009
 So when a client had a skin problem, we had to switch between the product arrays depending on their skin type. 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.010
 We have now cut from six different cosmeceuticals, and we phase out all product series, 

00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:52.311
 because Beauté Pacifique can be used for all skin types, 

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:55.812
 and the purchase price is more beneficial for the client. 

00:00:56.713 --> 00:01:03.513
 We have more or less searched all over the world for cosmeceuticals that can help rebuild the skin structure. 

00:01:03.714 --> 00:01:10.014
 And Beauté Pacifique certainly does more than most cosmeceuticals on the market. 

00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:12.916
 None of the cosmeceuticals we've seen 

00:01:13.117 --> 00:01:15.417
 can do what Beauté Pacifique can do. 

00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:16.618
 And even in one cream. 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.119
 Without laser treatment. 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.920
 - In fact, the products can also be used in connection with laser treatment. 

00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:29.821
 If you need laser treatment, 

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:36.322
 You can also continue the maintenance with the Beauté Pacifique products. 

00:01:37.022 --> 00:01:42.222
 So it's really a unique cream, 

00:01:42.223 --> 00:01:48.723
 and we are very excited about having the cream, and Beauté Pacifique, 

00:01:48.724 --> 00:01:52.024
 at our clinic. - Yeah, you should see our bathroom scissors, 

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:55.925
 they are completely blue and white. 

00:01:56.326 --> 00:01:59.126
 Since I started using the creams myself, 

00:02:00.527 --> 00:02:02.427
 I can certainly feel a big difference. 

00:02:02.628 --> 00:02:06.828
 Also, customers who don't want to use anything every single day, 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.829
 They might only use something a few times a week. They also achieve results. 

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:12.331
 Even the most lazy clients, 

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.732
 see results. 

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:19.533
 The effectiveness of the creams is incredible. 

00:02:20.934 --> 00:02:26.134
 We made small samples of Cremè Métamorphique, and then invited all our clients into the clinic, 

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:28.636
 where they all got a try. 

00:02:28.737 --> 00:02:30.837
 And the feedback area determined whether or not we would take the products in. 

00:02:30.938 --> 00:02:34.338
 In the course of two weeks, they had all made a preview of Crème Métamorphique. 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.439
 And that was what made the ball roll. 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.440
 So it was not necessary to make promotions or market them. 

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:41.441
 We just gave the clients one try, one small sample. 

00:02:41.442 --> 00:02:42.942
 And it was pretty much that. 

00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:44.643
 That was how we started. 

00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:52.844
 - We heard about Beauté Pacficique at a conference we were in Melbourne. 

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:55.045
 They had the ultrasound scanner with 

00:02:55.046 --> 00:03:00.546
 and because we had not previously seen such a type of scanner, 

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:03.847
 we were pretty interested. 

00:03:03.848 --> 00:03:07.548
 After talking to the Beaué Pacifique people, 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:15.449
 We sent Taryn to Sidney to investigate - to look at the ingredients, 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.950
 and to talk to the people behind it. 

00:03:18.951 --> 00:03:25.351
 My boss couldn't understand that the ingredients could actually be in the cream. 

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:29.852
 Many manufacturers declare the ingredients, but not the transport system. 

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:35.253
 So I went to Sidney to look into it. 

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:42.155
 And then I had a meeting with Flemming in Melbourne, where we discussed it, 

00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:48.456
 and I thought, "Wow - that's really what they say it is." 

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:50.758
 And that is also what has now brought us to Denmark. 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.059
 We will see where it comes from, 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.560
 and how it has come to the world. 

00:03:54.561 --> 00:03:57.661
 And we will talk more with Flemming, and hear the science behind the creams. 

00:03:57.662 --> 00:04:00.062
 And get training in the products and talk to the doctors up here. 

00:04:00.163 --> 00:04:02.763
 - We have been working with the products for two years, 

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:08.664
 And they were also in Australia before we introduced them. 

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:14.165
 And it's pretty revolutionary. 

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:15.966
 - It stands out from other products. 

00:04:15.967 --> 00:04:19.267
 especially in relation to all the broken skin we have in Australia, 

00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:21.468
 - Because of the sun. - Yes. 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:23.669
 We see the worst cases of broken skin, 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.970
 very age-changed skin. 

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:30.271
 And we can really do something about that with Beauté.
