00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
back to this okay so this texture pack

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.340 
back to this okay so this texture pack
like<00:00:36.830> I<00:00:36.949> said<00:00:37.129> it's<00:00:37.340> HD<00:00:37.489> it's<00:00:37.850> X<00:00:38.000> 128<00:00:38.480> I'm<00:00:38.780> I'm

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
that texture pack network so this work

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.189 
that texture pack network so this work
is<00:00:51.470> called<00:00:51.890> default<00:00:52.370> HD<00:00:53.000> you<00:00:53.540> can<00:00:53.600> find<00:00:53.900> it<00:00:54.019> the
