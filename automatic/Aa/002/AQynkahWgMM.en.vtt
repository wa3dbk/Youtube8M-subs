00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.830
 she is 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.380
 if you are going to create new schedules 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.039

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.740
 here on this day of the year what I created 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.050
 Paulo is now Lugano 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.890
 the company said that the client 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.169
 If it is going to be our Brazilian account and the pcm 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.399
 the road church pac still on the tab of the playstation network 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.699
 And you have to go until they stay here. 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.679
 subscribe to the playstation network I already left the best Portuguese because 

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:23.169
 present this menu option in Portuguese yesterday 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.479
 I here write about closing and 8 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.679
 clicked here in 28 minutes to start 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:33.439
 there are two is obsolete certainly comes here to create a new culture for the 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.399
 users 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.550
 we're here to create a new account 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.550
 and there is a lot of information that we have to fill 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.149
 Continue 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:47.289
 and then it arrives in the first part then the information 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:51.509
 these will fill in these three main starting fields here 

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:53.539
 So, your country obviously 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.209
 in our case it's going to be Brazil 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.639
 Here in Brazil 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.049
 all the Portuguese cloak 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.530
 and here the datena cement he danced date of birth filled here and date 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:05.509
 of birth 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.569
 in front of a store any team 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.569
 will propose next step 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.139
 arrived here in the next step the next step is nothing more than the term of 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.789
 service or biome or with the famous river boundary agreement then that part is 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:26.930
 very important 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.519
 why the correct would be not all this index is less 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.499
 here have a number of things that are the duties duties of all that is 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.399
 this service making available 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:41.389
 This is important that everyone deserves it of course if it warms everyone and I think 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:42.509
 that most are no longer 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:43.970
 It is always important to know 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.110
 What are you accepting that it's like a contract then? 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.159
 just read 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.849
 I already read the 20th day only in summer 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.109
 but here it is well accepted then agreed to break the next step 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:59.040
 then the next step is to start with the commission being more advanced then 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:03.489
 in this field the team since login is your email address 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.600
 who do not have to be together to count 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.919
 but here is just fill with your best friend attitude of the active 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.539
 and here in the password enter your password 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.539
 that you will choose French your combination from yesterday 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:21.419
 Then you put the password that will be repeated here and introduced a 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.050
 password man and here 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.509
 if you want to leave the jungle this password 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.550
 r then close this block here 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.330
 It's a security question so they give the option here. 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.770
 question questions 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.569
 and after that my daughter makes a week a reply no matter what the 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.360
 English has been met 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.750
 then this is another step and now let's take another step okey 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.120
 then comes this step 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.469
 this is the step of your idea with more than your daughter would be with him in May 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:54.150
 there is an exception to pm 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.979
 it is as if it will become known within the psn network 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.219
 the stage in the industry in the future to play online when you collect your 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:05.469
 friends is as the saying goes is a well-known reasons to notify by email 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.430
 the care of his steps of his life is a father of his grandson understood 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.069
 As you want to call then I leave there then I will put filipe al-maliki 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.080
 the third 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.849
 good example is right 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.849
 renatinho 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:23.479
 renato republic 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.539
 they will act worse 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.939
 when available link revenue is available 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:31.939
 so you have to create a routine 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.300
 a test here in the throat in the municipality renato at noon 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:41.550
 to create the report 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.319
 the available storm still matters the creativity of the team in the field 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.229
 the place where there were violent for example that in a next stage 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.150
 with one more step here we are now in an important step that is 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.569
 The name we already spoke here 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.169
 having to hire one who did not have you then obviously agree 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.180
 you must have your real name for each issue 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.280
 first name, child 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.419
 on the occasion were still nicknamed to lose 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.889
 the striker fabinho beijing is optional if you want to question concerts in 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.309
 coliseus and then we can enter with the next step of the team potiguar 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:20.989
 here is another very important step that is your address as the 

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:23.989
 situation in the normal register for anything else then 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:27.360
 you can register the name given to you 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.190
 currently such 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.279
 at lunch 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.689
 your postal service code for free and here is the status you 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:35.400
 investigated whether brazilian fashion 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.639
 in another front of Brazil that had to choose 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.639
 continues to enter another step 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.900
 there is another step that we fall short of 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.869
 I like her 

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:49.830
 and had your information also important if you do not want 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.689
 future hassles then we are here 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:56.509
 in notifications then the first notification if you mark sacks 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:57.789
 pressing 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.860
 you'll come across one caring to be interested in receiving material from 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.720
 Matias Olympian 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.439
 the actions of automakers 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.899
 the manufacturer of playstation 3 

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:11.860
 and if you imagine the second box here you will be authorizing your 

00:07:11.859 --> 00:07:14.330
 single shared your information 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.639
 partners so that the others also 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:22.210
 pacaembu and everything else then one can agree or not with these services 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:23.930
 vain of each 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.150
 finished making this option continues to buy next screen 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:34.150
 pisco
