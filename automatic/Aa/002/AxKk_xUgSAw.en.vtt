down<00:02:52.830> quickly<00:02:53.250> though<00:02:53.370> he<00:02:53.610> goes<00:02:53.760> down<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.240> -

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
down quickly though he goes down like -

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.260 
down quickly though he goes down like -
two<00:02:54.960> hits<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.410> an<00:02:55.860> iron<00:02:56.220> sword<00:02:56.580> so<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:56.940> is

relatively quickly as well the hides and
this<00:03:16.890> is<00:03:17.010> gonna<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.310> pretty<00:03:17.610> good<00:03:17.820> source

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
this is gonna be a pretty good source

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.390 
this is gonna be a pretty good source
for<00:03:19.170> leather<00:03:19.470> because<00:03:19.800> that's<00:03:20.070> what<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.280> can

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
for leather because that's what you can

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.070 
for leather because that's what you can
actually<00:03:20.520> create<00:03:20.880> if<00:03:21.240> you<00:03:21.360> get<00:03:21.510> four<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.870> them

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
actually create if you get four of them

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.690 
actually create if you get four of them
pop<00:03:22.590> them<00:03:22.770> in<00:03:22.860> their<00:03:22.950> little<00:03:23.070> square<00:03:23.460> shape

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
pop them in their little square shape

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.430 
pop them in their little square shape
and<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.210> get<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.360> singular<00:03:24.840> piece<00:03:25.020> of<00:03:25.230> leather

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
and you get a singular piece of leather

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.780 
and you get a singular piece of leather
now<00:03:25.740> when<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:25.950> comes<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.220> breeding<00:03:26.460> these

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
now when it comes to breeding these

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.700 
now when it comes to breeding these
animals<00:03:26.850> at<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.330> moment<00:03:27.750> I've<00:03:28.110> noticed<00:03:28.500> some

they're<00:03:49.440> too<00:03:49.620> far<00:03:49.860> apart<00:03:50.010> but<00:03:50.340> even<00:03:50.670> when

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
they're too far apart but even when

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.700

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
they're stuck inside a pen together they

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.680 
they're stuck inside a pen together they
don't<00:03:52.920> seem<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.220> be<00:03:53.340> spawning<00:03:53.760> when<00:03:54.540> they

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
don't seem to be spawning when they

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.900 
don't seem to be spawning when they
should<00:03:54.960> be<00:03:55.110> let<00:03:55.290> me<00:03:55.380> create<00:03:55.620> one<00:03:55.920> more<00:03:56.190> let<00:03:56.820> me

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
should be let me create one more let me

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.210 
should be let me create one more let me
use<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> carrot<00:03:57.540> on<00:03:57.630> you<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:58.200> carrot<00:03:58.440> on<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.860> and

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
use a carrot on you a carrot on you and

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.950 
use a carrot on you a carrot on you and
see<00:03:59.670> how<00:03:59.700> they're<00:03:59.970> not<00:04:00.120> pathfinding<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.870> each

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
see how they're not pathfinding to each

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.780 
see how they're not pathfinding to each
other<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.710> very<00:04:01.770> very<00:04:02.340> weird<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:02.760> I

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
other it's very very weird so I

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
other it's very very weird so I
hopefully<00:04:03.060> that'll<00:04:03.210> be<00:04:03.330> something<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:03.720> will

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
hopefully that'll be something that will

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.180 
hopefully that'll be something that will
be<00:04:03.870> fixed<00:04:04.200> by<00:04:04.320> time<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.710> game<00:04:04.860> is<00:04:05.010> released

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
be fixed by time the game is released

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.220 
be fixed by time the game is released
and<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.450> think<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:06.930> is<00:04:07.050> everything

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
and and I think that is everything

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.260 
and and I think that is everything
regarding<00:04:08.010> bunnies<00:04:08.340> this<00:04:08.490> week<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:09.240> can

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
regarding bunnies this week you can

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.940 
regarding bunnies this week you can
currently<00:04:09.630> get<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.900> potion<00:04:10.080> up<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.410> a<00:04:10.440> level<00:04:10.590> 2

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
currently get the potion up to a level 2

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.500 
currently get the potion up to a level 2
jump<00:04:11.250> boost<00:04:11.490> but<00:04:11.700> nothing<00:04:11.940> higher<00:04:12.150> than<00:04:12.180> that

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
jump boost but nothing higher than that

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.900 
jump boost but nothing higher than that
so<00:04:12.570> far<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.620> final<00:04:13.950> thing<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.400> sheep

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
so far and the final thing is sheep

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.000 
so far and the final thing is sheep

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
based on but and that's sometimes how it

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.740
