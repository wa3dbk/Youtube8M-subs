not going to make or break the Raptors
season<00:04:47.380> at<00:04:47.470> this<00:04:47.590> point<00:04:47.830> but<00:04:48.370> just<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.970> want

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
season at this point but just you want

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.730 
season at this point but just you want
to<00:04:49.270> get<00:04:49.419> something<00:04:49.660> positive<00:04:49.930> out<00:04:50.260> of<00:04:50.320> it<00:04:50.470> so

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
to get something positive out of it so

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.159 
to get something positive out of it so
can<00:04:50.979> they<00:04:51.160> maintain<00:04:51.940> momentum<00:04:52.240> in<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.930> loss<00:04:53.139> to

can they maintain momentum in a loss to
Detroit<00:04:53.560> well<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.250> think<00:04:54.370> if<00:04:54.639> they<00:04:54.790> execute

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
Detroit well I think if they execute

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.060 
Detroit well I think if they execute
defensively<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:56.200> get<00:04:56.380> beat<00:04:56.590> by<00:04:56.800> a<00:04:56.830> better

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
defensively and get beat by a better

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.159 
defensively and get beat by a better
team<00:04:57.460> you<00:04:58.000> can<00:04:58.180> live<00:04:58.300> with<00:04:58.450> that<00:04:58.479> as<00:04:58.840> long<00:04:58.870> as

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
team you can live with that as long as
