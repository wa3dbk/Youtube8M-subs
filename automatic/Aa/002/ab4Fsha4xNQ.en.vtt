hello my name is Markus rühl and I'm
currently<00:00:06.529> working<00:00:06.740> on<00:00:07.040> quadrotors<00:00:07.700> and<00:00:07.910> here

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
currently working on quadrotors and here

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.970 
currently working on quadrotors and here
especially<00:00:08.960> we're<00:00:09.260> interested<00:00:09.830> in<00:00:09.889> a

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
especially we're interested in a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.100 
especially we're interested in a
quadrotor<00:00:10.370> with<00:00:11.030> more<00:00:11.330> control<00:00:11.600> input<00:00:11.930> than

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
quadrotor with more control input than

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.619 
quadrotor with more control input than
average<00:00:12.500> quad<00:00:12.740> rotors<00:00:12.860> to<00:00:13.129> have<00:00:13.340> so<00:00:14.090> usually

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
average quad rotors to have so usually

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.349 
average quad rotors to have so usually
quad<00:00:14.990> rotors<00:00:15.139> have<00:00:15.559> four<00:00:16.190> control<00:00:16.520> inputs<00:00:16.820> to

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
quad rotors have four control inputs to

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.510 
quad rotors have four control inputs to
independently<00:00:17.960> control<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.890> position<00:00:19.369> and

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
independently control the position and

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.150 
independently control the position and
the<00:00:20.359> orientation<00:00:20.929> but<00:00:21.439> we<00:00:21.619> developed<00:00:21.980> a<00:00:22.039> new

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
the orientation but we developed a new

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.070 
the orientation but we developed a new
kind<00:00:22.400> of<00:00:22.490> a<00:00:22.580> concept<00:00:22.880> for<00:00:23.029> a<00:00:23.089> quadrotor<00:00:23.449> which

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
kind of a concept for a quadrotor which

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.290 
kind of a concept for a quadrotor which
has<00:00:24.259> eight<00:00:24.439> control<00:00:24.800> inputs<00:00:25.189> so<00:00:25.730> we<00:00:25.880> are<00:00:25.970> not

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
has eight control inputs so we are not

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.029 
has eight control inputs so we are not
only<00:00:26.480> controlling<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.289> spinning<00:00:27.619> velocity

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
only controlling the spinning velocity

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.859 
only controlling the spinning velocity
of<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.220> propellers<00:00:28.640> but<00:00:29.179> the<00:00:29.300> orientation<00:00:29.810> of

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
of the propellers but the orientation of

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.810 
of the propellers but the orientation of
the<00:00:30.019> propellers<00:00:30.409> as<00:00:30.560> well<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.429> this<00:00:31.550> gives<00:00:31.730> us

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
the propellers as well and this gives us

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.460 
the propellers as well and this gives us
eight<00:00:32.060> control<00:00:32.419> inputs<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.230> we<00:00:33.350> can

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
eight control inputs so we can

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.100 
eight control inputs so we can
independently<00:00:34.239> control<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.510> position<00:00:35.810> and

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
independently control the position and

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.900 
independently control the position and
the<00:00:36.260> orientation<00:00:36.560> of<00:00:36.770> our<00:00:36.890> quadrotor<00:00:37.340> and

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
the orientation of our quadrotor and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.930 
the orientation of our quadrotor and
this<00:00:38.030> gives<00:00:38.240> us<00:00:38.330> may<00:00:38.750> more<00:00:39.850> possibilities<00:00:40.850> to

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
this gives us may more possibilities to

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.030 
this gives us may more possibilities to
fly<00:00:41.180> around<00:00:41.390> first<00:00:41.810> of<00:00:41.930> all<00:00:42.080> but<00:00:42.740> what<00:00:42.890> we<00:00:43.010> are

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
fly around first of all but what we are

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.230 
fly around first of all but what we are
actually<00:00:43.190> more<00:00:43.520> interested<00:00:43.910> in<00:00:44.000> is<00:00:44.060> doing

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
actually more interested in is doing

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.170 
actually more interested in is doing
things<00:00:44.870> like<00:00:44.960> service<00:00:45.320> reporting<00:00:45.890> and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
things like service reporting and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.070 
things like service reporting and
discuss<00:00:47.180> it<00:00:47.270> with<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.480> opportunity<00:00:47.960> to

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
discuss it with the opportunity to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.020 
discuss it with the opportunity to
observe<00:00:48.200> forces<00:00:48.770> in<00:00:48.890> all<00:00:49.010> direction<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:49.820> not

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
observe forces in all direction so not

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.020 
observe forces in all direction so not
only<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:51.010> forces<00:00:52.010> in<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.280> Z<00:00:52.490> direction<00:00:52.940> of

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
only the forces in the Z direction of

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.520 
only the forces in the Z direction of
the<00:00:53.150> main<00:00:53.300> body<00:00:53.420> but<00:00:54.080> in<00:00:54.200> all<00:00:54.380> other

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.120 

you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.500 

what<00:03:25.130> our<00:03:25.250> long-term<00:03:25.430> goal<00:03:25.730> is<00:03:25.760> really<00:03:26.240> is<00:03:26.330> to

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
what our long-term goal is really is to

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.140 
what our long-term goal is really is to
fly<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.530> grab<00:03:27.920> when<00:03:28.190> pick<00:03:28.430> objects<00:03:28.940> place

fly and grab when pick objects place
them<00:03:29.450> exert<00:03:29.990> forces<00:03:30.380> drilling<00:03:30.920> holes<00:03:31.130> like

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
them exert forces drilling holes like

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.790 
them exert forces drilling holes like
really<00:03:32.060> a<00:03:32.090> normal<00:03:32.690> service<00:03:32.990> robot<00:03:33.230> can<00:03:33.410> do<00:03:33.560> and

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
really a normal service robot can do and

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.500 
really a normal service robot can do and
with<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.370> kind<00:03:34.550> of<00:03:34.700> concept<00:03:35.030> of<00:03:35.180> quadrotor

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
with this kind of concept of quadrotor

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.890 
with this kind of concept of quadrotor
we'll<00:03:36.140> be<00:03:36.380> able<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.770> do<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.510> can<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.540> give<00:03:38.780> me

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
we'll be able to do that can you give me

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.290 
we'll be able to do that can you give me
an<00:03:38.990> example<00:03:39.080> of<00:03:39.620> a<00:03:39.770> use<00:03:39.980> case<00:03:40.340> where<00:03:40.700> this

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
an example of a use case where this

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.410 
an example of a use case where this
quadrotor<00:03:41.810> would<00:03:41.960> be<00:03:42.080> better<00:03:42.290> than<00:03:42.590> yes<00:03:43.420> so

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
quadrotor would be better than yes so

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.840 
quadrotor would be better than yes so
for<00:03:44.540> example<00:03:44.870> an<00:03:44.990> easy<00:03:45.440> use<00:03:45.980> case<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:46.610> that's

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
for example an easy use case and that's

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.090 
for example an easy use case and that's
for<00:03:47.060> example<00:03:47.120> the<00:03:47.510> let's<00:03:47.840> say<00:03:48.100> short-term

something<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:18.739> that's<00:04:19.100> something<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:19.459> is

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
something and that's something that is

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.870 
something and that's something that is
just<00:04:19.820> possible<00:04:20.330> with<00:04:20.420> this<00:04:20.510> kind<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.810> concept

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
just possible with this kind of concept

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.250 
just possible with this kind of concept
so<00:04:22.880> what's<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.210> next<00:04:23.480> generation<00:04:23.990> going<00:04:24.170> to

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
so what's the next generation going to

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.380 
so what's the next generation going to
be<00:04:24.380> like<00:04:24.560> what<00:04:24.740> are<00:04:24.770> you<00:04:24.860> working<00:04:25.160> on<00:04:25.250> now<00:04:25.390> so

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
be like what are you working on now so

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.760 
be like what are you working on now so
the<00:04:26.510> next<00:04:26.690> generation<00:04:26.780> is<00:04:27.230> an<00:04:27.320> improvement<00:04:27.590> of

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
the next generation is an improvement of

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.370 
the next generation is an improvement of
that<00:04:27.919> one<00:04:28.130> here<00:04:28.370> so<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:29.150> see<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:30.020> it's<00:04:30.169> still

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
that one here so you see and it's still

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.810 
that one here so you see and it's still
really<00:04:30.620> looking<00:04:30.950> like<00:04:30.980> a<00:04:31.100> prototype<00:04:31.580> there

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
really looking like a prototype there

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.820 
really looking like a prototype there
are<00:04:31.880> lots<00:04:32.030> of<00:04:32.120> cables<00:04:32.510> around<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:33.110> as<00:04:33.620> well

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
are lots of cables around and as well

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.010 
are lots of cables around and as well
the<00:04:33.980> control<00:04:34.310> frequency<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:34.940> very<00:04:35.120> slow<00:04:35.390> so<00:04:35.900> we

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
the control frequency is very slow so we

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.750 
the control frequency is very slow so we
want<00:04:36.169> to<00:04:36.260> make<00:04:36.380> it<00:04:36.500> more<00:04:36.650> aggressive<00:04:37.460> more

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
want to make it more aggressive more

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.630 
want to make it more aggressive more
agile<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.419> really<00:04:38.930> be<00:04:39.080> able<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.640> very

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
agile and really be able to very

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.930 
agile and really be able to very
accurately<00:04:41.240> interact<00:04:41.960> with<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.260> environment

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
accurately interact with the environment

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.560 
accurately interact with the environment
ok<00:04:43.940> great<00:04:44.450> thank<00:04:44.750> you<00:04:44.810> thanks<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:45.440> lot
