goes<00:00:52.399> around<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:54.289> whole<00:00:54.320> piece<00:00:54.890> of<00:00:54.920> metal<00:00:55.519> of

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
goes around the whole piece of metal of

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.000 
goes around the whole piece of metal of
a<00:00:55.760> snaffle<00:00:56.059> bit<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.690> does<00:00:56.870> slide<00:00:57.230> around<00:00:57.739> a

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
a snaffle bit and it does slide around a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.639 
a snaffle bit and it does slide around a
little<00:00:58.129> bit<00:00:58.370> as<00:00:58.609> you<00:00:59.030> pull<00:00:59.359> on<00:00:59.449> the<00:00:59.569> reins<00:00:59.719> but

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
this is not going to slide because it is

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.360 
this is not going to slide because it is
right<00:01:03.140> inside<00:01:03.679> that<00:01:03.710> slot<00:01:05.020> now<00:01:06.020> also<00:01:06.320> there<00:01:07.220> is

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
right inside that slot now also there is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.850 
right inside that slot now also there is
another<00:01:07.400> hook<00:01:08.470> at<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:10.250> bottom<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.540> bit

another hook at the bottom of the bit

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.680 
another hook at the bottom of the bit
normally<00:01:12.860> we<00:01:13.340> can<00:01:13.520> put<00:01:13.730> we<00:01:13.850> put<00:01:14.060> our<00:01:14.180> rain<00:01:14.390> just

miler it has the curvature that allows
room<00:01:54.800> for<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.160> tongue<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:56.000> maybe<00:01:56.990> I'll<00:01:57.110> take

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
room for the tongue and maybe I'll take

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.840 
room for the tongue and maybe I'll take
it<00:01:57.410> off<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.650> show<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.040> bit<00:01:58.190> before<00:01:58.640> I'm

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
it off and show you the bit before I'm

it off and show you the bit before I'm
through<00:01:59.390> here<00:01:59.780> but<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:02.060> can<00:02:02.240> see<00:02:02.270> that<00:02:03.130> when<00:02:04.130> I

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
through here but you can see that when I

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.880 
through here but you can see that when I
pull<00:02:05.120> on<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.480> rain<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:07.190> is<00:02:07.490> going<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:08.149> rotate

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
pull on this rain it is going to rotate

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.290 
pull on this rain it is going to rotate
the<00:02:09.890> bit<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.310> whole<00:02:10.489> ring<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.789> little<00:02:11.090> bit

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
the bit the whole ring a little bit

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.580 
the bit the whole ring a little bit
forward<00:02:11.860> which<00:02:12.860> is<00:02:13.099> going<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.459> pull<00:02:14.390> ever<00:02:15.290> so

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
forward which is going to pull ever so

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.580 
forward which is going to pull ever so
slightly<00:02:15.890> on<00:02:16.219> the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
slightly on the

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.369 
slightly on the
chickpeas<00:02:16.980> which<00:02:17.879> is<00:02:18.060> going<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.360> pull<00:02:18.629> ever<00:02:19.140> so

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
chickpeas which is going to pull ever so

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.550 
chickpeas which is going to pull ever so
slightly<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.040> pole<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:22.410> will

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
slightly on the pole and that will

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.420 
slightly on the pole and that will
encourage<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.160> horse<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.910> flex<00:02:24.239> here<00:02:24.900> and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
encourage the horse to flex here and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.509 
encourage the horse to flex here and
flex<00:02:26.629> and<00:02:27.629> flex<00:02:28.379> as<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:29.010> apply<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> Rings<00:02:30.090> so

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
flex and flex as you apply the Rings so

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.479 
flex and flex as you apply the Rings so
that<00:02:32.519> is<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.940> idea<00:02:32.970> between<00:02:33.680> behind<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.920> miler

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
that is the idea between behind a miler

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.160 
that is the idea between behind a miler
bit<00:02:35.959> snap<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:36.989> bit<00:02:37.260> with<00:02:37.470> hooks<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.170> it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
bit snap a bit with hooks and so it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.500 
bit snap a bit with hooks and so it
really<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.620> little<00:02:41.190> step<00:02:41.489> above<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:42.209> plain

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
really is a little step above a plain

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.650 
really is a little step above a plain
Snapple<00:02:43.140> and<00:02:43.860> asking<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.030> worst<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.360> get<00:02:45.510> to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
Snapple and asking the worst to get to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.990 
Snapple and asking the worst to get to
the<00:02:45.750> bit<00:02:47.299> so<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.690> hope<00:02:48.989> that's<00:02:49.230> helpful<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:50.160> let

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
the bit so I hope that's helpful and let

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.759 
the bit so I hope that's helpful and let
me<00:02:51.120> take<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.540> off<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:53.730> can<00:02:54.120> see<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:56.120> bit

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
me take this off so you can see a bit

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.150 
me take this off so you can see a bit
before<00:02:58.769> we're<00:02:59.250> thrilled<00:03:00.560> hopefully<00:03:01.560> that's

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
before we're thrilled hopefully that's

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.039 
before we're thrilled hopefully that's
it<00:03:02.280> won't<00:03:02.459> go<00:03:02.579> anywhere<00:03:02.790> I'll<00:03:03.599> put<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> Rings

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
it won't go anywhere I'll put the Rings

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.670 
it won't go anywhere I'll put the Rings
over<00:03:04.319> his<00:03:04.410> head<00:03:05.329> so<00:03:06.329> there<00:03:06.840> you<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.019> the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
over his head so there you have the

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.470 
over his head so there you have the
miler<00:03:08.250> bit<00:03:09.769> that<00:03:10.769> was<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.069> his<00:03:11.250> mouth<00:03:11.489> with<00:03:12.329> you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
miler bit that was in his mouth with you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.780 
miler bit that was in his mouth with you
can<00:03:12.599> see<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.900> curvature<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.069> mouthpiece

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
can see the curvature to the mouthpiece

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.960 
can see the curvature to the mouthpiece
and<00:03:15.319> then<00:03:16.319> you<00:03:16.500> can<00:03:16.680> see<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.459> cheek<00:03:17.700> pieces

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
and then you can see the cheek pieces

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.110 
and then you can see the cheek pieces
inside<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.840> hooks<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.730> hope<00:03:20.910> that's

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
inside the hooks so I hope that's

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.410 
inside the hooks so I hope that's
helpful<00:03:23.420> Hudson<00:03:24.420> was<00:03:24.569> very<00:03:24.870> bored<00:03:25.170> during
