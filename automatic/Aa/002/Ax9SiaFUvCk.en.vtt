movie accurate but it has a vague
resemblance<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.470> one<00:01:35.650> used<00:01:35.890> in<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.100> movie

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460

over<00:01:37.180> on<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.450> side<00:01:37.689> here<00:01:37.720> we<00:01:38.200> have<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.350> little

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
over on the side here we have a little

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.859 
over on the side here we have a little
flap<00:01:38.950> you<00:01:39.159> could<00:01:39.280> pull<00:01:39.460> down<00:01:39.490> you<00:01:40.479> can<00:01:40.600> see<00:01:40.750> the

flap you could pull down you can see the

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.359 
flap you could pull down you can see the
inner<00:01:41.079> workings<00:01:41.380> even<00:01:42.130> though<00:01:42.189> they're<00:01:42.340> not

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
inner workings even though they're not

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.340 
inner workings even though they're not
really<00:01:42.670> all<00:01:43.149> that<00:01:43.180> painted<00:01:43.780> it's<00:01:43.960> still<00:01:44.170> kind

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
really all that painted it's still kind

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.679 
really all that painted it's still kind
of<00:01:44.409> a<00:01:44.470> nice<00:01:44.649> touch<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:46.180> could<00:01:46.329> put<00:01:46.509> it<00:01:46.600> on

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
of a nice touch that you could put it on

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.780 
of a nice touch that you could put it on
the<00:01:46.840> ground<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.380> pretend<00:01:48.130> he<00:01:48.310> was<00:01:48.340> getting<00:01:48.700> in

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
the ground and pretend he was getting in

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.999 
the ground and pretend he was getting in
the<00:01:48.820> armor<00:01:49.210> although<00:01:49.990> I<00:01:50.020> gotta<00:01:50.290> say<00:01:50.560> this

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
the armor although I gotta say this

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.499 
the armor although I gotta say this
would<00:01:51.220> be<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.369> lot<00:01:51.579> cooler<00:01:51.850> if<00:01:52.240> we'd<00:01:52.390> ever

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
would be a lot cooler if we'd ever

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.920 
would be a lot cooler if we'd ever
gotten<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:53.430> normal<00:01:54.430> Tony<00:01:54.820> Stark<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.479> racecar

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
gotten a normal Tony Stark a racecar

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.990 
gotten a normal Tony Stark a racecar
Tony<00:01:56.229> Stark<00:01:56.590> hell<00:01:57.159> even<00:01:57.430> if<00:01:57.610> we<00:01:57.670> gotten<00:01:57.909> the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
Tony Stark hell even if we gotten the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.030 
Tony Stark hell even if we gotten the
happy<00:01:58.360> Hogan<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:59.049> would<00:01:59.229> have<00:01:59.350> fit<00:01:59.770> in<00:01:59.799> a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
happy Hogan it would have fit in a

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.280 
happy Hogan it would have fit in a
little<00:02:00.399> bit<00:02:00.549> better<00:02:00.759> no<00:02:01.570> real<00:02:01.780> reason<00:02:02.110> why

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
little bit better no real reason why

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.249 
little bit better no real reason why
Iron<00:02:02.950> Man<00:02:03.189> would<00:02:03.490> be<00:02:03.759> with<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.600> suitcase<00:02:05.020> when

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
Iron Man would be with the suitcase when

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.679 
Iron Man would be with the suitcase when
he<00:02:05.350> already<00:02:05.469> has<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.770> armor<00:02:06.070> on<00:02:06.390> I'm<00:02:07.390> not<00:02:07.630> even

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
he already has the armor on I'm not even

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.479 
he already has the armor on I'm not even
sure<00:02:07.899> if<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.079> suitcase<00:02:08.470> still<00:02:08.679> exists<00:02:09.310> when

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
sure if the suitcase still exists when

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.949 
sure if the suitcase still exists when
he<00:02:09.579> enters<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.030> armor<00:02:10.299> on<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.420> don't<00:02:10.660> know<00:02:10.780> if

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
he enters the armor on I don't know if

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.319 
he enters the armor on I don't know if
it<00:02:11.049> leaves<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.410> husk<00:02:11.650> on<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.010> ground<00:02:12.280> or<00:02:12.640> if<00:02:12.970> the

it leaves a husk on the ground or if the

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.500 
it leaves a husk on the ground or if the
whole<00:02:13.510> thing<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.079> the<00:02:14.230> armor<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.670> not<00:02:16.269> exactly

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
whole thing is the armor so not exactly

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.949 
whole thing is the armor so not exactly
the<00:02:17.500> best<00:02:18.430> accessory<00:02:19.120> but<00:02:19.329> it's<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.540> cool<00:02:19.780> to

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
the best accessory but it's so cool to

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.770 
the best accessory but it's so cool to
have<00:02:20.140> that's<00:02:20.560> cooler<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.100> opens<00:02:21.430> up<00:02:21.780> they

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
this side for a nice Cemetery and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.510 
this side for a nice Cemetery and
there's<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.210> big<00:02:31.450> blue<00:02:31.720> triangle<00:02:32.230> here<00:02:32.620> you

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
there's the big blue triangle here you

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.430 
there's the big blue triangle here you
got<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.730> slightly<00:02:34.030> smaller<00:02:34.540> one<00:02:34.840> over<00:02:34.870> here

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
got a slightly smaller one over here

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.870 
got a slightly smaller one over here
looks<00:02:35.770> like<00:02:35.830> they<00:02:36.070> could<00:02:36.220> have<00:02:36.250> painted<00:02:36.730> the

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
looks like they could have painted the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.360 
looks like they could have painted the
rest<00:02:37.150> of<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.780> would<00:02:37.960> have<00:02:38.140> made<00:02:39.010> out<00:02:39.220> to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
rest of this it would have made out to

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.580 
rest of this it would have made out to
be<00:02:39.460> about<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.700> same<00:02:39.940> size<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.810> it's<00:02:41.410> pretty

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
be about the same size so it's pretty

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.170 
be about the same size so it's pretty
cool<00:02:41.770> feature<00:02:42.040> as<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.550> mentioned<00:02:42.790> before<00:02:42.850> the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
cool feature as I mentioned before the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.020 
cool feature as I mentioned before the
missiles<00:02:43.570> are<00:02:43.720> big<00:02:44.110> huge<00:02:44.650> honking<00:02:44.920> things<00:02:45.400> and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
missiles are big huge honking things and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.630 
missiles are big huge honking things and
we<00:02:46.360> could<00:02:46.450> sit<00:02:46.630> here<00:02:46.660> across<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.200> button<00:02:47.640> fire

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
we could sit here across the button fire

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.570 
we could sit here across the button fire
one<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.390> fire<00:02:50.260> two<00:02:50.590> now<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.160> kind<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.400> cool

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
one and fire two now it's kind of cool

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.860 
one and fire two now it's kind of cool
about<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:52.360> hold<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.660> button

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
about this is you can hold the button

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.860 
about this is you can hold the button
down<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.080> shoot<00:02:53.530> both<00:02:54.360> overall<00:02:55.360> I'll<00:02:55.720> keep

the suitcase on display with Iron Man

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.480 
the suitcase on display with Iron Man
not<00:02:58.480> keeping<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.840> missiles<00:02:59.170> on<00:02:59.260> display<00:02:59.620> it's

not keeping the missiles on display it's

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.670 
not keeping the missiles on display it's
an<00:03:00.910> accessory<00:03:01.330> though<00:03:01.570> not<00:03:02.200> complaining

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
an accessory though not complaining

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.920 
an accessory though not complaining
about<00:03:02.740> and<00:03:03.220> on<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.640> the<00:03:03.730> figure<00:03:04.090> himself<00:03:04.330> this

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
about and on to the figure himself this

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.400 
about and on to the figure himself this
is<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.200> really<00:03:05.770> really<00:03:05.980> cool<00:03:06.370> armor<00:03:06.730> design

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
is a really really cool armor design

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.930 
is a really really cool armor design
this<00:03:08.410> one<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:08.740> another<00:03:08.950> peg<00:03:09.280> warmer<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.820> the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
this one is another peg warmer in the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.030 
this one is another peg warmer in the
set<00:03:10.150> though<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.360> think<00:03:10.750> they<00:03:11.040> overestimated

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
set though I think they overestimated

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.770 
set though I think they overestimated
how<00:03:12.280> cool<00:03:12.610> people<00:03:13.030> would<00:03:13.150> think<00:03:13.270> this<00:03:13.420> armor

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
how cool people would think this armor

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.420 
how cool people would think this armor
is<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.290> figured<00:03:14.590> everyone<00:03:14.800> would<00:03:14.950> feel<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
is and figured everyone would feel the

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.850 
is and figured everyone would feel the
need<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.580> buy<00:03:15.820> about<00:03:16.060> seven<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.720> these<00:03:16.870> judging

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
need to buy about seven of these judging

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.350 
need to buy about seven of these judging
by<00:03:18.010> how<00:03:18.130> many<00:03:18.310> I've<00:03:18.460> seen<00:03:18.640> on<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.820> market<00:03:19.210> it

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
by how many I've seen on the market it

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.090 
by how many I've seen on the market it
is<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.780> really<00:03:20.110> cool<00:03:20.290> armor<00:03:20.530> it's<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.860> really

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
is a really cool armor it's a really

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.990 
is a really cool armor it's a really
neat<00:03:21.250> design<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:23.140> it's<00:03:23.830> an<00:03:24.040> overabundance<00:03:24.400> of

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
neat design but it's an overabundance of

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.850 
neat design but it's an overabundance of
this<00:03:25.180> figure<00:03:25.540> I've<00:03:25.720> seen<00:03:25.960> most<00:03:26.440> of<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.650> time

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
this figure I've seen most of the time

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.310 
this figure I've seen most of the time
my<00:03:27.490> biggest<00:03:27.700> gripe<00:03:28.180> with<00:03:28.390> this<00:03:28.540> guy<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:29.050> the

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
my biggest gripe with this guy is the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.320 
my biggest gripe with this guy is the
chest<00:03:29.650> armor<00:03:30.100> is<00:03:30.280> wrong<00:03:30.670> you'd<00:03:31.030> see<00:03:31.180> the

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
chest armor is wrong you'd see the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.360 
chest armor is wrong you'd see the
triangle<00:03:31.959> around<00:03:32.050> his<00:03:32.320> arc<00:03:32.470> reactor<00:03:32.590> well<00:03:33.280> in

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
triangle around his arc reactor well in

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.890 
triangle around his arc reactor well in
the<00:03:33.430> movie<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.730> wasn't<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.030> triangle<00:03:34.600> it<00:03:34.720> had<00:03:34.870> I

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
the movie it wasn't a triangle it had I

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.660 
the movie it wasn't a triangle it had I
think<00:03:35.080> about<00:03:35.290> two<00:03:35.530> more<00:03:35.709> sides<00:03:36.100> that<00:03:36.430> were<00:03:36.520> up

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
think about two more sides that were up

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.870 
think about two more sides that were up
here<00:03:37.110> it's<00:03:38.110> not<00:03:38.380> accurate<00:03:38.830> to<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.280> movie<00:03:39.400> and

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
here it's not accurate to the movie and

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.100 
here it's not accurate to the movie and
they've<00:03:40.030> done<00:03:40.240> like<00:03:40.390> eight<00:03:40.690> different

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
they've done like eight different

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.170 
they've done like eight different
versions<00:03:41.470> of<00:03:41.590> this<00:03:41.740> guy<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.730> feels<00:03:43.000> like

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
versions of this guy that feels like

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.730 
versions of this guy that feels like
eight<00:03:43.330> at<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:43.600> point<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.410> they've<00:03:44.530> never

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
eight at this point and they've never

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.320 
eight at this point and they've never
corrected<00:03:45.250> that<00:03:45.370> issue<00:03:45.610> so<00:03:45.940> that's<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.120> bit<00:03:46.300> of

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
corrected that issue so that's a bit of

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.330 
corrected that issue so that's a bit of
a<00:03:46.480> bummer<00:03:46.750> but<00:03:47.320> I'd<00:03:47.440> say<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.890> sculpting

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
a bummer but I'd say that the sculpting

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.890 
a bummer but I'd say that the sculpting
is<00:03:48.459> pretty<00:03:48.850> darn<00:03:49.120> nice<00:03:49.300> we<00:03:49.510> have<00:03:49.600> all<00:03:49.720> those

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
is pretty darn nice we have all those

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.110 
is pretty darn nice we have all those
cool<00:03:50.290> scales<00:03:50.830> going<00:03:51.250> up<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.520> down<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.730> armor

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
cool scales going up and down the armor

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.199 
cool scales going up and down the armor
you<00:03:52.360> made<00:03:52.990> a<00:03:53.020> really<00:03:53.320> nice<00:03:53.560> definition<00:03:54.209> it

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
you made a really nice definition it

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.180 
you made a really nice definition it
contrasts<00:03:55.900> well<00:03:56.110> with<00:03:56.140> the<00:03:56.380> armor<00:03:56.680> plates<00:03:56.950> and

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
contrasts well with the armor plates and

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.070 
contrasts well with the armor plates and
there's<00:03:57.310> a<00:03:57.400> lot<00:03:57.580> of<00:03:57.700> depth<00:03:58.030> going<00:03:58.360> on<00:03:58.630> here

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
there's a lot of depth going on here

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.230 
there's a lot of depth going on here
showing<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.010> way<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.280> armors<00:04:00.610> overlapped

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
showing the way the armors overlapped

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.949 
showing the way the armors overlapped
itself<00:04:02.610> really<00:04:03.610> really<00:04:03.850> cool<00:04:04.030> scaly<00:04:04.750> look

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
itself really really cool scaly look

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:06.900 
itself really really cool scaly look
going<00:04:05.170> on<00:04:05.380> with<00:04:05.650> it<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.190> detail<00:04:06.490> continues

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
going on with it the detail continues

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.790 
going on with it the detail continues
down<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.330> legs<00:04:07.600> no<00:04:08.260> one<00:04:08.410> thing<00:04:08.560> in<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
movie this armor being that it is a

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.740

smaller<00:04:12.040> armor<00:04:12.610> kind<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.120> did<00:04:13.300> give<00:04:13.600> the

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
smaller armor kind of did give the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.229 
smaller armor kind of did give the
illusion<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:14.380> was<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.500> thinner<00:04:14.970> suit<00:04:15.970> than

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
illusion that it was a thinner suit than

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.240 
illusion that it was a thinner suit than
the<00:04:16.390> normal<00:04:16.690> wire<00:04:16.930> man<00:04:17.200> suits<00:04:17.500> this<00:04:17.830> figure<00:04:18.190> is

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
the normal wire man suits this figure is

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.099 
the normal wire man suits this figure is
about<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.640> same<00:04:18.820> size<00:04:18.850> as<00:04:19.330> a<00:04:19.359> normal<00:04:19.660> Iron<00:04:19.930> Man

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109

about the same size as a normal Iron Man
buck<00:04:20.410> I<00:04:21.090> can't<00:04:22.090> really<00:04:22.210> expect<00:04:22.660> them<00:04:22.960> to<00:04:22.990> make

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
buck I can't really expect them to make

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.600 
buck I can't really expect them to make
a<00:04:23.260> subtle<00:04:23.530> change<00:04:23.800> like<00:04:24.070> that<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.250> don't<00:04:24.400> think

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
a subtle change like that I don't think

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.730 
a subtle change like that I don't think
the<00:04:25.540> head<00:04:25.690> sculpt<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:26.169> kind<00:04:26.350> of<00:04:26.410> more<00:04:26.620> we've

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
take off maybe not on this figure but on

Stokely<00:05:27.760> he<00:05:27.880> was<00:05:28.000> gonna<00:05:28.150> blast<00:05:28.480> just<00:05:29.380> some

Stokely he was gonna blast just some
extra<00:05:30.040> details<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.640> think<00:05:30.820> would<00:05:30.910> have<00:05:30.970> made<00:05:31.120> a

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
extra details I think would have made a

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.640 
extra details I think would have made a
lot<00:05:31.390> of<00:05:31.420> difference<00:05:31.930> with<00:05:32.080> a<00:05:32.140> lot<00:05:32.440> of<00:05:32.560> these

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
lot of difference with a lot of these

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.790 
lot of difference with a lot of these
figures<00:05:32.970> so<00:05:33.970> it's<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.090> little<00:05:34.240> disappointing

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
figures so it's a little disappointing

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.700 
figures so it's a little disappointing
