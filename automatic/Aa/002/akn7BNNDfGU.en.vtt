00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:07.170
 good as we were saying 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:11.820
 the fine thread 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.969
 goes down and goes up to the collector 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.969
 transistor that the collector in this case 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.810
 is the part of the transistor that has a 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.289
 hole this would be the collector 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.289
 ah 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.100
 the emitter of the transistor 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.960
 the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.930
 the connection to the left of the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.420
 transistor this would be the collector this 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.589
 the emitter from the left and in the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.589
 right the base 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.079
 this would be a transistor 2 n 30 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.079
 55 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:04.190
 the base of the transistor is connected to the 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.760
 connection of the potentiometer right 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.760
 2 k 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.950
 the connection of the center 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.520
 the potentiometer goes to the thick thread of the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.520
 bull and d 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:28.380
 here the negative of the stack 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.380
 is connected to the transmitter 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.510
 to the negative of the capacitor 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.560
 in this case 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.950
 I advise you to put a 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.579
 condenser 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:52.170
 instead of 50 volts 1000 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.550
 So get one of 25,000 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.180
 efe 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.510
 it's better so we do not go up much 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.890
 voltage and there's no risk of it being 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.890
 burn the led lamp 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.060
 then this would be a capacitor of 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.990
 25,000 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.800
 efe 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.390
 in negatives it is also connected to 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.120
 negative of the led lamp and the positive 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.220
 is also connected to the positive of the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.220
 led lamp and in turn 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.799
 to the part of the diode where you have the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.530
 white line that in this case is a 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.530
 diode and in 4007 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.970
 the lamp that I am using is 12 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.150
 volts 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.150
 3 watts and it works perfectly 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.060
 well nothing this is all 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.730

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.160
 because I'm going to keep uploading videos 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.350
 about this type of devices and 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.710
