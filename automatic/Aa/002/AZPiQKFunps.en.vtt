to<00:03:15.770> overreact<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.120> would<00:03:17.480> just<00:03:17.630> try<00:03:17.870> to

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
to overreact so I would just try to

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.810 
to overreact so I would just try to
monitor<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.590> situation<00:03:18.800> with<00:03:19.310> your<00:03:19.430> friends

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
continue to hang out as normal and then

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.040 
continue to hang out as normal and then
after<00:03:22.550> that<00:03:22.760> if<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.060> do<00:03:23.390> think<00:03:23.630> your<00:03:23.720> friends

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
after that if you do think your friends

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.240 
after that if you do think your friends
are<00:03:24.140> sort<00:03:24.320> of<00:03:24.350> going<00:03:24.650> out<00:03:24.800> of<00:03:24.950> their<00:03:25.070> way<00:03:25.220> to

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
are sort of going out of their way to

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.520 
are sort of going out of their way to
like<00:03:25.640> avoid<00:03:26.090> you<00:03:26.300> then<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:27.080> can<00:03:27.230> take<00:03:27.380> the

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
like avoid you then you can take the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.960 
like avoid you then you can take the
direct<00:03:27.800> approach<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.310> just<00:03:28.459> ask<00:03:28.670> them<00:03:28.880> about

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
direct approach and just ask them about

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.410 
direct approach and just ask them about
it

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
it

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.060 
it
I<00:03:29.450> think<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.080> direct<00:03:30.440> approach<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:30.890> think
