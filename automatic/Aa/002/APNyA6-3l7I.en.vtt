and<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.800> course<00:02:12.830> it<00:02:13.250> works<00:02:15.790> perfectly<00:02:16.790> in

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
and of course it works perfectly in

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.050 
and of course it works perfectly in
excellent<00:02:18.500> cosmetic<00:02:18.680> condition<00:02:19.460> i<00:02:19.640> would

excellent cosmetic condition i would

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.270 
excellent cosmetic condition i would
give<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.420> maybe<00:02:20.780> like<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.110> 7<00:02:21.500> out<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.620> 10<00:02:21.860> for<00:02:22.160> the

but<00:02:24.620> as<00:02:24.800> four<00:02:25.070> scuffs<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.760> everything<00:02:26.180> else

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
but as four scuffs and everything else

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.690 
but as four scuffs and everything else
it<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.810> absolutely<00:02:27.220> incredibly<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.520> good

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
it is absolutely incredibly in good

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.880 
it is absolutely incredibly in good
condition<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.930> all<00:02:30.230> works<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.650> lot<00:02:30.770> of

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
condition and it all works a lot of

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.200 
condition and it all works a lot of
times<00:02:31.070> like<00:02:31.280> one<00:02:31.550> time<00:02:31.700> I<00:02:31.730> got<00:02:31.790> one<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.090> these

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
times like one time I got one of these

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.130 
times like one time I got one of these
and<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:33.320> emphasize<00:02:33.680> are<00:02:33.890> all<00:02:34.010> messed<00:02:34.310> up<00:02:34.520> but

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
and the emphasize are all messed up but

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.640 
and the emphasize are all messed up but
this<00:02:36.140> one<00:02:36.320> works<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.830> I'm<00:02:36.950> happy<00:02:37.130> about<00:02:37.340> that

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
this one works so I'm happy about that

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.330 
this one works so I'm happy about that
next<00:02:39.650> I've<00:02:40.460> got<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:41.410> nerf<00:02:42.410> double<00:02:42.920> crossbow

these things are fairly cool they're not

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.310 
these things are fairly cool they're not
worth<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.400> whole<00:02:46.430> lot<00:02:46.580> but<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.780> came<00:02:48.020> with<00:02:48.200> the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
worth a whole lot but it came with the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.840 
worth a whole lot but it came with the
original<00:02:48.440> sister<00:02:48.920> bowstring<00:02:49.400> everything

updates on projects the 4k I'm doing the

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.890 
updates on projects the 4k I'm doing the
tank<00:05:49.040> is<00:05:49.220> actually<00:05:50.210> on<00:05:50.390> it<00:05:50.570> and<00:05:50.750> I'm

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
tank is actually on it and I'm

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.230 
tank is actually on it and I'm
pretty<00:05:51.230> bummed<00:05:52.220> out<00:05:52.460> about<00:05:52.520> it<00:05:52.790> because<00:05:53.030> I<00:05:53.090> put

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
pretty bummed out about it because I put

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.810 
pretty bummed out about it because I put
a<00:05:53.270> lot<00:05:53.390> of<00:05:53.450> work<00:05:53.660> into<00:05:53.840> it<00:05:53.960> so<00:05:54.460> I've<00:05:55.460> got<00:05:55.700> a<00:05:55.730> new

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
a lot of work into it so I've got a new

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.460 
a lot of work into it so I've got a new
tank<00:05:56.180> coming<00:05:57.430> if<00:05:58.540> it<00:05:59.540> wasn't<00:05:59.990> shooting<00:06:00.140> very

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
tank coming if it wasn't shooting very

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:01.870 
tank coming if it wasn't shooting very
good<00:06:00.650> I<00:06:00.680> think<00:06:00.800> it<00:06:01.100> might<00:06:01.220> have<00:06:01.340> been<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.520> tank

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
good I think it might have been the tank

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.670 
good I think it might have been the tank
because<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:02.360> back<00:06:02.570> of<00:06:02.720> the<00:06:02.810> tank<00:06:03.080> would

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
because the back of the tank would

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.800 
because the back of the tank would
actually<00:06:03.980> bulge<00:06:04.490> out<00:06:04.790> like<00:06:05.120> a<00:06:05.150> quarter<00:06:05.630> inch

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
actually bulge out like a quarter inch

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.110 
actually bulge out like a quarter inch
one<00:06:06.050> is<00:06:06.170> pressurized<00:06:06.800> and<00:06:07.130> I<00:06:07.580> know<00:06:07.640> I<00:06:07.790> wasn't

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
one is pressurized and I know I wasn't

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.090 
one is pressurized and I know I wasn't
putting<00:06:08.270> too<00:06:08.450> many<00:06:08.570> pumps<00:06:09.020> into<00:06:09.170> it<00:06:09.350> so<00:06:10.070> i

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
putting too many pumps into it so i

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.800 
putting too many pumps into it so i
think<00:06:10.280> it<00:06:10.490> was<00:06:10.550> pre<00:06:10.820> stress<00:06:11.180> or<00:06:11.390> something<00:06:11.690> was

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
think it was pre stress or something was

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:32.960 
putting your finger on the proof on the

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.350 
putting your finger on the proof on the
on<00:07:33.650> the<00:07:33.710> clip<00:07:33.980> release<00:07:34.280> you<00:07:34.910> just<00:07:35.120> pull<00:07:35.330> a
