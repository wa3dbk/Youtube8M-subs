00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
this example is going to be in the key

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.170 
this example is going to be in the key
of<00:00:39.480> G<00:00:39.780> I'm<00:00:40.290> not<00:00:40.710> sure<00:00:41.010> if<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.460> original<00:00:41.730> song

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
of G I'm not sure if the original song

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.450 
of G I'm not sure if the original song
they<00:00:42.480> played<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.930> off<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.320> album<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
they played it off the album is in the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.150 
they played it off the album is in the
key<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.670> G<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.940> don't<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.770> but<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.980> this

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
key of G I don't think it is but in this

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.459 
key of G I don't think it is but in this
case<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.820> put<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.270> G<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.440> I

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
case I'm going to put it in G so I

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.049 
case I'm going to put it in G so I
noticed<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.890> pretty<00:00:50.160> interesting<00:00:50.370> thing<00:00:50.610> that

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
noticed a pretty interesting thing that

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.299 
noticed a pretty interesting thing that
he<00:00:51.149> does<00:00:51.649> he<00:00:52.649> doesn't<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> time

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
he does he doesn't do it all the time

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.170 
he does he doesn't do it all the time
but<00:00:54.059> when<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> five<00:00:54.930> chord<00:00:55.320> comes<00:00:55.530> around

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
but when the five chord comes around

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.389 
but when the five chord comes around
we're<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.360> key<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.539> G<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.680> five<00:00:59.010> chord

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
we're in the key of G so the five chord

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.979 
we're in the key of G so the five chord
would<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.300> D<00:01:01.070> D<00:01:02.070> seven<00:01:02.460> chord<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:02.989> he

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
would be the D D seven chord here he

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.730 
would be the D D seven chord here he
goes<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.619> position<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.580> my<00:01:06.090> mind<00:01:06.680> this<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
goes to this position in my mind this is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770 
goes to this position in my mind this is
what<00:01:08.070> he's<00:01:08.189> thinking<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.909> no<00:01:08.939> idea<00:01:09.570> what

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
what he's thinking I have no idea what

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.170 
what he's thinking I have no idea what
he's<00:01:09.900> actually<00:01:10.110> thinking<00:01:10.520> but<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.939> what

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
he's actually thinking but this is what

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.469 
he's actually thinking but this is what
I<00:01:12.390> think<00:01:12.689> he<00:01:12.810> might<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.560> thinking<00:01:14.280> he<00:01:15.210> goes<00:01:15.390> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
I think he might be thinking he goes to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.030 
I think he might be thinking he goes to
this<00:01:15.630> position<00:01:19.880> so<00:01:20.880> five<00:01:21.330> chord

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
this position so five chord

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.870 
this position so five chord
and<00:01:24.470> everyone<00:01:25.470> kind<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.980> knows<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.430> Albert

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and everyone kind of knows the Albert

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.140 
and everyone kind of knows the Albert
box<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.950> he<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.520> takes<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.850> Albert

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
box and I think he just takes the Albert

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.040 
box and I think he just takes the Albert
box<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.720> moves<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.320> moves<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.860> up<00:01:32.010> two<00:01:32.340> frets

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
box and moves it moves it up two frets

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.810 
box and moves it moves it up two frets
because<00:01:34.050> that's<00:01:34.440> kind<00:01:34.680> of<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.130> way<00:01:35.280> he<00:01:35.310> might

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
because that's kind of the way he might

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.930 
because that's kind of the way he might
have<00:01:36.030> associated<00:01:37.280> approaching<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.370> five<00:01:38.610> chord

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
have associated approaching a five chord

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
have associated approaching a five chord
in<00:01:39.090> some<00:01:39.300> situations

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
in some situations

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.590 
in some situations

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
lick every time you know just improvise

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.550 
lick every time you know just improvise
the<00:03:42.730> lick<00:03:42.940> that's<00:03:43.629> one<00:03:43.900> thing<00:03:44.109> if<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.349> want<00:03:44.500> to

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
the lick that's one thing if you want to

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.670 
the lick that's one thing if you want to
play<00:03:44.799> like<00:03:45.040> Albert<00:03:45.489> King<00:03:45.930> he<00:03:46.930> never<00:03:47.109> just<00:03:47.349> sat

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680

down<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.250> played<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.940> same<00:03:49.180> lick<00:03:49.480> every

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
down and played the same lick every

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.509 
down and played the same lick every
single<00:03:50.019> time<00:03:50.230> it's<00:03:50.620> always<00:03:50.829> a<00:03:50.980> little<00:03:51.280> nuance

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
single time it's always a little nuance

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.210 
single time it's always a little nuance
here<00:03:51.909> or<00:03:52.269> there<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:52.750> that's<00:03:53.590> another<00:03:53.859> thing<00:03:53.980> to

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
here or there so that's another thing to

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.190 
here or there so that's another thing to
take<00:03:54.400> away<00:03:54.579> from<00:03:54.760> so<00:03:55.629> you<00:03:55.690> get<00:03:55.810> the<00:03:55.900> five<00:03:56.139> chord

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
take away from so you get the five chord

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.839 
take away from so you get the five chord
and<00:03:59.200> then<00:03:59.739> move<00:04:00.069> back<00:04:00.099> to<00:04:00.579> see<00:04:02.489> that's<00:04:03.489> one

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
and then move back to see that's one

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.640 
and then move back to see that's one
example<00:04:04.000> of<00:04:04.510> something<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.139> could<00:04:05.290> play
