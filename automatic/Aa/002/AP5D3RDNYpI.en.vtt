00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.050
 many of the functions of 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.430
 striated body is known by natural phenomena such as pathologies or 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.679
 diseases 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.109
 that they will accept proposals 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:14.109
 among which we found Parkinson's disease 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.140
 the city of parkinson 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.769
 it is a disease of tactics that is to say of unknown origin 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.849
 where it is seen that the main affectation scenes 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.050
 substance nigra 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.800
 in what is the compact portion 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.649
 that the one that is producing 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.299
 the dopamine and that gives rise to the city nor what is done 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.490
 to severe pathology especially four alterations once 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.540
 the appearance of abnormal movements such as tremor at rest 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.470
 that is, when the patient is not performing 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.090
 No activity of your limb 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.450
 presented a very finite tremor in the form d coins by pitino 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.890
 is a subject that occurs at rest and that diminishes when the patient has 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.200
 any 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.930
 another alteration that characterizes this stiffness disease 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.030
 this rigidity is observed when exploring the patient's muscle tone 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.910
 where by passively mobilizing your 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.000
 your elbow 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.290
 or some limb 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.990
 it is observed that there is a common thorny hop species 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.030
 and that is called wheel phenomenon 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.510
 70 are pitch alterations 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.010
 Another alteration that the patient presents to you is that making the movements 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.900
 very slowly 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.900
 that is to say the presumed labradío without essien 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.830
 which is characterized by the fact that the patient has to think about each 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 movement that you are going to perform 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.020
 you are not when we hear the alarm clock 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.440
 in the morning 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.170
 psg automatically we do not patrimonios eyes we are interested and we started doing 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.659
 our activities and acs 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.890
 the patient who has city of pakistan 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.020
 he has to think about every movement he's going to make 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.420
 and therefore the traditions are very slow 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.690
 and finally another characteristic disorder the parkinson's sphere 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.660
 they are disorders postures 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.109
 milestones the patient 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.469
 these postural traits make their march tina the characteristic 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.169
 from a march to small steps 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.429
 and the patient tends to fall forward 

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.189
 with loss of balance 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.400
 points has the arms attached cassia the throne 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.049
 we see that it is one of the characteristics of Parkinson's disease 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.469
 These patients have been observed to develop a syndrome in the long term 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.629
 that parkinson's disease is used along with 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:35.909
 that is to say 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.909
 this tells us that the nuclei that form 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.809
 the social body 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.479
 have priority with superior cognitive functions that said their 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.039
 executive functions 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.109
 the learning as well as d demos 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.679
 definitely process 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.669
 these basal nuclei 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.059
 have apart of motor functions have also crucial month 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:00.859
 intellectuals memory comitivas and that maybe 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:03.340
 another example of disease 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.379
 d 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.779
 of the social body 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:07.559
 It would be Korea 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.559
 and of the Koreans the evil Korea that the tail of the continent 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.609
 is accord john kirton or malignant korea 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.669
 is going to manifest itself by three clinical characteristics 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.980
 that are due to paid a patrol 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.969
 of the caudate nucleus above all 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.709
 in his head cd 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.819
 that there is atrophy 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.839
 highlight that showed caudate 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.649
 is going to give us the Korean 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.809
 that manifests itself by abnormal movements that are the so-called 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:35.779
 correct movements 

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:38.249
 which are disordered movements 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.639
 that apparently carry some intention 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.629
 but they are abrupt of big joints 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.879
 that can also be altered the language 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.639
 and that's why PT is called as if it were 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.690
 a dance 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:50.989
 thus 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.620
 another characteristic of Korea is dementia 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.829
 and then we go back observed 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.269
 what in pathology of the body is two of these basal nuclei 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.509
 there are also cognitive disorders 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:04.479
 these patients many times 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.669
 months later cubic mossos 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.079
 have dementia disorders 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.719
 with memory learning problems 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:15.049
 disorders visions pacial this praxias asks us 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.229
 and they also have the characteristic of having these psychiatric disorders 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.949
 psychiatric disorders 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.469
 they are usually manifested by depression 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.920
 that brings many of these patients to 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.199
 Yes Yes 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.560
 another example of disease 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.449
 three of the nuclei would quite be the one that nibali in which nibali sme 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.449
 its characteristic is that they are abnormal movements 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.910
 where the limb pe 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.580
 jeaneth top review presents sudden abrupt movements 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.000
 in the form of jerking 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.349
 kessel in rivals 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.969
 you see that here the section is the employment its mood 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.789
 yes we already saw that it is related to these circuits 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.389
 of the body this year with the match 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.760
 rough a degeneration usually type 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.770
 vascular 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.159
 in the subthalamic nucleus give these abnormal movements that is 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.029
 the immigrant 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.970
 by last 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.650
 we have to define what the feelings are often going to act on 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.749
 speak you 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.240
 the so-called past candidates 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.230
 here the term of gandia is misused by cases remain alive 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.219
 it is an accumulation of euros 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:23.589
 located 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.639
 the forum are in it is clarified 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.300
 and here they are accumulated anemones within scenarios but they will ask you to 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.539
 can visit 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.680
 easily identify is what some have atomized defined as 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.020
 paths passages 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.150
 what are we just seeing is 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.610
 the nucleus 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.699
 salgado the one who also 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.430
 the pale globe 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.559
 the substance miguel a 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:48.960
 and the core 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.139
 your mood 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.699
 those are the five basal nuclei 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.580
 despite adding that it would be the core 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.059
 we fulfill 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:06:00.139
 then a term that is used a lot in clinical 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.270
 the league sagres 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.550
 pontius gonzález that looks like a woman unhinged
