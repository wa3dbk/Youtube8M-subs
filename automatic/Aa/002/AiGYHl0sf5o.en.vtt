00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
the kind of an acog option i think this

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.720 
the kind of an acog option i think this
will<00:02:26.770> be<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.980> short<00:02:27.160> range<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.489> this<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.640> the

will be the short range of this is the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.090 
will be the short range of this is the
acog<00:02:28.030> option<00:02:28.390> but<00:02:29.050> my<00:02:29.170> first<00:02:29.319> perk<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.890> who's

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
acog option but my first perk is who's

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.350 
acog option but my first perk is who's
next<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.640> kill<00:02:30.819> with<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.000> final<00:02:31.239> round

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
next a kill with the final round

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.600 
next a kill with the final round
increases<00:02:31.900> reload<00:02:32.470> speed<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:33.069> plan<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.310> always

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
increases reload speed I plan to always

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.340 
increases reload speed I plan to always
be<00:02:33.730> killing<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.239> that's<00:02:34.390> good<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.959> has<00:02:35.319> the

would<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:41.170> option<00:02:41.560> tree<00:02:41.739> right<00:02:41.920> here<00:02:41.980> is

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
would the option tree right here is

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.580 
would the option tree right here is
single<00:02:42.850> whistling<00:02:43.150> switch<00:02:43.450> weapons<00:02:43.840> faster

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
single whistling switch weapons faster

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.440 
single whistling switch weapons faster
sindh<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.489> which<00:02:45.640> increases<00:02:46.090> range<00:02:46.269> and

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
sindh it which increases range and

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.150 
sindh it which increases range and
accuracy<00:02:46.690> basically<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.560> max<00:02:47.769> I<00:02:47.980> don't

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
accuracy basically to the max I don't

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.040 
accuracy basically to the max I don't
know<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.459> would<00:02:48.610> need<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.180> custom

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
know that I would need that and custom

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.810 
know that I would need that and custom
optics<00:02:50.470> precision<00:02:50.950> glass<00:02:51.190> for<00:02:51.400> a<00:02:51.430> better<00:02:51.550> zoom

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
optics precision glass for a better zoom

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.640 
optics precision glass for a better zoom
so<00:02:52.570> I<00:02:52.600> don't<00:02:52.870> know<00:02:52.930> which<00:02:53.080> one<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.290> these<00:02:53.470> I

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
so I don't know which one of these I

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.820 
so I don't know which one of these I
would<00:02:53.800> choose<00:02:53.950> probably<00:02:54.550> single<00:02:54.880> point<00:02:55.090> sling

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
would choose probably single point sling

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.800 
would choose probably single point sling
the<00:02:56.830> main<00:02:57.220> park<00:02:57.519> is<00:02:57.640> mulligan<00:02:58.209> missing<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.600> shot

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
magazine as far as perks ago this role

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.880 
magazine as far as perks ago this role
is<00:03:02.200> kind<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.440> weak<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.830> think<00:03:04.590> it's<00:03:05.590> kind<00:03:05.769> of

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
is kind of weak I think it's kind of

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.320 
is kind of weak I think it's kind of
it's<00:03:06.069> going<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.310> be<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.459> good<00:03:06.760> just<00:03:07.030> kind<00:03:07.239> of

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
it's going to be a good just kind of

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.500 
it's going to be a good just kind of
running<00:03:07.660> bounties<00:03:08.350> weapon<00:03:09.150> but<00:03:10.150> it's<00:03:10.329> not

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
running bounties weapon but it's not

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.090 
running bounties weapon but it's not
going<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.720> be<00:03:10.930> as<00:03:11.049> powerful<00:03:11.290> than<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.920> other

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
going to be as powerful than the other

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.650 
going to be as powerful than the other
one<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.310> think<00:03:12.640> because<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.060> other<00:03:13.180> one<00:03:13.329> have<00:03:13.450> a

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
one I think because the other one have a

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.740 
one I think because the other one have a
bit<00:03:14.049> better<00:03:14.200> perks<00:03:14.620> but<00:03:14.980> it's<00:03:15.640> still<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:16.060> tier<00:03:16.540> 2

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
bit better perks but it's still a tier 2

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.750 
bit better perks but it's still a tier 2
weapons<00:03:17.170> so<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.470> goes<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.769> attack<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.220> 331

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
weapons so it goes to the attack of 331

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.850 
weapons so it goes to the attack of 331
