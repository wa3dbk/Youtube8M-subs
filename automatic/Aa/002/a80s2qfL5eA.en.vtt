00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:17.740
 Hello people, welcome, one more 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.960
 video of the channel geo tv of the site ms week 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.449
 also commas for the whole 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.340
 microsoft technet community 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.950
 in this video talking about windows 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.350
 server 2012 r 2 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.150
 I'll spend two news here 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.000
 important there that you have to 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.120
 know and pass the basic concept and 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.360
 show how what config dhcp save 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.050
 and rauter from the ardi station and has come out of 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.530
 security that surely is someone already 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.090
 had some kind of problem of a 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.760
 server that lost the ip address ee 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.340
 I ended up getting the dhcp ip on the network is 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.640
 very common this happens and this 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.399
 functionality, it just protects the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.430
 your server your virtual machine from 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.390
 receive from traveling any package of 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.430
 hcp 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.460
 so you 're blocking this type 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.190
 Traffic in your vm making 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.190
 it does not receive an ip address from a 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.850
 dhcp server a very functionality 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.790
 useful here in case of ideas and got the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.430
 edit in case of harper save you 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.409
 protects your virtual machine from 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.799
 traffic data packets there 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.590
 unreliable routers is then 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:39.310
 Let's not say that you have any 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.930
 type of rust album server that tries to 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.080
 pass as a holter then the king pv has 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.060
 this intelligence to detect with this 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.700
 enabled option ok 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.009
 the router must protect the 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.430
 block any traffic pack that I saw 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.070
 it is from this rost that he considers as a 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.030
 risk to the environment is good, I will 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.430
 show you here how to configure 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.110
 open here my father stay 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.890
 important detail that this configuration 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:15.040
 you can do with the machine connected to the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.409
 has this advantage many features 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.510
 resources you can do with the 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:23.709
 connected virtual machine 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.780
 2012 2012 r 2 also ok right click 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.110
 here on the virtual machine or came here in 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.829
 settings here on the left side 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.000
 You have the network adapter here and there. 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:40.690
 you have or feature advancia was 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.829
 click here on advanced features and you 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:48.329
 Here you have two options to enable 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:52.239
 epd duty and keep and author keep 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:54.519
 okay note important if you have 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.989
 more network cards you have to 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.590
 expand here do the same procedure 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:04.870
 for the rest ok then here 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.900
 applying a good save author click on 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.370
 apply from that moment this 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.730
 my virtual machine 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.579
 it will not traffic any cp packets 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.930
 so maybe if I lose the address 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:23.440
 ip is from this server and this my network 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.379
 have any dhcp server that server 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.680
 will not receive any ip address from 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.699
 dhcp no hcp package will be 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.220
 trafficked in it 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:37.030
 It's fine and in the case of the author 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.669
 any package from a host that wants to 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.370
 to pass like raul have some rauter that 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.859
 it is not unreliable it will block 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.500
 pack of that face too 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.810
 Okay, so I wanted to move on to 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.940
 Are you this basic concept of halter? 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.620
 varzim and cp save and with much 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.340
 sets you up you will not miss Sergio 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.199
 roque 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.590
 Thank you so much, I hope you all enjoyed it.
