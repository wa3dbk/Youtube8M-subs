00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
has abrasive on both sides so what

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.560 
has abrasive on both sides so what
happens<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.210> mini

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
happens is if you have this mini

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.850 
happens is if you have this mini
s-shaped<00:01:22.439> file<00:01:22.880> and<00:01:23.880> being<00:01:24.210> short<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.560> curve

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
s-shaped file and being short the curve

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.190 
s-shaped file and being short the curve
really<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:26.909> helps<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.390> well<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:28.080> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
really really helps as well because it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.870 
really really helps as well because it
