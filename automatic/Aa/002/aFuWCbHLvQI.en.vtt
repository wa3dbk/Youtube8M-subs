it's only about a millimeter or two but
that's<00:00:34.720> where<00:00:35.050> plaque<00:00:35.470> will<00:00:35.829> get<00:00:36.070> trapped<00:00:36.430> and

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
that's where plaque will get trapped and

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.069 
that's where plaque will get trapped and
that's<00:00:36.940> where<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:37.300> actually<00:00:37.450> need<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:37.930> brush

ease if you were to angle your
toothbrush<00:00:42.579> at<00:00:42.790> 90<00:00:43.360> degrees<00:00:43.390> to<00:00:43.870> the<00:00:43.899> tooth

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
toothbrush at 90 degrees to the tooth

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.979 
toothbrush at 90 degrees to the tooth
like<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:45.460> then<00:00:46.210> you'll<00:00:46.420> find<00:00:46.719> that<00:00:46.840> you're

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
like so then you'll find that you're

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.840 
like so then you'll find that you're
kind<00:00:47.140> of<00:00:47.320> sitting<00:00:47.739> on<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.129> gap<00:00:48.489> and<00:00:48.760> you're

kind of sitting on the gap and you're

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.760 
kind of sitting on the gap and you're
not<00:00:48.969> you're<00:00:49.210> not<00:00:49.510> actually<00:00:49.930> brushing<00:00:50.379> it<00:00:50.620> out

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770

not you're not actually brushing it out
so<00:00:50.950> you<00:00:51.040> need<00:00:51.219> to<00:00:51.340> angle<00:00:51.579> your<00:00:52.300> toothbrush<00:00:52.840> so

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
so you need to angle your toothbrush so

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.810 
so you need to angle your toothbrush so
that<00:00:53.200> they're<00:00:53.379> here<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:54.160> bristles<00:00:54.640> of<00:00:54.760> the

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
that they're here the bristles of the

that they're here the bristles of the
toothbrush<00:00:55.300> actually<00:00:55.750> go<00:00:55.930> inside<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:57.550> gap

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
toothbrush actually go inside this gap

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.670 
toothbrush actually go inside this gap
over<00:00:58.239> here<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:58.690> then<00:00:59.079> round<00:00:59.379> circular

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
over here and then round circular

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.380 
over here and then round circular
motions<00:01:00.340> and<00:01:00.520> you'll<00:01:00.640> be<00:01:00.760> able<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:00.969> clean<00:01:01.210> it

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
motions and you'll be able to clean it

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.319 
motions and you'll be able to clean it
up<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.680> other<00:01:02.829> place<00:01:03.250> where<00:01:03.550> plaque<00:01:03.879> will<00:01:04.149> get

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:04.329 
up the other place where plaque will get

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.199 
up the other place where plaque will get
trapped<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:04.809> sitting<00:01:05.170> it<00:01:05.350> right<00:01:05.680> in<00:01:05.979> between

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:06.209 
trapped is sitting it right in between

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:09.480 
trapped is sitting it right in between
these<00:01:07.209> teeth<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.200> that's<00:01:08.740> one<00:01:09.009> of<00:01:09.039> the<00:01:09.159> main

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
these teeth and that's one of the main

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.120 
these teeth and that's one of the main
reasons<00:01:09.999> why<00:01:10.209> you<00:01:10.270> need<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.659> have<00:01:10.959> some<00:01:11.799> floss

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
reasons why you need to have some floss

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.300 
reasons why you need to have some floss
and<00:01:12.850> if<00:01:12.969> I<00:01:13.149> show<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:13.479> how<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.899> do<00:01:14.289> the<00:01:14.950> floss

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
and if I show you how to do the floss

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.849 
and if I show you how to do the floss
you<00:01:15.759> just<00:01:16.029> put<00:01:16.569> it<00:01:16.689> in<00:01:16.810> between<00:01:16.959> the<00:01:17.319> two<00:01:17.529> gaps

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
you just put it in between the two gaps

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.339 
you just put it in between the two gaps
initially<00:01:18.520> you'll<00:01:18.670> firer<00:01:18.969> hear<00:01:19.749> a<00:01:19.779> sound

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:20.349 
initially you'll firer hear a sound

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:22.169 
initially you'll firer hear a sound
because<00:01:20.799> it's<00:01:20.829> kind<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.279> goes<00:01:21.609> in<00:01:21.639> between<00:01:21.819> the

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
because it's kind of goes in between the

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:24.449 
because it's kind of goes in between the
contact<00:01:22.630> points<00:01:23.020> of<00:01:23.109> the<00:01:23.200> two<00:01:23.380> teeth<00:01:23.679> and<00:01:23.979> then

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:24.459 
contact points of the two teeth and then

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.459 
contact points of the two teeth and then
you<00:01:24.579> scrape<00:01:24.939> one<00:01:25.299> side<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.959> tooth<00:01:26.200> and

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
you scrape one side of the tooth and

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.559 
you scrape one side of the tooth and
then<00:01:27.069> scrape<00:01:27.459> the<00:01:27.670> other<00:01:27.789> side<00:01:28.029> of<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.240> tooth

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
then scrape the other side of the tooth

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.649 
then scrape the other side of the tooth
it<00:01:29.439> just<00:01:29.679> comes<00:01:29.859> out<00:01:30.189> now<00:01:30.759> will<00:01:30.909> that<00:01:30.939> tends<00:01:31.509> to

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
it just comes out now will that tends to

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.629 
it just comes out now will that tends to
do<00:01:32.049> is<00:01:32.789> that<00:01:33.789> will<00:01:34.060> get<00:01:34.959> rid<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:36.039> bacteria

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:36.639 
do is that will get rid of the bacteria

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:39.539 
do is that will get rid of the bacteria
that's<00:01:36.789> sitting<00:01:37.090> in<00:01:37.209> between<00:01:37.299> teeth<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
that's sitting in between teeth the

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.339 
that's sitting in between teeth the
final<00:01:40.060> place<00:01:40.299> where<00:01:40.569> you<00:01:40.689> get<00:01:40.899> bacteria

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:41.349 
final place where you get bacteria

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:43.800 
final place where you get bacteria
sitting<00:01:41.979> is<00:01:42.159> right<00:01:42.759> in<00:01:43.060> these<00:01:43.179> little<00:01:43.240> grooves

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
sitting is right in these little grooves

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.809 
sitting is right in these little grooves
and<00:01:44.489> pits<00:01:45.810> inside<00:01:46.810> on<00:01:47.770> top<00:01:48.189> of<00:01:48.340> your<00:01:48.459> teeth<00:01:48.669> the

end up with is nice pink healthy gum and
not<00:02:05.590> gum<00:02:05.859> like<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.459> which<00:02:06.759> is<00:02:06.909> red<00:02:07.239> sore<00:02:08.110> and

not gum like this which is red sore and
swollen<00:02:08.770> because<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.640> plaque<00:02:09.910> and

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
swollen because of the plaque and

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.229 
swollen because of the plaque and
bacteria<00:02:10.209> that's<00:02:10.869> actually<00:02:11.579> degrading<00:02:12.579> the

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
bacteria that's actually degrading the

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.880 
bacteria that's actually degrading the
bone<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.110> gun<00:02:14.349> away<00:02:14.860> from<00:02:15.099> the<00:02:15.549> two

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
bone and the gun away from the two

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.470 
bone and the gun away from the two
and<00:02:16.040> that's<00:02:16.220> when<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:16.550> start<00:02:16.850> getting<00:02:17.000> loose

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
and that's when you start getting loose

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.500 
and that's when you start getting loose
teeth<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.520> can<00:02:19.670> start<00:02:19.819> getting<00:02:19.910> more<00:02:20.360> and

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
teeth and you can start getting more and

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.710 
teeth and you can start getting more and
more<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.870> your<00:02:20.959> tooth<00:02:21.260> root<00:02:22.160> we<00:02:22.970> go<00:02:23.150> beginning

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
more of your tooth root we go beginning

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.920 
more of your tooth root we go beginning
to<00:02:23.959> become<00:02:24.230> exposed<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:26.180> that's<00:02:26.630> basically

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
to become exposed so that's basically

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.620 
to become exposed so that's basically
the<00:02:27.520> essentials<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.670> where<00:02:28.910> plaque<00:02:29.390> and

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
the essentials of where plaque and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.410 
the essentials of where plaque and
bacteria<00:02:29.690> would<00:02:30.410> would<00:02:30.800> stay<00:02:31.220> okay<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:31.970> as<00:02:32.300> you

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
bacteria would would stay okay so as you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.810 
bacteria would would stay okay so as you
can<00:02:32.570> see<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.020> three<00:02:33.320> areas<00:02:33.920> where<00:02:34.250> Clark<00:02:34.580> is

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
can see the three areas where Clark is

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.460 
can see the three areas where Clark is
more<00:02:35.090> than<00:02:35.600> likely<00:02:35.870> to<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.860> sit<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.340> fester<00:02:37.610> is

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
more than likely to to sit and fester is

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.070 
more than likely to to sit and fester is
along<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.650> gum<00:02:39.860> line<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:41.000> between<00:02:41.360> your<00:02:41.840> teeth
