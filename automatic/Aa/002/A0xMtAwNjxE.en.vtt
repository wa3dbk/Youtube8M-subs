into the interior of Florida and the

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.970 
into the interior of Florida and the
first<00:04:32.450> time<00:04:32.660> we<00:04:32.870> canoed<00:04:33.200> down<00:04:33.440> fish-eating

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
first time we canoed down fish-eating

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.160 
first time we canoed down fish-eating
Creek<00:04:34.280> we<00:04:34.520> felt<00:04:34.790> like<00:04:34.880> we'd<00:04:35.210> entered<00:04:35.660> into<00:04:36.140> a

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
Creek we felt like we'd entered into a

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.260 
Creek we felt like we'd entered into a
primeval<00:04:37.390> place<00:04:38.620> we<00:04:39.620> felt<00:04:39.830> like<00:04:40.010> we<00:04:40.490> were<00:04:41.060> in<00:04:41.150> a

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
primeval place we felt like we were in a

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.270 
primeval place we felt like we were in a
place<00:04:41.510> where<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.840> world<00:04:42.020> had<00:04:42.350> just<00:04:42.380> begun<00:04:42.980> and

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
place where the world had just begun and

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.180 
place where the world had just begun and

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
we were the only humans and we felt like

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.100 
we were the only humans and we felt like
maybe<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.700> Colusa<00:04:47.150> Indians<00:04:47.540> might<00:04:47.810> pop

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
maybe the Colusa Indians might pop

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.840 
maybe the Colusa Indians might pop
around<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.590> corner<00:04:48.950> at<00:04:49.070> any<00:04:49.160> minute<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.700> was

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
around the corner at any minute it was

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.270 
around the corner at any minute it was
just<00:04:50.210> such<00:04:50.990> an<00:04:51.260> absolutely<00:04:51.890> beautiful

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
just such an absolutely beautiful
