00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:12.650
 Hello 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:16.900
 Today is I think to understand because is out date and time of submission to the bottom of this video 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.220
 2013 May 8 days of 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.980
 today 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.470
 this 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.250
 Please wait for a moment without understanding 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.820
 Where 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.020
 Kyoto Ammunition 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.039
 Then here there 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.900
 here 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.280
 Takami Shigemi 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.410
 About Pappas a 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.380
 8 of this year 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.670
 It is the next feeling 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.350
 The result came out 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:53.920
 And here to with it Nene 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.210
 This is a temporary but foreign language 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.380
 Way 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.160
 It is 122 points of 150 points 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.160
 can you see 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.299
 a 2 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:14.010
 If this is corrected to the accuracy rate 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.900
 About 81 percent 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.970
 Of in Kyoto University 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.720
 Among the successful people 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.659
 Who is the highest score 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.450
 by myself 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.390
 I do not know if the unexpected ask them to report 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.560
 To Well generally in Hmm world 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.729
 Good 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.729
 It is supposed to be someone in the medical department medical department of the spawning tube 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:47.830
 Kyoto University's medical school highs and lows can be found on the net immediately published 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.610
 Than has been 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.140
 According to the data for the past 3 years, the highest point is 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.830
 Tsukiyama of center examination and secondary examination 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:04.820
 It is a thing but 88 pa 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:13.510
 It is the degree to which say 85 Papa 86% 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:17.040
 If you have a minimum score of 73 pearls 67 or 71 par 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.569
 Therefore we lecturer 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.270
 Brothers 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:31.240
 90 percent Well if you want to pass center test 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:33.750
 The water test will change depending on the year at the border , but if you want 60% and 5 minutes you have a needle 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.950
 Well there was a certain definition 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.950
 Is it feeling like that? 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.660
 However, the highest score by subject is 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.650
 I do not understand 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.270
 In the case of a medical school 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:54.489
 Mathematics and 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:59.500
 It is highly likely that you earn points in science and cover English and Japanese. 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:03.100
 So my score is the same but I think that 81 par is probably 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.380
 Faculty of Letters because it is School of Medicine Alma Ni_ko 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.040
 Someone highest score 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.640
 I do not know 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.550
 Well probably the top among the passing students 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.519
 Or 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.020
 About top rank 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.710
 I think 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:23.440
 Or it may be the most Maybe 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:29.740
 However, among the Kyoto University passers 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:32.770
 True because many people you will see there Toka canons and who's returnees and I like Uncle 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.990
 I understand the place well 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:40.150
 Then my 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:44.650
 The general exhibition is only for English and mathematics at one time 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:48.080
 Geography of the 22 o'clock from the center creatures to admire 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.370
 Then the language of ancient writing classical Chinese Because I Kanritsu 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.730
 It says the total is 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:04:01.569
 I'm only awful still 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:06.730
 In perhaps I toward their aging yourself Japan brothers movie 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:09.790
 I would like to have pride in which the 5 course modest Iwase has man-hour instruction to correct it 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:16.060
 I asked you to raise your confidence 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:18.389
 I mean that I want to better the business by hope it posted this video 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.760
 We gotten to 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.889
 In addition to this snow agencies paper 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.000
 I want to make a college 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.990
 I 've been aiming for a pass and I've been through here 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.670
 But some people 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:39.050
 Math also sees that I was catching up and overtaking 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:43.500
 But English has never been caught up 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.770
 Then 14 years at a famous preparatory school in Nagoya 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.500
 But it had been good child negotiations 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.720
 I have never met a teacher with an English proficiency grade 1 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.050
 then 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:59.700
 Maybe a huge medical school 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:06.200
 I think there are people with the highest scores 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:12.480
 Say Do not There are probably people who are jammed cram school instructor Yogi high school out given boundary Italy 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.840
 In Kyoto English led with industry Well 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:19.380
 Hmm 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.960
 I would like to say that it is Japan's best 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:27.920
 So 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:27.920
 Uchida doing this with blog youtube facebook etc 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.849
 I hope you feel good about everything 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.689
 From where 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.870
 If you come across complaints 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:41.030
 I still have it 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.810
 If no complaints appear 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.990
 I do not have much 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.740
 I want to make a decision 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.710
 Says I 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.710
 I will look at the situation a little and report again
