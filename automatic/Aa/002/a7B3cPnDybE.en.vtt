00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
walling threat to my opponents team as

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.399 
walling threat to my opponents team as
well<00:02:01.240> as<00:02:01.360> taking<00:02:01.539> out<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.780> threat<00:02:02.080> in<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.229> form

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
well as taking out a threat in the form

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.770 
well as taking out a threat in the form
of<00:02:02.440> ellicott<00:02:02.890> out<00:02:03.009> with<00:02:03.819> this<00:02:03.940> new<00:02:04.119> EV<00:02:04.450> spread

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
of ellicott out with this new EV spread

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.149 
of ellicott out with this new EV spread
nosepass<00:02:05.200> was<00:02:05.440> out<00:02:05.500> she's<00:02:05.710> starting<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:05.979> look

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
nosepass was out she's starting to look

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.419 
nosepass was out she's starting to look
really<00:02:06.220> really<00:02:07.000> difficult<00:02:07.330> to<00:02:07.630> take<00:02:07.869> down<00:02:08.429> by

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
really really difficult to take down by

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.340 
really really difficult to take down by
the<00:02:09.489> end<00:02:09.759> he<00:02:09.880> only<00:02:10.119> had<00:02:10.330> his<00:02:10.420> ruffler<00:02:10.869> left<00:02:11.140> and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
the end he only had his ruffler left and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.440 
the end he only had his ruffler left and
i<00:02:11.410> still<00:02:11.650> had<00:02:11.830> basically<00:02:12.250> my<00:02:12.489> entire<00:02:12.519> team<00:02:13.180> and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
i still had basically my entire team and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.900 
i still had basically my entire team and
so<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.470> led<00:02:14.709> to<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.920> most<00:02:15.069> difficult<00:02:15.670> part

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
so this led to the most difficult part

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.360 
so this led to the most difficult part
of<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.239> match<00:02:16.739> deciding<00:02:17.739> on<00:02:17.950> how<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.250> should

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
of the match deciding on how I should

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.559 
of the match deciding on how I should
kill<00:02:18.790> this<00:02:19.000> thing<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:22.030> decided<00:02:22.269> to<00:02:22.420> stick

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
kill this thing I just decided to stick

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.970 
kill this thing I just decided to stick

case he was scarf which I know is a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.960 
case he was scarf which I know is a
fairly<00:02:25.930> common<00:02:26.049> thing<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.769> without<00:02:27.549> the<00:02:27.819> game

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
fairly common thing and without the game

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.220 
fairly common thing and without the game
was<00:02:28.120> mine<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:28.330> are<00:02:28.569> searching<00:02:28.989> for<00:02:29.019> another

straightaway I quickly found another

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.240 
straightaway I quickly found another
game<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.080> this<00:02:32.170> time<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.590> was<00:02:32.680> against<00:02:33.130> a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
game and this time it was against a

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.039 
game and this time it was against a
fairly<00:02:33.790> well<00:02:33.970> balanced<00:02:34.299> team<00:02:34.480> actually<00:02:34.720> had<00:02:35.019> a

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
fairly well balanced team actually had a

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.569 
fairly well balanced team actually had a
very<00:02:35.290> big<00:02:35.500> threat<00:02:35.769> in<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.920> form<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.160> drifloon

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
very big threat in the form of drifloon

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.090 
very big threat in the form of drifloon
which<00:02:37.299> if<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.690> had<00:02:37.840> killed<00:02:38.019> my<00:02:38.170> nosepass<00:02:38.680> could

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
which if I had killed my nosepass could

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.069 
which if I had killed my nosepass could
actually<00:02:39.340> steamroll<00:02:40.239> for<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.480> lot<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.750> my<00:02:40.870> team

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
actually steamroll for a lot of my team

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.509 
actually steamroll for a lot of my team
with<00:02:41.230> acrobatics<00:02:41.620> as<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.100> had<00:02:42.190> nothing<00:02:42.489> really

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
with acrobatics as I had nothing really

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.250 
with acrobatics as I had nothing really
to<00:02:42.700> take<00:02:42.880> it<00:02:43.000> on<00:02:43.090> after<00:02:43.299> and<00:02:43.570> unburdened<00:02:44.049> boost

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
to take it on after and unburdened boost

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.440 
to take it on after and unburdened boost
getting<00:02:45.130> into<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.400> match<00:02:45.519> itself<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:46.120> quickly

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
getting into the match itself I quickly

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.660 
getting into the match itself I quickly
realized<00:02:46.989> my<00:02:47.170> mug<00:02:47.350> give<00:02:47.890> his<00:02:47.980> team<00:02:48.220> huge

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
realized my mug give his team huge

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.940 
realized my mug give his team huge
problems<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:50.049> I<00:02:50.079> took<00:02:50.260> spamming<00:02:50.829> that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
problems and so I took spamming that

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.530 
problems and so I took spamming that
against<00:02:51.280> everything<00:02:51.489> even<00:02:52.329> getting

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
against everything even getting

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.150 
against everything even getting
paralyzed<00:02:53.109> in<00:02:53.320> just<00:02:53.470> over<00:02:53.560> from<00:02:53.829> wrecking

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
paralyzed in just over from wrecking

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:08.950 
paralyzed in just over from wrecking
house

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.110 

what<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.740> did<00:03:09.890> eventually<00:03:10.160> die<00:03:10.520> was<00:03:10.790> a<00:03:10.820> really

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
what it did eventually die was a really

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.670 
what it did eventually die was a really
a<00:03:11.150> problem<00:03:11.390> because<00:03:11.810> if<00:03:11.930> force<00:03:12.110> drift<00:03:12.410> him<00:03:12.590> to

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
a problem because if force drift him to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.010 
a problem because if force drift him to
give<00:03:12.830> up<00:03:12.950> his<00:03:12.980> flying<00:03:13.370> gym<00:03:13.700> very<00:03:14.030> early<00:03:14.210> which

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
give up his flying gym very early which

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.510 
give up his flying gym very early which
means<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:15.470> no<00:03:15.590> sparks<00:03:15.980> could<00:03:16.100> easily<00:03:16.400> come

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
means that no sparks could easily come

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.150 
means that no sparks could easily come
in<00:03:16.640> to<00:03:16.760> handle<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.270> force<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.050> out<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.380> make<00:03:18.920> it

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
in to handle it force it out and make it

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.150 
in to handle it force it out and make it
no<00:03:19.460> longer<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.850> threat<00:03:20.090> then<00:03:20.960> after<00:03:21.740> a<00:03:21.770> forced

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
no longer a threat then after a forced

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.290 
no longer a threat then after a forced
out<00:03:22.310> miss<00:03:22.520> rivers<00:03:22.820> could<00:03:22.970> pretty<00:03:23.090> much<00:03:23.180> handle

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
out miss rivers could pretty much handle

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.940 
out miss rivers could pretty much handle
the<00:03:23.690> rest<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:23.930> his<00:03:24.020> team<00:03:24.200> no<00:03:24.350> problem<00:03:24.800> and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
the rest of his team no problem and

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.160 
the rest of his team no problem and
before<00:03:25.580> I<00:03:25.760> knew<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.120> game<00:03:26.450> was<00:03:26.690> once<00:03:26.900> again

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
before I knew it the game was once again

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.390 
before I knew it the game was once again
mine<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:30.110> Nets<00:03:30.320> game<00:03:30.500> I<00:03:30.650> had<00:03:30.830> I<00:03:31.010> was<00:03:31.130> very

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
mine the Nets game I had I was very

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.460 
mine the Nets game I had I was very
negative<00:03:31.910> about<00:03:31.940> going<00:03:32.420> into<00:03:32.570> because<00:03:33.200> of

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
negative about going into because of

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.070 
negative about going into because of
these<00:03:33.800> two<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.490> knew<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.060> riolu<00:03:35.570> especially

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
these two I knew that riolu especially

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.450 
these two I knew that riolu especially
was<00:03:36.200> going<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.380> be<00:03:36.500> one<00:03:36.710> hell<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.040> a<00:03:37.220> problem

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
was going to be one hell of a problem

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.220 
was going to be one hell of a problem
because<00:03:37.700> if<00:03:37.940> he<00:03:38.060> got<00:03:38.180> any<00:03:38.330> houses<00:03:38.720> up<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.080> was

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
because if he got any houses up I was

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.190 
because if he got any houses up I was
absolutely<00:03:39.470> screwed<00:03:40.460> and<00:03:40.700> so<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.600> therefore

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
absolutely screwed and so I therefore

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.360 
absolutely screwed and so I therefore
assume<00:03:42.590> that<00:03:42.770> he<00:03:42.860> was<00:03:42.950> going<00:03:43.070> to<00:03:43.130> leave<00:03:43.280> with

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
assume that he was going to leave with

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.440 
assume that he was going to leave with
his<00:03:43.490> Pharisee<00:03:44.000> despite<00:03:44.480> stack<00:03:45.490> and<00:03:46.490> I<00:03:47.210> there

follow<00:03:47.660> with<00:03:47.870> nosepass<00:03:48.380> so<00:03:48.560> he<00:03:48.710> could<00:03:48.890> fulfill

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
follow with nosepass so he could fulfill

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.040 
follow with nosepass so he could fulfill
his<00:03:49.400> intended<00:03:49.760> role<00:03:50.090> which<00:03:50.630> was<00:03:50.870> of<00:03:51.020> course

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
his intended role which was of course

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.010 
his intended role which was of course
trapping<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.280> killing<00:03:52.310> steel<00:03:53.000> types<00:03:53.330> this

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
trapping and killing steel types this

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.840 
trapping and killing steel types this
plan<00:03:54.290> went<00:03:54.500> off<00:03:54.620> completely<00:03:55.130> without<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.550> hitch

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
plan went off completely without a hitch

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.490 
plan went off completely without a hitch
and<00:03:56.240> within<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.540> first<00:03:56.750> couple<00:03:56.810> of<00:03:57.080> turns<00:03:57.290> I

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
and within the first couple of turns I

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.110 
and within the first couple of turns I
was<00:03:57.650> able<00:03:57.740> to<00:03:57.890> easily<00:03:58.070> not<00:03:58.430> carry<00:03:58.610> primary

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
was able to easily not carry primary

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.880 
was able to easily not carry primary
hazard<00:03:59.420> user<00:03:59.630> and<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.260> therefore<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.680> was

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
hazard user and so therefore I was

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.500 
hazard user and so therefore I was
presumably<00:04:01.340> safe<00:04:01.880> from<00:04:02.090> real<00:04:02.330> loose

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
presumably safe from real loose

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
of being a little and so it gave

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.350 
of being a little and so it gave
me<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.010> number<00:04:10.250> of<00:04:10.460> problems<00:04:10.700> just<00:04:11.060> from<00:04:11.270> the

me a number of problems just from the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.870 
me a number of problems just from the
sheer<00:04:11.390> cheapness<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:12.200> his<00:04:12.320> strategy<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:13.010> when

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
sheer cheapness of his strategy and when

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.430 
sheer cheapness of his strategy and when
I<00:04:13.910> finally<00:04:14.210> did<00:04:14.600> manage<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.140> take<00:04:15.290> that

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
I finally did manage to take that

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.750 
I finally did manage to take that
annoyance<00:04:15.770> down<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.220> was<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.400> free<00:04:16.580> opportunity

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
annoyance down it was a free opportunity

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.030 
annoyance down it was a free opportunity
for<00:04:17.360> him<00:04:17.420> to<00:04:17.480> bring<00:04:17.720> his<00:04:17.780> shine<00:04:18.170> through<00:04:18.470> which

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
for him to bring his shine through which

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.590 
for him to bring his shine through which
turned<00:04:19.370> out<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.549> be<00:04:19.700> some<00:04:19.910> sort<00:04:20.060> of<00:04:20.150> Pharisee

stealth<00:04:22.910> rocks<00:04:23.210> this<00:04:23.900> is<00:04:24.050> absolutely

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
stealth rocks this is absolutely

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.840 
stealth rocks this is absolutely
horrible<00:04:24.710> for<00:04:25.040> me<00:04:25.070> because<00:04:25.370> now<00:04:25.520> that<00:04:25.550> meant

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
horrible for me because now that meant

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:55.590 
horrible for me because now that meant
he's<00:04:26.000> rocks<00:04:26.270> with<00:04:26.420> her<00:04:26.510> up<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:27.710> men

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.750 

so<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.440> remembered<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.040> although<00:04:57.430> Sucker

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
so I remembered that although Sucker

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.670 
so I remembered that although Sucker
Punch<00:04:58.030> wouldn't<00:04:58.390> do<00:04:58.510> any<00:04:58.660> damage<00:04:58.900> it<00:04:59.440> would

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
Punch wouldn't do any damage it would

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.830 
Punch wouldn't do any damage it would
out<00:04:59.830> prioritize<00:05:00.460> copycat<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.180> so<00:05:01.660> therefore

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
out prioritize copycat and so therefore

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.620 
out prioritize copycat and so therefore
riolu<00:05:02.470> a<00:05:02.500> copycat<00:05:02.920> that<00:05:03.280> and<00:05:03.490> no<00:05:03.820> longer<00:05:04.240> bien
