video so a subscriber and here it is now
I<00:00:11.700> am<00:00:12.240> going<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.630> compare<00:00:13.139> today<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:14.370> three

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
I am going to compare today the three

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.779 
I am going to compare today the three
main<00:00:16.289> results<00:00:16.920> I've<00:00:17.010> taken<00:00:17.660> that<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.810> 23andme

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
main results I've taken that is 23andme

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.480 
main results I've taken that is 23andme
ancestry<00:00:20.789> DNA<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.480> my<00:00:21.930> penetrate<00:00:22.500> DNA<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.070> if

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
ancestry DNA and my penetrate DNA so if

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.839 
ancestry DNA and my penetrate DNA so if
you<00:00:23.699> don't<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:24.019> you<00:00:25.019> are<00:00:25.050> looking<00:00:25.590> at<00:00:25.830> if<00:00:26.670> you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
you don't know you are looking at if you

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.740 
you don't know you are looking at if you
don't<00:00:27.060> then<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.710> will<00:00:28.710> tell<00:00:28.920> you<00:00:29.010> what<00:00:29.750> results

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
don't then I will tell you what results

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.640 
don't then I will tell you what results
you're<00:00:30.900> looking<00:00:30.929> at<00:00:31.199> right<00:00:31.320> now<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.470> are

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
you're looking at right now you are

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.610 
you're looking at right now you are
looking<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.189> my<00:00:32.309> 23andme<00:00:33.120> results<00:00:33.410> which<00:00:34.410> I

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
looking at my 23andme results which I

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.470 
looking at my 23andme results which I
think<00:00:34.980> 23<00:00:35.309> me<00:00:35.610> has<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> most<00:00:36.149> accurate

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
think 23 me has the most accurate

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.990 
think 23 me has the most accurate
results<00:00:36.840> out<00:00:37.350> there<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.850> better

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
results out there I think it's better

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.479 
results out there I think it's better
than<00:00:39.239> ancestry<00:00:40.050> family<00:00:40.800> tree<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.250> does

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
than ancestry family tree but that does

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.979 
than ancestry family tree but that does
not<00:00:41.520> matter<00:00:41.820> I'm<00:00:42.149> just<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.600> share<00:00:42.870> my

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
not matter I'm just here to share my

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.560 
not matter I'm just here to share my
results<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.980> am<00:00:47.030> seventy-eight<00:00:48.030> point<00:00:48.239> for

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
results so I am seventy-eight point for

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.680 
results so I am seventy-eight point for
East<00:00:49.050> Asian<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.649> Native<00:00:50.039> American<00:00:50.899> so<00:00:53.449> if<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
East Asian and Native American so if you

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.660 
East Asian and Native American so if you
guys<00:00:54.930> don't<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.489> my

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
guys don't know of like if my

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
guys don't know of like if my
subscribers<00:00:57.210> don't<00:00:57.449> know<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:57.809> sure<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.440> guys

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
subscribers don't know I'm sure you guys

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.329 
subscribers don't know I'm sure you guys
know<00:01:00.289> but<00:01:03.379> that<00:01:04.379> means<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.890> fall<00:01:05.159> into

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
know but that means I I fall into

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.899 
know but that means I I fall into
seventy<00:01:05.939> percent<00:01:06.150> into<00:01:06.540> these<00:01:06.930> two<00:01:07.140> groups<00:01:07.439> so

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
seventy percent into these two groups so

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.130 
seventy percent into these two groups so
it<00:01:08.909> could<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.150> like<00:01:09.330> oh<00:01:09.479> while<00:01:09.720> you're<00:01:09.930> saving

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it could be like oh while you're saving

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.359 
it could be like oh while you're saving
8.4<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:12.170> would<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.200> mean<00:01:13.500> I'm<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.860> lot<00:01:14.189> of

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
8.4 like would that mean I'm a lot of

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.609 
8.4 like would that mean I'm a lot of
East<00:01:14.670> Asian<00:01:15.090> no<00:01:15.540> that's<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:16.080> mean<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.290> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
East Asian no that's not mean that it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.520 
East Asian no that's not mean that it
just<00:01:16.650> means<00:01:16.860> it's<00:01:17.689> it's<00:01:18.689> cluttered<00:01:19.049> together

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
just means it's it's cluttered together

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.359 
just means it's it's cluttered together
in<00:01:19.740> one<00:01:20.100> group<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.659> eventually<00:01:21.979> 23<00:01:22.979> me<00:01:23.159> would

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
in one group and eventually 23 me would

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.870 
in one group and eventually 23 me would
be<00:01:23.700> able<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.909> fix<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:25.640> anyways<00:01:26.640> let's<00:01:26.820> move

or<00:01:48.479> however<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.020> pronounce<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.740> am<00:01:50.689> two

point<00:01:52.049> seven<00:01:52.470> on<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.710> science<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.579> think<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.119> two

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
point seven on a science I think the two

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.389 
point seven on a science I think the two
point<00:01:54.450> seven<00:01:54.689> understand<00:01:55.020> would<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.399> Native

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
point seven understand would be Native

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.209 
point seven understand would be Native
American<00:01:57.320> that's<00:01:58.320> my<00:01:58.560> guess<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.189> don't

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
American that's my guess but I don't

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.350 
American that's my guess but I don't
know<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.610> will<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.619> their<00:02:01.619> updates

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
know we will have to see their updates

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.160 
know we will have to see their updates
then<00:02:03.360> yeah<00:02:03.450> those<00:02:03.630> are<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:03.899> 23<00:02:04.350> many<00:02:04.530> results

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
then yeah those are my 23 many results

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.820 
then yeah those are my 23 many results
hello<00:02:07.170> everyone<00:02:07.590> saw

I am European 14% so if you look at the

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.560 
I am European 14% so if you look at the
comparison<00:03:06.580> between<00:03:10.200> 23andme<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:12.570> ancestry

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
comparison between 23andme and ancestry

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.770 
comparison between 23andme and ancestry
DNA<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:14.140> is<00:03:14.200> not<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.739> different<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.370> in<00:03:15.820> 23<00:03:16.660> me

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
DNA it is not that different I in 23 me

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.220 
DNA it is not that different I in 23 me
I<00:03:16.810> am<00:03:16.959> 70<00:03:17.410> percent<00:03:17.770> European<00:03:17.890> here<00:03:18.459> I'm<00:03:18.550> 14<00:03:19.030> in

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.070 

Internet<00:03:23.230> 3<00:03:23.410> me<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.830> am<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:26.970> 77<00:03:27.970> percent<00:03:28.390> 79

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
Internet 3 me I am like 77 percent 79

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.020 
Internet 3 me I am like 77 percent 79
inch<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.470> 78<00:03:29.890> is<00:03:30.070> percent<00:03:31.200> Native<00:03:32.200> American<00:03:33.030> so

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
inch so 78 is percent Native American so

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.560 
inch so 78 is percent Native American so
I<00:03:34.739> think<00:03:37.050> my<00:03:38.050> sister<00:03:38.410> has<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.970> scoop<00:03:40.270> right

they tested a lot of Native American

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.820 
they tested a lot of Native American
group<00:03:44.560> so<00:03:44.739> that's<00:03:44.890> why<00:03:45.070> I<00:03:45.130> have<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:45.790> high<00:03:46.830> but

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
group so that's why I have that high but

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.100 
group so that's why I have that high but
they<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:48.580> then<00:03:48.700> again<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:49.030> don't<00:03:49.090> know<00:03:49.239> where

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
test with Family Tree DNA I submitted my

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.379 
test with Family Tree DNA I submitted my
23andme<00:06:04.469> results<00:06:04.650> raw<00:06:05.339> data<00:06:05.639> to<00:06:05.969> them<00:06:06.180> and

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
23andme results raw data to them and

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:09.499 
23andme results raw data to them and
this<00:06:07.050> is<00:06:07.110> what<00:06:07.379> they<00:06:07.500> came<00:06:07.740> up<00:06:07.800> with<00:06:08.009> so<00:06:08.550> even

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
this is what they came up with so even

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.860

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
though these results are wrong I suggest

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.740 
though these results are wrong I suggest
taking<00:06:13.110> a<00:06:13.379> test<00:06:13.710> before<00:06:13.979> judging<00:06:14.659> because<00:06:15.659> I

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
taking a test before judging because I

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.529 
taking a test before judging because I
didn't<00:06:15.990> take<00:06:16.080> a<00:06:16.139> DNA<00:06:16.409> test<00:06:16.620> with<00:06:16.979> them<00:06:17.190> I<00:06:17.539> just

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
didn't take a DNA test with them I just

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.990 
didn't take a DNA test with them I just
submitted<00:06:19.110> my<00:06:19.319> raw<00:06:19.589> data<00:06:19.830> to<00:06:20.069> them<00:06:20.219> I<00:06:20.339> paid<00:06:20.550> 55

but at the end of the day I got some

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.059 
but at the end of the day I got some
cool<00:06:34.389> results<00:06:34.870> so<00:06:35.439> it<00:06:35.500> doesn't<00:06:35.770> matter<00:06:35.919> but

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:36.069 
cool results so it doesn't matter but

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.830 
cool results so it doesn't matter but
this<00:06:36.219> is<00:06:36.370> what<00:06:37.530> Family<00:06:38.530> Tree<00:06:38.740> DNA<00:06:38.770> shows<00:06:39.840> for

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
this is what Family Tree DNA shows for

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.309 
this is what Family Tree DNA shows for
my<00:06:40.990> raw<00:06:41.169> data<00:06:41.520> for<00:06:42.520> 23<00:06:42.939> me<00:06:43.090> it<00:06:44.020> might<00:06:44.289> be

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 
my raw data for 23 me it might be

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:46.920 
my raw data for 23 me it might be
different<00:06:44.770> if<00:06:45.009> I<00:06:45.159> submitted<00:06:45.939> my<00:06:46.060> sample<00:06:46.780> to

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
different if I submitted my sample to

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.589 
different if I submitted my sample to
them<00:06:47.080> but<00:06:47.289> I<00:06:47.319> cannot<00:06:47.710> afford<00:06:47.860> that<00:06:48.159> so<00:06:49.060> for<00:06:49.479> now

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 
them but I cannot afford that so for now
