00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.410
 hello that as this year I hope that 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.120
 very good, let's talk about the 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.400
 project as they could read there 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.820
 above it is a ppcv fund 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.830
 let's do it for chapter 1 and 2 or 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.420
 at least that is my goal as they will 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.520
 noticed I'm getting those chapters 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.140
 I'm not going to tell you why I eliminated the 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.730
 old since it would be the zeal is the story 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.890
 very long the issue is that I want 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.080
 receive them to celebrate the 10 years of 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.410
 ppcv for now we are going to focus on 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.449
 those two if this project is successful already 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.489
 We will analyze if Carlos can do it. 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:37.239
 later chapters I will need 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.280
 voices of all the characters the most 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.690
 feasible and as similar as possible 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.420
 especially for the characters 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.229
 main such as bom bom bubble 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.389
 acorn dexter and jack that more people 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.190
 important good can check the 

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:53.049
 chapter 1 and 2 here in the description 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.389
 of the video look for some character that 

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:58.030
 they are interested and if they see what they can do 

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:59.799
 a good voice because they are preparing 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.899
 his casting for what this would be 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.119
 project I want you to send me an audio 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.920
 with the character demo that you 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.240
 they want to do and put me there 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.189
 description if they can 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.200
 what page is to have it as 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.439
 reference the characters that we're going to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.340
 need then as I said are chocolate 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.460
 acorn bubble sensei jacques dexter 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:26.229
 by angel but cowardly miss who 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.420
 the professor antonio in that more so billy 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.509
 and mandy although they have few dialogues what 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.399
 that I will search mainly apart 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.549
 that the voices are the most similar 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.039
 possible to the character is going to be this 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.959
 audio quality so hopefully the 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.479
 audio you very well is that it is the most 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:45.520
 clean possible since many people 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.770
 have that problem how to do it 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.110
 look for a closed place to record your 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.140
 voice first of all without noise if it is 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.170
 possible they will record the show in their 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.030
 computer away the cpu as much as 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.610
 can of the microphone since the sound of 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.549
 the fans of hard drives and all that 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.250
 get microphone noises in order me and some 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.289
 friends let's select the audios 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.600
 for the characters and choose the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.730
 people many people of course 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.610
 that they will have credits at the end of 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.010
 video with their respective channels and to 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.660
 no time I'm going to promote all 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.310
 the pages that you have as if 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.740
 I will win or something like that there in the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.390
 descriptions of the video I know that many 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.940
 people want to get in because they have 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.800
 asked how he has no idea in 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.870
 facebook people that if I'm going to be a 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.570
 fan what I want to put that this that 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.250
 the other and well I imagine that they are going to 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.100
 get enough because they have no idea 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.959
 as they have asked me and if you can not 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.820
 dedicate it and the project if not 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.640
 get enough voices or 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.970
 at least give the most important in 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.430
 this people can send me their demos 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.430
 of voice whether personal messages here in 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.410
 youtube or my facebook as I told you 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.060
 in send me the and tell me which page 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.920
 is that where are the lines that go to 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.470
 when and he does not need me to do a 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.150
 fan of absolutely all the dialogues 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.790
 have the character for example if 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.290
 a girl wants to make for chocolate is not 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.660
 so necessary that he do everything if 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.850
 he wants to do he does it true but it's not 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.700
 necessary for me to make some 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.740
 prayers maximum in more with two or three 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.630
 prayers would be more than enough to 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.030
 get an idea of â€‹â€‹his voice that's all 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.230
 what I need and well I think that is 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.690
 all 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.350
 thank you very much for listening here to the 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.330
 video and I hope they send me many 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.790
 requests so that we will have more 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.230
 options to choose the best audios 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.970
 for what would be this project that 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.130
 I really want and I want it to come out 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.660
 best possible so nothing people that's 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.810
 everything until then 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.810
 bye
