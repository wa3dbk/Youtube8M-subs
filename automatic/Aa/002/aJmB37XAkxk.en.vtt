00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:41.349 
though by this time a lot of funds had
already<00:01:39.259> imported<00:01:39.859> it<00:01:39.979> for<00:01:40.789> those<00:01:40.909> who<00:01:41.090> didn't

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
already imported it for those who didn't

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.489 
already imported it for those who didn't
I'm<00:01:41.569> sure<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:41.929> was<00:01:42.020> worth<00:01:42.169> the<00:01:42.319> wait<00:01:42.349> because

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
I'm sure it was worth the wait because

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.039 
I'm sure it was worth the wait because
this<00:01:42.950> game<00:01:43.159> is<00:01:43.310> simply<00:01:43.549> one<00:01:43.759> of<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:43.939> best

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
this game is simply one of the best

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.599 
this game is simply one of the best
JRPGs<00:01:45.049> in<00:01:45.709> about<00:01:45.919> ten<00:01:46.189> years

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
JRPGs in about ten years

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.429 
JRPGs in about ten years
ok<00:01:47.450> so<00:01:47.509> we'll<00:01:47.749> continue<00:01:47.929> to<00:01:48.109> show<00:01:48.319> the

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
ok so we'll continue to show the

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.019 
ok so we'll continue to show the
standard-definition<00:01:48.950> footage<00:01:49.520> up<00:01:49.759> until

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:50.029 
standard-definition footage up until

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:51.940 
standard-definition footage up until
about<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.209> halfway<00:01:50.509> mark<00:01:50.749> where<00:01:51.619> we'll<00:01:51.739> fade

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
about the halfway mark where we'll fade

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.409 
about the halfway mark where we'll fade
out<00:01:52.099> to<00:01:52.219> black<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:52.639> then<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.029> next<00:01:53.239> time<00:01:53.329> you

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:53.419 
out to black and then the next time you

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:54.699 
out to black and then the next time you
see<00:01:53.569> the<00:01:53.630> game<00:01:53.779> it'll<00:01:54.139> be<00:01:54.200> running<00:01:54.380> on<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
see the game it'll be running on the

dolphin emulator

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.429

there'll<00:01:56.179> be<00:01:56.209> an<00:01:56.329> on-screen<00:01:56.659> prompt<00:01:57.169> to<00:01:57.319> let

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
there'll be an on-screen prompt to let

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.929 
there'll be an on-screen prompt to let
you<00:01:57.529> know<00:01:57.619> when<00:01:57.739> this<00:01:57.859> has<00:01:57.950> happened<00:01:57.979> but<00:01:58.789> if

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
you know when this has happened but if

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.309 
you know when this has happened but if
you<00:01:59.029> honestly<00:01:59.299> can't<00:01:59.539> tell<00:01:59.630> and<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.109> highly

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
you honestly can't tell and I highly

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.099 
you honestly can't tell and I highly
recommend<00:02:00.799> a<00:02:01.009> visit<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:01.999> opticians<00:02:05.109> so
