00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.120 

it<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.730> hit<00:02:38.850> 12<00:02:39.240> /<00:02:39.540> 12<00:02:39.780> on<00:02:40.020> there<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:41.010> have

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
it just hit 12 / 12 on there you have

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.520 
it just hit 12 / 12 on there you have
the<00:02:41.160> first<00:02:41.490> chocolates<00:02:43.040> she's<00:02:44.040> hot<00:02:45.530> here's

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
the first chocolates she's hot here's

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.260 
the first chocolates she's hot here's
the<00:02:46.590> CQC

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.170 

oh<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:55.140> CQC<00:02:55.830> as<00:02:55.950> soon<00:02:56.070> as<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.310> emit<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.030> is

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
oh the CQC as soon as that emit it is

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.660 
oh the CQC as soon as that emit it is
and<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.630> move<00:03:00.930> while<00:03:01.200> shooting<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:01.710> all

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
and you can move while shooting it all

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.980 
and you can move while shooting it all
right<00:03:02.820> so<00:03:03.060> it's<00:03:03.090> accurate<00:03:03.600> while<00:03:03.720> strafing

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
right so it's accurate while strafing

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.060 
right so it's accurate while strafing
too<00:03:04.380> i<00:03:05.870> think<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.930> CQC<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.710> Night<00:03:07.830> Stalker

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
too i think the CQC in the Night Stalker

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.000 
too i think the CQC in the Night Stalker
pretty<00:03:08.790> much<00:03:08.910> near<00:03:09.120> identical<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:10.890> the

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
pretty much near identical and then the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:23.840 
pretty much near identical and then the
sig<00:03:11.280> 556<00:03:20.210> sig<00:03:21.210> 556<00:03:22.280> ridiculously<00:03:23.280> fucking

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
sig 556 sig 556 ridiculously fucking

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.520 
sig 556 sig 556 ridiculously fucking
accurate<00:03:24.540> look<00:03:25.020> at<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.410> shit<00:03:25.800> moving<00:03:27.530> third

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
accurate look at that shit moving third

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.420 
accurate look at that shit moving third
person<00:03:31.580> look<00:03:32.580> at<00:03:32.670> that<00:03:32.820> shit<00:03:34.010> look<00:03:35.010> at<00:03:35.220> that

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
person look at that shit look at that

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.170 
person look at that shit look at that
shit<00:03:36.110> ok<00:03:37.110> that's<00:03:37.530> why<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:37.920> like<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.400> sig<00:03:38.640> 556

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
shit ok that's why I like the sig 556

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.570 
shit ok that's why I like the sig 556
it's<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.400> fucking<00:03:41.400> accurate<00:03:42.390> mike<00:03:42.720> i<00:03:43.580> think

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
it's so fucking accurate mike i think

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.710 
it's so fucking accurate mike i think
the<00:03:44.700> sig<00:03:44.940> 556<00:03:45.450> is<00:03:45.900> less<00:03:46.170> accurate<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.820> that

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
the sig 556 is less accurate so that

so<00:03:58.380> that's<00:03:58.590> basically<00:03:58.800> it<00:03:59.070> all<00:03:59.400> with<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.820> best

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
so that's basically it all with the best

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.910 
so that's basically it all with the best

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
in the game the compact scope the rifle

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
laser in the forward grip so the tar I

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.270 
laser in the forward grip so the tar I
guess<00:04:08.790> counts<00:04:09.240> as<00:04:09.420> an<00:04:09.780> SMG<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.709> I<00:04:10.770> wonder<00:04:11.070> if

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
guess counts as an SMG and I wonder if

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.930 
guess counts as an SMG and I wonder if
an<00:04:11.400> SMG<00:04:11.900> grip<00:04:12.900> actually<00:04:13.590> works<00:04:13.860> on<00:04:14.190> that<00:04:14.430> but

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
an SMG grip actually works on that but

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.520 
an SMG grip actually works on that but
the<00:04:15.060> g36<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.650> g36<00:04:17.310> is<00:04:17.459> alright<00:04:17.820> but<00:04:18.260> I<00:04:19.260> didn't

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
the g36 the g36 is alright but I didn't

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.930 
the g36 the g36 is alright but I didn't
bring<00:04:19.620> it<00:04:19.680> out<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:19.890> never<00:04:20.220> important<00:04:20.730> so<00:04:20.910> that
