and the eggs have got to be turned
regularly<00:03:09.290> the<00:03:09.950> eggs<00:03:10.070> need<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.430> be<00:03:10.520> turned

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
regularly the eggs need to be turned

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.140 
regularly the eggs need to be turned
regularly<00:03:11.510> so<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.620> membrane<00:03:13.370> does<00:03:13.640> not<00:03:13.850> stick

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
regularly so the membrane does not stick

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.920 
regularly so the membrane does not stick
to<00:03:14.300> the<00:03:14.420> shell

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
to the shell

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.610 
to the shell
so<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.560> Umbro<00:03:16.010> can<00:03:16.490> develop<00:03:17.240> and<00:03:17.450> turn<00:03:18.080> in<00:03:18.440> the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
so the Umbro can develop and turn in the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.820 
so the Umbro can develop and turn in the
egg<00:03:18.740> as<00:03:19.010> it<00:03:19.190> grows<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:20.390> temperature<00:03:21.020> has<00:03:21.590> to

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
egg as it grows the temperature has to

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.250 
egg as it grows the temperature has to
be<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.280> certain<00:03:22.910> temperature<00:03:23.330> or<00:03:23.660> eggs<00:03:23.870> are<00:03:24.110> not

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
be a certain temperature or eggs are not

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.200 
be a certain temperature or eggs are not
going<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.530> hatch<00:03:24.710> the<00:03:25.130> humidity's<00:03:25.760> got<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.150> be

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
going to hatch the humidity's got to be

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.730 
going to hatch the humidity's got to be
a<00:03:26.240> certain<00:03:26.660> amount<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.960> community<00:03:27.470> or<00:03:27.710> that

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
a certain amount of community or that

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.470 
a certain amount of community or that
eggs<00:03:28.100> not<00:03:28.400> going<00:03:28.580> to<00:03:28.670> hatch<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.090> those<00:03:29.270> are<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
eggs not going to hatch so those are the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.060 
eggs not going to hatch so those are the
three<00:03:29.750> basic<00:03:30.220> elements<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.820> a<00:03:32.120> hatching<00:03:36.070> if

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
three basic elements in a hatching if

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.170 
three basic elements in a hatching if
they<00:03:37.580> are<00:03:38.620> in<00:03:39.620> an<00:03:39.740> incubator<00:03:40.040> three<00:03:41.000> days

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
they are in an incubator three days

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.240 
they are in an incubator three days
before<00:03:41.600> they<00:03:41.720> hatch<00:03:41.959> they<00:03:42.230> actually<00:03:42.620> go<00:03:42.830> into

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
before they hatch they actually go into

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.520 
before they hatch they actually go into
a<00:03:43.280> Hatcher<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:44.600> they<00:03:44.720> can<00:03:44.870> move<00:03:44.990> around<00:03:45.050> hatch

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
a Hatcher so they can move around hatch

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.220 
a Hatcher so they can move around hatch
out<00:03:46.120> when<00:03:47.120> they're<00:03:47.270> ready<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.540> hatch<00:03:47.810> out<00:03:48.050> and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
out when they're ready to hatch out and

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.260 
out when they're ready to hatch out and
they're<00:03:48.320> dried<00:03:48.650> we<00:03:48.920> pull<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.400> trays<00:03:49.670> out<00:03:49.940> we

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
they're dried we pull the trays out we

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.390 
they're dried we pull the trays out we
box<00:03:50.540> everything<00:03:50.900> up

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
box everything up

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.340 
box everything up
usually<00:03:53.090> we<00:03:53.300> pull<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.660> hatch<00:03:53.840> it's<00:03:54.140> real

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
usually we pull the hatch it's real

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.320 
usually we pull the hatch it's real
early<00:03:54.530> morning<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.340> we<00:03:55.550> have<00:03:55.730> anywhere<00:03:56.060> from

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
early morning and we have anywhere from

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.360 
early morning and we have anywhere from
four<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.930> five<00:03:57.140> sexers<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:57.860> will<00:03:58.010> come<00:03:58.220> in

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
four to five sexers that will come in

four to five sexers that will come in
and<00:03:58.520> they<00:03:58.610> actually<00:03:58.760> sexes<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.690> bird<00:03:59.900> pick

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
and they actually sexes the bird pick

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.460 
and they actually sexes the bird pick
out<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.800> males<00:04:01.010> and<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.280> females<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:02.870> takes
