00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.790
 there is nothing before the start of one 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.980
 all such films must exist from 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:23.990
 Hand designed and made one 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.610
 nothing we really have to do each 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.239
 plan the smallest detail 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.099
 It's about natural elements like fire 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:34.270
 smoke and water to all 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.270
 others are the ones on the canvas 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.770
 for me as an artistic director 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.240
 the fantastic how many times you can already 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.370
 Design everything if you have one 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.620
 incredible decision-making power month 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.240
 because of stop motion filming it is 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.040
 especially difficult the environment 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.550
 credible way to become alive 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.350
 to let 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.010
 but that was very important to us 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.010
 special atmosphere 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.040
 we think about what does water look like 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.020
 what does dust look like from what materials 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.350
 we use to create these pictures 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.130
 and start as nature can you 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.770
 do not change 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.900
 We built a kind of canal system 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.539
 flowing and dripping in the water 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.909
 plastic and glass what they behind me 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.689
 see is a glass plate meeting makes 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.460
 to relax glass sekt from the left 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.229
 to the right and that creates the fleece 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.549
 Move 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.829
 there are nested in each other 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.130
 Mirror turned and easy update 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.840
 Adhesive tape then observe the effect 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.670
 when the glass is from left to right 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.649
 over the mirrors and step ready 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.490
 the illusion of one arises 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:43.819
 shiny water surface 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.560
 I note the 24 25 different 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.950
 grasses we grow in she's bridge 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.869
 to let 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.759
 are all very special but also 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.659
 stylized so that you are in our world 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.209
 fit into it 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.279
 that was very important a new species 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.289
 has yet been completely discovered 

00:01:55.279 --> 00:02:00.139
 It was early for the fire 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.850
 Tests with multiple made our rating 

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:04.039
 department has the great pictures of the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.170
 flames and fire generated by it on 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.030
 wrapped multicar with this orange 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.020
 yellow light combined it was 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.020
 incredible 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.719
 the truck the special delight elements 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.370
 to reproduce nature is also in the 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.530
 Challenge her as close as possible 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.790
 get 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.439
 one develops a greater understanding 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.939
 for the things the one else 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.379
 Of course, because one appears 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:29.579
 dive deep into the matter 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:31.629
 we are the little moments the c and 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.189
 if it works, it's like one 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.500
 Head-to-head race of nature 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.760
 it is an uplifting feeling when you are 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.760
 nature tries to emulate 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.299
 the box from 23 october in the cinema 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.200
 there is a legend that everyone in she's 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.500
 bridge barely clear the people the 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.890
 Judge a close door and gate 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.610
 come scary creatures from the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.610
 dark out 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.970
 they are nasty and huge so it will be 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:25.930
 cleared up as soon as you see one 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:29.060
 would you be timid church 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.260
 and maybe you never have anything 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.310
 Strange enough 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.790
 because right under the streets there 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.790
 live 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:51.920
 from majka universal pictures you are 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:51.920
 not brave they are not fit 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.230
 but soon 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.379
 my hero is his hiding game more 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.379
 work out clearly 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.820
 the box despite
