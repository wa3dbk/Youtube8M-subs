 I'll make that big pot I do not do 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.130
 in the small pot because otherwise it will 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.529
 stay there when it's time for you to move 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.380
 also has to be more milk than 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.519
 rice is then this big pot here 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:37.010
 it's ideal 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:37.010
 I put the cup of rice one two three 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.790
 four 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.210
 all in all I put five cups of water 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.360
 in a cup of rice is then the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.379
 people will let cooking rice and 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.870
 if you wish you may be putting 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.449
 cinnamon powder to pick up the taste and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.180
 kitchen together with rice can put 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.150
 also caught the Indian you like 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.299
 a lot you can put that I like 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.159
 gets more intense 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.110
 while our mother is cooking 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.119
 I've already separated the ingredients here 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.960
 people will need to do our 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.470
 Creamy rice, right? That's the cream. 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.900
 two tablespoons of cinnamon powdered coconut 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.790
 you do not like you do not need to put me 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.259
 I like to put on top to stay 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.930
 most beautiful milk and condensed milk are 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.820
 so I'll wait for the rice to cook and 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.540
 I'll come back here later to show you 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.869
 you 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.270
 the rest of the beauty recipe - after 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:49.600
 that the rice already cooked with milk 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:55.869
 delicious condensed nÃ© 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:58.320
 the best part put there had all of 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.320
 condensed milk 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.250
 I'll mix it here on low heat. 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.430
 mixing milk here until embodies 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.330
 condensed rice 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.730
 after you have all stirred up like this 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:32.570
 put the milk and I'm moving to 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.570
 little by little're 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.700
 now you can increase the fire of 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.099
 I just stooped so I would not burn the 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.500
 how the ball was already cooked 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.680
 adding the cream the cream 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.050
 condensed milk is 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.379
 dangerous to burn on the bottom of the pan is 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.879
 so it is important to lower the fire 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:03.870
 after adding lenses may 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.870
 raise the fire again and stirring 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.819
 Remember that I told you that a 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.470
 cup of rice I needed a liter 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.450
 of milk on average 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.299
 so I'll put a little more of 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.280
 milk here because because I had a 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:24.310
 larger container 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:26.530
 I put this meter curve here not 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.799
 I'm going to add some more milk 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.799
 on here 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.540
 I'll add the rija a killer tip 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.400
 her powder 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.210
 who likes cinnamon powder can put 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.070
 who does not like does not need it again and 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.460
 I also like to put the cinnamon in 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.580
 dust on top when decorating 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.680
 think are the silver and presentable 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.200
 and I also think it's delicious 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.080
 formerly did not like cinnamon contain 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.820
 The conflict may not please me. 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.710
 supported cinnamon 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.600
 Do you know those words of cinnamon mine? 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.220
 Mom talks to you right, right? 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.760
 It was going to speak in our mind that you 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.620
 can fuse bullet that horrible piece 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.620
 Then I 'm starting to like it 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:50.680
 We'll be fine here until it expires. 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.680
 to thicken slightly 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.450
 the gent hour is messing around a lot 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.630
 How do I know the point of the friendly? 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:38.600
 so it does not get dry and any type 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.419
 very watery then you know how I 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.990
 I know this when you're moving. 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:47.480
 and start to boil and can 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:51.020
 getting a little difficult for you to move 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:53.389
 and you can already rescue it, let it dry much 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.990
 milk because if not then you 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:59.479
 turn off the fire they err little today 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.960
 some of the milk is then it is always 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:05.660
 cool you leave a little like this 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:12.590
 more milk than rice is good 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:14.830
 so now I will add that the cream 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.830
 of milk 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.120
 and I'll keep on messing 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:41.720
 after you can mix a 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:44.240
 full cream on rice all 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.640
 can be turned off because the cream 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:51.460
 milk and can not boil 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.460
 Okay, so here I 've already mixed it up. 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:08.740
 so look and james turley full and 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:11.530
 I'm going to turn the fire off here and that's what 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:15.070
 I usually do nessie dot 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.870
 here as I still have not got them 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.170
 little things 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.390
 I always put here O there already is 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.550
 amount of each beginning can speak 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.040
 Our breakfast is very good and if you can it is too much. 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.230
 big but if you can not take it 

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.800
 I make you can put in the refrigerator 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.800
 new here 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:39.030
 How do you have a cap? 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.030
 put in the refrigerator again 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:49.870
 now I'll put a little bit of 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:55.320
 cinnamon on top for more 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:55.320
 beautiful also just to spruce 

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.480
