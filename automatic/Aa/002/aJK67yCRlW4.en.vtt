00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 endless class struggle between bk and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960
 consoles seems to have become integral 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.179
 part of the gaming community while the players 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.980
 tirelessly boast of a great graph to us 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.840
 more games opportunity 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.719
 upgrade while konsolschiki 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.090
 talk about optimizing exclusive games 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.410
 and in the general argument falls both 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.689
 parties but apparently 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.119
 this war does not last long 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.039
 No, this is not due to the fact that the console and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.529
 disappear somewhere they are not going anywhere 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 but will turn full-fledged for now and 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.099
 advances in this direction are already visible 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.200
 Now that board appeared 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.180
 applications and multitasking without console 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.760
 You can already surf the Internet to watch 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.620
 movies and much more is what 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.930
 the difference between p console we still 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.210
 there is however in the near future 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.160
 it will disappear and by the way I think that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.050
 consoles until it was originally necessary 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 shares what a computer is to give 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.680
 The answer to this question is quite simple. 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.629
 even from explanatory dictionaries this is what 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.309
 makes deductions and if in an explanatory 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.079
 Dictionary is still there to look there 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.359
 discover that the computer is electronic 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.340
 machine that stores and works with 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.619
 large amount of information that these 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.750
 do consoles yes they do all the same 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.880
 the most that such a console from the same 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.590
 dictionary is an electronic system which 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.450
 connects to the display for example by 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.180
 TV and used to run 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.799
 video games according to this definition 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.140
 consoles are designed to play 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.299
 games but see the game bake made for 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.189
 same kind of device 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.320
 are large plastic 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.880
 boxes that connect to the screen and 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.100
 let you play games as we see 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.229
 the difference between consoles and computers 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.240
 it was originally mildly misty 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.310
 fundamental differences between them and 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.710
 not at all one of the main arguments 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.880
 bakers is that the computer is not 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.829
 only valuable fur 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.500
 it's true on computers you can do 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.259
 all that is thought of before 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.759
 sole and main purpose 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.740
 video game consoles 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.630
 if so far it was possible to perform the most 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.579
 various concert tasks not 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.979
 it turned out to run anything else except 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.979
 your favorite game and it was home 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.200
 reason separating pc and console 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.229
 but it seems this disgrace comes 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.329
 end of this year at e3 2015 sony and 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.160
 microsoft made it clear they took 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.200
 course on console flexibility with 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.090
 which consoles will try to complete 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.770
 replace gamers while console gamers 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.300
 will be able to use their devices not 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.739
 only for video games but also for 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.670
 full surf on the Internet 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.040
 viewing civic but music reading 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.989
 weather news and even for 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.980
 video game pizza delivery no longer 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.470
 are the only reason 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.120
 the existence of console consoles too 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.220
 become flexible as a direct result 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.690
 course on multitasking console 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.519
 interface increasingly start 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.560
 remind while tires and desktops it 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.000
 especially evident in the example and xbox one 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.430
 You menus are actually already 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.380
 full desktop all applications 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.120
 have found their own market stored in 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.069
 subfolders that are stored in their 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.290
 queue in folders appeared to be bookmarks 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.790
 windows and more everything that we are used to 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.709
 see on computers can offer 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.720
 now and this console of course this 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.730
 unsurprisingly given aggressive 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.340
 microsoft intent to create a common 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.940
 system for all its devices including 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.160
 PC. 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.959
 However, sony who do not have such 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.209
 variety of devices and accordingly 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.430
 similar intentions are not far behind the t-shirts 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.319
 in the ps4 menu also appeared square 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.150
 windows and mouse cursor which 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.069
 controlled by touchpad 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.079
 controller but support full 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.060
 clavomyshy speaks for itself in this 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.889
 one's boxing plan only catches up with him 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.410
 direct competitor given the changes 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.519
 interface and appearance 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.500
 Multitasking future gamers for 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.389
 their net game consoles will be 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.130
 spend much less time playing 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.079
 video games and do more 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.810
 others the degree of difference between gaming 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.670
 consoles will be even less for this 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.440
 moment the only difference computer 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.049
 from the console there is the possibility of upgrade 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.579
 pk to improve performance but 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.650
 God knows how long it will be 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.510
 continue considering the trend 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.859
 which console before all spk is quite 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.380
 probably in the near future 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.720
 microsoft and sony will also offer 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.819
 official console hardwar upgrades 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.590
 for example in microsoft already allowed to 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.359
 stimulate their boxing or first and 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.040
 the only one at the moment official 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.720
 a custom controller i can with 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.389
 confidence to say that this is only 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.190
 the beginning is essentially from now on we have the console 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.410
 on which you can play video games and 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.819
 will run various applications and 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.950
 while on which you can run 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.989
 different boards to play video games 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.700
 now more than ever soon 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.220
 between consolers of dirty dogs 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.200
 reminiscent of the appearance of zebras black with 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.030
 white stripes or white with black 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.019
 stripes and really both kinds 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.210
 devices quite 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.069
 same job so what's the difference on 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.560
 what do you prefer to play 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:31.259
 the community can breathe a sigh of relief 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.280
 frantic console on computer free 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:34.280
 coming to the end
