00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.250 
that's how you measure your object so
I'm<00:02:21.010> literally<00:02:21.310> going<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.610> pull<00:02:21.849> up<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.989> part

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
I'm literally going to pull up the part

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.699 
I'm literally going to pull up the part
here<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.920> start<00:02:24.370> pulling<00:02:25.239> in<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:26.050> edge<00:02:26.200> here

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
here and start pulling in the edge here

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.430 
here and start pulling in the edge here
now<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.459> problem<00:02:27.849> I<00:02:27.970> have<00:02:28.239> is<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:29.230> need

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
now the problem I have is that you need

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.280 
now the problem I have is that you need
to<00:02:29.590> keep<00:02:29.769> pulling<00:02:30.099> the<00:02:30.700> top<00:02:30.940> up<00:02:31.200> what<00:02:32.200> you

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
to keep pulling the top up what you

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.900 
to keep pulling the top up what you
don't<00:02:32.470> want<00:02:32.650> to<00:02:32.709> be<00:02:32.890> doing<00:02:33.069> is<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.549> grabbing

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
don't want to be doing is just grabbing

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.420 
don't want to be doing is just grabbing
it<00:02:34.120> in<00:02:34.390> like<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.410> because<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.099> goes<00:02:36.220> all

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
it in like that because it goes all

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.789 
it in like that because it goes all
bulky<00:02:36.940> so<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> really<00:02:38.019> important<00:02:38.560> thing<00:02:38.769> is

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
bulky so the really important thing is

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.640 
bulky so the really important thing is
to<00:02:39.130> start<00:02:39.430> pulling<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.940> up<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.329> grabbing<00:02:41.230> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
to start pulling it up and grabbing the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.289 
to start pulling it up and grabbing the
tissue<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.340> cellophane<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.060> have

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
tissue in the cellophane so you have

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.000 
tissue in the cellophane so you have
some<00:02:43.510> tension<00:02:44.049> so<00:02:44.980> pull<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.280> up<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:46.420> grab<00:02:46.780> it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
some tension so pull it up and grab it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.270 
some tension so pull it up and grab it
in<00:02:48.010> with<00:02:48.250> your<00:02:48.430> hand<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.620> as<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:50.920> can<00:02:51.069> see

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
in with your hand and as you can see

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.130 
in with your hand and as you can see
little<00:02:51.459> bit<00:02:51.670> by<00:02:51.790> little<00:02:51.819> I'm<00:02:52.360> pulling<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.900> up

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
little bit by little I'm pulling it up

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:03.010 
little bit by little I'm pulling it up
and<00:02:53.680> grabbing<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.370> into<00:02:54.700> my<00:02:54.819> hand

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.330 

and<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.650> stopped<00:03:03.980> there<00:03:04.460> my<00:03:04.760> swap<00:03:05.180> hands<00:03:06.340> and

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
and I stopped there my swap hands and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.490 
and I stopped there my swap hands and
I'm<00:03:07.430> going<00:03:07.610> to<00:03:07.700> do<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.970> same<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.630> other<00:03:08.660> side

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.890 

so<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.590> stop<00:03:14.950> you<00:03:15.280> do<00:03:15.400> exactly<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.849> same<00:03:15.900> wrap

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
so you stop you do exactly the same wrap

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.470 
so you stop you do exactly the same wrap
your<00:03:17.049> hand

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
and just bring it up bit by bit it's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.540 
and just bring it up bit by bit it's
really<00:03:22.500> easy<00:03:22.650> when<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:22.980> know<00:03:23.010> how<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.370> just
