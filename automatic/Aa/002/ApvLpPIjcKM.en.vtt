silenced<00:00:10.640> weapon<00:00:11.270> systems<00:00:11.630> and<00:00:11.690> we're<00:00:11.840> taking

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
silenced weapon systems and we're taking

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.379 
silenced weapon systems and we're taking
a<00:00:12.110> look<00:00:12.260> at<00:00:12.380> their<00:00:12.500> barrels<00:00:12.830> here<00:00:13.040> and<00:00:13.280> I'm<00:00:14.270> a

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389 
a look at their barrels here and I'm a

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.360 
a look at their barrels here and I'm a
big<00:00:14.540> fan<00:00:14.719> of<00:00:14.750> their<00:00:14.990> barrels<00:00:15.320> they<00:00:16.160> make

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:16.370 
big fan of their barrels they make

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.390 
big fan of their barrels they make
really<00:00:17.240> affordable<00:00:17.720> barrels<00:00:18.110> and<00:00:18.400> it's

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
really affordable barrels and it's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.060 
really affordable barrels and it's
exactly<00:00:19.760> what<00:00:20.270> I<00:00:20.300> want<00:00:20.539> in<00:00:20.660> a<00:00:20.750> barrel<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:21.230> this

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
exactly what I want in a barrel and this

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.610 
exactly what I want in a barrel and this
this<00:00:22.580> barrel<00:00:22.970> here<00:00:23.300> is<00:00:24.850> nitrated<00:00:25.850> and<00:00:26.620> would

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.620 
this barrel here is nitrated and would

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.530 
this barrel here is nitrated and would
be<00:00:27.800> it<00:00:28.370> scrum<00:00:28.730> line<00:00:28.940> and<00:00:29.590> they<00:00:30.590> do<00:00:30.650> an<00:00:30.950> x-ray

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
be it scrum line and they do an x-ray

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.510 
be it scrum line and they do an x-ray
inspection<00:00:32.540> of<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:32.809> so<00:00:33.620> it's<00:00:33.800> all<00:00:34.219> good<00:00:34.399> to<00:00:34.489> go

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
inspection of it so it's all good to go

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.979 
inspection of it so it's all good to go
you<00:00:34.640> know<00:00:34.850> it's<00:00:34.969> going<00:00:35.059> to<00:00:35.120> be<00:00:35.210> a<00:00:35.300> good<00:00:35.660> barrel

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
you know it's going to be a good barrel

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.290 
you know it's going to be a good barrel
but<00:00:36.739> let's<00:00:37.160> talk<00:00:37.309> about<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.730> features<00:00:38.090> but

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
but let's talk about the features but

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.300 
but let's talk about the features but
then<00:00:38.570> I<00:00:38.660> look<00:00:38.870> for<00:00:38.900> in<00:00:39.380> a<00:00:39.530> barrel<00:00:39.920> for<00:00:40.160> your

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
then I look for in a barrel for your

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.370 
then I look for in a barrel for your
standard<00:00:40.760> rifle<00:00:41.180> not<00:00:41.360> for<00:00:41.630> like<00:00:41.780> a<00:00:41.810> precision

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
standard rifle not for like a precision

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.650 
standard rifle not for like a precision
gun<00:00:42.680> not<00:00:43.040> for<00:00:43.310> anything<00:00:44.030> not<00:00:44.390> that<00:00:44.540> these

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
gun not for anything not that these

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.960 
gun not for anything not that these
won't<00:00:44.870> be<00:00:44.960> precise<00:00:45.380> but<00:00:45.650> this<00:00:46.340> is<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:46.700> barrel

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
won't be precise but this is the barrel

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.870 
won't be precise but this is the barrel
that<00:00:47.000> I<00:00:47.150> would<00:00:47.360> put<00:00:47.570> in<00:00:47.690> 90%<00:00:48.650> of<00:00:49.040> they<00:00:49.340> are<00:00:49.370> that

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
that I would put in 90% of they are that

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.139 
that I would put in 90% of they are that
that<00:00:50.270> I<00:00:50.390> do<00:00:50.780> deal<00:00:51.260> with<00:00:51.550> first<00:00:52.550> of<00:00:52.700> all<00:00:52.820> you

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
that I do deal with first of all you

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.569 
that I do deal with first of all you
want<00:00:53.329> a<00:00:53.360> 16<00:00:53.660> inch<00:00:53.960> you<00:00:54.530> know<00:00:54.560> because<00:00:55.370> that's

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
want a 16 inch you know because that's

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.520 
want a 16 inch you know because that's
that's<00:00:56.300> going<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.570> be<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.989> shortest<00:00:57.290> that<00:00:57.440> you

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
that's going to be the shortest that you

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.660 
that's going to be the shortest that you
can<00:00:57.680> have<00:00:57.800> it<00:00:57.950> while<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:58.190> can<00:00:58.220> change<00:00:58.550> your

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
can have it while you can change your

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.670 
can have it while you can change your
muzzle<00:00:58.850> devices<00:00:59.239> without<00:01:00.110> pinning<00:01:00.590> and

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
muzzle devices without pinning and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.530 
muzzle devices without pinning and
welding<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.160> that's<00:01:01.340> something<00:01:01.730> that<00:01:01.880> that<00:01:02.090> I

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
welding and that's something that that I

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.819 
welding and that's something that that I
want<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:02.870> look<00:01:03.500> at<00:01:04.269> 14<00:01:05.269> 5s<00:01:05.600> are<00:01:05.689> fine<00:01:05.899> as<00:01:06.140> well

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
want to look at 14 5s are fine as well

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.740 
want to look at 14 5s are fine as well
if<00:01:07.340> that's<00:01:07.850> what<00:01:08.210> you're<00:01:08.360> into<00:01:08.570> there's

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
if that's what you're into there's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.980 
if that's what you're into there's
nothing<00:01:08.960> wrong<00:01:09.079> with<00:01:09.259> those<00:01:09.380> but<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:10.990> 16

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
nothing wrong with those but the 16

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.200 
nothing wrong with those but the 16
inches<00:01:12.290> is<00:01:12.530> most<00:01:12.830> advantageous<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:13.820> mean<00:01:14.120> I've

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
inches is most advantageous I mean I've

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.510 
inches is most advantageous I mean I've
seen<00:01:14.450> most<00:01:15.140> devices<00:01:15.710> blow<00:01:15.920> off<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.340> things

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
seen most devices blow off and things

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.149 
seen most devices blow off and things
like<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:18.170> 16<00:01:18.530> inch<00:01:18.680> affords<00:01:19.070> you

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
like that and so the 16 inch affords you

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.070 
like that and so the 16 inch affords you
that<00:01:19.340> ability<00:01:19.970> to<00:01:20.240> change<00:01:20.510> it<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:20.840> to<00:01:20.960> do

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
that ability to change it and to do

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.899 
that ability to change it and to do
those<00:01:21.260> things<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:21.710> to<00:01:21.979> fix<00:01:22.250> broken<00:01:22.490> ones<00:01:22.790> and

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
those things and to fix broken ones and

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:23.460 
those things and to fix broken ones and
things<00:01:23.030> like<00:01:23.119> that

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
things like that

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.719 
things like that
secondly<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:24.650> a<00:01:24.710> mid-length<00:01:25.040> gas<00:01:25.310> system

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
secondly it's a mid-length gas system

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.670 
secondly it's a mid-length gas system
which<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.299> I<00:01:26.510> would<00:01:26.869> never<00:01:27.110> recommend<00:01:27.470> a

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
which I I would never recommend a

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.859 
which I I would never recommend a
carbine<00:01:28.010> length<00:01:28.820> unless<00:01:29.330> you<00:01:29.479> have<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.659> really

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
carbine length unless you have a really

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.899 
carbine length unless you have a really
short<00:01:30.049> barrel<00:01:30.440> that's<00:01:31.340> pretty<00:01:31.610> much<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.880> only

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
short barrel that's pretty much the only

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.420 
short barrel that's pretty much the only
the<00:01:32.360> only<00:01:32.540> time<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.110> it's<00:01:33.590> out<00:01:33.830> of<00:01:33.860> necessity

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
the only time and it's out of necessity

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.990 
the only time and it's out of necessity
rather<00:01:34.460> than<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:35.299> desire<00:01:35.720> to<00:01:35.750> do<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:36.760> so<00:01:37.760> bid

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
rather than the desire to do so so bid

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.060 
rather than the desire to do so so bid
length<00:01:38.210> obviously<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.409> could<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.799> could<00:01:39.950> do

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
length obviously you could you could do

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.580 
length obviously you could you could do
a<00:01:40.100> rifle<00:01:40.520> length<00:01:40.670> on<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:40.939> longer<00:01:41.299> barrel<00:01:41.590> but

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
a rifle length on a longer barrel but

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.679 
a rifle length on a longer barrel but
that's<00:01:42.799> mid<00:01:43.640> like<00:01:43.820> this<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.360> recommended

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
that's mid like this is the recommended

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.010 
that's mid like this is the recommended
length<00:01:44.960> that<00:01:45.860> I<00:01:46.070> would<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.549> I<00:01:46.580> would<00:01:46.820> say<00:01:47.030> I

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
length that I would that I would say I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.499 
length that I would that I would say I
would<00:01:48.380> want<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:49.220> next<00:01:49.850> thing<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.090> I<00:01:50.240> really

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
would want the next thing that I really

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.690 
would want the next thing that I really
liked<00:01:50.689> about<00:01:50.780> these<00:01:51.080> is<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:51.979> is<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.310> medium

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
liked about these is it is a medium

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.320 
liked about these is it is a medium
contour<00:01:53.200> profile<00:01:54.200> throughout<00:01:54.890> here<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.400> that

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
contour profile throughout here and that

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.530 
contour profile throughout here and that
is<00:01:56.630> my<00:01:56.990> preferred<00:01:57.350> my<00:01:57.830> preferred<00:01:58.189> profile<00:01:58.759> for

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
is my preferred my preferred profile for

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.130 
is my preferred my preferred profile for
durability<00:02:00.380> for<00:02:01.009> length<00:02:01.250> of<00:02:01.430> wear<00:02:01.640> for<00:02:02.210> the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
durability for length of wear for the

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.510 
durability for length of wear for the
barrel<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.590> be<00:02:03.710> able<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.920> heat<00:02:04.100> up<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.310> little

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
barrel to be able to heat up a little

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.180 
barrel to be able to heat up a little
bit<00:02:04.610> more

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
bit more

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.719 
bit more
and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> pencil<00:02:06.360> barrel<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:08.490> not

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and then a pencil barrel now it's not

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.790 
and then a pencil barrel now it's not
absolutely<00:02:09.390> necessary<00:02:09.479> that's<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.410> me

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
absolutely necessary that's just me

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.680 
absolutely necessary that's just me
I<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.160> medium<00:02:11.610> contours<00:02:12.120> for<00:02:12.300> those<00:02:12.450> reasons

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
I like medium contours for those reasons

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.810 
I like medium contours for those reasons
but<00:02:13.620> there's<00:02:13.800> no<00:02:13.950> nothing<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.430> say<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.730> you

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
but there's no nothing to say that you

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.280 
but there's no nothing to say that you
can't<00:02:15.030> use<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.210> pencil<00:02:15.300> barrel<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.080> one

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
can't use a pencil barrel like this one

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.320 
can't use a pencil barrel like this one
which<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.040> also<00:02:17.190> from<00:02:17.490> them<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.120> same

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
which is also from them it's the same

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.110 
which is also from them it's the same
stats<00:02:18.680> except<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:19.830> a<00:02:19.890> thinner<00:02:20.100> barrel<00:02:20.460> it's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
stats except it's a thinner barrel it's

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.850 
stats except it's a thinner barrel it's
about<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.420> half<00:02:21.660> pound<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:22.050> lighter<00:02:22.290> which<00:02:22.560> if

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
about a half pound of lighter which if

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.990 
about a half pound of lighter which if
you're<00:02:22.980> looking<00:02:23.220> for<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.400> lightweight<00:02:23.580> build

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
you're looking for a lightweight build

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.880 
you're looking for a lightweight build
then<00:02:24.690> here<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.500> go

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you got a barrel right here from the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.780 
you got a barrel right here from the
same<00:02:27.720> guys<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.200> these<00:02:28.920> these<00:02:29.220> barrels<00:02:29.640> are

barrel as this one here except that it's

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.240 
barrel as this one here except that it's
mellow<00:02:42.120> night<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.650> that's<00:02:43.650> just<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.920> different

mellow night and that's just a different
style<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.700> coding<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.270> don't<00:02:45.660> have<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> whole<00:02:45.960> lot

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
style of coding I don't have a whole lot

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.290 
style of coding I don't have a whole lot
of<00:02:46.110> experience<00:02:46.380> with<00:02:46.740> Malinois<00:02:47.190> but<00:02:48.060> from

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
of experience with Malinois but from

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
check these check these barrels out

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.480 
check these check these barrels out
they're<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:59.070> great<00:02:59.370> price<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.000> they<00:03:00.900> are<00:03:01.490> are

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
they're a great price and they are are

everything that I look forward about I

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.660 
everything that I look forward about I
forgot<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.590> mention<00:03:04.710> these<00:03:05.040> are<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:05.430> in<00:03:05.520> eight

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
forgot to mention these are one in eight

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.520 
forgot to mention these are one in eight
twists<00:03:05.970> which<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.900> what<00:03:07.050> I'm<00:03:07.170> going<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.380> be

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
twists which is what I'm going to be

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.190 
twists which is what I'm going to be
looking<00:03:07.860> for<00:03:08.600> because<00:03:09.600> it's<00:03:09.900> going<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:10.080> be

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
looking for because it's going to be

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.960 
looking for because it's going to be
able<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.380> stabilize<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.160> moat<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.580> largest

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
able to stabilize the moat the largest

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.970 
able to stabilize the moat the largest
range<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.330> bullets<00:03:12.720> they<00:03:13.080> are<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.860> are

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
range of bullets they are that are

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.820 
range of bullets they are that are
commercially<00:03:14.580> produced<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.230> think<00:03:16.680> they're

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
commercially produced so I think they're

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.050 
commercially produced so I think they're
great<00:03:16.920> barrels<00:03:17.310> they<00:03:17.400> also<00:03:17.520> have<00:03:17.700> an<00:03:17.760> eleven

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
great barrels they also have an eleven

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.729 
great barrels they also have an eleven
and<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.209> half<00:03:18.239> but<00:03:18.720> they're<00:03:19.050> almost<00:03:19.230> always<00:03:19.470> out

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
and a half but they're almost always out

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.240 
and a half but they're almost always out
of<00:03:19.770> stock<00:03:20.870> because<00:03:21.870> they're<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:22.560> popular<00:03:22.590> so

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
of stock because they're so popular so

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.040 
of stock because they're so popular so
