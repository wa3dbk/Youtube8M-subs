00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:08.139 
in a very very hard engineering brick

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.449 
in a very very hard engineering brick
not<00:00:09.139> very<00:00:09.379> permeable<00:00:09.740> but<00:00:10.100> as<00:00:10.160> you<00:00:10.250> can<00:00:10.400> see

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:10.459 
not very permeable but as you can see

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.629 
not very permeable but as you can see
we've<00:00:10.879> got<00:00:10.910> a<00:00:11.059> little<00:00:11.209> bit<00:00:11.420> of<00:00:11.539> a<00:00:11.600> salt<00:00:11.809> band<00:00:12.639> so

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:13.639 
we've got a little bit of a salt band so

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.119 
we've got a little bit of a salt band so
you've<00:00:13.789> already<00:00:13.940> noticed<00:00:14.299> that<00:00:15.100> there<00:00:16.100> are

oh<00:01:03.989> yeah<00:01:04.589> nothing<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.729> higher<00:01:05.940> further<00:01:06.299> up<00:01:06.570> so

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
oh yeah nothing up higher further up so

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.280 
oh yeah nothing up higher further up so
I'm<00:01:08.190> just<00:01:08.250> trying<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.759> figure<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.690> why<00:01:09.990> we're

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
I'm just trying to figure out why we're

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.410 
I'm just trying to figure out why we're
why<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.950> don't<00:01:11.070> classing<00:01:11.550> it<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> big

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
why we don't classing it but the big

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.700 
why we don't classing it but the big
strange<00:01:12.720> thing<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.110> finding<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.590> is

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
strange thing I'm finding is is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.130 
strange thing I'm finding is is
brand-new<00:01:13.950> extension<00:01:14.759> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> rear<00:01:15.149> and<00:01:15.810> here

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
brand-new extension of the rear and here

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.570 
brand-new extension of the rear and here
we've<00:01:16.259> got<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.470> brand-new<00:01:16.740> extension<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.550> that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
we've got a brand-new extension and that

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.389 
we've got a brand-new extension and that
too<00:01:18.270> has<00:01:18.420> got<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.810> natural<00:01:19.649> dam<00:01:20.009> proofing

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
too has got this natural dam proofing

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.700 
too has got this natural dam proofing
system<00:01:20.640> installed<00:01:21.270> into<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.810> non-chemical<00:01:22.619> of

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
system installed into it non-chemical of

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.400 
system installed into it non-chemical of
course<00:01:23.240> probably<00:01:24.240> no<00:01:24.509> need<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.810> read<00:01:24.960> mustard

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
course probably no need to read mustard

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.200 
course probably no need to read mustard
or<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:26.100> Buster's<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> inside<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> new

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
or what Buster's on the inside a new

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.889 
or what Buster's on the inside a new
extension<00:01:27.960> Adorno<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.690> are

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
extension Adorno so there you are

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.889 
extension Adorno so there you are
it's<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.700> not<00:01:32.700> installed<00:01:33.060> by<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> chemical<00:01:33.600> dump

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
it's a not installed by a chemical dump

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.040 
it's a not installed by a chemical dump
roofer<00:01:34.940> not<00:01:35.940> installed<00:01:36.360> by<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> builder

probably installed by some specialist on
perhaps<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.110> architects<00:01:40.619> thought<00:01:40.830> they'd

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
perhaps the architects thought they'd

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.559 
perhaps the architects thought they'd
have<00:01:41.039> a<00:01:41.100> player<00:01:41.369> with<00:01:41.550> it<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:42.270> his<00:01:42.390> new

any of you've got any ideas I'd love to
know<00:01:47.840> what<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.080> system<00:01:49.289> is<00:01:49.530> doing<00:01:49.800> why<00:01:50.250> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
know what this system is doing why it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.240 
know what this system is doing why it
was<00:01:50.520> installed<00:01:51.229> what's<00:01:52.229> its<00:01:52.409> purpose<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:53.039> life

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
was installed what's its purpose in life

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.270 
was installed what's its purpose in life
is<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.819> how<00:01:54.300> all<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.099> materials<00:01:56.099> and
