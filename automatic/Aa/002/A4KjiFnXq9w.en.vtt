hold<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.080> think<00:02:03.410> he<00:02:03.530> might<00:02:03.800> have<00:02:03.830> a

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
hold it I think he might have a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.490 
hold it I think he might have a
chocolate<00:02:04.450> about<00:02:05.450> them<00:02:05.600> so<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.170> best<00:02:06.320> way<00:02:06.470> for

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500

and not going up there he's getting

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.150 
and not going up there he's getting
himself<00:02:11.810> caught<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.410> he's<00:02:12.500> gonna<00:02:12.710> go<00:02:12.890> down<00:02:13.130> a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160

out he's tried to count again I think

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.480 
out he's tried to count again I think
this<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.060> very<00:02:17.360> clever<00:02:18.020> move<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:18.650> oh<00:02:18.980> my<00:02:19.280> gosh

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
this is very clever move but oh my gosh

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.250 
this is very clever move but oh my gosh
just<00:02:19.700> too<00:02:19.850> late<00:02:20.060> waste<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.510> his<00:02:20.630> life<00:02:20.870> so

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
just too late waste of his life so

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.290 
just too late waste of his life so
anyway<00:02:21.590> four<00:02:22.100> games<00:02:22.370> 12<00:02:22.610> nothing<00:02:22.940> nothing's

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
anyway four games 12 nothing nothing's

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.940 
anyway four games 12 nothing nothing's
gonna<00:02:23.450> spawn<00:02:23.690> just<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:24.110> more<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.770> think

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
gonna spawn just one more and I think

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.290 
gonna spawn just one more and I think
it's<00:02:25.070> going<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.280> be<00:02:25.370> very<00:02:25.490> close<00:02:25.760> right<00:02:25.970> now<00:02:26.000> so

is<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.840> part<00:02:42.110> of<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.350> eight<00:02:42.530> my<00:02:42.770> core<00:02:43.070> is<00:02:43.520> that

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
is the part of the eight my core is that

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.730

little<00:02:43.880> pocket<00:02:44.090> in<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.450> bar<00:02:44.630> but<00:02:44.780> anyway<00:02:45.590> this

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
little pocket in the bar but anyway this

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.260 
little pocket in the bar but anyway this
is<00:02:45.800> a<00:02:45.950> fit<00:02:46.280> for<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.640> dragon<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.000> think<00:02:47.180> he's

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
is a fit for the dragon I think he's

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.060 
is a fit for the dragon I think he's
doing<00:02:47.450> pretty<00:02:47.510> well<00:02:47.750> what<00:02:48.320> he's<00:02:48.830> getting

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
doing pretty well what he's getting

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.190 
doing pretty well what he's getting
himself<00:02:49.220> cornered<00:02:50.060> which<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.390> a<00:02:50.420> very<00:02:50.750> stupid

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
himself cornered which is a very stupid

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.560 
himself cornered which is a very stupid
I<00:02:51.470> have<00:02:51.620> no<00:02:51.769> idea<00:02:51.950> why<00:02:52.220> they<00:02:52.400> do<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:52.760> but<00:02:52.970> I

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
I have no idea why they do this but I

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.390 
I have no idea why they do this but I
think<00:02:53.780> he<00:02:54.140> really<00:02:54.170> could<00:02:54.500> about<00:02:54.709> full<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.070> them

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
think he really could about full of them

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.740 
think he really could about full of them
it<00:02:55.550> was<00:02:55.670> probably<00:02:55.970> about<00:02:56.060> seven<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:56.660> you

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
it was probably about seven so you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.270 
it was probably about seven so you
couldn't<00:02:56.989> really<00:02:57.110> before<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.920> it's<00:02:58.130> about

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
couldn't really before and it's about

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.490 
couldn't really before and it's about
three<00:02:58.550> left<00:02:58.820> so<00:02:59.060> he's<00:02:59.269> in<00:02:59.420> pretty<00:02:59.750> well<00:03:00.019> most

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
three left so he's in pretty well most

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.800 
three left so he's in pretty well most
of<00:03:00.680> these<00:03:00.830> hells<00:03:01.130> are<00:03:01.370> very<00:03:01.970> low<00:03:02.239> anyway<00:03:02.630> look
