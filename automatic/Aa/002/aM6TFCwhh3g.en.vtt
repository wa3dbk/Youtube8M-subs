I've<00:00:58.020> taken<00:00:58.289> my<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.840> I<00:01:00.840> traced<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.590> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
I've taken my can and I traced out a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.030 
I've taken my can and I traced out a
circle<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.399> paper<00:01:03.379> around<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> outside<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
circle of paper around the outside of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.920 
circle of paper around the outside of
the<00:01:05.129> can<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> trimmed<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.780> that

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the can and then I trimmed it so that

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.700 
the can and then I trimmed it so that
would<00:01:07.080> fit<00:01:07.439> inside<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:09.150> lid<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.840> then

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
would fit inside the lid of the can then

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.280 
would fit inside the lid of the can then
I<00:01:10.740> folded<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.570> because<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.810> thing<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
I folded it up because the thing is is

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.580 
I folded it up because the thing is is
you<00:01:13.320> want<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.400> centered<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.110> folded

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
you want this to be centered so I folded

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.620 
you want this to be centered so I folded
it<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.830> into<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.159> little<00:01:17.220> cone<00:01:18.830> and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.540> put<00:01:21.540> it

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it up into a little cone and then put it

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.580 
it up into a little cone and then put it
back<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.830> gives<00:01:22.860> us<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.900> set<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
back in and that gives us the set and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.399 
back in and that gives us the set and
that<00:01:25.920> center<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.640> paper<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.150> right<00:01:27.479> there

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
that center of the paper is right there

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.109 
that center of the paper is right there
which<00:01:28.860> will<00:01:29.100> technically<00:01:29.579> give<00:01:29.820> us<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
which will technically give us the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.370 
which will technically give us the
center<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> I've<00:01:32.700> got<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:34.110> drill

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
center of the can so I've got the drill

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.440 
center of the can so I've got the drill
here<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.979> I've<00:01:35.159> put<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> paper<00:01:35.670> inside<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
here and I've put the paper inside the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.660 
here and I've put the paper inside the
center<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.560> am<00:01:37.829> just<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
center of the can and I am just going to

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.090 
center of the can and I am just going to
drill<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.659> hole<00:01:42.259> in<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.439> center<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> can

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
drill a hole in the center of the can

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.999 
drill a hole in the center of the can
now<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:45.630> want<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:48.329> hole<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:49.590> big<00:01:49.890> enough

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
now we want the hole to be big enough

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.749 
now we want the hole to be big enough
for<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.399> coat<00:01:50.640> hanger<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.970> fit<00:01:51.240> through<00:01:52.759> so

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
for that coat hanger to fit through so

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.580 
for that coat hanger to fit through so
it<00:01:53.880> doesn't<00:01:54.210> matter<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:54.990> it's<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
it doesn't matter if you if the it's a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.789 
it doesn't matter if you if the it's a
little<00:01:55.829> bit<00:01:55.979> bigger<00:02:03.290> I'll<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.409> make<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.619> a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
little bit bigger I'll just make it a

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.709 
little bit bigger I'll just make it a
little<00:02:04.920> bit<00:02:05.159> bigger<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:06.090> doesn't<00:02:06.149> really

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
little bit bigger it doesn't really

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.320 
little bit bigger it doesn't really
matter<00:02:07.049> how<00:02:07.380> big<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.340> hole<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:09.090> long<00:02:09.270> as

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
matter how big the hole is as long as

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.120 
matter how big the hole is as long as
it's<00:02:09.629> bigger<00:02:09.869> than<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> coat<00:02:10.379> hanger

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
it's bigger than the coat hanger

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.900 
it's bigger than the coat hanger

said may seem like a lot of hoopla for a
mousetrap<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.510> they<00:02:18.660> are<00:02:18.780> driving<00:02:19.110> me

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
out of the wall that's a much better

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.100 
out of the wall that's a much better

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
the hole bigger is so the can will spin

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.190 
the hole bigger is so the can will spin
now

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
now

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.390 
now
we're<00:02:34.800> gonna<00:02:34.890> take<00:02:35.130> our<00:02:35.280> bucket<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.780> just

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
above the hole where the handle goes in

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:48.830 
above the hole where the handle goes in
I'm<00:02:41.220> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.820> make<00:02:41.940> another<00:02:42.180> hole<00:02:42.480> and<00:02:47.840> this

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
I'm going to make another hole and this

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.200 
I'm going to make another hole and this
hole<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.320> don't<00:02:49.560> want<00:02:49.800> too<00:02:50.100> big<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.940> want<00:02:51.120> to

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
hole you don't want too big you want to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.930 
hole you don't want too big you want to
be<00:02:51.300> able<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.570> fit<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.990> coat<00:02:52.200> hanger<00:02:52.350> through

be able to fit the coat hanger through

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.160 
be able to fit the coat hanger through
so<00:02:53.940> let's<00:02:54.120> see<00:02:54.270> if<00:02:54.360> our<00:02:54.420> coat<00:02:54.630> hanger

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170

so let's see if our coat hanger
goes<00:02:55.500> through<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:56.010> hole<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:58.260> so<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.220> does

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
goes through that hole and so it does

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.750 
goes through that hole and so it does
and<00:02:59.670> we<00:02:59.820> also<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:01.620> reason<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.070> put<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.550> hole

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
and we also the reason I put the hole

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.000 
and we also the reason I put the hole
where<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.660> we<00:03:03.840> want<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.350> top<00:03:04.770> of<00:03:04.950> the

where I have is we want the top of the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.920 
where I have is we want the top of the
can<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.250> be<00:03:05.490> just<00:03:05.880> above<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.390> edge<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
can to be just above the edge of the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.710 
can to be just above the edge of the
bucket<00:03:07.250> but<00:03:08.250> not<00:03:08.580> quite<00:03:08.850> level<00:03:09.060> we<00:03:09.270> don't<00:03:09.510> want
