 he 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.960
 The stool is not again meeting the new bass life 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.920
 What else did you say today? 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.920
 Kenzo looks forward to it 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.380
 In the posture 5 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 de 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.280
 I have to be built 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:40.460
 Nice to meet you, coffee room 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.399
 Yes, next to the smell wheel using 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.160
 This guy does not know Ame. 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.190
 What is filtered out and others 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.190
 Ah 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.200
 U 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.250
 Yes, I do not know why I did not see my cock , but when I heard this, 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.400
 It's 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:09.740
 So ying and usually now 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:14.960
 If you are not hypnotized, you may have rested your drum for a long time 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:20.259
 When faith comes in and we do that day 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.259
 I do not know why Breech Protection is awkward to go 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.140
 And I can not learn from him. 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.990
 Yes, it's stable. 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.780
 I think so to watch out for sugar 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.060
 I can not because I 've been writing prostitutes all these days. 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.060
 Through cyberspace . 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.789
 What President 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.259
 I think will be able to hit the hills a little easier than it is now state of the drum 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.860
 I have a status. 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.009
 If you can not make it easy for you to relax . 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:12.410
 I'm supposed to replace the target constantly . 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:15.110
 It is not so hard to be constant now about this sight . 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.340
 Take a rest when you become 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.340
 Now there's a difference. 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:30.140
 So the number of students below 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.770
 If you have a big problem, you can see that there are two problems. 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:39.680
 It's so high that I ask for 9. 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:43.070
 Because of the difference in energy, the energy dog ​​seems to be overtaking like Sanel 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.400
 That feeling of being Waking Waking is forced to occur 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.400
 By the way 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:57.709
 I'm myself a little river at the bottom you have a game one year 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:03:01.850
 Especially now hasineunde earlier now doing what you need to do the same beauty pd 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.790
 One of the reasons why I feel uncomfortable is 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.330
 It should produce a motion 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.330
 This dandruff 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.489
 Call me home. 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.610
 When you squeeze 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:25.860
 Doegeodeunyo as one poison haneunge not too bad, as one talking from one east 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:29.790
 Now it 's like a repeating loop and you have to wheel it in this distribution. 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:33.270
 Oh, I feel something uneasy . But ballad 4 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.720
 Is it tempo slow and a lot of it? 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.780
 Gotta have a fast tempo, the 2nd throw shit because I'm better with the 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.800
 Then Annie rattling pilhi 2 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:48.870
 I have to go, and sometimes I become unstable . 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.870
 I see coming aboard figuring kilns 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:01.230
 Emotion It 's a little less flexible 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.230
 Make a lot of good things like strokes . 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.240
 Environment Keyword 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.950
 Now That I'm gone future 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.950
 So, one of the things you have to practice 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.770
 What a feeling Jeju did. 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:30.310
 Talisman left or what this motion than one which turns so hey sl 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:36.100
 If you just think of it as a gig and think it is much better than now 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.100
 It feels light and not heavy. 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.210
 Now if you feel like you're using a lot of 0 arm. 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.350
 Also, 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.920
 Concept turn turn point 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:02.450
 The first mother dollars inde unbalanced gospel that's of course what Bo Sean Huh diagnosis 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:07.130
 But when I grew up, the motion gave me the door, 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:09.700
 When the idea is to move the motion speed salgetda bond is then geuchyeoteul 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.700
 It's the same. 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.830

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.530
