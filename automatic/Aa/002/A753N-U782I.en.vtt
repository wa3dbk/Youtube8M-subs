00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
and new a shield technology also known

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.029 
and new a shield technology also known
as<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.630> games<00:00:16.049> console<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:16.830> mentioned

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
as the games console that we mentioned

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.480 
as the games console that we mentioned
just<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.730> couple<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.060> days<00:00:18.240> ago<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.859> shield

just a couple of days ago so shield

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.640 
just a couple of days ago so shield
hasn't<00:00:20.939> been<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.150> most<00:00:21.270> popular<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.020> devices

hasn't been the most popular of devices

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.370 
hasn't been the most popular of devices
and<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.880> fair<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> say<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.359> Nvidia<00:00:24.990> may

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
and think is fair to say that Nvidia may

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.519 
and think is fair to say that Nvidia may
be<00:00:25.640> overestimated<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.849> how<00:00:27.230> crazy<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
be overestimated just how crazy the

asked are working on the device and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.229

known as the shield tablet so what

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.130 
known as the shield tablet so what
exactly<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:50.190> specs<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.059> exactly<00:00:51.629> is

going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> purpose<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> shield

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
going to be the purpose as the shield

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.479 
going to be the purpose as the shield
tablet<00:00:53.730> well<00:00:54.469> it's<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.949> parent<00:00:56.250> there<00:00:56.309> going<00:00:56.460> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
tablet well it's a parent there going to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.910 
tablet well it's a parent there going to
be<00:00:56.550> an<00:00:56.730> 8-inch<00:00:57.239> device<00:00:57.780> which<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.530> fairly

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
be an 8-inch device which is fairly

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.590 
be an 8-inch device which is fairly
reasonable<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> tablet<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.359> it's<00:01:00.510> going

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
reasonable for a tablet and it's going

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.920 
reasonable for a tablet and it's going
to<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.780> 1920<00:01:01.649> x<00:01:01.859> 1200<00:01:02.760> resolution<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to be 1920 x 1200 resolution which is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.250 
to be 1920 x 1200 resolution which is
semi<00:01:04.769> curious<00:01:05.280> i<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:06.150> most<00:01:06.390> people<00:01:06.900> expect

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
great if you're

gigabyte<00:02:20.700> model<00:02:20.880> then<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.840> get<00:02:22.080> an<00:02:22.230> LTE<00:02:22.710> modem

on<00:02:23.580> board<00:02:23.880> now<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:25.350> one<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.680> course<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.950> going

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100

to<00:02:26.160> be<00:02:26.280> one<00:02:26.490> hundred<00:02:26.640> dollars<00:02:27.060> more<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:27.690> it's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
to be one hundred dollars more so it's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.160 
to be one hundred dollars more so it's
definitely<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.590> bit<00:02:28.800> of<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.950> price<00:02:29.280> premium

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170

not the biggest in the world but it's

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160 
not the biggest in the world but it's
not<00:03:17.430> too<00:03:17.670> bad<00:03:17.880> really<00:03:18.239> to<00:03:18.570> be<00:03:18.660> honest<00:03:18.959> there<00:03:19.140> is

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
not too bad really to be honest there is

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.160 
not too bad really to be honest there is
as<00:03:19.470> well<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.680> back<00:03:20.070> camera<00:03:20.670> with<00:03:20.850> this

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
as well a back camera with this

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.560 
as well a back camera with this
theoretically<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.590> output<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.220> 4k<00:03:23.730> and

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
theoretically it can output to 4k and

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.690 
theoretically it can output to 4k and
will<00:03:25.260> indeed<00:03:25.770> feature<00:03:26.130> things<00:03:26.489> such<00:03:26.670> as

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
will indeed feature things such as

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.790 
will indeed feature things such as
shadow<00:03:27.120> play<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.930> all<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.290> other<00:03:28.410> bits<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
shadow play and all the other bits and

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
shadow play and all the other bits and
pieces<00:03:29.100> you'd<00:03:29.280> expect<00:03:29.760> from<00:03:29.880> Nvidia<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:32.040> one

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
pieces you'd expect from Nvidia so one

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.850 
pieces you'd expect from Nvidia so one
can<00:03:33.090> argue<00:03:33.120> what<00:03:33.840> exactly<00:03:34.050> is<00:03:34.410> going<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.739> be

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
can argue what exactly is going to be

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.190 
can argue what exactly is going to be
the<00:03:34.950> purpose<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.700> well<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.330> can<00:03:36.900> see<00:03:37.110> it

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
the purpose of this well I can see it

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.930 
the purpose of this well I can see it
really<00:03:37.470> having<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:37.980> Civil<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.550> different

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
really having the Civil of different

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.420 
really having the Civil of different
advantages<00:03:39.239> one<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.440> main<00:03:40.709> ones<00:03:40.739> that's

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
advantages one of the main ones that's

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.660 
advantages one of the main ones that's
pretty<00:03:42.000> obvious<00:03:42.180> right<00:03:42.480> now<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.260> k1<00:03:43.769> just

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
pretty obvious right now is the k1 just

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.900 
pretty obvious right now is the k1 just
like<00:03:45.660> say<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.920> Titan<00:03:47.430> does<00:03:48.269> support<00:03:49.519> dx12<00:03:50.519> it

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
like say the Titan does support dx12 it

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.180 
like say the Titan does support dx12 it
does<00:03:51.120> support<00:03:51.300> tessellation<00:03:52.110> coo<00:03:52.410> 2<00:03:52.560> sixes<00:03:52.980> on

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
does support tessellation coo 2 sixes on

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.600 
does support tessellation coo 2 sixes on
but<00:03:53.790> while<00:03:54.720> it's<00:03:55.110> very<00:03:55.290> exciting<00:03:55.830> to<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:56.489> know

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
but while it's very exciting to you know

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.550 
but while it's very exciting to you know
go<00:03:57.360> through<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.690> feature<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:58.019> this<00:03:58.080> they<00:03:58.290> can

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
go through the feature of this they can

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.290 
go through the feature of this they can
support<00:03:58.739> obviously<00:03:59.550> it<00:03:59.730> doesn't<00:03:59.910> have<00:04:00.150> to

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
support obviously it doesn't have to

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.920 
support obviously it doesn't have to
quite<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.690> performance<00:04:01.230> level<00:04:01.470> there<00:04:01.860> too

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
quite the performance level there too

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.960 
quite the performance level there too
well<00:04:03.930> kick<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:04.530> into<00:04:04.650> such<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.010> high<00:04:05.340> gear<00:04:05.700> but

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
well kick it into such a high gear but

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.550 
well kick it into such a high gear but
it<00:04:06.060> will<00:04:06.300> be<00:04:06.330> very<00:04:06.660> powerful<00:04:06.900> for<00:04:07.350> a<00:04:07.380> mobile

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
it will be very powerful for a mobile

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.530 
it will be very powerful for a mobile
device<00:04:08.070> in<00:04:08.280> terms<00:04:08.459> of<00:04:08.550> all<00:04:08.760> gflops<00:04:09.120> as<00:04:09.420> I've

mentioned<00:04:09.570> previously<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.769> is<00:04:11.250> around<00:04:11.670> an

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
mentioned previously it is around an

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.630 
mentioned previously it is around an
xbox<00:04:12.330> 360<00:04:13.050> there<00:04:13.410> is<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> decent<00:04:14.100> amount<00:04:14.280> of

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
xbox 360 there is a decent amount of

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.849 
xbox 360 there is a decent amount of
memory<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.480> board<00:04:15.720> as<00:04:15.870> well<00:04:16.080> obviously<00:04:16.500> we're

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
memory on board as well obviously we're

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.949 
memory on board as well obviously we're
not<00:04:16.950> quite<00:04:17.190> sure<00:04:17.220> how<00:04:17.430> light<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.359> OS<00:04:18.630> is<00:04:18.660> going

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
not quite sure how light the OS is going

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.259 
not quite sure how light the OS is going
to<00:04:19.019> be<00:04:19.200> rumors<00:04:20.010> have<00:04:20.250> it<00:04:20.280> it's<00:04:20.880> going<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.180> be

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
to be rumors have it it's going to be

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.630 
to be rumors have it it's going to be
some<00:04:21.539> variant<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.440> android<00:04:22.890> OS<00:04:23.039> but<00:04:23.430> we're

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
some variant of the android OS but we're

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.790 
some variant of the android OS but we're
not<00:04:23.760> exactly<00:04:23.910> sure<00:04:24.210> which<00:04:24.630> variant<00:04:25.470> on<00:04:25.620> which

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
not exactly sure which variant on which

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.960 
not exactly sure which variant on which
version<00:04:25.830> and

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
version and

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.210 
version and
so<00:04:27.060> on<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.570> so<00:04:27.600> forth<00:04:27.810> however<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:28.860> looking

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
so on and so forth however it's looking

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.770 
so on and so forth however it's looking
to<00:04:29.250> be<00:04:29.400> kind<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:30.030> shining<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:33.240> question<00:04:33.690> is

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
to be kind of shining so the question is

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.280 
to be kind of shining so the question is
are<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.110> gonna<00:04:34.380> buy<00:04:34.650> it<00:04:34.730> well<00:04:35.730> it<00:04:36.450> can<00:04:37.080> work

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
are you gonna buy it well it can work

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.680 
are you gonna buy it well it can work
out<00:04:37.530> pretty<00:04:37.740> expensive<00:04:38.190> for<00:04:39.000> example<00:04:39.420> if<00:04:39.540> you

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
out pretty expensive for example if you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.350 
out pretty expensive for example if you
wanted<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.080> buy<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.800> full<00:04:41.160> 32<00:04:41.730> gigabyte<00:04:42.150> model

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
wanted to buy the full 32 gigabyte model

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.320 
wanted to buy the full 32 gigabyte model
which<00:04:43.140> is<00:04:43.170> four<00:04:43.770> hundred<00:04:44.100> dollars<00:04:44.130> plus<00:04:45.120> the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
which is four hundred dollars plus the

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.320 
which is four hundred dollars plus the
controller<00:04:45.720> sixty<00:04:46.560> dollars<00:04:46.890> plus<00:04:47.610> as<00:04:47.940> well

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
controller sixty dollars plus as well

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.790 
controller sixty dollars plus as well
you<00:04:48.600> can<00:04:48.630> get<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.990> shield<00:04:49.230> cover<00:04:49.590> which

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
you can get the shield cover which

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.830 
you can get the shield cover which
basically<00:04:50.190> allows<00:04:50.370> you<00:04:50.760> to<00:04:50.970> pretty<00:04:51.270> much<00:04:51.450> prop

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
basically allows you to pretty much prop

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.400 
basically allows you to pretty much prop
it<00:04:51.990> up<00:04:52.610> you're<00:04:53.610> going<00:04:53.730> to<00:04:53.790> be<00:04:53.850> looking<00:04:54.000> at<00:04:54.630> well

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
it up you're going to be looking at well

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.320 
it up you're going to be looking at well
around<00:04:55.800> five<00:04:56.100> hundred<00:04:56.460> US<00:04:56.580> dollars<00:04:57.090> flat

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
around five hundred US dollars flat

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.100 
around five hundred US dollars flat
which<00:04:57.840> is<00:04:58.590> pretty<00:04:59.430> expensive<00:05:00.060> when<00:05:00.750> you<00:05:00.870> think

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
which is pretty expensive when you think

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.540 
which is pretty expensive when you think
about<00:05:01.200> it<00:05:01.380> I<00:05:01.680> mean<00:05:01.890> you<00:05:02.010> could<00:05:02.100> definitely<00:05:02.280> buy

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
about it I mean you could definitely buy

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.840 
about it I mean you could definitely buy
cheaper<00:05:03.000> tablets<00:05:03.180> on<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:04.320> other<00:05:04.590> hand<00:05:04.860> this

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
cheaper tablets on the other hand this

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.660 
cheaper tablets on the other hand this
sucker<00:05:06.210> up<00:05:06.390> is<00:05:06.660> obviously<00:05:07.320> primarily<00:05:08.160> focused

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
sucker up is obviously primarily focused

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.120 
sucker up is obviously primarily focused
on<00:05:08.760> gaming<00:05:09.090> so<00:05:09.930> there<00:05:10.320> are<00:05:10.590> definitely<00:05:10.800> going

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
on gaming so there are definitely going

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.860 
on gaming so there are definitely going
to<00:05:11.220> be<00:05:11.310> those<00:05:11.490> who<00:05:11.520> wanted<00:05:11.970> by<00:05:12.210> it<00:05:12.270> obviously

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
to be those who wanted by it obviously

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.660 
to be those who wanted by it obviously
as<00:05:12.930> well<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.260> does<00:05:13.410> have<00:05:13.590> a<00:05:13.620> benefits<00:05:14.220> such<00:05:14.640> as

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
as well it does have a benefits such as

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.730 
as well it does have a benefits such as
being<00:05:15.180> able<00:05:15.390> to<00:05:15.480> stream<00:05:15.960> directly<00:05:16.290> to<00:05:16.620> the

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
being able to stream directly to the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:23.120 
being able to stream directly to the
device<00:05:18.169> it<00:05:19.169> sounds<00:05:19.680> cool<00:05:21.530> personally<00:05:22.530> I<00:05:22.740> would

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
device it sounds cool personally I would

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.860 
device it sounds cool personally I would
have<00:05:23.220> liked<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.640> have<00:05:23.669> seen<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.240> slightly<00:05:24.630> more

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
have liked to have seen a slightly more

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.710 
have liked to have seen a slightly more
powerful<00:05:25.440> k<00:05:25.650> one<00:05:25.890> or<00:05:26.130> another<00:05:26.550> version<00:05:27.330> of<00:05:27.630> the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
powerful k one or another version of the

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.130 
powerful k one or another version of the
k1<00:05:28.520> but<00:05:29.520> I<00:05:29.910> guess<00:05:30.480> we're<00:05:30.660> just<00:05:30.690> going<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.050> have

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
k1 but I guess we're just going to have

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.620 
k1 but I guess we're just going to have
to<00:05:31.200> see<00:05:31.440> what<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.740> benchmarks<00:05:32.370> say<00:05:32.700> obviously

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
to see what the benchmarks say obviously

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.320 
to see what the benchmarks say obviously
right<00:05:34.169> now<00:05:34.230> nvidia<00:05:34.800> are<00:05:35.040> leasing<00:05:35.880> a<00:05:36.000> cup<00:05:36.300> of

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
right now nvidia are leasing a cup of

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.290 
right now nvidia are leasing a cup of
benchmarks<00:05:37.260> which<00:05:37.669> put<00:05:38.669> it<00:05:38.790> to<00:05:38.910> be<00:05:39.030> pretty

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
benchmarks which put it to be pretty

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
benchmarks which put it to be pretty
high<00:05:39.919> but<00:05:40.919> then<00:05:41.640> again<00:05:41.850> it's<00:05:42.479> competing

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
high but then again it's competing

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.520 
high but then again it's competing
against<00:05:43.860> things<00:05:44.040> such<00:05:44.250> as<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.610> ipad<00:05:45.030> air<00:05:45.530> and

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
against things such as the ipad air and

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.700 
against things such as the ipad air and
it's<00:05:47.160> also<00:05:47.790> very<00:05:48.300> difficult<00:05:48.930> because<00:05:49.169> it's

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
it's also very difficult because it's

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.469 
it's also very difficult because it's
not<00:05:50.070> really<00:05:50.460> games<00:05:50.760> they're<00:05:51.120> just<00:05:51.300> things

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:51.479 
not really games they're just things

but<00:06:18.780> that<00:06:20.030> synthetic<00:06:21.030> benches<00:06:21.750> aren't

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
but that synthetic benches aren't

necessarily<00:06:22.620> indicative<00:06:23.160> of<00:06:23.729> what<00:06:24.180> you're

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
going to see in a game so I figure the

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.790 
going to see in a game so I figure the
best<00:06:28.140> option<00:06:28.620> here<00:06:28.860> is<00:06:29.040> to<00:06:29.520> just<00:06:29.700> wait<00:06:30.800> another

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
best option here is to just wait another

best option here is to just wait another

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:53.489 
traditional bluetooth so this is pretty

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:57.350 
traditional bluetooth so this is pretty
nice<00:06:53.759> but<00:06:54.649> obviously<00:06:55.649> very<00:06:56.129> early<00:06:56.580> on<00:06:56.610> yet<00:06:56.999> so

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 
nice but obviously very early on yet so

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.019 
nice but obviously very early on yet so
i<00:06:57.389> just<00:06:57.659> we're<00:06:57.869> gonna<00:06:58.050> have<00:06:58.349> to<00:06:58.589> kind<00:06:59.129> of<00:06:59.189> wait

00:07:00.019 --> 00:07:00.029 
i just we're gonna have to kind of wait

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:04.159 
i just we're gonna have to kind of wait
and<00:07:00.419> see<00:07:00.689> how<00:07:01.019> everything<00:07:02.300> plays<00:07:03.300> out<00:07:03.539> anyway

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:04.169 
and see how everything plays out anyway

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:05.359 
and see how everything plays out anyway
hopefully<00:07:04.619> they've<00:07:04.709> enjoyed<00:07:04.889> the<00:07:05.009> video<00:07:05.189> I'll
