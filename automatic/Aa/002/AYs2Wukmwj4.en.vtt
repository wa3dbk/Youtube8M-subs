00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.030
 present provable luminaires 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.180
 leds 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.760
 we have two models the model of 14 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.290
 watts 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:18.240
 which has 40 LEDs the largest model 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.770
 24 watts 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.770
 that has 50 l 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.470
 we open the box 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.330
 we have the brochure 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.520
 we have the luminaire the luminaire comes 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.770
 with an electronic ballast to be able 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.770
 connect directly to 220 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.510
 with the cables 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.510
 but our model 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.310
 It does not matter 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.310
 but more 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.960
 this payroll already has a screen 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.119
 plastic 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.210
 what is good for lighting up 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.000
 uniform 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.060
 the luminaires are decorative and high 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.720
 luminosity are ideal to be used 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.200
 in buildings halls fort and and others 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.400
 places 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.560
 and it is for indoor use 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.190
 and now I'm going to tell you how in 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.190
 installation 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.369
 this plate of some simulates 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.729
 what would be a roof or a surface to 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.729
 install 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.409
 This hole makes it like a wick 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.190
 110 mm cup 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.470
 once the hole is made 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:07.920
 one passes from the other one passes from the other side 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.920
 the expense 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.510
 and the luminaire has a strong two 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.510
 springs that work from the other side 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.530
 I would have already mounted the luminaire and 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.530
 the other side would be the ballast 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.870
 the connection the circuit of the presentation 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.870
 the lighting circuit 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.310
 I hope you have enjoyed life 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:08.349
 remember to visit w9 w if kalex 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.349
