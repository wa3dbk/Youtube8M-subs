00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.320
 use to make this design is going to be 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:16.170
 one glaze rosita one green and the brightness 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.090
 final and this enamel 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.720
 because good let's start with the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.720
 yellow color 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.660
 let's start by painting half of the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.619
 a 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.619
 diagonally 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:44.100
 ok and we hope to grow and now with 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.200
 pink color let's paint 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.460
 the part that was left 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.460
 in the same way 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.320
 thus 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.920
 let's remove what we have 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:22.180
 stained and we wait for it to dry 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.120
 good and we are going to do with this color a 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.260
 diagonal 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.260
 differently 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.320
 ok we remove with your other nail good another 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.080
 thing the rest of enamel that remained in 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.909
 your nails and hope you want it to 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.310
 give the other pass because for the same 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:58.560
 that is on top of two colors 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.560
 it looks transparent it did a little 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.880
 okay 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.090
 good since it is dry we are going to give another 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.640
 last with the green color to cover 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.099
 a light pass so that it makes 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.280
 Quick to cover the colors below 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.280
 what 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.860
 good since it's dry now we're going to 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.860
 use this type of enamel 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.640
 delgadito is a very thin brush look 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.900
 is for exactly to detail for 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.590
 make lines for 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.680
 to make details good for you to look 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.269
 let's talk a little bit let's try to 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.910
 do this so that we are not going to 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.490
 drain some drop 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.280
 remove the excess so that it does not go to 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.530
 the line is very thick and we start 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.730
 from up here 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.740
 and we try to lower 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.680
 and we do the same thing we grab another little 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.750
 of the line of work and tries to leave 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.250
 the brush there and only turn everything 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.250
 turn your finger 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.760
 okay 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.300
 but finally let's put our 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.160
 protective base 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.990
 or shine they want to call you 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.990
 so that it lasts longer our 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.930
 our enamel to a guy and good they have 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.880
 have to wait for it to dry, this does not 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.890
 it lasts neither two nor three minutes is good 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.820
 It also depends on why you bought 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.610
 true but try to dry very 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.010
 is not well put on a ventilator treatment 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.030
 Do not grab things do not wash the dishes 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.310
 or so and well this one takes care of your dreams 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.490
