 121 and today we are here with a new video 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.200
 tutorial 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.360
 then often there are new videos 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.100
 wished yara this time is how to create 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.860
 a lan server then this server wool 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.130
 it's different from last saw that 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.520
 I did it because it's not a phone but there 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:44.350
 as said well yes a lan server that does not 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:47.680
 use the minecraft server ie this one 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.360
 you're made this using this thing 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.949
 here I want you to be able to do even less 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.210
 to download it you have to download only no 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.519
 thank you 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.720
 you only have to download love us this 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.519
 is useful to you 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.970
 let go of the mein kampf server not 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.729
 you need it more, you don't need it then, like yes 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.320
 creates very simple keyserver lan 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:14.140
 open your minecraft if you want 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.770
 also the link description that is shit 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.770
 that han vc 1 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.270
 as you can see the complete nickname 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.610
 however it is that of youtube of hand for 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 always with the never change and on having 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.000
 a matter of discipline here is why 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.910
 that is, I show with all the versions 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.640
 just the versions between those that 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.740
 they owe what they ought to be 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.910
 who must play as customers 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.150
 I must have to be the same are 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.520
 compatible little though because if I create 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.690
 if I am lost or and create a server 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:53.940
 the ananas 1.7.2 is a friend of mine wants 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.460
 enter however at 1.5.2 can not enter 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.850
 because they are compatible more or 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.800
 less as we say however at work vi 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.480
 I'll show you how 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.340
 you have to go into a split single player 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:15.659
 create new world in this type case 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.560
 I try the art no lazio lan field 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.510
 you can set all the settings 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.200
 what do you want this thing I do 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.200
 normal in creative create the world 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.939
 it takes a while because ola or shaders a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.609
 little way we say 19 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:45.989
 it is not true they are very few however not 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:47.459
 I know why, however, since then, if you log in, Madonna 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.599
 locke is perfect but he didn't understand it 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:55.799
 then I feel sorry for a moment 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:03:02.609
 the scene so all in the perfect you see 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:05.939
 how cool is how you saw the lock 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:10.519
 pic3d cv and two scenes treme dop team 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:10.519
 water of the pop the killing description 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:18.000
 how can you see if creating the world 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:23.400
 big world, that is, this world is beautiful 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.510
 has crap history you need 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.480
 do you have to press est or as they say 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.569
 as I knew it, you have to do it or come around 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.439
 choose the world settings that you 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.090
 wants 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:38.940
 the tricks you are the player just 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.819
 behind it was just the creative sact the pole 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.729
 in this case the world has left that 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.479
 you have to do see this theme 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:51.299
 sorry or do you see what appeared in 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:53.400
 other in is born there is even below 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.549
 on the left is local a game of 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.540
 death a port and the tells you to bring in 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.009
 this case the door we have to tell a 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.680
 what they want to get into 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:09.150
 this case can be someone own 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.359
 rarely ex can anyone be 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.780
 there is no perino there is no preferences 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:21.120
 not even the white list is missing 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.979
 ban command because I want you can 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:29.280
 only doing would not lack the 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:33.249
 door and 64 608 and just that maybe it has 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:38.439
 friends to get back where the is 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:41.469
 shores of love you must not also put 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:45.129
 you have to give him the door but the door won't 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:47.679
 2 55 65 that default of minecraft but 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:52.539
 you have to give him the door that he managed to 

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:53.369
 you here ok so it was very calm 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.599
 hard 

00:04:53.369 --> 00:05:04.199
 I can also enter inter gamer e 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:04.199
 if you want what 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.900
 however it is that you want it to be here 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.030
 appeared twice less hd left game 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.770
 or how it jammed anyway 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.560
 it works is not very difficult 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.990
 I hope the tutorial has been there 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.360
 helpful because it really was a bit of a 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.620
 hassle put the minecraft server 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.990
 the world of settings may hesitate 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.460
 while this is much easier basket 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.850
 of the world is the dress of the lan 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.350
