00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.120
Regardless of the All Blacks'
performance at the weekend,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.040
their performance of the haka
is improving greatly.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.640
Piri Weepu says a lot of effort
has been put in behind the scenes

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.760
in order to execute
the job successfully.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.160
Irena Smith reports.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.800
His voice will uplift the
All Blacks for Rugby World Cup.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.040
The country has witnessed
the pride the All Blacks have

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.200
when performing the haka,
no matter where they come from.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.560
Derek Lardelli is the
man he's talking about.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.880
He's a haka expert who's
behind improving the haka

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.280
and helping the boys
understand what it means.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.680
Although his position
as haka leader is solid,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.960
he still has a battle on his hands
to become the number one half-back.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.120
Weepu was left out of the
All Blacks for the last RWC,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.240
and there was talk about him
returning to rugby league.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.200
But Piri says he has
grown a lot since then

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.880
and is more focused on his game.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.560
It's something the All Blacks
coaches have recognised.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.440
If his on-field plans
don't eventuate,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.080
there's sure to be a kapa haka
group waiting in the wings.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.840
Irena Smith, Te Karere.
