00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.770
 of fusion to number 3 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.860
 my shield is in God who saves the 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.860
 straight arms 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.640
 reflection 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.240
 with this psalm we can live confident 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.430
 in that when we feel that our life 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.770
 he is in danger 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.770
 it is God who protects us as a shield 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.739
 we must be sure that the lord 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:49.530
 listen to our prayer wherever 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.530
 we are and in any situation 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.670
 if our heart is right in front of 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.920
 God our cry comes in front of 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.920
 his throne 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.850
 and we can trust that at the moment 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.850
 fair 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.370
 neither before nor after the Lord is going to 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.040
 tilt your ear to us and extend 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.500
 his hand of mercy to get us out in 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.710
 victory of whatever we are 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.710
 suffering 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.770
 his love is what makes him see 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.140
 our sincere heart when no longer 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.140
 we can more and we want to throw in the towel 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.850
 because we see the giants and we think 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.210
 until I get there is when the power 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.700
 God acts 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.700
 protecting us from any evil 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.760
