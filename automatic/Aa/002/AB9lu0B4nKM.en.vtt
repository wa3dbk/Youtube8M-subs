00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.730
 our branch specializes in 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.430
 treatment of patients with malignant 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.860
 skin and mucous formations in particular 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.170
 in this situation, we plan 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.230
 photodynamic therapy 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:29.680
 patients with basal cell carcinoma 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.610
 skin of the lumbar region patient to us 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.690
 arrived 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.430
 and as a resident of the Moscow region 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.649
 direction from your region was 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.890
 morphological diagnosis verified on 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.969
 prehospital that is carried out 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.309
 morphological study in particular 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.019
 cytology where the diagnosis 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.879
 was installed that is, we appeared 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.640
 hippo ray or basal cell cells 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.820
 what is the indication for 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.829
 carrying out photodynamic therapy with 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.890
 admission to the department, the patient passed 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.820
 all necessary minimum 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.360
 biochemical laboratory and 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.620
 instrumental research methods 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.170
 replying where we could learn about 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.510
 the state of the body you after all some 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.360
 indications or contraindications what is 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.350
 comorbidities and 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.710
 accordingly planned date 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.060
 photodynamic therapy 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.740
 here's how we already know everything 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.130
 for photodynamic therapy 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.350
 need the introduction of photosensitization in 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.080
 particular in recent years we have been working with 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.390
 drugs flare new series which 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.940
 us quickly accumulates in 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.440
 body so on the day of the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.140
 photodynamic therapy we conduct 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.380
 the introduction of photosensitivity for a half 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.770
 three hours before the procedure 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.550
 after this period is held and 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.190
 diagnostic procedures which 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.980
 include you fluorescent diagnostics 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.520
 and spectrometry and research 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.380
 here in particular what the spectrum looks like 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.149
 fluorescent diagnostics 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.310
 we use special for this 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.350
 equipment specially camcorder 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.869
 which will register specs fluur 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.929
 the essence of the lesion that is from 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.910
 but formations on the skin on the screen 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.400
 computer that is on the screen 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.459
 computer here is actually on a dark background 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.580
 we see a bright glowing spot which 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.459
 and says that we have a drug 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.370
 accumulated in this and thrust and we that is higher 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.709
 than in the surrounding healthy tissue and after 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.500
 we will conduct a similar procedure after 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.440
 termination of photodynamic therapy and 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.450
 then we will see the changes on the screen 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.880
 that is, this is the stain that we had 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.620
 bright luminous she will turn pale but 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.989
 this we can see a little later 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.099
 here is the next moment diagnostically 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.780
 this spectrum is a metric study 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:55.000
 here we are using a special 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.730
 the fiber we touch to 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.750
 formation and fix the spectra 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.980
 fluorescence on the screen as a graph 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:09.400
 such a triangular form we 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:16.530
 we make such measurements from several 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.530
 points of education itself 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.120
 with tissues that surround formations 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.790
 there is so said on the periphery of education 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:33.370
 and also with apparently healthy skin and 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.010
 control well further on with 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.740
 special programs we measure 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.670
 the areas of these storage peaks are measured 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.850
 and already on the difference in the ratio of clicks 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.210
 accumulations in healthy skin and in 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.070
 damaged skin wear can say about 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.480
 a certain level of accumulation of drugs 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.730
 that is, the so-called index 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.670
 fluorescence ie this situation we 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.940
 here we fix in the education itself somewhere 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.600
 order around 30 let's say order 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.180
 numbers 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.340
 and already in the control of this order 7 that is 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.530
 accordingly 30 divided by 7 will be a 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.390
 somewhere in the 5 times the level 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.270
 savings but the very 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.590
 photosensitivity towards 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.090
 healthy skin first is 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.489
 evidence of selectivity 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.130
 photosensitization that is, he is with us 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.320
 really accumulate it in 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.450
 more in apulia tissues than in 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.830
 normal healthy skin that's what you 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.360
 proper more basis us all 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.880
 photodynamic therapy 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.190
 well, then the process itself begins 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.580
 here's the laser so-called irradiation 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.710
 of blood 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.700
 here's the laser light source 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.950
 is a laser apparatus 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.080
 generating light with a certain length 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.280
 waves in particular for all lari new 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.010
 photosensitization 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.900
 need devices that generate light with 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.000
 wavelength 662 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.390
 nanometer such a requirement we have 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.480
 responds's laser technology from which 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:00.050
 us produces oh oh semiconductor 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.060
 devices st petersburg here it is 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.280
 compact and easy to comfortable in 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.080
 exploitation i.e. semiconductor 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.200
 laser devices that is actually 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.600
 if we remembered what we worked for 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.010
 15 years ago it was such a huge 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.500
 generators 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.540
 huge pipes that were heated 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.060
 warmed up a few hours down 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.690
 cooled afterwards in order for us to 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.310
 gave out exactly the light laser 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.240
 light is exactly worth the wavelength when 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.580
 it was necessary here and the name is the last 15 years 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.110
 even less by these with these devices 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.520
 we have been working for more than five years 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.350
 actually around 10 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.390
 we have already switched to such small ones 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.190
 compact semiconductor devices 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.320
 which do not take up much space and easy 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.510
 in operation at the very technique 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.050
 is to calculate the required dose 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.640
 light which should be applied to the skin and 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.640
 given to the patient so that we 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.530
 got quite pronounced 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.960
 hemorrhagic necrosis as a result 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.540
 any photo dynamic impact 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.190
 photosensitization itself is more 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.360
 accumulates in tumors education is all 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.460
 anyway there is a certain level 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.250
 accumulations in surrounding healthy tissue 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.430
 and we need to protect them always from 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.260
 excess burn so we form such 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.110
 stencils that protect the environment 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.380
 the fabric and allows us to irradiate only 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.990
 here the fabric that we need we form 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.600
 would usually be from black tetta 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.529
 impermeable paper or fabric for 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.289
 there is a principle this way 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:32.049
 a light spot is formed in order 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:34.239
 So here is the process of obtaining 

00:06:32.049 --> 00:06:37.269
 laser light of this formation 

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:40.539
 time here is our calculation which we 

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:42.759
 calculate after a certain time 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.319
 during which here is the session 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:47.829
 laser irradiation 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:51.189
 we already look what we got then 

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:52.329
 have for this we spend first 

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:55.299
 visual inspection 

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:58.029
 instead of irradiation, that is, we see that 

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:58.899
 we are white this hearth appears 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:01.989
 the signs 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:03.599
 hemorrhagic necrosis as a small 

00:07:01.989 --> 00:07:05.739
 such blueness and most 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:08.229
 neoplasms and accordingly we 

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:10.929
 conduct additional fluorescent on and 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.389
 research if earlier we saw bright 

00:07:10.929 --> 00:07:15.939
 glowing hearth then now we see how 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:18.399
 he turned pale he became practically level with 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:20.999
 from the skin and even appeared so dark 

00:07:18.399 --> 00:07:23.859
 bezel around this so-called effect 

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:25.689
 luminescence of a cloth i.e. speaking 

00:07:23.859 --> 00:07:28.119
 that the so-called burned out 

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:31.439
 photosensitivity that is passed with us 

00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:31.439
 photo chemical reaction
