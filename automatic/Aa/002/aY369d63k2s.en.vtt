something<00:04:31.390> like<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.930> so<00:04:32.170> the<00:04:32.290> fact<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.620> you

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
something like that so the fact that you

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.130 
something like that so the fact that you
made<00:04:32.890> that<00:04:32.920> low<00:04:33.550> key<00:04:33.820> choice<00:04:34.120> but<00:04:34.690> I'm<00:04:34.870> saying

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
made that low key choice but I'm saying

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.500 
made that low key choice but I'm saying
out<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:36.100> context<00:04:36.820> I<00:04:36.910> think<00:04:36.940> they're<00:04:37.240> very<00:04:37.270> good

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
out of context I think they're very good

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.960 
out of context I think they're very good
in<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.350> context<00:04:38.950> of<00:04:39.040> this<00:04:39.190> stage<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:39.790> in<00:04:39.880> the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
in the context of this stage and in the

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.540 
in the context of this stage and in the
show<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.540> think<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:41.080> was<00:04:41.170> a<00:04:41.200> little<00:04:41.590> low<00:04:41.860> energy

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
show I think it was a little low energy

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.420 
show I think it was a little low energy
but<00:04:43.090> it<00:04:43.960> was<00:04:44.140> still<00:04:44.380> good<00:04:44.620> I'm<00:04:44.830> not<00:04:44.980> knocking

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
but it was still good I'm not knocking

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.320 
but it was still good I'm not knocking
it<00:04:45.520> but<00:04:45.700> America<00:04:46.300> has<00:04:46.390> got<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.740> vote<00:04:48.330> judge
