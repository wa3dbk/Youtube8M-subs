00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
in the paper another drawing another

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.870 
in the paper another drawing another
cartoon<00:01:50.049> so<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.380> guess<00:01:51.710> this<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:51.979> evidence<00:01:52.610> I

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
cartoon so I guess this is evidence I

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.969 
cartoon so I guess this is evidence I
guess<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:53.450> is<00:01:53.600> real<00:01:54.670> this<00:01:55.670> picture<00:01:56.710> 5li<00:01:57.710> this

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
guess this is real this picture 5li this

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.679 
guess this is real this picture 5li this
would<00:01:58.189> have<00:01:58.310> been<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.579> first<00:01:58.850> time<00:01:59.210> or<00:01:59.659> maybe

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
would have been the first time or maybe

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.190 
would have been the first time or maybe
the<00:02:00.200> second<00:02:00.710> time<00:02:00.909> so<00:02:01.909> they<00:02:02.570> tell<00:02:02.810> us<00:02:02.960> there's

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
the second time so they tell us there's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.020 
the second time so they tell us there's
thousands<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.100> different<00:02:04.159> types<00:02:04.789> of
