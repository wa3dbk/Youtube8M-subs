00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.730
 so the second technique that I'm going 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.869
 to introduce yourself is called percussion 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.029
 it's a technique that's going to be the 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.570
 own rather neandertal living here 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.190
 in europe in a cold climate the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.410
 friction that you saw at the moment 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.330
 to succeed it requires good wood 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.210
 quality and above all it needs wood that he 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.440
 contains no resin Neanderthal here 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.269
 in its environment only has 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.010
 conifers trees with resin 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.780
 the resin prevents from rising in 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.760
 temperature the friction is not going to be a 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.640
 interesting technique for Neanderthal 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.549
 it's the percussion that will see him 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.920
 guillaume of the iphone so I have three 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.720
 elements first is a piece of 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.620
 flint 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.839
 unlike the myth that would 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.420
 that we make fire in front of the fire with 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.890
 2.6 nex that's wrong if you hit two 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.200
 flint between them that you will get some 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.130
 it is a sell certainly but sparks 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.869
 cold 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.810
 we call it sparks of light 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.560
 goes off tribal luminescence for the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.030
 little scientific name 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.250
 sparks of light can not 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.380
 to make fire because it goes up to 60 70 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.820
 degrees at most here at the friction 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.200
 just now we went up to 400 degrees 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.259
 thanks to this other stone I will do 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.939
 sparks of heat this time 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.280
 in this stone the pyrite to do 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.929
 there is as its name the indicated had to do 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.890
 for 70% 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.329
 there is especially breath for 30% and this 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.539
 are the small grains of breath that 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.159
 sees shine in the stone of the little ones 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.080
 sulfur crystals that will allow me 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.600
 to create sparks that will go up 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.709
 at 800 degrees 800 degrees that's 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.450
 considerable it will allow me 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.039
 to light a this said they will stay 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.959
 at 800 degrees for a very very long time 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.580
 big that's why it's going to take 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:01.159
 I'll go quickly for the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.159
 drop his sparks on a tinder 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.920
 in the technique of friction in 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.630
 rubbing the two pieces of wood I 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.729
 creates sweat so I make my 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.049
 soul naked there I could call my 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.480
 pebbles before seeing any of me 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.739
 I would have the apartment of which tinder he 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.830
 must I find it in nature 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.239
 here it is the best tinder that 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.590
 our ancestors and discovered by the way we 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.450
 gave him the name of old tinder 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.470
 since it is made of amman ivy 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.600
 it's a mushroom that grows on the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.500
 trunk of the trees in this way very 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.450
 easy to recognize 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.590
 it's part of the same family as the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.069
 famous beef tongue 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.840
 all tinder ports life when I 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:42.849
 cut out this mushroom the louvre game that 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.290
 I get the flesh inside 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.510
 flesh of this mushroom looks a little 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.730
 to cotton when I cut it like that 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.670
 reveals small fibers 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.500
 microscopic here very fine these fibers 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.319
 are perfect for capturing 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.330
 sparks and start a fire by creating 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.489
 an embers 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.950
 I have both gathered my tinder based 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.079
 of mushrooms map inherited his breath 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.579
 my flint which is neither more nor less 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.769
 that a pool of water finally with which 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.489
 I will be able to tear the breath 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.160
 so what is really happening 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.079
 when I blow out the atom's breath 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.959
 sulfur will recombine with oxygen 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.329
 from the air this reaction this fusion 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.870
 atomic somehow at home 2 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.060
 suffers more oxygen not create 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.760
 the energy will release energy under 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.099
 form of heat and it will go up to 8,102 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.650
 this is called oxidation phenomenon 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.910
 simply 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.780
 so our ancestors do not know all that 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.950
 but by cons they know they 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.260
 use 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:49.690
 that's how our ancestors to succeed 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:52.180
 to make fire through the cairo then we 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.560
 poorly distinguishes the sparks for the 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.790
 simple reason that we are in full 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.690
 day that they are very small 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.380
 plots of cold heat that queues 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.530
 nearby 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.060
 I send some fly over 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.799
 I'm watching to see if there are any 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:18.880
 a big one that will eventually turn on a 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:21.000
 piece of mushrooms well this way 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.000
 the 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.630
 two or three sparks sufficiently 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.540
 big and hot enough 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.130
 they are mounted very high temperature 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:40.199
 ended up igniting a few pieces 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.580
 of tinder here not then the speed of the 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.190
 technique will depend mainly on the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.510
 material quality 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.370
 here I am lucky to have a mushroom 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.919
 dry I protected in my purse 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.139
 in leather that did not take moisture a 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.150
 very hard dense pyrite which 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.250
 well support karkh ution and who 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.139
 contains enough sulfur and a 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.389
 flint as well at the size of my hand 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:04.430
 very hard also that allows me to good 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:07.860
 snatched my tests but small spark 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:13.220
 then, as I did earlier, 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.220
 get the embers I created here 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.820
 the smoke you see there the very 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.350
 known beekeepers you have before 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.210
 to open hives example hives 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.740
 has been there since ancient times 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.960
 mushroom there they use these this 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.550
 smoke there use them it's a smoke 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.850
 slightly anesthetic for 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.850
 insects 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.540
 now that ember is enough 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.110
 big able to support my air a little 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.669
 wet 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.669
 I will be able to blow on 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.939
 to pass this time u13 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.910
 but 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.950
 here is an odor that will emerge is the 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.010
 mushroom burning a woody smell 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.560
 very woody and then sulfur 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.700
 sulfur of the stone a smell of powder 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.700
 gunpowder firecracker 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.340
 it 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.639
 our ancestors use the mushroom 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.229
 also abounds live in the 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.760
 caves that was making big fires in 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:32.800
 which he put the pieces of 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.199
 mushrooms the smoke chase all the 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.820
 insects and sometimes the bears that 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.930
 lived in the caves before 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.930
 to be able to occupy 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.460
 ga antiquity the mushroom and is 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.310
 used as a bag that fuse for his 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.699
 properties made of lens years based 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.699
 change 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.710
 There you go 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:32.009
 this is it by percussion 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:35.300
 thanks to flint iron pyrite and 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:35.300
