00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.560
 Welcome to the golf academy 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.450
 st leon-red 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.640
 surely some of them already have 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.290
 once noticed that many good golfers 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.500
 every time behind the ball 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.700
 face and look towards the goal 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.100
 But many golfers are simply 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.900
 on the ball and off you go annoy yourself 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.580
 but in retrospect, if the ball is not 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.739
 flying towards the desired destination 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.200
 but that is not necessarily theirs 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.640
 momentum 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.900
 Surely you have already asked yourself what 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.590
 the players behind the ball actually 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.629
 do 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.650
 They are looking for a goal for you 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.059
 align myself today i'll get him two today 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.489
 show possibilities as they are 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.150
 can correctly align the first 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.010
 possibility 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.150
 go behind the ball and set 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.010
 imagine a line 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.470
 from her ball to her 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.450
 Go to the target now 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.190
 this line in the immediate vicinity 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.479
 your ball something striking on the ground 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.340
 what they want to aim for 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.350
 This can be for example a sheet or 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.350
 be a different color stain in the grass 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.570
 Now you go into setup and move with 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.760
 her bat on her chosen one 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.580
 intermediate goal first after that 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.770
 left foot then the right without 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.330
 greater effort or worry pull you 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.280
 automatically towards destination 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.960
 as your goal is in the extension 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.960
 yours between cs 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.240
 the second possibility is again 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.810
 behind the ball and stand up 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.890
 line 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.320
 moving from your ball to your goal 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.610
 look directly at the horizon 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.600
 extension to your line 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.750
 striking goal 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.369
 this can be the flag or eg a 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.270
 treetop or a steeple 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.760
 his 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.830
 Now you go to the stage goal with yours 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.630
 put the bat on the chosen target 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.759
 then first your left foot and then 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.130
 the right one and concentrate 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.390
 Only focus on this goal now 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.390
 automatically in the right direction 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.150
 hereby you have two options 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.500
 to control their alignment and 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.860
 more consistency in your beats too 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.860
 to get
