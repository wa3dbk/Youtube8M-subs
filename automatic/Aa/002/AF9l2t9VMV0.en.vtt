00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
hold then this could rip using a certain

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.120 
hold then this could rip using a certain
whole<00:00:14.870> side<00:00:15.110> here<00:00:16.840> and<00:00:17.840> just<00:00:18.710> come<00:00:18.860> up<00:00:18.950> in

whole side here and just come up in
through<00:00:19.369> one<00:00:19.730> thing<00:00:19.939> I<00:00:20.000> forgot<00:00:20.119> to<00:00:20.270> mention<00:00:20.360> in

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
through one thing I forgot to mention in

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.640 
through one thing I forgot to mention in
the<00:00:20.720> first<00:00:20.750> part<00:00:21.160> is<00:00:22.160> that<00:00:23.200> you<00:00:24.200> just<00:00:24.380> gotta<00:00:24.560> be

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
the first part is that you just gotta be

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.429 
the first part is that you just gotta be
pretty<00:00:24.829> sure<00:00:25.070> that<00:00:25.250> you've<00:00:25.400> left<00:00:26.439> any

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
pretty sure that you've left any

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.609 
pretty sure that you've left any
clearance<00:00:27.770> at<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:27.980> back<00:00:28.099> here<00:00:28.399> in<00:00:28.579> terms<00:00:28.790> of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
clearance at the back here in terms of

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.839 
clearance at the back here in terms of
width<00:00:30.619> that<00:00:30.829> you've<00:00:31.009> got<00:00:31.189> here<00:00:31.460> just<00:00:31.640> so<00:00:31.820> that

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
width that you've got here just so that

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.970 
width that you've got here just so that
the<00:00:32.090> scooter<00:00:32.689> panelists<00:00:33.140> I'll<00:00:33.320> close<00:00:33.500> it

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
the scooter panelists I'll close it

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.530 
the scooter panelists I'll close it
I<00:00:34.010> can<00:00:34.880> still<00:00:35.030> accommodate<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.630> new<00:00:35.899> socket

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
I can still accommodate the new socket

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.750 
I can still accommodate the new socket
so<00:00:38.540> then<00:00:38.720> the<00:00:39.710> wall<00:00:40.070> of<00:00:40.160> just<00:00:40.340> remembers

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
so then the wall of just remembers

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.330 
so then the wall of just remembers
lumber<00:00:41.090> off<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:41.560> I'm<00:00:42.560> just<00:00:42.620> gonna<00:00:42.800> fail<00:00:43.040> at<00:00:43.220> the

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
lumber off so I'm just gonna fail at the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.840 
lumber off so I'm just gonna fail at the
end<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.580> them<00:00:45.400> I'm<00:00:46.400> gonna<00:00:46.550> try<00:00:46.730> for<00:00:46.790> safe

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.390 

I've<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.060> finished<00:00:51.950> drilling<00:00:52.950> the<00:00:53.130> hole<00:00:53.280> of

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
I've just finished drilling the hole of

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.430 
I've just finished drilling the hole of
clean<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.700> the<00:00:53.820> hole<00:00:54.230> for<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> socket<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
clean up the hole for the socket and

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
clean up the hole for the socket and
just<00:00:58.440> attached<00:00:58.740> it<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.070> no<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.910> really

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
just attached it there no it's really

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.400 
just attached it there no it's really
simple<00:01:00.240> to<00:01:00.450> stick<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.750> on<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.230> guess

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
simple to stick it on it's just a guess

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.690 
simple to stick it on it's just a guess
of<00:01:01.940> just<00:01:02.940> single<00:01:03.210> screw<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.020> behind<00:01:04.260> it

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
of just single screw you behind it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
of just single screw you behind it
that's<00:01:05.700> holding<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.120> place<00:01:06.210> they're<00:01:06.480> just

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that's holding it in place they're just

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.090 
that's holding it in place they're just
putting<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.350> recess<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.920> front

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
putting that little recess and the front

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.060 
putting that little recess and the front
of<00:01:08.190> the<00:01:08.250> schooner<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:12.020> the<00:01:13.020> front<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
of the schooner and then the front of it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.260 
of the schooner and then the front of it
effects<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.550> moraine<00:01:14.790> written<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.180> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
effects like that moraine written on so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.760 
effects like that moraine written on so
I<00:01:15.330> figured<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.780> know<00:01:15.900> these<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.470> used<00:01:16.650> quite

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I figured you know these are used quite

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.350 
I figured you know these are used quite
a<00:01:16.860> lot<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.070> boats<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.460> secured<00:01:17.940> in<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.150> bit<00:01:18.270> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
a lot in boats and secured in a bit of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.510 
a lot in boats and secured in a bit of
the<00:01:19.320> air<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.590> work<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.950> boats<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.310> I've<00:01:20.400> seen

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
the air I work in boats but I've seen

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
the air I work in boats but I've seen
people<00:01:20.700> actually<00:01:20.910> mr.<00:01:21.510> Allens<00:01:21.720> critters<00:01:22.080> as

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
people actually mr. Allens critters as

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.380 
people actually mr. Allens critters as
well<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.590> GPS<00:01:22.950> systems<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:23.970> stuff<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.240> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
well for GPS systems and stuff like that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
well for GPS systems and stuff like that
so<00:01:27.290> he'll<00:01:28.290> probably<00:01:28.410> have<00:01:28.650> stars<00:01:28.890> up<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.220> but

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
so he'll probably have stars up here but

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.270 
so he'll probably have stars up here but
this<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.420> actually<00:01:30.510> I<00:01:31.140> think<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.250> just

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
this is actually I think this is just

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.880 
this is actually I think this is just
like<00:01:32.520> an<00:01:32.610> American<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.000> your<00:01:33.119> ignition<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.890> so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
like an American is your ignition is so

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.310 
like an American is your ignition is so
the<00:01:34.979> ignitions<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.550> state<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.320> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
the ignitions of the state and then you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.950 
the ignitions of the state and then you
have<00:01:37.500> kind<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.890> blank<00:01:38.130> thing<00:01:38.190> there<00:01:38.550> but

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
have kind of a blank thing there but

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.999 
have kind of a blank thing there but
looking<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> size<00:01:40.410> of<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.710> think<00:01:40.830> it's

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
looking at the size of it I think it's

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.830 
looking at the size of it I think it's
just<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.220> little<00:01:41.430> bit<00:01:41.550> too<00:01:41.670> big<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.509> whole<00:01:42.660> list

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
just a little bit too big the whole list

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.060 
just a little bit too big the whole list
there<00:01:43.020> I<00:01:43.050> think<00:01:43.229> would<00:01:43.410> overlap<00:01:43.800> here<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
there I think would overlap here a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.550 
there I think would overlap here a
little<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.930> stuck<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.050> underneath<00:01:46.259> there

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
little bit so stuck it underneath there

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.010 
little bit so stuck it underneath there
and<00:01:49.490> yeah<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.150> I<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.780> show<00:01:51.990> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and yeah so this is the I just show you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.150 
and yeah so this is the I just show you
the<00:01:52.200> solar<00:01:52.380> apparently<00:01:52.770> gotten<00:01:52.920> Maplin<00:01:55.160> this

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
the solar apparently gotten Maplin this

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.730 
the solar apparently gotten Maplin this
was<00:01:56.570> 13<00:01:57.570> pine<00:01:57.780> actually<00:01:58.080> got<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> special<00:01:58.649> offer

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
was 13 pine actually got a special offer

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
was 13 pine actually got a special offer
so<00:01:59.429> it's<00:01:59.550> looking<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.789> ones<00:01:59.970> on<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.149> internet

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
so it's looking at ones on the internet

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.600 
so it's looking at ones on the internet
looking<00:02:01.470> at<00:02:01.649> different<00:02:02.039> solar<00:02:02.220> panels<00:02:02.520> and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
looking at different solar panels and

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.690 
looking at different solar panels and
internet<00:02:02.910> for<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:04.590> know<00:02:04.710> maybe<00:02:04.890> 20<00:02:05.280> 30<00:02:05.310> quid

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
internet for you know maybe 20 30 quid

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.249 
internet for you know maybe 20 30 quid
and<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.179> saw<00:02:06.330> this<00:02:06.450> from<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.690> map<00:02:06.840> without<00:02:06.990> a

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and I saw this from the map without a

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.100 
and I saw this from the map without a
vessel<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.979> did<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.910> job<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:09.479> 13-pound

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
vessel I did a job for a bit 13-pound

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.700 
vessel I did a job for a bit 13-pound
yeah<00:02:10.440> well<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.710> was<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.220> was<00:02:11.450> $12.99<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.710> we

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
yeah well it was it was $12.99 so we

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.220 
yeah well it was it was $12.99 so we
came<00:02:13.860> what<00:02:14.240> came<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.330> two<00:02:15.420> different<00:02:15.990> types<00:02:16.140> of

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
came what came on two different types of

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.970 
came what came on two different types of
connector<00:02:16.530> actually<00:02:16.770> there's<00:02:16.950> this

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
connector actually there's this

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.970 
connector actually there's this
connector<00:02:17.610> here<00:02:17.640> which<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.680> same<00:02:19.680> normal

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
connector here which is the same normal

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.980 
connector here which is the same normal
12<00:02:20.220> volt<00:02:21.080> socket<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:24.240> then<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:24.569> has<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.720> little

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
12 volt socket and then it has a little

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.690 
12 volt socket and then it has a little
plug<00:02:25.170> here<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.620> can<00:02:25.710> plug<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.340> it

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
plug here that you can plug that and it

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.660 
plug here that you can plug that and it
also<00:02:26.850> comes<00:02:27.180> with<00:02:27.270> just<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.220> usual<00:02:29.220> bog

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
also comes with just the usual bog

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.910 
also comes with just the usual bog
standard<00:02:29.819> sort<00:02:30.240> of<00:02:30.270> alligator<00:02:30.690> substitute<00:02:31.230> so

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
standard sort of alligator substitute so

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.080 
standard sort of alligator substitute so
the<00:02:32.010> club's<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.400> clip<00:02:32.580> taken<00:02:32.760> onto<00:02:32.940> your

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
the club's it's clip taken onto your

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.150 
the club's it's clip taken onto your
battery<00:02:34.100> so

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
battery so

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.070 
battery so
we're<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:36.850> tested<00:02:37.210> here<00:02:37.360> name<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.720> multimeter

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
we're just tested here name a multimeter

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.860 
we're just tested here name a multimeter
just<00:02:38.320> make<00:02:38.470> sure<00:02:38.560> it's<00:02:38.710> working<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:40.150> like<00:02:40.690> so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
just make sure it's working and like so

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.270 
just make sure it's working and like so
let's<00:02:41.290> break<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.620> count<00:02:41.830> it's<00:02:42.010> actually

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
let's break the count it's actually

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.300 
let's break the count it's actually
given<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:42.940> little<00:02:43.090> bit<00:02:43.240> dull<00:02:43.390> because<00:02:43.570> it's

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
given a little bit dull because it's

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.410 
given a little bit dull because it's
coming<00:02:45.310> up<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.520> half<00:02:45.640> hitting<00:02:45.880> even<00:02:46.180> so

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
coming up and half hitting even so

00:02:46.420 --> 00:03:15.240 
coming up and half hitting even so
there's<00:02:46.930> not<00:02:47.020> much<00:02:47.080> later

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.059 

as<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.370> can<00:03:16.459> see<00:03:16.640> they<00:03:16.790> were<00:03:16.849> only<00:03:17.090> getting

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
as you can see they were only getting

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.110 
as you can see they were only getting
well<00:03:19.069> actually<00:03:19.189> I<00:03:19.370> got<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.640> terminals<00:03:20.000> wrong

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
well actually I got the terminals wrong

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.210 
well actually I got the terminals wrong
we<00:03:20.239> were<00:03:20.299> in<00:03:20.420> but<00:03:20.569> we<00:03:21.500> get<00:03:21.650> an<00:03:21.709> 11<00:03:21.980> point<00:03:22.099> 6

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
we were in but we get an 11 point 6

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.860 
we were in but we get an 11 point 6
volts<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.760> that's<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:23.750> know<00:03:23.810> it's

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
volts and that's you know it's

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.160 
volts and that's you know it's
practically<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:25.189> know<00:03:25.220> it's<00:03:25.989> very<00:03:26.989> late<00:03:27.140> and

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
practically you know it's very late and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.960 
practically you know it's very late and
even<00:03:27.349> there's<00:03:27.680> not<00:03:27.769> much<00:03:27.890> later<00:03:28.129> into<00:03:28.549> the

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
even there's not much later into the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.410 
even there's not much later into the
test<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.689> panel<00:03:30.200> earlier<00:03:30.230> it<00:03:30.590> was<00:03:30.709> given

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
test of the panel earlier it was given

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.830 
test of the panel earlier it was given
17<00:03:32.420> volts<00:03:32.629> and<00:03:33.019> directs<00:03:33.530> on<00:03:33.709> mate<00:03:33.890> so<00:03:34.840> that's

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
17 volts and directs on mate so that's

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.970 
17 volts and directs on mate so that's
good<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.019> that's<00:03:36.110> working<00:03:36.379> tonight

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
good that that's working tonight

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.020 
good that that's working tonight
when<00:03:37.280> you're<00:03:37.370> getting<00:03:37.430> paired<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:37.909> the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
when you're getting paired to the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.089 
when you're getting paired to the
terminals<00:03:38.420> here<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:38.720> that's<00:03:39.680> just<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:39.950> case

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
terminals here so that's just the case

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.440 
terminals here so that's just the case
of<00:03:41.739> pumpkin<00:03:42.739> two<00:03:42.890> little<00:03:43.250> spades<00:03:44.000> over<00:03:44.239> this

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
of pumpkin two little spades over this

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.099 
of pumpkin two little spades over this
and<00:03:44.810> then<00:03:44.900> picking<00:03:45.799> up<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.129> the<00:03:46.220> battery<00:03:46.400> I

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
and then picking up to the battery I

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.569 
and then picking up to the battery I
made<00:03:48.109> actually<00:03:48.230> install<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.680> fuses<00:03:49.099> I<00:03:49.400> feel<00:03:49.549> a

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
made actually install a fuses I feel a

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.750 
made actually install a fuses I feel a
lot<00:03:49.670> of<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:50.379> the<00:03:51.379> sockets<00:03:52.220> on<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.430> internet

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
lot of the the sockets on the internet

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.580 
lot of the the sockets on the internet
actually<00:03:52.879> happen<00:03:53.359> and<00:03:53.629> Lane<00:03:53.959> fuses<00:03:54.349> which<00:03:54.470> is

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
actually happen and Lane fuses which is

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.809 
actually happen and Lane fuses which is
probably<00:03:54.859> a<00:03:54.920> good<00:03:55.040> thing<00:03:55.099> to<00:03:55.340> be<00:03:55.430> honest<00:03:55.670> just

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
probably a good thing to be honest just

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.280 
probably a good thing to be honest just
in<00:03:55.909> case<00:03:56.090> water<00:03:56.299> it<00:03:56.480> gets<00:03:56.540> into<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.870> socket<00:03:57.200> or

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
in case water it gets into the socket or

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.649 
in case water it gets into the socket or
something<00:03:57.560> that<00:03:57.680> started<00:03:58.180> and<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.389> starts<00:03:59.599> to

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
something that started and it starts to

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:05.530 
something that started and it starts to
short-circuit<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:04.060> too<00:04:05.060> little

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
short-circuit so too little

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.819 
short-circuit so too little
you<00:04:05.810> don't<00:04:05.989> speed<00:04:07.959> and<00:04:08.959> I've<00:04:09.200> got<00:04:09.409> these<00:04:09.530> just

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
you don't speed and I've got these just

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.369 
you don't speed and I've got these just
as<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:09.950> part<00:04:10.489> of<00:04:10.549> a<00:04:10.639> Crump<00:04:10.849> inserting<00:04:11.269> these<00:04:12.260> are

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
as a part of a Crump inserting these are

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.390 
as a part of a Crump inserting these are
just<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:13.400> little<00:04:14.239> bit<00:04:14.329> of<00:04:14.420> plastic<00:04:15.280> these<00:04:16.280> are

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
just a little bit of plastic these are

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.979 
just a little bit of plastic these are
just<00:04:16.519> bog-standard<00:04:16.780> let's<00:04:17.780> see<00:04:17.900> those

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
just bog-standard let's see those

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:27.310 
just bog-standard let's see those
connectors<00:04:18.729> and<00:04:19.729> then<00:04:19.849> victim<00:04:20.419> couples

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.150 

I<00:04:27.350> think<00:04:27.920> this<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:30.560> I'm<00:04:30.650> just<00:04:30.710> gonna<00:04:30.920> hook<00:04:31.100> it

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
I think this and I'm just gonna hook it

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.490 
I think this and I'm just gonna hook it
up<00:04:31.220> to<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.460> battery<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:32.270> then<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:33.350> whole

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
up to the battery and then the whole

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.150 
up to the battery and then the whole
reason<00:04:33.740> I'm<00:04:33.830> doing<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:34.100> enemy<00:04:34.340> is<00:04:34.370> because

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
reason I'm doing that enemy is because

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.860 
reason I'm doing that enemy is because
the<00:04:37.160> battery<00:04:37.670> is<00:04:37.970> probably<00:04:38.480> another<00:04:38.630> great

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
the battery is probably another great

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.350 
the battery is probably another great
battery<00:04:39.050> it's<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:40.220> little<00:04:40.700> bit<00:04:41.000> all<00:04:41.180> I<00:04:41.210> think

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
battery it's a little bit all I think

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.480 
battery it's a little bit all I think
about<00:04:41.510> is<00:04:41.660> like<00:04:41.900> four<00:04:42.110> years<00:04:42.290> old<00:04:42.500> so<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:44.350> can

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
about is like four years old so it can

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.640 
about is like four years old so it can
drop<00:04:46.490> off<00:04:46.670> now<00:04:46.880> from<00:04:47.060> tainted<00:04:47.210> came<00:04:47.650> the

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
drop off now from tainted came the

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.970 
drop off now from tainted came the
beggar<00:04:48.830> service<00:04:49.250> charge<00:04:49.670> it<00:04:49.790> so<00:04:50.890> every<00:04:51.890> so

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
beggar service charge it so every so

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.900 
beggar service charge it so every so
often<00:04:52.130> I<00:04:52.280> was<00:04:52.400> just<00:04:52.520> sticking<00:04:52.640> it<00:04:52.790> on<00:04:52.880> the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
often I was just sticking it on the

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.250 
often I was just sticking it on the
battery<00:04:53.120> charger<00:04:53.510> just<00:04:53.660> to<00:04:53.750> keep<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:53.930> on<00:04:54.110> top

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
battery charger just to keep it on top

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.110 
battery charger just to keep it on top
so<00:04:56.920> avoid<00:04:57.920> that<00:04:57.950> and<00:04:58.280> avoid<00:04:58.670> having<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:59.000> take

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
so avoid that and avoid having to take

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.310 
so avoid that and avoid having to take
off<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.420> panel's<00:04:59.750> here<00:04:59.810> because<00:05:00.050> every<00:05:00.170> time

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320
