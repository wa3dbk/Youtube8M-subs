00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
and now I've got a tricky deal of trying

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.359 
and now I've got a tricky deal of trying

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
to kick it over and see if you know I

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.689 
to kick it over and see if you know I
can<00:00:23.550> get<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> work<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.560> we'll<00:00:25.560> give<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
can get it to work so we'll give it and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.450 
can get it to work so we'll give it and
hold<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.180> camera<00:00:27.420> steady<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.260> could

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
hold this camera steady so that I could

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.730 
hold this camera steady so that I could
fret<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.720> we'll<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.199> hold<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.560> on

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
fret here and we'll just hold that on

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220 
fret here and we'll just hold that on
the<00:00:31.949> big<00:00:32.279> attack<00:00:32.550> which<00:00:32.850> says<00:00:33.059> three<00:00:33.390> right

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
from the basic model it has it goes up

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.859 
from the basic model it has it goes up
to<00:01:49.470> 20,000<00:01:50.189> rpm<00:01:50.899> it's<00:01:53.179> it's<00:01:54.179> counter<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.840> a

high tech number really a nice little
thing<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:11.550> got<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.849> find<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.120> way<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.269> again<00:02:12.690> this

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
thing I got to find a way to again this

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.630 
thing I got to find a way to again this
is<00:02:13.560> where<00:02:13.739> you<00:02:13.860> change<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.459> right<00:02:15.239> here<00:02:16.640> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
is where you change it right here the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.070 
is where you change it right here the
pushing<00:02:18.209> for<00:02:18.420> four<00:02:18.630> or<00:02:18.720> five<00:02:18.900> different

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
pushing for four or five different

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.170 
pushing for four or five different
functions<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:21.950> wish<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.069> had<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> nitrous<00:02:23.790> button

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
functions I wish I had a nitrous button

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.539 
functions I wish I had a nitrous button
here<00:02:24.360> too<00:02:24.630> but<00:02:24.930> maybe<00:02:25.709> they'll<00:02:25.950> come<00:02:26.220> out<00:02:26.400> with

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
here too but maybe they'll come out with

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:40.410 
here too but maybe they'll come out with
one<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:27.000> that

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420
