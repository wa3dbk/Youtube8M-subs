00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
was quite a bit of difference in base

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.410 
was quite a bit of difference in base
from<00:02:27.180> my<00:02:27.390> samsung<00:02:28.020> camera<00:02:28.470> right<00:02:28.650> there<00:02:29.420> and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
from my samsung camera right there and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.660 
from my samsung camera right there and
on<00:02:31.170> this<00:02:31.410> camera<00:02:31.680> because<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.190> camera<00:02:32.490> has<00:02:32.610> a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
on this camera because this camera has a

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.540 
on this camera because this camera has a
mono<00:02:32.940> mic<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.770> as<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.890> notice<00:02:35.160> why<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.340> base

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
mono mic and as you notice why the base

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.760 
mono mic and as you notice why the base
was<00:02:36.060> too<00:02:36.210> loud<00:02:36.390> at<00:02:36.600> first<00:02:36.930> but<00:02:37.290> then<00:02:37.440> sort<00:02:37.710> of

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
was too loud at first but then sort of

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.990 
was too loud at first but then sort of
cut<00:02:37.950> out<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.250> because<00:02:38.460> it<00:02:38.550> was<00:02:38.670> cutting<00:02:38.880> out

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
cut out is because it was cutting out

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.490 
cut out is because it was cutting out
this<00:02:39.210> mic<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:39.720> was<00:02:39.810> too<00:02:40.020> much<00:02:40.260> air<00:02:40.470> pressure

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
this mic there was too much air pressure

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.830 
this mic there was too much air pressure
in<00:02:40.950> here<00:02:41.070> for<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.700> mic<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.060> really<00:02:42.330> respond

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
in here for the mic to really respond

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.199 
in here for the mic to really respond
correctly<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:43.830> sort<00:02:44.490> of<00:02:44.520> cut<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.850> out<00:02:44.970> but

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
correctly so it sort of cut it out but

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.949 
correctly so it sort of cut it out but
he<00:02:45.270> could<00:02:45.390> still<00:02:45.600> hear<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.840> base<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.810> tell<00:02:48.810> me

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
he could still hear the base so tell me

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.930 
he could still hear the base so tell me
what<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.170> guys<00:02:49.290> think<00:02:49.350> on<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.610> difference

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
what you guys think on the difference

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.940 
what you guys think on the difference
between<00:02:51.090> mics<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.900> because<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.680> was<00:02:52.830> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
between mics if you because it was the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.600 
between mics if you because it was the
same<00:02:53.820> exact<00:02:54.120> volume<00:02:54.300> same<00:02:55.230> sub<00:02:55.590> same<00:02:55.920> box<00:02:56.160> same
