00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.289 
what I'm going to make for you today is
a<00:00:02.879> risotto<00:00:03.410> and<00:00:04.410> what<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:05.339> have<00:00:05.609> I'll<00:00:05.819> just<00:00:06.029> go

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
a risotto and what we have I'll just go

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.210 
a risotto and what we have I'll just go
over<00:00:06.480> them<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.140> have<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.680> number<00:00:08.040> of

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
over them is we have a number of

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.910 
over them is we have a number of
functions<00:00:08.880> on<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.420> machine<00:00:09.809> we<00:00:10.440> have<00:00:10.469> a

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
functions on the machine we have a

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.980 
functions on the machine we have a
high-pressure<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.389> for<00:00:12.630> basically

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
high-pressure and that is for basically

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.860 
high-pressure and that is for basically
when<00:00:13.259> you're<00:00:13.469> using<00:00:13.740> meats<00:00:14.219> chicken<00:00:15.120> etc<00:00:15.450> etc

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
when you're using meats chicken etc etc

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.130 
when you're using meats chicken etc etc
then<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:17.039> low<00:00:17.220> pressure<00:00:17.550> which<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.270> used<00:00:18.690> for

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
then a low pressure which is used for

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.820 
then a low pressure which is used for
soft<00:00:19.470> foods<00:00:19.740> soups<00:00:20.430> risottos<00:00:21.240> etc<00:00:21.869> etc<00:00:21.930> we

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
soft foods soups risottos etc etc we

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.109 
soft foods soups risottos etc etc we
also<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> sauteing<00:00:25.039> browning<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
also have a sauteing browning and a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.320 
also have a sauteing browning and a
simmering<00:00:27.510> function<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.260> well<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.150> which<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
simmering function as well and which is

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.910 
simmering function as well and which is
great<00:00:30.570> because<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.710> brown

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
great because you don't have to brown

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.500 
great because you don't have to brown
something<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> stove<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.059> then<00:00:33.120> put<00:00:33.390> it

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
something on a stove and then put it

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.870 
something on a stove and then put it
into<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.190> container<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.309> put<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.640> into<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
into the container and put it into the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.880 
into the container and put it into the
oven<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.840> done<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.290> again<00:00:37.590> as<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> was

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
oven it's all done so again as I was

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
oven it's all done so again as I was
saying<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:38.640> pot<00:00:38.910> solution<00:00:39.540> as<00:00:39.660> well

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
saying it's a one pot solution as well

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.799 
saying it's a one pot solution as well
once<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.800> has<00:00:41.100> finished<00:00:41.340> cooking<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.360> does<00:00:42.570> go

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
once it has finished cooking it does go

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.440 
once it has finished cooking it does go
over<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> keep<00:00:43.469> warm<00:00:43.710> function<00:00:43.920> at<00:00:44.670> about<00:00:44.940> 70

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
over to a keep warm function at about 70

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.970 
over to a keep warm function at about 70
degrees<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.110> will<00:00:46.140> keep<00:00:46.379> warm<00:00:46.710> for

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
degrees and it will keep warm for

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.479 
degrees and it will keep warm for
approximately<00:00:47.730> 12<00:00:48.059> hours<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.780> well<00:00:49.050> okay<00:00:49.860> so

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.410 
browning sauteing or simmering it will
only<00:01:28.049> go<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.790> pressure<00:01:30.390> functions<00:01:30.990> of

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
only go on for the pressure functions of

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.560 
only go on for the pressure functions of
I<00:01:31.450> love<00:01:31.750> okay<00:01:32.290> so<00:01:33.159> I'm<00:01:33.520> going<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:34.000> pop<00:01:34.299> a<00:01:34.330> little

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
just have to wait to that gets a little

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.940 
just have to wait to that gets a little
bit<00:01:58.250> warm<00:01:58.670> as<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.480> will<00:01:59.630> see<00:01:59.840> when<00:02:00.080> we<00:02:00.260> put<00:02:00.800> the

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
bit warm as you will see when we put the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.890 
bit warm as you will see when we put the
lid<00:02:01.130> on<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.490> we<00:02:01.940> want<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.240> pressure<00:02:02.480> to<00:02:02.690> come

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
lid on and we want the pressure to come

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.010 
lid on and we want the pressure to come
up<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:04.460> little<00:02:04.700> dot<00:02:05.030> there's<00:02:05.480> a<00:02:05.570> little<00:02:05.810> dot

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
up the little dot there's a little dot

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.160 
up the little dot there's a little dot
where<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.710> timer<00:02:07.010> is<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.550> flashes<00:02:08.149> when<00:02:08.990> it

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.800 
six minutes and press Start it's become
solid<00:05:08.250> now<00:05:09.250> it's<00:05:09.490> flashing

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
solid now it's flashing

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.350 
solid now it's flashing
you'll<00:05:11.320> find<00:05:11.620> once<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.430> gets<00:05:12.640> to<00:05:12.790> pressure<00:05:13.120> and

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
you'll find once it gets to pressure and

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.700 
you'll find once it gets to pressure and
that<00:05:13.480> will<00:05:13.630> take<00:05:13.840> probably<00:05:13.990> about<00:05:14.260> five

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
that will take probably about five

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.230 
that will take probably about five
minutes<00:05:15.310> then<00:05:16.210> it<00:05:16.570> will<00:05:17.100> start<00:05:18.100> to<00:05:18.550> count<00:05:18.970> down

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
minutes then it will start to count down

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.450 
minutes then it will start to count down
when<00:05:19.420> it<00:05:19.510> gets<00:05:19.570> to<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:19.960> right<00:05:20.140> pressure<00:05:20.470> and

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
when it gets to the right pressure and

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.910 
when it gets to the right pressure and
then<00:05:21.610> when<00:05:21.970> it's<00:05:22.120> ready<00:05:22.180> it'll<00:05:23.170> be<00:05:23.380> and<00:05:23.740> go

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
then when it's ready it'll be and go

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.460 
then when it's ready it'll be and go
over<00:05:24.100> to<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.370> capelin<00:05:24.790> function<00:05:25.270> if<00:05:26.020> we<00:05:26.080> just

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
over to the capelin function if we just

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.580 
over to the capelin function if we just
left<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:27.100> it<00:05:27.640> actually<00:05:27.910> would<00:05:28.590> depressurize

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
left it it actually would depressurize

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.610 
left it it actually would depressurize
itself<00:05:30.280> but<00:05:31.090> as<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.390> can<00:05:31.570> see<00:05:31.870> one<00:05:32.470> of<00:05:32.560> the

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
itself but as you can see one of the

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.400 
itself but as you can see one of the
safety<00:05:32.890> features<00:05:33.040> is<00:05:33.730> that<00:05:33.760> this<00:05:34.240> cannot<00:05:35.110> be

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
safety features is that this cannot be

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.080 
safety features is that this cannot be
opened<00:05:35.860> because<00:05:36.220> of<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:36.610> pressure<00:05:36.880> that's

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
opened because of the pressure that's

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.650 
opened because of the pressure that's
inside<00:05:37.690> it<00:05:37.720> so<00:05:38.650> as<00:05:39.130> I<00:05:39.400> said<00:05:39.610> as<00:05:39.760> time<00:05:40.240> goes<00:05:40.450> on

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
inside it so as I said as time goes on

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.170 
inside it so as I said as time goes on
we<00:05:41.020> would<00:05:41.230> be<00:05:41.260> eventually<00:05:41.950> be<00:05:42.100> able<00:05:42.250> to<00:05:42.460> but

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
we would be eventually be able to but

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.910 
we would be eventually be able to but
we're<00:05:43.330> going<00:05:43.660> to<00:05:43.810> give<00:05:43.990> it<00:05:44.110> a<00:05:44.170> quick<00:05:44.350> flick<00:05:44.740> so

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
we're going to give it a quick flick so

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.650 
we're going to give it a quick flick so
don't<00:05:45.130> get<00:05:45.340> scared

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.920 

and<00:05:51.660> wonderful<00:05:52.620> thing<00:05:52.800> with<00:05:52.980> it<00:05:53.160> as<00:05:53.310> well

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
and wonderful thing with it as well

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.180 
and wonderful thing with it as well
sometimes<00:05:54.930> if<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.200> don't<00:05:55.230> I<00:05:55.530> just<00:05:55.560> sort<00:05:56.130> of

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
sometimes if I don't I just sort of

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.850 
sometimes if I don't I just sort of
judge<00:05:56.520> the<00:05:56.790> ingredients<00:05:57.540> if<00:05:58.260> I<00:05:58.440> don't<00:05:58.650> think

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
judge the ingredients if I don't think

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.010 
judge the ingredients if I don't think
that<00:05:59.070> it's<00:05:59.220> cooked<00:05:59.430> enough<00:05:59.760> if<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:00.450> can<00:06:00.630> just

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
that it's cooked enough if I can just

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.540 
that it's cooked enough if I can just
put<00:06:01.140> the<00:06:01.230> lid<00:06:01.380> back<00:06:01.410> on<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.860> keep<00:06:02.100> warm

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
put the lid back on the keep warm

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.100 
put the lid back on the keep warm
and<00:06:02.730> it<00:06:02.820> will<00:06:02.940> cook<00:06:03.120> itself<00:06:03.630> because<00:06:03.930> it's

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
and it will cook itself because it's

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.830 
and it will cook itself because it's
around<00:06:04.320> 70<00:06:04.890> degrees<00:06:04.920> or<00:06:05.850> I<00:06:05.910> could<00:06:06.450> if<00:06:06.570> I<00:06:06.690> wanted

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
around 70 degrees or I could if I wanted

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.600 
around 70 degrees or I could if I wanted
to<00:06:07.170> obviously<00:06:07.380> put<00:06:07.710> it<00:06:07.980> on<00:06:08.100> for<00:06:08.370> a<00:06:08.430> bit<00:06:08.460> longer

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
to obviously put it on for a bit longer

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.490 
to obviously put it on for a bit longer
of<00:06:09.090> course<00:06:09.480> it<00:06:09.660> wouldn't<00:06:09.810> take<00:06:10.080> as<00:06:10.290> long<00:06:10.440> to

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
of course it wouldn't take as long to

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.170 
of course it wouldn't take as long to
get<00:06:10.770> to<00:06:10.920> pressure<00:06:11.160> because<00:06:11.760> it's<00:06:11.970> already

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
get to pressure because it's already

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.810 
get to pressure because it's already
gone<00:06:12.570> that

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
gone that

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.030 
gone that
he<00:06:14.820> is<00:06:15.060> feeding<00:06:15.510> it

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
he is feeding it

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.370 
he is feeding it
I<00:06:17.100> said<00:06:17.730> this<00:06:17.850> with<00:06:18.060> a<00:06:18.090> bit<00:06:18.300> of<00:06:18.330> steam<00:06:18.690> but<00:06:19.080> I

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
I said this with a bit of steam but I

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:29.730 
I said this with a bit of steam but I
still<00:06:20.370> can't<00:06:20.700> just<00:06:21.360> see<00:06:22.080> what<00:06:22.320> there<00:06:22.620> we<00:06:22.710> go

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.820 

so<00:06:30.070> what<00:06:30.310> I'm<00:06:30.400> going<00:06:30.640> to<00:06:30.730> do<00:06:31.080> these<00:06:32.080> all

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
so what I'm going to do these all

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.540 
so what I'm going to do these all
risotto

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
risotto

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:42.300 
risotto
needs<00:06:34.030> some<00:06:34.300> cheating<00:06:40.770> it's<00:06:41.770> going<00:06:41.980> to<00:06:42.130> pop

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
needs some cheating it's going to pop

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.250 
needs some cheating it's going to pop
some<00:06:42.610> Parmesan<00:06:43.270> cheese<00:06:43.300> and<00:06:43.630> I<00:06:43.720> hope<00:06:43.900> everyone

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
some Parmesan cheese and I hope everyone

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.530 
some Parmesan cheese and I hope everyone
likes<00:06:44.290> fantasy<00:06:44.950> cheese<00:06:45.160> before<00:06:45.460> I<00:06:45.670> said<00:06:46.660> that

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
likes fantasy cheese before I said that

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.070 
likes fantasy cheese before I said that
just<00:06:49.540> going<00:06:49.720> to<00:06:49.810> stir<00:06:50.260> it<00:06:50.530> around<00:06:52.080> probably

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
just going to stir it around probably

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.870 
just going to stir it around probably
could<00:06:53.290> do<00:06:53.470> with<00:06:53.650> maybe<00:06:53.920> another<00:06:54.040> few<00:06:54.580> minutes

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
could do with maybe another few minutes

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.860 
could do with maybe another few minutes
the<00:06:55.060> cheese<00:06:55.390> actually<00:06:55.660> does<00:06:56.050> help<00:06:56.290> it<00:06:56.500> as<00:06:56.590> well
