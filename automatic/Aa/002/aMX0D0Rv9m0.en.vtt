00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.370

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.800
 our morale in relation to 3 o'clock 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.750
 I'm going to record that now 56 then it's 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.820

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.079
 Likes to stay in roger and relax keeps 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.030
 the cariocas in the channel and probably 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.460
 Sunday already has that in the case is our 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.609
 top 5 is ipi you did not understand why the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.500
 top-5 letter to which pen hand signaled the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.760

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.700

 like it took too little latinos 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.440
