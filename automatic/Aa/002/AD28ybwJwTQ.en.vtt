and loosen up the rear shackles start
with<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.160> bottom<00:02:16.340> first

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.880 

that's<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.570> good<00:02:30.750> idea<00:02:30.780> since<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.410> want<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> take

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
that's a good idea since we want to take

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.640 
that's a good idea since we want to take
a<00:02:31.920> look<00:02:32.220> at<00:02:32.460> how<00:02:32.880> this<00:02:33.090> shackle<00:02:33.630> says<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.470> know

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
a look at how this shackle says you know

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:55.490 
a look at how this shackle says you know
when<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:34.950> goes<00:02:35.100> back<00:02:53.750> put<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:54.840> aside<00:02:54.960> for

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
when it goes back put it aside for

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.310 
when it goes back put it aside for
reinstallation<00:02:59.450> so<00:03:00.450> now<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.660> rear<00:03:01.050> bolt

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
reinstallation so now the rear bolt

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.230 
reinstallation so now the rear bolt
removed<00:03:01.740> we<00:03:02.400> want<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.670> go<00:03:02.730> ahead<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.120> loosen

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
removed we want to go ahead and loosen

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:13.750 
removed we want to go ahead and loosen
up<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.740> run<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.970> here<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.330> might<00:03:12.480> need

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
up the run so here you might need

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.340 
up the run so here you might need
tension<00:03:14.760> or<00:03:14.940> breaker<00:03:15.420> bars<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.960> get<00:03:16.080> a<00:03:16.110> loose

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
tension or breaker bars to get a loose

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.630 
tension or breaker bars to get a loose
once<00:03:16.740> you<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.100> loose<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.430> get<00:03:17.610> a

once you get it loose you can get a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:31.370 
once you get it loose you can get a
ratchet<00:03:18.030> on<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.360> get<00:03:18.840> out

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.290 

now<00:03:32.380> use<00:03:32.590> taking<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.130> off<00:03:33.280> with<00:03:33.940> your<00:03:34.090> hand

and you will not be using the u-bolts

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.450 
and you will not be using the u-bolts
again

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460
