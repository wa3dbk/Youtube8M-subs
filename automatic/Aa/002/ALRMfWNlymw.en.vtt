00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.910
 new video on minecraft pocket 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.090
 edition so for the last part in 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.399

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.090
 creation this in fact I'm writing a map 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.960
 2025 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.350
 so that's it, I'm done 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.600
 map 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.379
 in fact I was billion but I have not 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.190
 need to make video 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.550
 so if that's done today then here I 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.829
 specifies that I see these videos 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.250
 ah the good plan of the geek and as 1e his 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.140
 flagship therefore that of the Community field 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.660
 so communal cfa ben actually it's for 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.230
 mathias a community channel dedicated to 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.629
 Minecraft 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.609
 then the right ixengine dikes plan for 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.239
 respond to the attempted video game in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.960
 general 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.830
 so that's it so we'll start 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.970
 introduce you to the map 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.680
 so here if a stand 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.710
 if there are buses we are all there 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.940
 lagarde the barrier 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.810
 the buses are still in the swing there 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.570
 the little shed 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.940
 was here I too what is 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.760
 but it's a case that looks like a 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.140
 little brush here on the stairs for 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.200
 to ride a romÃ©o must not go all of 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.730
 so here we hired so I admit 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.480
 it's a little bit his mail agoston 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.830
 and illuminates no true yes for those who 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.320
 do not know it but if ever I will pass 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.479
 on like a severe crisis the banks 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.720
 in this case, I'm a Quebecer so 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.750
 sorry my access I know you 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.560
 understand my accent but I'm sorry 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.440
 I do like that here it says so 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:07.910
 here we cook it fine to miss a little 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:09.440
 and if we then have the divine as well as the 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.360
 focus here is the red focus 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.030
 here we have the table with luck so 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.560
 it's still a little sorry lagos time 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.380
 walk for earlier here we have the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.810
 hearty office medicine ariary and all 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.760
 the enemies who walks past the door 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:31.519
 here we have the bed of blaye with the room 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.010
 this is it and if we small 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.040
 car 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.830
 so it's safe for the blue house 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.920
 election of the arm below here it is 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.769
 just like here we have cases with the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.870
 this is my blue truck and on our 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.970
 the bus so a little weird 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.190
 the bus I'll admit it but he 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.310
 does not look like that in a doctor 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.230
 2025 so also I want to clarify that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.180
 I am first youtube to shout it has me 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.700
 more so I still pretty proud of 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.860
 me but it's not so serious and spock 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.890
 frankly it's just 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.790
 impressive 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.910
 So here is the little box 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.440
 blue so sidewalks with spad 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.330
 so I have not done yours that 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.550
 continue because anything for 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.800
 you 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.110
 this little bit of work to have in 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.330
 do it because we do not go outside 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.900
 of the machine precisely done inside 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.090
 of the brand 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.550
 as you see not otherwise it would do 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.020
 to go do it other than me so that 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.910
 here we have the car between red and 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.000
 nokia's share 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.630
 so here we have the orange house so we 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.510
 go from the andes 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.100
 here it's sure it defends but the like 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.640
 stone with media forms are 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.650
 illusionary 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:50.440
 finally here we have the couches with 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.800
 living room makes it just right there 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.950
 paintings multiply everywhere here on 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.380
 had the dining room that we can get 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.110
 put here a corner and everything so that's it 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.450
 the counters are here here we are the 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.700
 trash with blue and green garbage 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.450
 that in fact we will mount a bone so the 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.370
 Socialists we see the vision that if 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.200
 we can what is boring as a little 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.600
 like in the other and kill all 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.080
 enemies who pass by Madame here 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:24.130
 if we had led a small strawberry 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.110
 orange so here we do not read them with a 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.970
 TV who had here but I did a 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.690
 asshole big bet is not serious 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.410
 not the end of the world 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.890
 so in any case not yet 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:40.990
 so here it was a kind of sheds 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:42.730
 weird with a blue hue gave way 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.830
 Quite weird I found it's really 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.450
 strange when I saw what I did 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.480
 better than I could to recreate but 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.740
 it was really so that's why 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:56.650
 here we go to spain 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.570
 here we are small garden so for 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.810
 real you can not miss so I did 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.850
 I put the letter I made a door 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:10.490
 that the door can be opened but can 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:14.830
 not so that's what it's me 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:20.090
 hop here we had the nuclear bri 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:22.039
 that's right then if I did a 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.599
 hole actually enough for the air hole 6 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.349
 houses that I have not done 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.910
 outdoors 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:32.000
 that's why I think I'm going in 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:35.180
 mouth and that's good coop so I think 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.060
