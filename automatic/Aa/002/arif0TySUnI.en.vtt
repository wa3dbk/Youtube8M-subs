00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
thing about the jigging scene is that

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.900 
thing about the jigging scene is that
it's<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.350> nature<00:01:33.770> of<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:34.069> fish<00:01:34.369> that<00:01:34.640> really

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
it's the nature of the fish that really

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.520 
it's the nature of the fish that really
determines<00:01:35.240> how<00:01:35.690> you're<00:01:35.929> going<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.200> approach

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
determines how you're going to approach

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.130 
determines how you're going to approach
the<00:01:36.860> fish<00:01:37.039> when<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.399> comes<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.970> jigging<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:38.479> I

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
the fish when it comes to jigging and I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.020 
the fish when it comes to jigging and I
mean<00:01:39.289> that's<00:01:39.440> obvious<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:40.160> mean<00:01:40.340> if<00:01:40.789> it's

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
mean that's obvious I mean if it's

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.600 
mean that's obvious I mean if it's
bluegills<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:41.780> that's<00:01:41.960> perch<00:01:42.410> and<00:01:42.740> but<00:01:43.399> yeah

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
bluegills and that's perch and but yeah

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.130 
bluegills and that's perch and but yeah
I<00:01:43.670> mean<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:43.940> go<00:01:44.060> from<00:01:44.300> blue<00:01:44.450> gills<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.899> even

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
I mean you go from blue gills to even

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.230 
I mean you go from blue gills to even
perch<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.679> you<00:01:45.770> have<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.100> change<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:46.940> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
perch and you have to change the the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.880 
perch and you have to change the the
bluegill<00:01:47.600> prefers<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.080> little<00:01:48.229> bit<00:01:48.530> different

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
bluegill prefers a little bit different

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.770 
bluegill prefers a little bit different
lure<00:01:49.069> than<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.459> perch<00:01:49.670> does<00:01:49.970> often<00:01:50.330> times<00:01:50.539> not

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
lure than the perch does often times not

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.300 
lure than the perch does often times not
that<00:01:50.840> they<00:01:51.110> won't<00:01:51.259> both<00:01:51.500> eat<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:51.830> same<00:01:52.009> thing

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
that they won't both eat the same thing

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.639 
that they won't both eat the same thing
and<00:01:52.550> so<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.209> is<00:01:53.360> when<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.720> comes<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:54.170> let's<00:01:54.410> say

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
and so it is when it comes to let's say

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.680 
and so it is when it comes to let's say
pike<00:01:55.660> pike<00:01:56.660> we'll<00:01:57.020> take<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:58.580> horizontal<00:01:59.119> bait

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
pike pike we'll take a horizontal bait

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.660 
pike pike we'll take a horizontal bait
like<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.229> puppet<00:02:01.100> minnow

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
like the puppet minnow

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.219 
like the puppet minnow
they'll<00:02:02.090> eat<00:02:02.300> these<00:02:02.450> tubes<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:03.110> were

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
they'll eat these tubes that were

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.199 
they'll eat these tubes that were
fishing<00:02:03.470> with<00:02:03.800> right<00:02:04.069> here<00:02:04.340> but<00:02:04.789> if<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.000> had

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
fishing with right here but if you had

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.749 
fishing with right here but if you had
to<00:02:05.240> select<00:02:05.810> for<00:02:06.080> pike<00:02:06.289> it<00:02:06.950> probably<00:02:07.490> would<00:02:07.640> be

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
to select for pike it probably would be

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.210 
to select for pike it probably would be
that<00:02:08.030> that<00:02:08.390> puppet<00:02:08.780> minnow<00:02:08.990> yes<00:02:09.380> but<00:02:10.039> they'll

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
that that puppet minnow yes but they'll

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.250 
that that puppet minnow yes but they'll
they'll<00:02:10.640> eat<00:02:10.789> just<00:02:10.819> about<00:02:11.120> anything<00:02:11.510> but<00:02:11.840> so

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
they'll eat just about anything but so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.400 
they'll eat just about anything but so
then<00:02:12.440> when<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.770> comes<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.819> lake<00:02:14.060> trout<00:02:14.410> we

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
then when it comes to the lake trout we

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.110 
then when it comes to the lake trout we
know<00:02:15.620> they'll<00:02:15.890> eat<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.280> puppet<00:02:16.640> minnow<00:02:16.849> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
know they'll eat that puppet minnow and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.699 
know they'll eat that puppet minnow and
we're<00:02:17.330> talking<00:02:17.510> about<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.900> bait<00:02:18.230> that<00:02:18.260> is

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
we're talking about a bait that is

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.890 
we're talking about a bait that is
horizontal<00:02:19.069> swings<00:02:19.610> like<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.540> overall

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
horizontal swings like that but overall

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.280 
horizontal swings like that but overall
still<00:02:21.530> it's<00:02:22.400> this<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.510> know<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> tube<00:02:23.990> style

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290

still it's this you know the tube style
oops<00:02:24.920> I'll<00:02:25.160> bait<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.760> think<00:02:25.970> part<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.270> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
oops I'll bait and I think part of the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.730 
oops I'll bait and I think part of the
reason<00:02:26.420> god<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:27.050> thought<00:02:27.230> we<00:02:27.380> were<00:02:27.500> fishing

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
reason god we thought we were fishing

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.410 
reason god we thought we were fishing
crappies<00:02:28.280> a<00:02:28.310> week<00:02:28.550> ago<00:02:28.849> and<00:02:28.970> we<00:02:29.060> talked<00:02:29.300> about

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
crappies a week ago and we talked about

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.390 
crappies a week ago and we talked about
taking<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:29.990> away<00:02:30.110> from<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.590> fish<00:02:30.800> turning

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
taking it away from the fish turning

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.949 
taking it away from the fish turning
them<00:02:31.520> on<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.849> mean<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.510> we're<00:02:32.630> doing<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.930> same

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
them on I mean and we're doing the same

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.720 
them on I mean and we're doing the same
thing<00:02:33.410> here<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:33.709> taking<00:02:34.099> it<00:02:34.220> away<00:02:34.310> from<00:02:34.430> a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
thing here but taking it away from a

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.490 
thing here but taking it away from a
lake<00:02:34.910> trout<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.330> taking<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.050> away<00:02:36.110> from<00:02:36.380> a

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
lake trout and taking it away from a

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.559 
lake trout and taking it away from a
grub<00:02:36.769> you're<00:02:37.010> -<00:02:37.159> when<00:02:37.670> we're<00:02:37.819> doing<00:02:37.970> crappies

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
grub you're - when we're doing crappies

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.270 
grub you're - when we're doing crappies
it's<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.170> lake<00:02:39.590> trout<00:02:39.769> you<00:02:39.920> can<00:02:40.099> reel

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
it's like this lake trout you can reel

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.890 
it's like this lake trout you can reel
like<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.849> well<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.120> fact

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
like that and well in fact

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.869 
like that and well in fact
don't<00:02:42.079> you<00:02:42.200> show<00:02:42.500> them<00:02:42.739> you<00:02:43.340> know<00:02:43.459> exactly

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
don't you show them you know exactly

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.420 
don't you show them you know exactly
because<00:02:44.569> the<00:02:45.140> jigging<00:02:45.500> motion<00:02:45.890> is<00:02:46.040> different

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
because the jigging motion is different

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.979 
because the jigging motion is different
it's<00:02:46.549> more<00:02:46.730> pronounced<00:02:47.329> and<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.689> can<00:02:47.840> show

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
it's more pronounced and you can show

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.869 
it's more pronounced and you can show
them<00:02:48.019> that<00:02:48.319> as<00:02:48.470> you<00:02:48.560> get<00:02:48.680> going<00:02:48.860> here<00:02:49.159> sure<00:02:49.640> I

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
them that as you get going here sure I

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.380 
them that as you get going here sure I
got<00:02:50.299> go<00:02:50.870> back<00:02:51.079> over<00:02:51.379> there<00:02:51.560> and<00:02:51.680> catch<00:02:51.860> me<00:02:52.069> one

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
got go back over there and catch me one

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.670 
got go back over there and catch me one
I'll<00:02:53.390> show<00:02:53.420> you<00:02:53.659> the<00:02:53.900> jigging<00:02:54.260> cadence

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
I'll show you the jigging cadence

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.990 
I'll show you the jigging cadence
because<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.040> think<00:02:55.099> it's<00:02:55.400> really<00:02:55.610> really

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
because I think it's really really

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.929 
because I think it's really really
important<00:02:56.569> here<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.860> just<00:02:58.370> as<00:02:58.489> I<00:02:58.579> let<00:02:58.790> this

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
important here and just as I let this

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.660 
important here and just as I let this
out<00:02:59.180> the<00:03:00.109> real<00:03:00.319> key<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.069> fact<00:03:01.310> that<00:03:01.400> lake

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
out the real key is the fact that lake

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.750 
out the real key is the fact that lake
trout<00:03:01.909> are<00:03:02.060> cold<00:03:02.329> water<00:03:02.599> fish<00:03:02.930> they<00:03:03.200> love<00:03:03.760> cold

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
trout are cold water fish they love cold

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.569 
trout are cold water fish they love cold
water<00:03:05.060> 48<00:03:05.780> 52<00:03:06.200> degrees<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.950> even<00:03:07.010> cooler<00:03:07.519> than

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
water 48 52 degrees and even cooler than

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.119 
water 48 52 degrees and even cooler than
that<00:03:07.849> so<00:03:08.120> when<00:03:08.810> we<00:03:08.989> talk<00:03:09.230> about<00:03:09.260> jigging<00:03:10.099> for

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
that so when we talk about jigging for

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.099 
that so when we talk about jigging for
them<00:03:10.549> it's<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.819> much<00:03:11.060> more<00:03:11.299> aggressive<00:03:11.420> jig

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
them it's a much more aggressive jig

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.830 
them it's a much more aggressive jig
than<00:03:12.319> say<00:03:12.500> crappies<00:03:13.069> or<00:03:13.280> walleye<00:03:13.519> or<00:03:13.760> some<00:03:14.750> of

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
than say crappies or walleye or some of

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.509 
than say crappies or walleye or some of
the<00:03:14.900> warm<00:03:15.109> water<00:03:15.409> species<00:03:15.769> that'll<00:03:16.280> still

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
the warm water species that'll still

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.030 
the warm water species that'll still
bite<00:03:16.700> in<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:16.970> winter<00:03:17.180> time<00:03:17.359> but<00:03:17.650> so<00:03:18.650> I'm<00:03:18.829> down

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
bite in the winter time but so I'm down

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.479 
bite in the winter time but so I'm down
there<00:03:20.019> and<00:03:21.019> I<00:03:21.109> just<00:03:21.319> like<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.590> hold<00:03:21.739> my<00:03:21.920> rod

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
there and I just like to hold my rod

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.430 
there and I just like to hold my rod
like<00:03:22.790> this<00:03:23.030> too<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.329> I<00:03:23.389> always<00:03:23.629> keep<00:03:23.930> my<00:03:23.989> hand

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
like this too and I always keep my hand

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.879 
like this too and I always keep my hand
over<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.310> Bale<00:03:25.489> so<00:03:25.790> if<00:03:25.909> the<00:03:26.060> odd<00:03:26.209> time<00:03:26.480> I've

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
over the Bale so if the odd time I've

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.530 
over the Bale so if the odd time I've
taken<00:03:27.889> the<00:03:28.099> ante<00:03:28.400> release<00:03:28.700> off<00:03:28.939> I<00:03:29.120> know<00:03:29.180> that

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
taken the ante release off I know that

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.330 
taken the ante release off I know that
trout<00:03:29.870> can<00:03:30.079> never<00:03:30.230> take<00:03:30.470> line<00:03:30.769> off<00:03:31.010> when<00:03:31.250> he

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
trout can never take line off when he

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.580 
trout can never take line off when he
hits<00:03:31.579> but<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.359> key<00:03:32.510> for<00:03:32.689> me<00:03:32.840> is<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:33.019> Kate<00:03:33.379> this

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
hits but the key for me is a Kate this

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.550 
hits but the key for me is a Kate this
is<00:03:33.799> just<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.159> nice<00:03:34.340> swim<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.810> lift<00:03:36.109> up<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.500> I

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
is just a nice swim and I lift up and I

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.259 
is just a nice swim and I lift up and I
fall<00:03:36.829> down<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:37.220> it's<00:03:37.310> controlled<00:03:37.849> slack

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
fall down and it's controlled slack

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.420 
fall down and it's controlled slack
there<00:03:38.659> so<00:03:39.290> now<00:03:39.409> it's<00:03:39.590> on<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:39.769> bottom

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
there so now it's on the bottom

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.000 
there so now it's on the bottom
lift<00:03:40.970> it<00:03:41.150> up<00:03:41.269> that's<00:03:42.019> attracting<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.799> fish

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
lift it up that's attracting the fish

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.830 
lift it up that's attracting the fish
it's<00:03:43.250> falling<00:03:43.730> in<00:03:43.849> a<00:03:43.939> spiral<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.689> I'm

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
it's falling in a spiral and I'm

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.539 
it's falling in a spiral and I'm
following<00:03:45.109> it<00:03:45.500> down<00:03:45.680> a<00:03:45.709> case<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.160> hits<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.489> on

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
following it down a case it hits it on

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.819 
following it down a case it hits it on
the<00:03:46.609> fall<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.209> then<00:03:47.870> when<00:03:48.049> I<00:03:48.079> hit<00:03:48.319> the<00:03:48.470> bottom

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
the fall and then when I hit the bottom

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.589 
the fall and then when I hit the bottom
there<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.220> always<00:03:49.669> like<00:03:49.819> to<00:03:49.849> pop<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.419> two<00:03:50.569> or

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
there I always like to pop it two or

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.629 
there I always like to pop it two or
three<00:03:50.720> times<00:03:50.959> like<00:03:51.349> that<00:03:51.530> on<00:03:51.709> slack<00:03:52.069> line<00:03:52.400> and

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
three times like that on slack line and

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.849 
three times like that on slack line and
the<00:03:53.209> tail<00:03:53.419> now<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.720> tails<00:03:54.079> floating<00:03:54.680> all<00:03:54.829> over

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
the tail now the tails floating all over

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.220 
the tail now the tails floating all over
it's<00:03:55.400> moving<00:03:55.819> around<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.720> think<00:03:57.049> it's

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
it's moving around you think it's

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.659 
it's moving around you think it's
pausing<00:03:57.769> there<00:03:57.919> but<00:03:58.069> that<00:03:58.220> baits<00:03:58.459> still

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
pausing there but that baits still

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.809 
pausing there but that baits still
moving<00:03:59.150> ever<00:03:59.329> so<00:03:59.419> subtly<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.980> real<00:04:01.340> key<00:04:01.639> with

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
moving ever so subtly the real key with

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.189 
moving ever so subtly the real key with
lake<00:04:02.030> trout<00:04:02.239> though<00:04:02.389> is<00:04:02.510> you've<00:04:02.629> got<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.049> watch

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.199 
lake trout though is you've got to watch

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.280 
lake trout though is you've got to watch
your<00:04:03.409> sonar<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.239> can<00:04:05.419> see<00:04:05.569> my<00:04:05.750> bait<00:04:05.959> on<00:04:06.169> the

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
your sonar and I can see my bait on the

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.409 
your sonar and I can see my bait on the
sonar<00:04:06.650> perfectly<00:04:07.280> right<00:04:07.489> now<00:04:07.669> but<00:04:08.239> if<00:04:08.329> that

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
sonar perfectly right now but if that

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.670 
sonar perfectly right now but if that
was<00:04:08.569> the<00:04:08.659> lake<00:04:08.810> trout<00:04:08.959> I<00:04:09.049> see<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.319> lake<00:04:09.530> trout

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
was the lake trout I see a lake trout

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.589 
was the lake trout I see a lake trout
coming<00:04:10.010> in<00:04:10.190> right<00:04:10.310> now<00:04:10.370> I'd<00:04:10.669> lift<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:11.269> up<00:04:11.359> very

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
coming in right now I'd lift it up very

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.089 
coming in right now I'd lift it up very
quickly<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:12.199> problem<00:04:12.680> with<00:04:12.829> doing<00:04:12.979> that

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
quickly the problem with doing that

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.920 
quickly the problem with doing that
that's<00:04:13.669> usually<00:04:13.940> when<00:04:14.239> they<00:04:14.359> hit<00:04:14.479> at<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.750> top

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
that's usually when they hit at the top

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.839 
that's usually when they hit at the top
of<00:04:15.109> the<00:04:15.229> lift<00:04:15.409> so<00:04:15.949> now<00:04:16.099> you've<00:04:16.280> got<00:04:16.310> nowhere<00:04:16.639> to

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
of the lift so now you've got nowhere to

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:19.870 
of the lift so now you've got nowhere to
go<00:04:17.000> so<00:04:17.030> what<00:04:17.389> I<00:04:17.419> like<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.840> do<00:04:18.099> is<00:04:19.099> reel<00:04:19.549> it<00:04:19.760> up

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
go so what I like to do is reel it up

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.699 
go so what I like to do is reel it up
take<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.209> as<00:04:20.389> fast<00:04:20.690> as<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:21.019> can<00:04:21.079> away<00:04:21.440> from<00:04:21.470> the

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709
