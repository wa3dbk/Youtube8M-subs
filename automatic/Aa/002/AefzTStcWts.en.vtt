00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and I definitely definitely recommend

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.350 
and I definitely definitely recommend
that<00:01:43.040> because<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.030> stunts

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
that because there is all you get stunts

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.270 
that because there is all you get stunts
so<00:01:45.540> much<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:45.990> game<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.409> if<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.130> don't

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
so much in this game and if you don't

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.560 
so much in this game and if you don't
have<00:01:47.369> tactical<00:01:47.640> mask<00:01:47.909> it's<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.390> much

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
have tactical mask it's really not much

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.719 
have tactical mask it's really not much
you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.869> do<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.350> stunned<00:01:49.729> majority

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you can do if you get stunned majority

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.100 
you can do if you get stunned majority
of<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> time<00:01:51.060> you're<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.720> get<00:01:51.840> rushed

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
of the time you're going to get rushed

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.289 
of the time you're going to get rushed
and<00:01:52.320> you're<00:01:52.470> going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.619> get<00:01:52.770> killed<00:01:53.119> also<00:01:54.119> for

I really<00:02:12.450> haven't<00:02:12.780> played<00:02:13.020> respawn<00:02:13.440> so<00:02:13.710> I

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
I really haven't played respawn so I

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.560 
I really haven't played respawn so I
don't<00:02:14.400> know<00:02:14.520> any<00:02:14.700> other<00:02:14.730> higher<00:02:15.030> killstreaks

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570

don't know any other higher killstreaks
hands<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.250> but<00:02:17.250> these<00:02:17.430> are<00:02:17.490> definitely

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
hands like that but these are definitely

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.730 
hands like that but these are definitely
three<00:02:18.270> killstreaks<00:02:18.750> i<00:02:18.930> recommend<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.500> using

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
three killstreaks i recommend you using
