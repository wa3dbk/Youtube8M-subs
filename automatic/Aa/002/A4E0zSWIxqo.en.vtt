that is dangerous to people there are

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.050 
that is dangerous to people there are
thousands<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.619> things<00:00:22.740> out<00:00:23.010> there<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.850> if<00:00:23.970> you

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
thousands of things out there but if you

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.599 
thousands of things out there but if you
can<00:00:24.240> break<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.600> cycle<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.710> toxicity<00:00:26.189> by

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
can break the cycle of that toxicity by

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.400 
can break the cycle of that toxicity by
pointing<00:00:27.029> out<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.359> absurdity<00:00:27.930> which<00:00:28.170> of

pointing out one absurdity which of

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.990 
pointing out one absurdity which of
which<00:00:28.560> aspartame<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
which aspartame is that and then the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.700 
which aspartame is that and then the

scientists say quite frequently is that
very<00:02:06.740> shortly<00:02:07.070> after<00:02:07.640> a<00:02:07.670> regulatory<00:02:08.119> agency

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
very shortly after a regulatory agency

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.630 
very shortly after a regulatory agency
is<00:02:08.840> created<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.560> gets<00:02:09.770> captured<00:02:10.100> by<00:02:10.459> those

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
is created it gets captured by those

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.760 
is created it gets captured by those

that are regulates that's kind of what

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.830 
that are regulates that's kind of what
people<00:02:13.310> say<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:13.730> repeatedly<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.630> think

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
people say that repeatedly and I think

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.900 
people say that repeatedly and I think
they're<00:02:14.989> totally<00:02:15.440> wrong<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.920> believe<00:02:16.730> they're

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
they're totally wrong I believe they're

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.449 
they're totally wrong I believe they're
born<00:02:17.150> captured<00:02:17.630> if<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:18.739> did<00:02:18.980> that<00:02:19.010> up<00:02:19.280> with

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
born captured if you did that up with

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.910 
born captured if you did that up with
vitamin<00:02:19.940> C<00:02:20.180> tomorrow<00:02:20.810> vitamin<00:02:21.350> C<00:02:21.560> would<00:02:21.800> be

vitamin C tomorrow vitamin C would be

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.650 
vitamin C tomorrow vitamin C would be
gone<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.700> chemical<00:02:23.030> industry<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.360> always

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
gone so the chemical industry is always

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.330 
gone so the chemical industry is always
trying<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.989> find<00:02:24.080> ways<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.860> stick<00:02:25.160> their

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
trying to find ways to stick their

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.490 
trying to find ways to stick their
chemicals<00:02:25.790> into<00:02:26.570> us<00:02:26.690> without<00:02:26.900> doing<00:02:27.170> proper

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
chemicals into us without doing proper

testing do that we're eating now the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.650 
testing do that we're eating now the

chilliness IBD pencil heart problem all

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.130 
chilliness IBD pencil heart problem all
coming<00:02:39.620> from<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:39.920> bad<00:02:40.220> foods<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.510> we<00:02:41.660> get<00:02:41.900> in

coming from the bad foods that we get in
their<00:02:42.290> grocery<00:02:42.800> stand<00:02:43.130> but<00:02:44.090> what's<00:02:44.239> left<00:02:44.480> to

their grocery stand but what's left to
eat<00:02:44.840> now<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.380> mean<00:02:45.650> realistically<00:02:45.950> we<00:02:46.310> were

eat now I mean realistically we were

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.330 
eat now I mean realistically we were
