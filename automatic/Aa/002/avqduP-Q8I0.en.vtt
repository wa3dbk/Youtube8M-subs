00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.580 
of like finesse I think to where you can
do<00:03:04.300> special<00:03:04.660> moves<00:03:04.840> like<00:03:05.020> doing<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.350> ground

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
do special moves like doing a ground

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.050 
do special moves like doing a ground
pound<00:03:05.830> or<00:03:06.010> something<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.670> you<00:03:06.880> can<00:03:06.910> bounce

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
pound or something and you can bounce

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.610 
pound or something and you can bounce
off<00:03:07.240> something<00:03:07.540> punch<00:03:07.780> in<00:03:07.900> midair<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.440> like

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
off something punch in midair and like

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.250 
off something punch in midair and like
there's<00:03:09.340> punch<00:03:09.910> juggling<00:03:10.510> where<00:03:10.810> your<00:03:10.959> slow

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
there's punch juggling where your slow

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.990 
there's punch juggling where your slow
motion<00:03:11.650> punching<00:03:12.070> like<00:03:12.310> this<00:03:12.489> thing<00:03:12.730> for<00:03:12.970> a

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
motion punching like this thing for a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.180 
motion punching like this thing for a
bunch<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.269> times<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.720> it's<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.590> the

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
bunch of times and it's just the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.770 
bunch of times and it's just the
emphasis<00:03:15.580> on<00:03:15.700> punching<00:03:16.030> stuff<00:03:16.269> as<00:03:16.480> cool<00:03:16.660> as

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
emphasis on punching stuff as cool as

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.100 
emphasis on punching stuff as cool as
possible<00:03:16.810> so<00:03:17.820> Racing's<00:03:18.820> fast<00:03:19.420> steering

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
possible so Racing's fast steering

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.360 
possible so Racing's fast steering
punching<00:03:20.590> all<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:22.450> lot<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.989> intensity<00:03:23.440> how

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
punching all a lot of intensity how

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.430 
punching all a lot of intensity how
what's<00:03:24.640> uh<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.269> average<00:03:25.750> length<00:03:25.959> of<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.260> game

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
what's uh the average length of a game

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.850 
what's uh the average length of a game
what<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:26.709> say<00:03:27.239> for<00:03:28.239> one<00:03:28.690> quest<00:03:29.110> it's<00:03:29.470> probably

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
what you say for one quest it's probably

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.210 
what you say for one quest it's probably
like<00:03:30.070> five<00:03:30.400> minutes<00:03:30.430> or<00:03:30.989> two<00:03:31.989> minutes<00:03:32.260> to

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
question or two so in two minutes you

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.160 
question or two so in two minutes you
can<00:03:35.380> punch<00:03:35.590> like<00:03:35.950> probably<00:03:36.459> 20<00:03:36.760> x<00:03:36.970> 20<00:03:37.690> punches

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
that's what ten punches per minute

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.930 
that's what ten punches per minute
that's<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:41.080> whoa<00:03:42.010> how<00:03:42.370> many<00:03:42.519> punches<00:03:42.700> per

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
that's a whoa how many punches per

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.180 
that's a whoa how many punches per
minute<00:03:43.209> haha<00:03:43.720> we<00:03:44.170> haven't<00:03:44.380> quite<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.680> measure

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
minute haha we haven't quite a measure

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.770 
minute haha we haven't quite a measure
that<00:03:45.280> yeah<00:03:45.550> that's<00:03:45.670> an<00:03:45.820> important<00:03:46.150> metric<00:03:46.540> I

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
that yeah that's an important metric I

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.660 
that yeah that's an important metric I
guess<00:03:47.100> we'll<00:03:48.100> get<00:03:48.220> back<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.459> me<00:03:48.519> on<00:03:48.550> that

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
guess we'll get back to me on that

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.310 
guess we'll get back to me on that
