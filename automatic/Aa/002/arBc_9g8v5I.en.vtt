anyway<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:22.460> aside<00:02:22.960> so<00:02:23.960> we<00:02:24.730> all<00:02:25.730> know<00:02:25.760> how

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
anyway that aside so we all know how

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.930

Warner's<00:02:26.510> operate<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.350> know<00:02:27.610> they<00:02:28.610> like<00:02:28.760> to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
Warner's operate you know they like to

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.550

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
so it kind of made sense for them to

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.510 
so it kind of made sense for them to
push<00:02:32.810> Man<00:02:33.380> of<00:02:33.410> Steel<00:02:33.740> back<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.190> summer<00:02:34.400> of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.420 
back I think to 2013 as well all I think
it<00:03:50.020> was<00:03:50.110> supposed<00:03:50.440> to<00:03:50.530> come<00:03:50.680> out<00:03:50.800> summer<00:03:51.250> of

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
it was supposed to come out summer of

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.410 
it was supposed to come out summer of
next<00:03:51.580> year<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:51.910> i<00:03:51.940> think<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.210> going<00:03:52.330> to<00:03:52.390> be

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
next year but i think is going to be

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.680 
next year but i think is going to be
later<00:03:52.780> on<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.920> year<00:03:54.300> trying<00:03:55.300> to<00:03:55.360> remember

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
later on in the year trying to remember

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.480 
later on in the year trying to remember
actually<00:03:56.080> i<00:03:56.290> might<00:03:56.500> just<00:03:56.560> quickly<00:03:57.070> double

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
actually i might just quickly double

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.660 
actually i might just quickly double
check<00:03:58.110> but<00:04:00.000> as<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.060> say<00:04:01.390> overall<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.680> think<00:04:03.160> that

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
check but as I say overall I think that

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.860 
check but as I say overall I think that
Sam<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.750> is<00:04:05.260> a<00:04:05.290> good<00:04:05.640> good<00:04:06.640> idea<00:04:07.030> that's<00:04:07.390> you

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
Sam it is a good good idea that's you
