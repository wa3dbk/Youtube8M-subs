00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.379
 hi youtube i am zeiter here bringing you 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.629
 a new video well then on this occasion 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.270
 we are going to put a very easy and very 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.670
 simple to be able to expand your desktop 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.740
 on mac so it's good for this we go 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.430
 to obviously use an external monitor 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:30.390
 and we're going to need a cable either 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.020
 go to mini dv to what is the ejea or what 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.570
 that is mini displayport to vejer well in 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.030
 depending on the connections or rather 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.550
 of your brand's collection are going to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.859
 buy or are going to buy your cable in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.289
 this case this is the mini dv entry 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.190
 how can you see it and this is the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.469
 eternal mini displayport this one is 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.780
 aware will vary depending on the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.519
 model of your mac so good you guys 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.499
 when you purchase your cable 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.499
 buy what you should keep in mind 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:04.440
 what connection do they have as they 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:06.120
 I repeat this is the mini dv connection and 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.570
 This is the mini displayport communication 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.979
 in this case, my mac has the input 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.440
 mini displayport 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.870
 So, well, I'm going to do it with 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.000
 this cable but if you 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.610
 in the mini baby and it's pretty much what 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.920
 same so good once I already 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.440
 they bought their cable we will proceed to what 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.620
 is to connect it well because this is the cable 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.860
 what I was saying in my case is a mini 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.380
 displayport bird head 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.290
 must take into account why 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.970
 connection are going to connect your monitor 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.800
 external 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.440
 in this case I made the mistake of 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:46.130
 buy this other adapter that is 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.170
 come I saw something that is from gea and this 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.180
 my mac does not have it that way 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.430
 good have to take into account the 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.060
 time to buy your cable that tickets 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.830
 has its mac and why is it going to 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.870
 connect well is that good 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.450
 they already got that this cable is good 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.230
 let's see it is a mini displayport to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.230
 what is desired 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.250
 let's open it 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.730
 is this 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.560
 as you can see this is the vga entry 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.209
 and this is the mini displayport entry 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.280
 as you can see the connections are 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.030
 different in the cables one is more 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.250
 small and the other one is bigger 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.740
 I remind you that this is mini dv and I'm 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.720
 here is the mini displayport so 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.980
 so they do not make the same mistake that 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.140
 I 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.810
 take into account that connections 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.360
 they are compatible with your mac so you do not 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.370
 buy a cable that is not good so the 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.610
 The next step is to connect what is 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.900
 the external monitor to the brand in how 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.790
 can see there in the background we have what 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.459
 what is the mac and here we have what it is 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.620
 this this little monitor that good 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.730
 it's somewhat obsolete and something old but 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.370
 good is going to help us do this 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.200
 tutorial first of all we should already 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.550
 have what is our cable at hand 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.040
 in the cable and the vga input of what 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.930
 is our external monitor we are going to 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.480
 connect it in this way 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.410
 A) Yes 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.730
 apply it like that and let's make sure 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.220
 so they do not go away 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.030
 this side 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.030
 and distilled 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.140
 very well since we have already insured now 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.390
 what follows is to connect the display port 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.400
 what the brand is 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.310
 Well, as you can see, these are 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.260
 the connections of my mac good as 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.569
 you can appreciate it in my mac no 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.040
 has what is the mini dv so it's 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.140
 good I'll connect via mini 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.690
 displayport which is this one here 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.050
 penultimate so good we're going to 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.750
 connect it in the following way 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.850
 ah 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.570
 this is the entrance 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:04.880
 and it was like this is how it is 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.880
 it was already what is connected is the 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.210
 connection and this goes to what is the other 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.090
 end of the monitor now what 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.970
 would continue is to connect the monitor to the light 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.340
 so that the external monitor recognizes the 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.320
 hand 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.919
 Well, once we have already 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.470
 connected what is the external monitor 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.520
 it will automatically synchronize 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.280
 us and for example we open a 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.889
 firefox page and for example 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.770
 we drag in this case towards the 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:38.050
 right as you can see you are 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.670
 expand my desk and I can 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.540
 use 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.370
 this external monitor to expand my 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.640
 desk for example if I do what 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.260
 I will sing myself the steps of this other 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.930
 side 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.410
 and I can visualize what is my 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.410
 messenger account on this monitor and in 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.600
 this other main monitor I can be 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.900
 working either in a program of 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.940
 editing or browsing the internet is that 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.500
 Well, this is a good option for 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.190
 to be able to expand your desktop if you 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.140
 you have some monitor out there 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.230
 You can use it as I show you in 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.000
 this tutorial there is that good in this 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.950
 method also has some 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.080
 configurations if we go to 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.510
 what is eluding preferences 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.280
 let's close this window here we go 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.570
 to close it 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:33.160
 ok it comes if we go to preferences of 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.990
 system we will find here a 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.030
 section that says screens and 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.720
 automatically on each screen it 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.260
 a small menu appears 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.260
 let's count them 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.560
 as you can see then this is in the 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.060
 configuration of my mac monitor and 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.120
 this is the configuration of my monitor 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.210
 of compact in this case is that good 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.610
 us in alignment we can not only 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:03.139
 modify the side that we want 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:05.539
 either right left or in the part 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.909
 below depending on our 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.289
 needs we can use the 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:13.219
 monitor 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.719
 to our preference skin even 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:17.120
 we can also expand it by making a 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:19.879
 little bit bigger and automatically it 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.370
 synchronize well us if we 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:26.180
 we want the main monitor what is 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.219
 this monitor what is the emotion 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.250
 external simply drag just 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:33.349
 what is the menu bar to this other 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.569
 screen and it's automatically going to 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:39.490
 synchronize so that this screen is 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:42.879
 the main one and it's not like that is that good 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.400
 perform we return to normal 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:48.110
 dragging what is the bar 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.420
 to the main window 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.360
 to monitor principal forgiveness so that 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.910
 well we can also duplicate 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.220
 on the screens on the screen 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.350
 principal that duplicates and 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:05.260
 it will automatically do the same 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.640
 what is done in the main monitor but 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.840
 well this almost does not help us much 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.850
 so good 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.290
 those are the options that we 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.620
 we can align even we can 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.580
 modify the color of both screens 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.930
 Well, this has been all for the 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.540
 At the moment I hope you liked the 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.460
