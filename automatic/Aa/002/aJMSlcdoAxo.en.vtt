00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.860
 she the passenger 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.510
 The brahman's data is that the enduring dida by ease and accessibility 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.510
 that technique that the muse barbatuques 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.350
 it's a very pitiful technique to go look for it 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.770
 I have no other resource. 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.489
 so give there pro 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.329
 the trump to g1 focus on the entire children's repertoire developed a repertoire was 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:10.430
 useful 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.400
 by this technique was a natural unfoldment 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.540
 also something that had already been condemned 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.850
 oftentimes 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.439
 despite the children's will in a little time even if it was 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.410
 accessible to children that children always 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.900
 frequents 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.420
 until the one that indicates continues being the same people makes percussion portugal 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.370
 practically dengue 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 at home we have here in research 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.290
 during five universities win we made cat some jokes 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.820
 little touches can be 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.420
 to serve as an inspiration and 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 we lose hope in the future the show 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.650
 we tried to translate a bit and bring it during the show 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.270
 the language codes of the petition to spare alex was also a motive 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.090
 of work 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.220
 Then take foot for example was a game 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220
 fifteen years before they used them in our workshops 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:14.389
 and we got that little cell in that little code 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:18.079
 and was unfolded in the knee during this year 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.199
 within food in training and in the Middle East 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.639
 always summoning the child 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.869
 I got in touch with my body and understood the language 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:30.469
 of petition with coral 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.469
 through the document 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.659
 we want to pay for the treatment of this disease has always been a 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:05.559
 It's always been a delicate moment. 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:09.489
 of our other games that we made a point of not having three shows 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.089
 also 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.439
 of course 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.179
 There, take care. 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:17.219
 doctor communicating with 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.219
 with children and teenager with care 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:21.200
 the way 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.200
 why people are led to interact with the audience 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.819
 this is an experience but we kept baker jaycee 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.819
 because the show every touch has always been an interactive show 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.229
 I think it's strange that day. 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:40.439
 of the code itself we can talk shows that people want 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:43.439
 no instrument available here 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:46.120
 ivete aviation 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.650
 is the only show the bar owner of his show that this movie 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.529
 public 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:55.819
 the whole public is armed with its rtp instrument with one sixth of the world 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.629
 it was a rock show everybody can move to participate together only 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.039
 help and so the children are 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.339
 in the beginning they are the movement they are 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:10.739
 exploring the voice exploring the body they are much alive much more alive and 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.739
 in children during the 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.279
 Paulo 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.949
 O 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.949
 who is it 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.360
 on the occasion it drew my attention that the group was a creation 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.729
 of the group asked 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.479
 Are you really after the show? 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.150
 he had suffered wings of wax that 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.860
 nerter proacre dictated this question 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.039
 we are true yes 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.729
 but the difference for me Roberto doing and 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.610
 not it the surprise factor that for being a child 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.309
 the reaction may not think we expect 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:30.949
 but because of the collective 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.009
 without the presence 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.720
 on behalf of children then it comes 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.470
 I used to be where I used to be. 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.870
 this presence and then on a website 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.839
 so much 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:46.960
 is located can pt can predict a little more I think I can 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.900
 if the adductors 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.930
 very different made a huge effort to remember 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.820
 nothing of our damage in the sector that was useful to be imagining how silva 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.029
 what would it be 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:02.949
 the children's reaction and fainted in the certainty that he knew if the death of thing 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.349
 does not work 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.229
 but it was taken overall it was very good to rate in the louisiana and indirect 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.559
 weaknesses we always hope to remain 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.100
 but the amount of child I practically surprised me because 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.050
 At night again saw children in need but now 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.150
 at this time with a more children-oriented repertoire 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.030
 for me it was a surprise and yes it has a huge amount it was a sensation 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.030
 new planned 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:38.559
 sample 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:46.409
 of course not 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.460
 hp 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.659
 O 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.009
 in season 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:03.259
 O
