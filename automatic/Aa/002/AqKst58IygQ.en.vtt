00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.209 
cut carbide bit one eighth of an inch
bit<00:01:24.539> I've<00:01:24.719> had<00:01:24.899> to<00:01:25.020> decrease<00:01:25.469> the<00:01:25.710> speeds<00:01:26.070> that

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
bit I've had to decrease the speeds that

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.609 
bit I've had to decrease the speeds that

everywhere so dust collection is pretty

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.440 
everywhere so dust collection is pretty
much<00:02:04.770> non-existent<00:02:04.829> with<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.909> that's<00:02:06.359> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
much non-existent with it that's the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.180 
much non-existent with it that's the
only<00:02:06.630> downfall<00:02:06.810> well<00:02:07.350> I'll<00:02:07.439> probably<00:02:07.740> end<00:02:08.039> up

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
only downfall well I'll probably end up

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
only downfall well I'll probably end up
putting<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.550> router<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.910> this

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
putting a router in this

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.370 
putting a router in this
and<00:02:10.190> tinkering<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.430> with<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.820> from<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.380> but

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
and tinkering it with it from there but

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.220 
and tinkering it with it from there but
I<00:02:13.410> want<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.710> make<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.950> smaller<00:02:14.550> cart<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.300> say

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.980 
I want to make a smaller cart I say
smaller<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:16.830> this<00:02:16.950> thing<00:02:17.130> is<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.660> 40<00:02:18.660> inches

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
smaller but this thing is like 40 inches

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.260 
smaller but this thing is like 40 inches
by<00:02:19.200> 40<00:02:19.590> inches<00:02:19.860> or<00:02:20.040> however<00:02:20.160> many<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.550> it's

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
by 40 inches or however many it is it's

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.330 
by 40 inches or however many it is it's
a<00:02:21.360> pretty<00:02:21.570> big<00:02:21.780> size<00:02:22.110> machine<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:22.980> I'm

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
a pretty big size machine so I'm

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.740 
a pretty big size machine so I'm
probably<00:02:23.460> gonna<00:02:23.700> make<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.880> card<00:02:24.270> for<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.600> and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
probably gonna make a card for it and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.060 
probably gonna make a card for it and
stick<00:02:25.350> it<00:02:25.380> where<00:02:25.680> my<00:02:25.950> welder<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:27.800> drill<00:02:28.800> press

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
stick it where my welder and drill press

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.660 
stick it where my welder and drill press
were<00:02:29.700> I've<00:02:30.950> kind<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.010> had<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.250> move<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.520> couple

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
bandsaw then the CNC machine and then

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.360 
bandsaw then the CNC machine and then
this<00:02:48.900> little<00:02:49.110> tool<00:02:49.530> cart<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.130> don't<00:02:50.250> know<00:02:50.310> if

by any means so i think what i'm going
to<00:05:07.320> do<00:05:07.440> is<00:05:07.550> experiment<00:05:08.550> on<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.660> toilet

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
to do is experiment on the toilet

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.960 
to do is experiment on the toilet
cabinet<00:05:10.740> that<00:05:10.919> was<00:05:11.040> actually<00:05:11.250> in<00:05:11.640> that

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
bathroom and if it we took it down to

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.820 
bathroom and if it we took it down to
paint<00:05:15.660> the<00:05:15.750> walls<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.260> i<00:05:16.290> hadn't<00:05:16.530> put<00:05:16.650> it<00:05:16.710> back
