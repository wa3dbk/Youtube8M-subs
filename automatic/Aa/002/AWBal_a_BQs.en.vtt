this tutorial is going to be about

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.030 
this tutorial is going to be about
frequency<00:00:06.150> separation<00:00:06.620> I'm<00:00:07.620> asked<00:00:07.980> about

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
frequency separation I'm asked about

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.150 
frequency separation I'm asked about
frequency<00:00:08.639> separation<00:00:08.820> all<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.690> time

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
frequency separation all the time

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.990 
frequency separation all the time
because<00:00:11.160> people<00:00:11.190> think<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.759> really

in the next tutorial okay so we're just
preparing<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:04.559> image<00:01:04.920> ready<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
preparing the image ready for the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.910 
preparing the image ready for the
artwork<00:01:06.270> later<00:01:09.170> so<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> first<00:01:10.560> thing<00:01:10.770> that's

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
artwork later so the first thing that's

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.289 
artwork later so the first thing that's
really<00:01:11.340> important<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
really important that you have to do is

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.230 
really important that you have to do is
go<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.540> image<00:01:16.020> mode<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.740> select<00:01:17.240> 16-bit

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
go to image mode and select 16-bit

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.660 
go to image mode and select 16-bit
Channel<00:01:18.720> don't<00:01:19.259> ask<00:01:19.409> me<00:01:19.590> why<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
Channel don't ask me why but you do and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
Channel don't ask me why but you do and
then<00:01:21.450> make<00:01:21.630> 2<00:01:21.869> layers<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.229> your<00:01:22.439> background

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
then make 2 layers of your background

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.399 
then make 2 layers of your background
image<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> rename<00:01:23.850> them<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.930> bottom<00:01:25.110> one

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
image and rename them the bottom one

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.789 
image and rename them the bottom one
you're<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.740> cause<00:01:25.920> skin<00:01:26.100> tones<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
you're going to cause skin tones and the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.510 
you're going to cause skin tones and the
top<00:01:29.009> one<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.670> want<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.939> call<00:01:30.119> skin<00:01:30.630> textures

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
top one you want to call skin textures

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.649 
top one you want to call skin textures
because<00:01:32.520> basically<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> be

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
because basically we're going to be

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.480 
because basically we're going to be
working<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.200> two<00:01:34.439> layers<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.040> that's<00:01:35.220> what

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
working on two layers and that's what

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.600 
working on two layers and that's what
frequency<00:01:36.329> separation<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:37.340> you're<00:01:38.340> going<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
frequency separation is you're going to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.649 
frequency separation is you're going to
be<00:01:38.700> changing<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.360> color<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.079> textures

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
be changing the color and the textures

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.749 
be changing the color and the textures
okay<00:01:42.659> ten<00:01:42.899> off<00:01:43.049> skin<00:01:43.380> textures<00:01:43.890> select<00:01:44.430> skin

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
okay ten off skin textures select skin

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.660 
okay ten off skin textures select skin
tones<00:01:45.090> go<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> filter<00:01:46.470> blur<00:01:46.680> filter<00:01:47.340> blur

Gaussian blur and just play around with

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.670 
Gaussian blur and just play around with
the<00:01:50.280> slider<00:01:50.579> until<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.840> image<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.170> out<00:01:52.409> of

light<00:02:26.069> now<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.810> formula<00:02:28.319> if<00:02:29.010> you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
light now that is the formula if you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.430 
light now that is the formula if you
just<00:02:29.489> do<00:02:29.700> that<00:02:29.849> simple<00:02:30.360> technique<00:02:30.750> frequency

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
just do that simple technique frequency

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.040 
just do that simple technique frequency
separation<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.519> an<00:02:32.730> absolute<00:02:33.060> double<00:02:33.420> ok<00:02:33.989> so

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
separation is an absolute double ok so

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.770 
separation is an absolute double ok so
remember<00:02:34.410> that<00:02:34.970> now<00:02:35.970> we're<00:02:36.120> going<00:02:36.269> on<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.420> skin

skin<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.810> need<00:02:40.140> blending<00:02:42.140> so<00:02:43.140> you're<00:02:43.410> just

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
skin that need blending so you're just

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.650 
skin that need blending so you're just

different<00:02:46.620> areas<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.160> skin<00:02:47.730> now<00:02:48.480> remember

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
different areas of skin now remember

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.020 
different areas of skin now remember

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
because you're on the skin tones layer

because you're on the skin tones layer
you're<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:51.750> touching<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.349> textures<00:02:52.980> you're

you're not touching the textures you're

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.910 
you're not touching the textures you're
just<00:02:54.120> changing<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.840> color<00:02:55.049> tones<00:02:55.349> slightly

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
so play with the slider till it feels

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.309 
so play with the slider till it feels
right<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.670> do<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.120> all<00:03:00.299> over<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.660> face<00:03:00.840> so

usually<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:31.950> wouldn't<00:03:32.459> be<00:03:32.790> as<00:03:32.880> quick<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.359> this

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
usually I wouldn't be as quick as this

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:36.979 
usually I wouldn't be as quick as this
I'd<00:03:33.900> probably<00:03:34.139> take<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> bit<00:03:34.709> longer<00:03:35.989> because

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
I'd probably take a bit longer because

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.949 
I'd probably take a bit longer because
I'm<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.319> bit<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.920> perfectionist<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:39.269> you

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
I'm a bit of a perfectionist but you

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.080 
I'm a bit of a perfectionist but you
know<00:03:40.079> for<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.380> sake<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.620> not<00:03:40.980> boring<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.910> to

tears<00:03:42.359> during<00:03:42.810> my<00:03:43.079> tutorial<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.889> thought<00:03:44.160> it'd

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
tears during my tutorial I thought it'd

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.360 
tears during my tutorial I thought it'd
go<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> bit<00:03:44.609> quicker<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:46.709> if<00:03:47.160> you're<00:03:47.280> doing

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
go a bit quicker and if you're doing

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.099 
go a bit quicker and if you're doing
smaller<00:03:47.790> areas<00:03:48.209> like<00:03:48.420> on<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.660> nose<00:03:48.840> here

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
smaller areas like on the nose here

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.059 
smaller areas like on the nose here
you're<00:03:49.440> gonna<00:03:49.560> have<00:03:49.769> to<00:03:49.920> feather<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:52.069> lower

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
you're gonna have to feather a lower

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.099 
you're gonna have to feather a lower
number<00:03:53.310> because<00:03:54.000> otherwise<00:03:54.780> you're<00:03:55.079> just

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
number because otherwise you're just

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.160 
number because otherwise you're just
gonna<00:03:55.410> it's<00:03:55.739> just<00:03:55.829> going<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.160> disappear<00:03:56.639> so

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
gonna it's just going to disappear so

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.789 
gonna it's just going to disappear so
there<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.290> go<00:03:58.500> that's<00:03:58.829> 20<00:03:59.370> Melton's<00:03:59.880> fine

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
there you go that's 20 Melton's fine

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.650 
there you go that's 20 Melton's fine
super<00:04:01.799> ok<00:04:02.400> I'm<00:04:02.519> going<00:04:02.700> up<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:02.970> skin<00:04:03.209> textures

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
super ok I'm going up to skin textures

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.039 
super ok I'm going up to skin textures
now<00:04:03.950> now<00:04:04.950> remember<00:04:05.569> you're<00:04:06.569> not<00:04:06.720> going<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.959> be

good bit it's that easy we all we all
know<00:04:28.780> how<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.139> use<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.410> clone<00:04:29.680> tool<00:04:29.949> but<00:04:30.639> by

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
know how to use a clone tool but by

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.879 
know how to use a clone tool but by
doing<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.360> this<00:04:31.479> way<00:04:31.539> you're<00:04:32.410> not<00:04:32.590> touching

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
doing it this way you're not touching

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
one of my avant-garde portraits so this

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.430 
one of my avant-garde portraits so this
bit<00:05:02.409> I<00:05:02.560> would<00:05:02.620> normally<00:05:02.949> take<00:05:03.370> a<00:05:03.430> lot<00:05:03.729> longer

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
bit I would normally take a lot longer

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.899 
bit I would normally take a lot longer
doing<00:05:05.440> than<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.889> am<00:05:06.099> today<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:09.400> skin<00:05:09.789> is

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
doing than I am today the skin is

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.670 
doing than I am today the skin is
looking<00:05:10.090> pretty<00:05:10.389> good<00:05:10.659> on<00:05:10.930> this<00:05:11.110> cheek<00:05:11.409> here

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
looking pretty good on this cheek here

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.279 
looking pretty good on this cheek here
so<00:05:11.979> what<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.550> can<00:05:12.789> do<00:05:13.030> is<00:05:13.210> up<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.569> size<00:05:13.840> of

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
so what you can do is up the size of

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.189 
so what you can do is up the size of
your<00:05:14.650> clone<00:05:15.069> tool<00:05:15.400> and<00:05:15.729> take<00:05:16.479> those<00:05:16.630> textures

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
your clone tool and take those textures

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.870 
your clone tool and take those textures
from<00:05:17.440> that<00:05:17.680> side<00:05:17.949> because<00:05:18.220> they're<00:05:18.550> they're

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
from that side because they're they're

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.809 
from that side because they're they're
looking<00:05:19.180> really<00:05:19.330> good<00:05:19.599> on<00:05:20.050> to<00:05:20.349> the<00:05:20.470> other<00:05:20.620> side

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
looking really good on to the other side

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.659 
looking really good on to the other side
and<00:05:22.659> it<00:05:22.810> doesn't<00:05:22.990> look<00:05:23.229> strange<00:05:23.620> because<00:05:24.039> you

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
and it doesn't look strange because you

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.430 
and it doesn't look strange because you
the<00:05:24.940> colors<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.690> shadows<00:05:26.080> are<00:05:26.349> all

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
the colors and the shadows are all

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.399 
the colors and the shadows are all
exactly<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:27.009> same<00:05:27.159> underneath<00:05:27.729> so<00:05:28.570> by<00:05:28.930> by

exactly the same underneath so by by
working<00:05:29.860> on<00:05:30.009> frequency<00:05:30.520> separation<00:05:31.169> you<00:05:32.169> can

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
working on frequency separation you can

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.560 
working on frequency separation you can
maintain<00:05:32.530> that<00:05:32.820> whilst<00:05:33.820> you're<00:05:34.030> working<00:05:34.479> on

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
nice save as a tiff file that will

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.390 
nice save as a tiff file that will
maintain<00:06:45.730> your<00:06:46.030> layers<00:06:46.890> it<00:06:47.890> will<00:06:47.919> also<00:06:48.220> keep

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
maintain your layers it will also keep

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.120 
maintain your layers it will also keep
the<00:06:51.400> resolution<00:06:52.000> of<00:06:52.090> your<00:06:52.120> image<00:06:52.919> you<00:06:53.919> don't

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
the resolution of your image you don't

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.340 
the resolution of your image you don't
want<00:06:54.310> to<00:06:54.400> save<00:06:54.550> it<00:06:54.580> as<00:06:54.760> a<00:06:54.790> JPEG<00:06:55.360> because<00:06:56.080> you

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.350 
want to save it as a JPEG because you

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.620 
want to save it as a JPEG because you
will<00:06:56.470> lose<00:06:56.740> the<00:06:56.919> resolution<00:06:57.630> dramatically

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.630 
will lose the resolution dramatically

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.000 
will lose the resolution dramatically
and<00:06:58.870> you<00:06:59.080> will<00:06:59.230> also<00:06:59.500> lose<00:06:59.919> your<00:06:59.980> layers<00:07:02.010> I'm

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.010 
and you will also lose your layers I'm

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.650 
and you will also lose your layers I'm
just<00:07:03.250> going<00:07:03.400> to<00:07:03.520> clear<00:07:03.910> her<00:07:04.120> chest<00:07:04.390> up<00:07:04.570> a

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660 
just going to clear her chest up a

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.290 
just going to clear her chest up a
little<00:07:04.900> bit<00:07:05.050> here<00:07:05.520> doing<00:07:06.520> exactly<00:07:06.970> what<00:07:07.180> we

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
little bit here doing exactly what we

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.659 
little bit here doing exactly what we
did<00:07:07.450> for<00:07:07.600> the<00:07:07.720> face<00:07:11.070> so<00:07:12.070> there<00:07:12.280> you<00:07:12.460> have<00:07:12.490> it

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
did for the face so there you have it

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:17.219 
did for the face so there you have it
frequency<00:07:13.330> separation<00:07:15.750> very<00:07:16.750> often<00:07:17.110> people

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
frequency separation very often people

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.140 
frequency separation very often people
think<00:07:17.410> it's<00:07:17.740> really<00:07:18.070> difficult<00:07:18.310> it's

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
think it's really difficult it's

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.880 
think it's really difficult it's
basically<00:07:19.630> a<00:07:19.780> case<00:07:20.020> of<00:07:20.229> remembering<00:07:20.770> a

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:20.890 
basically a case of remembering a

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.090 
basically a case of remembering a
formula<00:07:21.810> which<00:07:22.810> is<00:07:22.840> pretty<00:07:23.320> much<00:07:23.500> what<00:07:23.830> the

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 
formula which is pretty much what the

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.680 
formula which is pretty much what the
case<00:07:25.030> for<00:07:25.330> most<00:07:25.540> things<00:07:25.780> in<00:07:25.960> Photoshop<00:07:27.690> there

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:28.690 
case for most things in Photoshop there

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.790 
case for most things in Photoshop there
we<00:07:28.840> are<00:07:29.550> okay<00:07:30.550> have<00:07:31.000> fun<00:07:31.030> trying<00:07:31.419> that<00:07:31.800> take

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 
we are okay have fun trying that take

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.700 
we are okay have fun trying that take
care<00:07:33.010> bye
