this<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.890> that<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.310> chunk<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.760> a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
this is that the chunk of a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.550 
this is that the chunk of a
neurobiologist<00:03:01.600> think<00:03:01.870> has<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.230> do<00:03:02.380> with

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
neurobiologist think has to do with

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.740 
neurobiologist think has to do with
storing<00:03:03.040> new<00:03:03.190> memories<00:03:03.520> give<00:03:03.940> us<00:03:04.060> an<00:03:04.209> analogy

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
storing new memories give us an analogy

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.559 
storing new memories give us an analogy
of<00:03:04.780> how<00:03:05.080> much<00:03:05.350> larger<00:03:06.100> these<00:03:06.310> sections<00:03:06.819> are<00:03:07.150> a

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
of how much larger these sections are a

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.780 
of how much larger these sections are a
lot<00:03:07.780> larger<00:03:07.959> perhaps<00:03:08.620> up<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.860> seven<00:03:09.370> or<00:03:09.550> eight

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
lot larger perhaps up to seven or eight

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.120 
lot larger perhaps up to seven or eight
what's<00:03:10.180> called<00:03:10.450> standard<00:03:11.110> deviations<00:03:11.709> larger

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
what's called standard deviations larger

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.350 
what's called standard deviations larger
than<00:03:12.220> normal<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.760> understand<00:03:13.209> what<00:03:13.330> that

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
than normal to understand what that

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.750 
than normal to understand what that
means<00:03:13.690> if<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.560> man<00:03:14.860> was<00:03:15.250> seven<00:03:15.610> or<00:03:15.700> eight

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
means if a man was seven or eight

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.580 
means if a man was seven or eight
standard<00:03:16.060> deviations<00:03:16.690> taller<00:03:17.170> than<00:03:17.470> the

standard deviations taller than the

height of the average man he'd be 10
feet<00:03:19.300> tall<00:03:19.630> so<00:03:20.250> we<00:03:21.250> have<00:03:21.370> some<00:03:21.550> potentially

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
feet tall so we have some potentially

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.160 
feet tall so we have some potentially
whopping<00:03:22.540> effects<00:03:22.989> Giants<00:03:23.739> Giants

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.370 

scientists<00:03:29.170> are<00:03:29.230> now<00:03:29.380> helping<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:30.220> from

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
scientists are now helping that from

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.630 
scientists are now helping that from
taking<00:03:32.380> pictures<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.860> your<00:03:33.040> brains<00:03:33.310> right

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
taking pictures of your brains right

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.640 
taking pictures of your brains right
when<00:03:33.880> they<00:03:34.090> have<00:03:34.239> done<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.630> they<00:03:35.260> can't

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
when they have done that they can't

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.430 
when they have done that they can't
figure<00:03:36.010> out<00:03:36.300> what<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.330> is<00:03:37.600> in<00:03:37.780> your<00:03:37.959> brain<00:03:38.170> and

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
figure out what it is in your brain and

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.920 
figure out what it is in your brain and
maybe<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:39.070> can<00:03:39.220> help<00:03:39.250> other<00:03:39.610> memory<00:03:40.120> including

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
maybe it can help other memory including

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.860 
maybe it can help other memory including
Alzheimer's<00:03:42.209> 1978<00:03:43.209> where<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.600> Friday

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
Alzheimer's 1978 where the Friday

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.720 
Alzheimer's 1978 where the Friday
thought<00:03:44.350> I<00:03:44.380> was<00:03:44.590> peculiar<00:03:45.160> but<00:03:45.340> it<00:03:45.430> wasn't

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
thought I was peculiar but it wasn't

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.780 
thought I was peculiar but it wasn't
because<00:03:45.820> of<00:03:46.000> that<00:03:46.269> yeah<00:03:46.890> how<00:03:47.890> about<00:03:48.100> November

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
because of that yeah how about November

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.610 
because of that yeah how about November
