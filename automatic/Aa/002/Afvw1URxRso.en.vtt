00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.130
 let's make that algorithm that will check the largest number of a 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.450
 list numbers 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.529
 then the first number 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:12.969
 25 since the second name 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.129
 15 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.439
 the other 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.599
 the other 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.589
 and the fifth in the world 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.589
 68 is the biggest in the world is here 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.800
 guns how does this work on the street algorithm 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.410
 see that they teach are two variables only if you put 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.270
 actually when you type the first number 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.950
 indiana and cintra that in the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.460
 the larger sandals 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.140
 be delivered 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.480
 is stored here 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.480
 to dedic second number it will be stored 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.410
 here is not a 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.860
 in the second variable then it is to make comparison between your first variable 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.290
 this first variable and the second variable compare the number with another 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 the first largest variable 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.460
 to redeem this check if you have the second variable 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.050
 it's bigger 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.000
 that the first variable home 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.850
 with the greater name 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.200
 this second rossetto is greater than the first name of the board 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.740
 is greater then get this first name if the second number here has already interrogated 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.810
 and the worst is that since this variable that with the name of greater 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.900
 right 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.720
 alex played here then 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.510
 the first in group c along with it says that is one and here you typed 2 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.140
 then see a 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.330
 that 2 is bigger here 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.360
 so far nothing to do is going the way 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.100
 the two craques plane she who since peshawar is the largest 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.410
 something simple 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.000
 I write signed the third one there goes in some of them the same variable that already 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.370
 is no longer the same name is now replaced by the number of your title 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.010
 now 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.980
 this third time here 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.470
 to do the summer check the new processor type 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.370
 is greater than what is stored there that you had already shown that it was 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.749
 bigger than the game roll 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:12.199
 he is bigger than his team won in the moment is bigger 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.399
 the card 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.729
 hit the 14 there 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:21.019
 in the neck of the place that was our biggest I want two in the case now the cd of the 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.439
 number greater than 2 gordon keep that number there within that variable that 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.419
 called greater 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:27.639
 you are not being 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.929
 not with the room on the shoulder with the fifth 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:32.089
 if that is what 0 for example 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:33.229
 the strike 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.179
 the certainty is that ceramic - it is bigger 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.319
 that what you now dollar within the laia of the greater 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:42.929
 if it is done with the human being 30Âºc it will not be tomorrow 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.029
 ignore 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.089
 and will continue algorithm 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:50.479
 That's right, so it will do if it's bigger. 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.219
 but I want to, I'll state 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.200
 the writing is that several larger 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.499
 if elected with - as in May the Colorado 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.569
 but here for the algorithm that nois today 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.569
 call me right now 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.859
 another algorithm still from yesterday nothing 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:11.469
 temples
