00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:08.960 

okay<00:00:02.909> so<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.920> was<00:00:04.920> out<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.670> about<00:00:06.290> on<00:00:07.290> my<00:00:08.160> daily

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
okay so I was out and about on my daily

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.400 
okay so I was out and about on my daily
rounds<00:00:09.510> doing<00:00:10.500> my<00:00:10.679> daily<00:00:11.250> chores<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:12.769> I

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
rounds doing my daily chores and I

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.710 
rounds doing my daily chores and I
happened<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.440> cross<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:17.600> as<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.930> was<00:00:20.720> coming

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
happened to cross this as I was coming

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.109 
happened to cross this as I was coming
down<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.109> path<00:00:23.420> now<00:00:24.560> to<00:00:25.560> me

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
down the path now to me

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.359 
down the path now to me
these<00:00:27.119> look<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:28.429> raspberries<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:31.369> can

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
these look like raspberries I can

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.389 
these look like raspberries I can
honestly<00:00:32.520> say<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:34.040> never<00:00:35.040> really

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
honestly say that I have never really

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.000 
honestly say that I have never really
seen<00:00:35.450> raspberries<00:00:36.450> out<00:00:36.960> in<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.040> wild

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.069 

I'm<00:00:42.489> not<00:00:42.670> a<00:00:42.699> very<00:00:42.969> big<00:00:43.089> fan<00:00:43.149> of<00:00:43.329> raspberries<00:00:43.960> to

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
I'm not a very big fan of raspberries to

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.799 
I'm not a very big fan of raspberries to
begin<00:00:44.350> with<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.690> these<00:00:47.460> certainly<00:00:48.460> do<00:00:49.390> look

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
begin with but these certainly do look

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.130 
begin with but these certainly do look
like<00:00:50.079> raspberries

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.940 

now<00:00:53.880> I'll<00:00:54.880> have<00:00:55.090> to<00:00:55.120> do<00:00:55.330> my<00:00:55.510> research<00:00:55.690> again<00:00:56.230> to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
now I'll have to do my research again to

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.830 
now I'll have to do my research again to
find<00:00:57.250> out<00:00:57.490> whether<00:00:57.700> or<00:00:57.790> not<00:00:57.880> that<00:00:58.210> is<00:00:58.420> exactly

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
find out whether or not that is exactly

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.980 
find out whether or not that is exactly
what<00:00:59.020> I'm<00:00:59.110> looking<00:00:59.410> at<00:00:59.560> and<00:01:00.420> perhaps<00:01:01.420> some<00:01:01.840> of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
what I'm looking at and perhaps some of

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.700 
what I'm looking at and perhaps some of
the<00:01:02.170> sharp<00:01:02.500> ride<00:01:03.220> viewers<00:01:03.790> out<00:01:04.210> there<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:05.680> be

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
the sharp ride viewers out there will be

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.490 
the sharp ride viewers out there will be
able<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.070> tell<00:01:06.280> me<00:01:06.490> if<00:01:06.700> this<00:01:07.090> is<00:01:07.330> in<00:01:07.810> fact<00:01:07.870> a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
able to tell me if this is in fact a

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:16.520 
able to tell me if this is in fact a
wild<00:01:09.040> raspberry<00:01:10.290> bush<00:01:11.580> or<00:01:12.580> vine

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
you can see some pods which haven't

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.590 
you can see some pods which haven't
opened<00:01:19.110> yet

check<00:01:27.020> out<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.320> morphology<00:01:28.040> of<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.549> leaf

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
check out the morphology of the leaf

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.980 
check out the morphology of the leaf
itself

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.310
