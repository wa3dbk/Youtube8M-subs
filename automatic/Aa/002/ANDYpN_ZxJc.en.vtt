00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.230
 a new revolutionary counter 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.869
 fluxing that puts an end to the problems of 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.480
 geometry adjustment allowing 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.580
 a precise and accurate registration 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.810
 in full agreement with the specifications of the 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.810
 original builder 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.090
 a truly complete kit of 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.640
 adapters and allows easy 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.640
 assembly of a large number of 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.640
 turbochargers 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.060
 the feature that makes the turbo 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.009
 unique test of its kind is given by 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.039
 ability to perform tests with the 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.619
 moving rotor the machine is equipped 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.819
 of an oil pumping system to the 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.360
 order to guarantee the correct 

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:51.189
 turbo operation without damage 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.509
 unlike the other banks present 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.789
 on the market 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.520
 the turbo test takes the measurements of 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.619
 flow also from the compressor side a 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.020
 this also your vents 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.590
 suction are conveyed with 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.179
 special quick- connect tubes la 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.429
 measurement of turbo parameters 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.769
 carried out with the rotor moving 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.650
 also allows you to check for absence 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:18.840
 of the annoying whistle often present 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.840
 on rebuilt turbochargers 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.689
 turbocharger installed 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.689
 Testing is quick and fast 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.800
 just select the code of the 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.800
 turbo under test 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.140
 then press the flow button e 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.140
 wait for the measurement 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.200
 the monitor displays the range of 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.560
 specification values ​​that values 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.560
 measured 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.379
 the measured values if the contents 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.280
 within the green zone they certify 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.109
 the correct adjustment of the geometry 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.870
 the test is repeated for several 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.560
 positions of geometry and for different 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.560
 pressure values 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.639
 at the end of the test the turbo test 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:34.219
 allows to print the report of 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:37.150
 proof document that has attached to the turbo 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:40.099
 certifies its correct functioning 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.409
 this certificate is increasingly in demand 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.639
 from customers provides valuable help 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:48.049
 in the sale of rebuilt turbos 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:52.510
 an incorrect adjustment of the geometry 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.510
 is highlighted by a red icon 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.239
 incorrect adjustment is corrected 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:03.239
 acting on the length of the st 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.270
 adjusted to the siri lever performs the test 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.720
 to verify that you have obtained the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.720
 correct value 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.850
 turbo test being able to work 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.220
 with the moving rotor allows 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.050
 perform performance measurements 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.790
 this feature is revealed 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.980
 extremely useful when you want 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.680
 check the efficiency of a turbo 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.450
 rebuilt on a striped carter or when 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.270
 we proceed to the elaboration of a 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.310
 turbocharger the car tracks a 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.740
 graph that relates the number 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.850
 of rotor speed and the product flow 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.850
 in the compressor side 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.900
 the test and adjustment procedure is 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.240
 quite similar also for i 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.240
 pneumatically controlled turbochargers 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.400
 for pneumatic actuators are 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.470
 necessary two distinct adjustments on 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.810
 beat grain for blood flow 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.670
 opening and length of the stands for 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.670
 medium and maximum opening flow
