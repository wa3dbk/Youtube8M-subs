it's<00:00:59.570> like<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.719> free-to-play<00:01:00.230> game<00:01:01.690> so<00:01:02.859> there

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
it's like a free-to-play game so there

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.399 
it's like a free-to-play game so there
it<00:01:03.980> is<00:01:07.330> okay<00:01:08.330> so<00:01:08.390> here<00:01:08.720> we<00:01:08.840> have<00:01:08.990> it<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.320> then

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
it is okay so here we have it and then

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.210 
it is okay so here we have it and then
notifications<00:01:10.159> menu<00:01:11.110> both<00:01:12.110> of<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:14.230> files<00:01:15.230> top

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
notifications menu both of the files top

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.350 
notifications menu both of the files top
the<00:01:16.340> file<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:16.640> can<00:01:16.730> just<00:01:16.909> go<00:01:17.030> ahead<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.270> take

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
the file you can just go ahead and take

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.050 
the file you can just go ahead and take
it<00:01:17.479> away<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.810> just<00:01:18.110> let<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.409> game<00:01:18.560> download

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
it away you just let the game download

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.399 
it away you just let the game download
so<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.240> problem<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:20.689> is<00:01:20.810> that<00:01:20.990> somewhere

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
so the problem is is that somewhere

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.490 
so the problem is is that somewhere
about<00:01:21.649> 400<00:01:22.130> megabytes<00:01:22.520> or<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.360> it<00:01:23.659> will<00:01:23.810> give

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
about 400 megabytes or so it will give

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.819 
about 400 megabytes or so it will give
me<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:24.829> fail<00:01:25.130> message<00:01:25.549> for<00:01:26.540> me<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:27.049> might<00:01:27.799> be

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
me that fail message for me it might be

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.069 
me that fail message for me it might be
different<00:01:28.100> for<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:28.579> or<00:01:28.820> something<00:01:29.240> I<00:01:29.420> don't

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
different for you or something I don't

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.609 
different for you or something I don't
know<00:01:30.229> but<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:31.670> solution<00:01:32.119> is<00:01:32.240> let<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:33.350> go

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
know but the solution is let it go

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.899 
know but the solution is let it go
around<00:01:33.799> 200<00:01:34.460> megabytes<00:01:34.850> and<00:01:35.119> then<00:01:35.930> start<00:01:36.909> well

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
around 200 megabytes and then start well

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.200 
around 200 megabytes and then start well
this<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.210> procedure<00:01:38.630> when<00:01:38.930> it<00:01:39.049> reaches<00:01:40.210> 36

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
this is a procedure when it reaches 36

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.420 
this is a procedure when it reaches 36
megabytes

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
megabytes

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
megabytes
let's<00:01:43.430> wait<00:01:43.670> for<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:45.039> let's<00:01:46.039> say<00:01:46.219> it's<00:01:46.369> 236<00:01:47.210> so

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
let's wait for it let's say it's 236 so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.510 
let's wait for it let's say it's 236 so
right<00:01:48.110> here<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.289> barely<00:01:48.469> 36<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.159> when<00:01:49.399> it

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
right here is barely 36 so when it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.990 
right here is barely 36 so when it
reaches<00:01:49.789> like<00:01:49.909> 34<00:01:50.509> 35<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.549> want<00:01:52.549> to<00:01:52.610> go<00:01:52.700> right

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
reaches like 34 35 I want to go right

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.149 
reaches like 34 35 I want to go right
