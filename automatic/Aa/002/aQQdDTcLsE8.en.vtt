00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.750
Good evening my love!

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.680
I have been waiting for you as if you were coming from the sky

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:27.230
I have been waiting for you to bring me continents of pale mystery

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.650
Aaaaaaaa…

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.330
Good evening my love! 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:44.180
I have been waiting for you as if our love were the only thing left on earth

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.320
Beyound

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.700
Good evening my love! 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:58.850
I have been waiting for you as if our love were the only thing left on earth

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:17.410
beyond greatness, beyond fall… beyond the word.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.800
Good evening my love! 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.720
I can tell you with words 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.850
that there are few things still sacred left on earth,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.550
That premature loves fall into graves

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.790
Good evening my love!

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.910
There are enough people who want to put a lock on our love’s door

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.440
to put bands to the word longing.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.420
Good evening my love!

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.780
I have been waiting for you as if you were coming from the sky

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:10.960
I have been waiting for you to bring me continents of pale mystery.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.840
Aaaaaaaa…

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.030
Good evening my love! 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:27.360
I have been waiting for you as if our love were the only thing left on earth

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.060
Beyond…

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.380
Good evening my love!

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:42.540
 I have been waiting for you as if our love were the only thing left on earth,

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.210
beyond greatness, beyond fall… beyond the word.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:03:01.130
Good evening my love!

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.050
Good evening my love! 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:14.000
I have been waiting for you as if our love were the only thing left on earth,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:26.340
beyond greatness, beyond fall… beyond the word.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:38.850
Good evening my love!
