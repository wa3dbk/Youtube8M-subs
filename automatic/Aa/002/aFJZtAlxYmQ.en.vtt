00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.290
 whoooah has invited us to over 100 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.150
 to come for a new presentation 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.590
 telephone and if it was not whole 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.660
 mysterious what exactly she would 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.100
 the basics present that 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.690
 they had already announced themselves on 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.550
 facebook on which you leave such 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.890
 so one already knew what would go 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.450
 just not exactly how there 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.020
 would really look like and what he would 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.369
 being able 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.470
 and that seemed to be when this is your him 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.119
 huawei ascend p6 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.770
 I say sorry where are three four 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.510
 and five stayed because the previous one was there 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.710
 two values ​​are indeed correct 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.449
 they skipped a few because 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.489
 he then say so she should be able to 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.100
 compete with, for example, the iphone 6 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.870
 that might someday come 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.579
 that 6 that actually mainly refers to the 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.389
 thickness then you go on a small ride 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.889
 presentation was on June 18, 1886 as 

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:50.889
 say english here 

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:53.409
 and first 6 point 18 mm thick and that is whole 

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:55.030
 very thin 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.409
 I actually hope not to 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.819
 make comparison with that brand with 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:59.319
 that apple 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.749
 only he seems very much to say 

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:04.269
 spot the differences here 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:05.950
 I like darnay's seek out summer and 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.850
 she referred during a presentation 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.200
 myself to 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.759
 not so much to the design what is left 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.469
 look great but change camera 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.329
 they were very proud of that is an 8 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.860
 megapixel camera and they mainly say that 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.570
 the automatic mode 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.009
 really fantastic works we got lock 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.009
 to see where it was next to the iphone 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.420
 laid the galaxy s4 and then saw the 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.859
 photos are indeed impressive 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.000
 but well you already know that is always one 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.320
 little bit tricky 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 with such presentations 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.799
 returning to the design they are partial 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.820
 compare with paper be it job paper 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.590
 ever actually replaced by the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.420
 smartphone nowadays why not 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.909
 that phone kind of got that idea 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.250
 give paper honestly say 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.990
 see it in your one side angled the 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.030
 other side is round and nothing will see 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.229
 why fold paper and what 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.170
 far-fetched in my eyes 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.520
 but here for sure if you look nice 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.469
 and that is a big plus 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.570
 this peace x runs on android 4 point 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:55.450
 two with the e-motion you why over it 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.460
 the hull of how oh me god especially there 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.289
 It is noticed that they really are impossible much 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.369
 Themes for the device they have 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.049
 said more than 1000 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.359
 including three specific to this one 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.009
 basics you would namely in white black 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:07.270
 and the pink and let that be the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.620
 colors are in which the device also 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.869
 just released or there 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.610
 specifications was actually not 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.409
 told a lot during presentation 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.790
 what a neighborhood but a slide that is not yet 15 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.019
 seconds 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.510
 but well what i'll tell you from 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.739
 a 1.5 gigahertz quadcore processor 2 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.540
 gigabyte of internal memory 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.690
 two cameras on the back 8 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.459
 megapixel on the front 5 megapixel and 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:34.879
 can enter a 4.7 inch 720 p screen 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:37.920
 in filming and is striking 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.299
 6.18 millimeters preferably 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.190
 and yes that is so much thinner and volt dc 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.190
 but wish to participate leak 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:50.129
 which you like in the front is that you 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.540
 can make selfies and then get on well with 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.299
 all phones but here is a kind 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.230

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.450
 young of itself already that maybe 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.099

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.780
 well apart from that software apart from it 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.400

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.040
 recommended retail price of 449 euros and 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.930
 for the specification that has in the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.250

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.720
