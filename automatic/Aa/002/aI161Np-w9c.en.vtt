crafts man you guys have two new pedals
what<00:00:31.490> we're<00:00:31.640> here<00:00:31.820> in<00:00:31.910> first<00:00:32.180> is<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:33.050> pitch

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
what we're here in first is the pitch

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.070 
what we're here in first is the pitch
grinder<00:00:33.710> right<00:00:33.860> yeah<00:00:34.370> it's<00:00:34.780> it's<00:00:35.780> our<00:00:35.960> new

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
grinder right yeah it's it's our new

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.430 
grinder right yeah it's it's our new
baby

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
baby

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.890 
baby
it's<00:00:36.710> our<00:00:36.890> first<00:00:37.070> digital<00:00:37.610> unit<00:00:37.970> it's<00:00:38.780> a

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
it's our first digital unit it's a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.040 
it's our first digital unit it's a
sequence<00:00:39.320> pitch<00:00:39.560> shifter<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:40.340> we<00:00:41.000> tuned<00:00:41.300> each

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
sequence pitch shifter and we tuned each

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.870 
sequence pitch shifter and we tuned each
stage<00:00:42.410> of<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.680> sequence<00:00:43.100> with<00:00:43.700> its

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
stage of the sequence with its

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.549 
stage of the sequence with its
corresponding<00:00:44.210> knob<00:00:44.780> here<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:47.380> just<00:00:48.380> haven't

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
corresponding knob here I just haven't

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.280 
corresponding knob here I just haven't
set<00:00:48.830> you<00:00:49.040> a<00:00:49.100> pretty<00:00:49.520> random<00:00:50.200> selection<00:00:51.200> of

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
set you a pretty random selection of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.520 
set you a pretty random selection of
notes<00:00:51.470> right<00:00:51.770> now<00:00:52.690> so<00:00:53.690> we<00:00:53.809> turn<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.110> range<00:00:54.290> all

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
notes right now so we turn the range all

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.829 
notes right now so we turn the range all
the<00:00:54.559> way<00:00:54.680> up<00:00:54.860> to<00:00:54.949> 8<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.430> what<00:00:55.610> you<00:00:55.730> like<00:00:56.690> you

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
the way up to 8 and what you like you

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.470 
the way up to 8 and what you like you
heard<00:00:57.019> before<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:57.500> jumps

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.790 

you<00:01:01.480> can<00:01:01.630> do<00:01:01.750> it<00:01:01.840> anywhere<00:01:02.140> between<00:01:02.320> one<00:01:02.770> and

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
you can do it anywhere between one and

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:14.889 
you can do it anywhere between one and
eight<00:01:03.210> I've<00:01:04.210> been<00:01:04.390> really<00:01:04.570> into<00:01:05.310> three

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.690 

so<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.380> individual<00:01:15.950> numbered<00:01:16.429> knobs

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
so the individual numbered knobs

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.310 
so the individual numbered knobs
explained<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> little<00:01:17.539> more<00:01:17.780> in<00:01:17.869> depth<00:01:18.079> of<00:01:18.200> what

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
explained a little more in depth of what

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.730 
explained a little more in depth of what
they<00:01:18.469> do<00:01:18.640> they<00:01:19.640> each<00:01:19.820> correspond<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.740> one

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
they do they each correspond to one

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.160 
they do they each correspond to one
stage<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.520> sequence<00:01:22.939> so<00:01:23.600> here<00:01:23.929> we're<00:01:24.079> on

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
stage of the sequence so here we're on

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:31.080 
stage of the sequence so here we're on
stage<00:01:24.770> one

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.749 

sort<00:01:31.390> of<00:01:31.479> an<00:01:31.630> actual<00:01:31.930> pitch<00:01:32.290> yeah<00:01:33.189> and<00:01:33.460> what<00:01:33.640> is

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
sort of an actual pitch yeah and what is

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.240 
sort of an actual pitch yeah and what is
the<00:01:33.880> range<00:01:34.150> of<00:01:34.509> pitches<00:01:34.750> available<00:01:35.409> we<00:01:36.040> go

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
the range of pitches available we go

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.770 
the range of pitches available we go
from<00:01:36.520> one<00:01:36.729> octave<00:01:37.119> down<00:01:38.369> oops<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:40.420> octave

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
from one octave down oops one octave

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.279 
from one octave down oops one octave
down<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.810> two<00:01:44.170> hotties<00:01:44.470> up<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.930> can<00:01:47.110> handle

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
down to two hotties up if you can handle

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.730 
down to two hotties up if you can handle
it

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
it

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.580 
it
I<00:01:47.770> don't<00:01:48.369> like<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.640> go<00:01:48.759> that<00:01:48.970> high<00:01:49.350> that's<00:01:50.350> just

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
I don't like to go that high that's just

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.340 
I don't like to go that high that's just
me<00:01:52.590> now<00:01:53.590> we<00:01:54.220> also<00:01:54.369> have<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.580> glide<00:01:54.909> feature<00:01:55.350> so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
me now we also have a glide feature so

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.899 
me now we also have a glide feature so
if<00:01:56.409> you<00:01:56.500> leave<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.830> on<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.950> one-step<00:01:57.490> pattern

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
if you leave it on a one-step pattern

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.149 
if you leave it on a one-step pattern
then<00:01:58.360> you<00:01:58.390> can<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:59.229> can<00:01:59.259> tap<00:01:59.649> through<00:02:00.009> the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
then you can you can tap through the

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:14.480 
then you can you can tap through the
whole<00:02:00.340> sequence<00:02:00.690> at<00:02:01.690> any<00:02:01.899> speed<00:02:02.259> II<00:02:02.289> like

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.590 

or<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:16.230> jumping<00:02:16.680> way<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.860> guess

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.930 

this<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.050> also<00:02:23.260> your<00:02:23.620> your<00:02:23.950> tempo<00:02:24.310> control<00:02:24.490> for

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
this is also your your tempo control for

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.960 
this is also your your tempo control for
the<00:02:25.060> overall<00:02:25.480> speed<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.430> freeze<00:02:30.790> the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
the overall speed and you can freeze the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.900 
the overall speed and you can freeze the
pattern<00:02:31.330> anytime<00:02:32.290> it's<00:02:32.470> running<00:02:32.830> and<00:02:33.520> as<00:02:33.730> soon

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
pattern anytime it's running and as soon

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.030 
pattern anytime it's running and as soon
as<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.090> let<00:02:34.270> go<00:02:34.300> it'll<00:02:35.200> resume<00:02:35.620> right<00:02:35.860> where

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
as you let go it'll resume right where

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.890 
as you let go it'll resume right where
you<00:02:36.100> left<00:02:36.250> off

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.570 

not<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.020> get<00:02:41.170> too<00:02:41.320> philosophical<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:42.310> do<00:02:42.460> you

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
not to get too philosophical but do you

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.000 
not to get too philosophical but do you
see<00:02:43.150> this<00:02:43.360> as<00:02:43.600> more<00:02:44.020> of<00:02:44.080> an<00:02:44.260> instrument<00:02:44.620> in

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
see this as more of an instrument in

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.460 
see this as more of an instrument in
itself<00:02:45.580> or<00:02:45.910> something<00:02:46.210> that<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.870> equally

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
itself or something that is equally

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.600 
itself or something that is equally
suited<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.720> making<00:02:49.720> actual<00:02:50.710> chords<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.370> lead

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
suited to making actual chords and lead

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.950 
suited to making actual chords and lead
lines<00:02:51.940> freakin<00:02:52.900> well<00:02:53.890> my<00:02:54.580> idea<00:02:54.760> was<00:02:55.240> to<00:02:55.600> try

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
lines freakin well my idea was to try

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.070 
lines freakin well my idea was to try
and<00:02:56.050> make<00:02:56.290> an<00:02:56.470> arpeggiator<00:02:57.720> pretty<00:02:58.720> much<00:02:58.870> just

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
and make an arpeggiator pretty much just

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.970 
and make an arpeggiator pretty much just
for<00:02:59.260> fun<00:02:59.640> but<00:03:00.640> as<00:03:00.790> soon<00:03:00.970> as<00:03:01.030> we<00:03:01.210> had<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:02.530> working

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
for fun but as soon as we had a working

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.760 
for fun but as soon as we had a working
prototype<00:03:03.570> we<00:03:04.570> started<00:03:04.960> writing<00:03:05.170> songs<00:03:05.500> with

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
prototype we started writing songs with

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.310 
prototype we started writing songs with
it

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
it

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.370 
it
essentially<00:03:08.320> using<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.800> as<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:08.950> new<00:03:09.190> instrument

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
essentially using it as a new instrument
