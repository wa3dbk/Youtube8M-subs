00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
they're just in these huge bins and you

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.380 
they're just in these huge bins and you
just<00:03:14.019> dig<00:03:14.440> through<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.859> bins<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.400> everything

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
just dig through the bins and everything

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.059 
just dig through the bins and everything
that<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.629> buy<00:03:16.840> they<00:03:17.230> just<00:03:17.379> weigh<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.590> out<00:03:17.829> and

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.069 
that you buy they just weigh it out and
I<00:03:18.130> believe<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.519> was<00:03:18.609> something<00:03:18.819> like<00:03:19.000> 87<00:03:19.840> cents

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.190 
I believe it was something like 87 cents
a<00:03:20.200> pound<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.669> found<00:03:22.120> this<00:03:22.359> letter<00:03:22.630> there<00:03:22.989> and
