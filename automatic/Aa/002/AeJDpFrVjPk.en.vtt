00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 need to find or recharge your 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.520
 electric car discover each map 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.589
 more service to locate the terminals 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.540
 recharge download app 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.230
 on your smartphone and you join 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.809
 the community 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.250
 also share information about 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.100
 charging points in your area 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:33.600
 chargemap available on the tablet web 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:36.239
 is mobilized hello to all I am with 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.129
 Sebastian to talk about the cable of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.719
 recharge it not that actually allows for 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.760
 reload a zoe on a socket 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.809
 classic domestic so I want to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.600
 specify anyway that it is not a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.219
 cable that is provided by renault and which 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.809
 is approved by renault 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.559
 really a cable manufactured by 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.120
 independent manufacturers 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.000
 so I wanted to have the opinion of 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.199
 Sebastian on this cable is what you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.360
 can tell me a little bit in which 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.680
 context they use and if they 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.420
 work properly in a 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.280
 first time it allowed me to start 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.239
 with masoe since obviously like 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.930
 many people who buy a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.030
 electric car 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.939
 we have some setbacks install a 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.370
 terminal immediately so that's already the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.750
 the first solution that allowed me to 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.020
 to recharge by car at home in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.800
 a second time also it allowed 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.260
 to go a little further with the 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.710
 car than what is planned to know from 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.710
 make two round trip of almost two 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.320
 hundred 200 km east each between 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.250
 strasbourg and belfort pretty much what and 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.960
 So what can you give us? 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.660
 maybe an idea of ​​charging times 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.630
 also with this cable in 16 amps 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.690
 classic it is about 8 9 hours 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.940
 for one for a full recharge 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.470
 so I could go up to 32 amps 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.250
 obviously the mill room made the 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.780
 do-it-yourself for 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.030
 the names of experts did not necessarily 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.130
 brought to hand what and there we 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.960
 arrives at 4 am to 4 hours recharge 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.479
 not what is very appreciable for a 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.100
 round trip weekend is all about 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.360
 is acceptable and so what are you 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.060
 have a return maybe in 10 years loses 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.280
 then on charging times 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.369
 so that's a little bit where the pack 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.420
 hurts but well let's say the problem 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.060
 really specify does not come from the cable 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.380
 in itself but from the dice car 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.900
 that we go down below the 16 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.780
 amperes efficiency are seen 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.190
 drastically reduced I did not go 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.990
 to the end but the 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.360
 the display of the car madicked me 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.720
 time around the last 15 hours is 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.520
 really there we are really in the 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.780
 extra refill when we go down in 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.730
 below 16 amps and suddenly this is 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.670
 that this cable is usable easily 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.380
 by all where you have to have 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.170
 certain certain notions to be able to 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.940
 use it correctly for a 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.320
 charging would look classic on a socket 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.430
 of current they really usable by 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.440
 all one simply has to respect 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.610
 some procedure an order 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.820
 of use to have the least amount of 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.370
 possible problem now for them 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.710
 are really practical to 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.970
 the use is possible that it makes 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.500
 that it was necessary to make some small 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.590
 changes on the cable compared 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.660
 to the kits that is provided basic with 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.850
 the adapter socket and blow 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.230
 are there moments the cable has 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.540
 not allowed charging is what it is 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.930
 things that happen 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:16.230
 yes but as often c 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:19.230
 the facility that would be involved the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.360
 zoe imposes certain constraints as 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.740
 we 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.990
 some have seen it on forums 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.500
 or others namely a grounding 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:30.150
 cable is correctly the phase is 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.800
 neutral in the right order that's it 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.600
 things that everyone can 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.820
 relatively easily mastered it's 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.560
 true that in addition to the cable will require 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.540
 maybe make the investment of a 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.460
 little trick only target what the sheikh 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.600
 has bet electrician know who who 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.430
 does not cost more than one euro at leroy 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.630
 merlin which allows to spot phase is 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.770
 neutral and disassemble the facts a 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.940
 socket to reverse the 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.010
 cables to the cellars or what's that at 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.650
 final this cable at once it allows for 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.180
 recharge your car every day but 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.460
 if it can also be insurance in 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.080
 does for people who see there have any 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.000
 business trips and depends perhaps 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.040
 charging stations and a given moment 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.890
 do not want if the bollard certainly needs 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.940
 not be blocked quite that's it 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.770
 it was a course that allows you to go 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.090
 far and there would be even higher 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.310
 in my thinking it's a cable that 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.020
 allows that will ask my 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.670
 sense of developing the electric car 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.470
 outside does not actually agree on the 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.150
 makes a car today 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.410
 electric whatever it is for me 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.230
 she must be able to recharge on a 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.100
 taking a domestic battery not suddenly it 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.750
 we are going to make a 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.340
 cable demonstration and we will see 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.590
 how does it work then it's gone 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.410
 so we may have already presented the 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.410
 cable and explain the different 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.930
 elements that make up completely then 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.930
 the cable is composed of a housing that 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.840
 is directly connected to the pistol 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.990
 reloading in solidarity with 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.860
 equipment that resists rain 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.720
 humidity 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.540
 her child is no problem there 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.180
 can recharge outside with it is 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.490
 directly surmounted by a connector 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.610
 industrial type so there must be reasons 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.660
 convenience of all equipment or 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.570
 other I decided to put a 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.530
 three-phase connector but of course there 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.790
 will be delivered this connector to the base I 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.760
 was not functioning will be strictly 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.480
 the same so on I'm going to hook up 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.390
 the adapter that connects 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.650
 at a classic power outlet like 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.080
 the operation is still pretty 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.700
 close to a new box and that there you 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.440
 the box and all the time under tension 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.200
 when one connects it to the car 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.430
 must know that the case 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.780
 must be connected to the socket 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.280
 before plugging it into the car 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.169
 unlike a little bit to what is 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.970
 says in the user manual of zoe and 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.320
 which is valid only in 15 united states 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.600
 Boxing can not be plugged 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.890
 indifferently the front cable is the 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.390
 terminal is in line on the cars there 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:50.130
 have to start by plugging in the 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:52.470
 current case and in a second 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.960
 time before connecting it to the car 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.580
 to select from the current of 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.430
 charges so what I advise of 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.860
 do it even if you do not know 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.140
 still the state of the upstream facility 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.060
 these two directly set it to 16 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.520
 years loses we will have a lot more 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.229
 chances of 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.729
 the load launches successfully 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.720
 after we can lower the current of 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.729
 tanks if we ever see that it heats 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.560
 too much for technical reasons or 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.900
 better to start it's clear you can 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.849
 one can lift his outstanding load of 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.169
 charge the walleye will react in real time 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.629
 so it's a little bit more the 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.800
 housings versus a boxing mold on 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.180
 can adapt the charge current into 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.330
 according to needs according to 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:34.099
 technical constraints that has behind 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:36.110
 so then we open the hatch of the 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.879
 zoe so that's pretty important to the 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.319
 to do at that moment and not to open 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:43.120
 the trapdoor too long before because 

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:47.000
 if we leave the hatch open in 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.949
 suspense too long the computer 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.370
 board will cut himself he will refuse the 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:55.840
 load so I plug the connectors 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.840
 and immediately 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.139
 I activate the load with this button remains 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.000
 press it until they flash 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:07.250
 so there the car actually talks with 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.830
 the with the cable quite so here 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.259
 the little slap we heard we 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:16.009
 means that the car has validated the 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:18.680
 validate the installation and ordered 

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:20.569
 casing to throw the current on the on 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.940
 the cable so we hear the charger 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.259
 sifel has the charge started we will see 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.599
 that on the dashboard so suddenly 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:31.009
 we actually see on the board of 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:34.669
 board that the charge is in progress 12:30 from 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:36.529
 charges for a quarter a quarter of the 

00:07:34.669 --> 00:07:37.580
 battery roughly to recharge in this 

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.919
 which roughly corresponds to what 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:42.310
 I explained before about 9 hours to 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:42.310
 a full charge
