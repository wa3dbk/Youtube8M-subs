00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
I can do a series on all that sort of

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.399 
I can do a series on all that sort of
stuff<00:02:47.620> is<00:02:47.980> fair<00:02:48.489> game<00:02:48.930> but<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:49.989> know<00:02:50.109> think

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409
