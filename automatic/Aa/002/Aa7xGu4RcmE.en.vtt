 the orange trees I knew on the globe and be 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.529

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.269
 For you, who wants to get better? 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.759

 take care of body and hair full of touches 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.610
 here we are going to talk about diets I have 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.230
 supplementation and everything related to inflation 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.660
 for us women 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.430
 first of all I'll give you a visit to 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.430
 each what you lose in the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.950
 gym or in your diet is a ton 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.300
 of false and envious people that you will 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.090
 lose your life 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.879
 people want to see better but never 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.590
 better than them to start I think 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.539
 important that the region with the errors of 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.090
 some women in the academies 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.309
 the first most common leg training 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.420
 every day thinking that the open leg 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.820
 and be faster 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.010
 this is totally wrong or muscle 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.320
 grows at rest and is not a day 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.020
 for the other than a monster but 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.810
 Release I have not seen any 48 hours 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.430
 You do not train upper limbs. 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.890
 if you're the type that does not think it's pretty 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.380
 Let's build your story, I got it. 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.200
 enough in heavy training but 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.750
 letting senior training is so ugly 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.040
 women have only one arm and no 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.170
 also does not 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.600
 and I think you will not like 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.479
 stay with the gelatin arm when your 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.119
 presence of third abdominal vegetables 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.160
 in excess a thousand sit ups will not do 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.160
 you lose most what you are going to do 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.400
 This is diet and Europe injects itself into 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.530
 I say not easy hunger and 56 correctly 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.259
 this will be addressed here in this framework 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.570
 there are also 4 with maturity in training and 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.880
 but you can be sure if you see a 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.399
 girl training with friends or with 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.280
 It's because the training is 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.530
 it's too light or a waste 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.660
 can you repair the maroons are always 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.610
 shaken closed and it is not because it is 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.760
 They do not have a closed face. 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.860
 because it hurts they are concentrated and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.989
 so it has to be you have to 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.600
 get used to the pain because she who 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.810
 separate a good workout from a bad workout if 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.540
 you finished 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.640

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.360

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.250
