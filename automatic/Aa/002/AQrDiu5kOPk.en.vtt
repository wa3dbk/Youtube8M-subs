00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 today in ice production we will play with 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.600
 fire without burning 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.279
 do not 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.340
 welcome to ice production 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.530
 selection that reveals all the mysteries 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.879
 special effects and techniques 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.660
 your favorite movies of 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.370
 hollywood 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.440
 I am frigo marrÃ³ your presents all 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.089
 this comes from the previous video where this 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.160
 boy asked me to do something with 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:46.110
 full seems very complicated but no no what 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.120
 is the only thing you need to do the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.829
 fire and explosion are the archives 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.809
 that come in the downloadable package of 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.129
 special effects essential action 2 a 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.339
 Once all this is together let's go to the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.199
 tutorial we take fire and place it 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.239
 in the window and we take it back so that 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.500
 lace in this then we put the smoke 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.880
 has the smoke the fire did not have 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.950
 no sense and it would be enough 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.659
 ridiculous once placed we have to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.490
 make it look like it's a real fire for 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.770
 the smoke we scale if necessary and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.600
 we reduce the opacity of 87% for the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.880
 fire we're going to effect correction of 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.680
 color color balance hl and we give you the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.840
 color that we like or personally 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.250
 it gave him a touch like that orange so he 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.200
 see as real as you can 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.509
 then we doubled the house's layer and 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.970
 we add the effect of the color balance 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.860
 hl that mentioned above we do 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.430
 a mask around the fire and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.290
 we click on the most expensive option increases 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.240
 the open feather of the mask until 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.340
 it is seen that the fire produces that flash 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.200
 orange once finished add the 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.370
 color correction the effects and the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.370
 leader 2 and then 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.340
 I think next week we 'll see 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.340
 this 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.130
 for the most skeptical that the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.560
 Real false and maximum I encourage you to
