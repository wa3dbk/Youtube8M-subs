00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.420
 circle center ans 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.680
 one so 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.140
 a pebble man as you can the 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.280
 see on the screen so 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.050
 you present 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.439
 I will introduce you to my rogue 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.290
 I have several modes we will say gdra 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:28.119
 mode withdrawal pm withdrawal pea engeance 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:32.710
 wafula I 'm lucky turn with a 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.820
 mix of both so I present to you 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.309
 my crap because it's been a long time 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.210
 that I'm doing pvp I'll start with 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.219
 a tram 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.870
 then my and case that I stopped there is 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.700
 not long then I'm going to you 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.230
 present my mill because I find 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.379
 that rogue it's a class very 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.910
 interesting to play because it does not 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.519
 depends not necessarily stuff because 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.219
 that it's a site a class for me 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.339
 who plays according to the way of playing 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.289
 and not necessarily the stuff 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.449
 we can have a very ordinary staff 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.920
 full acts and it is power I have 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.000
 well managed if we have a good way of 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.770
 play a good skill so 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.130
 so here I am going to introduce you to my 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.740
 stuff 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.900
 so I planned a stuff a 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.190
 ceremonial or level 134 but for 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.229
 the moment I have not planned any ap 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.090
 finally I'm 131 I'll see maybe 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.040
 thereafter so I have a little under 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.930
 water ride a small only kenzo 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:32.729
 pm with the pretty little stats etc 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.649
 I have a soft hammer mortise effect words 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.619
 simply because it was the 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.899
 only who had in hd bfm 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.869
 after I have a small tasty soft tray 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:47.500
 exo pea that seems to me rather than I 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.640
 perfect with a little mastrad is over 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.859
 good life it's me who made the 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.299
 true excuse it is not no 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:59.229
 more huge and but here after I have some 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:02.770
 small bottari over vita also a 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.750
 little belt throws me I have as I 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.719
 could 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.190
 a little I was going to 940 vita and and a 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.770
 little spring leaf over quickly to 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.100
 auxerre also with a small fuser 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:19.690
 between two future coise 19 the kawa of 60 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.150
 wisdom an examiner an acrobat and a 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.700
 player so 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.230
 after my trophies my pet changes 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.140
 of idea dg 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.019
 dragodinde also emerald plum a 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.860
 level without changing my trophies 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:39.159
 according to the genre of the game plays against 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.200
 so it's been a long time since I practice 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.610
 pvp pvp a little bit mans but I 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.060
 think I can present you a lot 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.360
 nice videos so here I'm going to you 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.810
 present a little rogue to the putsch 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.739
 see the rox good this is a rogue 1 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.299
 that roxx is a rogue like 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.129
 the others but I think my way of 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.890
 playing is interesting compared to 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:14.040
 others without necessarily boasting or access 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:14.040
 exeter will accept after that say other 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.620
 I am on the siemens server too 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:24.359
 for those who know 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:27.579
 so that's a typical level 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:31.030
 so here I have the jirs and the whore acts 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.489
 so I put five hundred and fifty years 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:37.209
 vitality of blood with the parent show in 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.120
 asia i am by shaw luck wisdom i 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.720
 go everywhere and intel soon 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.320
 so 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.720
 I have 35 critical strike a pm withdrawal 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.440
 I do not have my trophies so 35 with 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:56.030
 a pretty leak a nice tackle a few 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.530
 damage 38 22 power damage 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.840
 no damage is practically 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.370
 nice resistance 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.590
 after when I put the bad luck 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.120
 necessarily it takes me away that takes me out of the 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.120
 gym and only adds luck 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.690
 plays in 5 5 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.580
 so we like it at its pm 5 2 in I 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.739
 that only one vote against it is the 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.210
 look a little bit of my stuff because 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.070
 when for example I want to play with the 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.240
 chaffer and attract loved ones and more 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.160
 still they redouble abbott 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.060
 finally here I am going to show you 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.060
 my little rock this putsch hoping that 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.729
 so 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:44.249
 I show you the good alaa attack 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:45.050
 espangol first thing 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.439
 exceptional 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.229
 it remains one that remains a ruble to 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:56.009
 rogue acted what after I can you 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:05:00.330
 show my rops too from akbou missing a 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:02.459
 vehicle so I'm one on two shots 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.889
 critics practically on all 

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:10.169
 spells so all that gives pretty 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.209
 for damage after level bomb 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.610
 I think everyone knows it is 

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:20.309
 a rogue rocks a heck of a leap 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:23.479
 that's why a lot of 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:29.039
 people say that a ruble class to 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:30.990
 bitter tea but for me a cunning sepa 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.419
 shit and since you still have to know 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.249
 really play well to place in 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:40.229
 bombs et cetera and so on 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:43.159
 and I do not like people who 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:47.429
 say ah because it's a lot of 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:49.259
 reflection and and even for me a 

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:52.349
 rogue should have a lot more 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:57.089
 playing time to replay at the end of the turn 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:06:04.579
 foiled after so at nothing 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:04.579
 exceptional but good 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.170
 it's going to do big damage surely but 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.690
 here's 2000 I'm going up to almost 1300 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.110
 maybe with reviews on town 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.560
 etc. 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.660
 I could go up to 1300 sees the man 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.720
 as said it remains a ruble to handle a 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.270
 I have nothing exceptional level level 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.590
 stats good you I showed you quickly 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:44.020
 makes water spells when I hear 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:48.890
 that there is a coach playing on all 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:51.140
 chances when when people camps 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:54.760
 play with the da shield when we play 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.760
 with the shield acted but it allows to 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:02.240
 2,2 against the resistances here I play 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.900
 plus the water element 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:09.980
 the element acted that pau but I like 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:12.500
 compared to the spell since it allows to 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:15.950
 put erosion with troubles we're going 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.450
 even to transfer dpa with with rest 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.250
 we do not ask you for bombs it's 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:26.389
 practically the same as 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:29.720
 that that agility the minutes good I 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:31.790
 think I finished for today I 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.240
 will present you several pvp videos in 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:37.669
 live or without comment finally I 'll see 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.639
 well good here I leave you 

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:44.120
 subscribe to baa match n 6 dice but otherwise 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:47.560
 you are not holding back good here is good 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.560
 continuation and next
