so I was almost entire cutting edges in

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.949 
so I was almost entire cutting edges in
the<00:02:03.060> entire<00:02:03.360> blade

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.729 

really<00:02:09.959> good<00:02:10.819> ergonomics<00:02:12.349> fits<00:02:13.349> in<00:02:13.500> hand
