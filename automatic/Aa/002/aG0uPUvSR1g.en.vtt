00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.529
 Good day to all friends 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.600
 to the channel with you phisher and 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.970
 Today I want to show you Easter eggs 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.429
 who were with him in the classics first 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.099
 Easter eggs are no longer in current 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:27.220
 version is in the quarter of warriors under 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:31.119
 there are some people in the city 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:34.239
 slap 20 to 100 with swords and here 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.629
 there is a fight between the guys who 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.489
 you can see some observatories came running well 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.520
 They probably put them somewhere experience 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.610
 I certainly do not know 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.890
 there is a dispatch to the fight club 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.770
 because one of the fighters is called 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.610
 Tyler want something is not fighting but the idea is not 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.060
 must fight 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.010
 Okay, let's go by the way, when I came up 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.170
 closer mob still warmed up with me 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.550
 and the carnage began 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.650
 I think this place is good for you all 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.440
 familiar because it is here arthas 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.080
 meted killed his father here even 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.080
 blood lingering left but it will not be about 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.020
 this is probably every second player knows 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.970
 the story of the fallen prince and no one else 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.640
 the secret is that there is a star wars universe 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.530
 which we all love too much in general 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 the story of darth vader arthas is very 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.670
 seems Arthas was a mentor Houtart 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.890
 who believed that arthas would grow and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.170
 will become the king but arthas himself 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.990
 strength and glory of what he wanted 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.240
 achieve also anakin skywalker that is 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.430
 Darth Vader wanted a lot of strength and character 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.110
 very similar to the example of what arthas 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.690
 went over to the fucking side and by so 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.830
 called kingdom salvation why 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.450
 killing morgana with 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.700
 and Anakin went to the dark side 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.069
 because I wanted to save save my 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.530
 wife he saw in his dream how she 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.130
 dying and at the end of the dart you play 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.990
 knocked down on your son's lap 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.600
 repent of their sins snot drool 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.240
 tears and so on the same thing we see in 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.090
 rear to k to k to to arthas but this is what we are 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.690
 eventually we are going to loot it in the classics 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.209
 Ilyicha no, but this is just my opinion 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.750
 so that you read this suddenly 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.150
 anyone 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.420
 Still it is interesting that before 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.970
 arthas is somewhat similar to a gift vader 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.849
 okay, it's time to go to the next easter eggs 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.790
 in kaab camp goblins hibari worth 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.459
 a jar of dough 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.240
 if you don't see so here you can 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:32.490
 say hello to the second terminator 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.560
 let's move on next 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.870
 Easter eggs are in plain sight but not 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.730
 many do not know it is about 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.510
 pirate bay and 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.640
 this is a goblin statue with arms outstretched 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.650
 This Easter eggs on the statue of Christ the Savior 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.440
 from rio de janeiro after the cataclysm 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.630
 the statue was damaged but now she 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.600
 eat naturally safe and sound 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.910
 and last for easter 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.390
 located on one of the barren mountains 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.730
 lands 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.650
 you will see an unremarkable crypt 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.750
 if not pull him here you can 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.360
 contemplate the skeleton on the throne which is all 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.240
 still squeezes his faithful sword in his hands 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.890
 sending the canon to the barbarian is still a bunch 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.900
 all sorts of corpses what else do we have 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.820
 various vases and chests and someone in there 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.400
 I thought about making a fire and did not understand 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.290
 who wove it into his head all okay 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.880
