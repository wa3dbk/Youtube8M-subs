00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.830
 in Frankfurt have in the Lower Bavarian Eggenfelden 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.560
 we condemn 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.129
 Bierhoff made the cease-fire 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:10.739
 These were the biggest ones that the market 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.739
 looked forward to this message the whole week 

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:18.460
 What about the design of the bouncer's income 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.239
 and then I could be able to 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.150
 Sounds like a perfect plan is running 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.800
 Audi calculate loudly 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 the hard underground try your luck again 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.509
 SV spread 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.310
 take a look 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.310
 the boys meet resistance 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.750
 as a chemist 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.080
 we like to come back 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.810
 the completed 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.410
 a very very nice all selected the engine brake wants the bouncer 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.100
 claim that the bathroom closes again it is not my midnight 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.270
 strange 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.290
 just coming 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.480
 the market will continue to wait for that to finally come 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.130
 but probably because I just look for each other 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.310
 although I stop German Passat 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.470
 how to be won 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.090
 can integrate 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.870
 but in the choice of 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.360
 he alone has no problems when she calls, for example, Fiat 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.880
 in headwind 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.620
 then for Maren landed during the year 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.520
 4 on the back of the well the rationale for the controversial intake 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.840
 politics 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.100
 but there are the difficulties and conflicts between certain 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.440
 Foreigners groups are having a negative impact with the evening only 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.960
 granted access to a certain percentage of certain foreigners 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.120
 I am not feeling at all Burton actually feels quite a percent, he advises 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.450
 Parents bad choice 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.660
 Manuela kids have fun 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.980
 and again and again to experience the disappointment that you have to help 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.880
 Meadows now no nice feeling is him 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.350
 Clinging in Bavaria 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.530
 we confront the bouncers winter tires television 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.060
 from Jung program and 3 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.820
 and adverse we talk to the club and his friend a story we 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.820
 Wanted to know why the whole thing before I am income 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.960
 there is nothing for the best 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.590
 So, being a foreigner or not all of them is no reason to be here 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.939
 in or out certainly comes 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.589
 we know honors that he will pass this passage on the fine criteria 

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.819
 Website of Alba stands 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.760
 we have to have the stronger as if the opposite of what they are 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.799
 just in said they always said that percent it does not matter if 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.329
 Lausanne is or not if you give it a consensus for and percent yes Muslims 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.159
 AirTran Seers gives 151 percent Sun City to other people 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.719
 Dr 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.150
 Bonnie owner Timo Federer for unfortunately not in front of our camera 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:43.249
 instead, attorneys attorney's foreigner quota policy he writes to us 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.919
 rather, in the past it has clashes between 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.639
 given to rival groups of foreigners 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.820
 Therefore, the number of people from this environment is at certain exhibitors 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.940
 limited to avoid known from the past problems 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.839
 a disco operator can sort out by nationality 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:04.219
 we ask experts 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:09.079
 Alone the conjecture king now more than 50 dead a lasso and then 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.930
 maybe more than 30 Alba was 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.150
 then there's Zoff then there's but that's why I have to from the outset 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.349
 prevent 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.200
 the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.309
 Discriminates the respective ice takes big bang train but whoever 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.269
 Dr Gerber wants to go dancing 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.849
 is a violation of the General Equal Treatment Act Football 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.149
 not an isolated case 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:33.549
 Germany's discus regularly discriminates against foreigners and migrants 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.250
 the paragraph with the foreigner quotas policy Steffen example also often the 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.709
 wildest times 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.009
 who can help drive 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:44.439
 maybe the Bavarian state parliament 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.560
 here Martin Neumeier takes care of discrimination Saturday 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:50.669
 I would be familiar 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.239
 discussed with the just to get into conversation and say okay 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.189
 we make the world on Saturday at 23 o'clock always the weather mother 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.409
 still in the process 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:00.619
 in the club 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:04.609
 4 6 8 wants to talk to the book there so and finances 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:07.249
 the debitel others 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:09.669
 The idea was already in Straubing 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.499
 Here the integration politician Peter Stranninger is fighting against discrimination 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:17.289
 one of the discount for he tried the disco operator two years ago 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.829
 to make sense of the round table on the table today 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.270
 consternation 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270
 the affected ones showed their limited understanding 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.409
 and come out is nothing 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.120
 APA again this year 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.120
 it's back to a similar 4 of the coming 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.820
 100 it weather did not help us a good one 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.419
 why not easy 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.529
 if a foreigner was coming 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.400
 and he is rejected 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.050
 with the reason 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.430
 We want you to be a Turk too much now 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.809
 then he can make a successful suits 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:58.829
 However, the strategists will be relatively quick then their 

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:00.500
 Change strategy 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.400
 and say we do not give a reason anymore 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.900
 around us and the lawsuit prospects are becoming significantly worse 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.029
 is not bound to give reasons 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:14.639
 why he does not let someone in that Ronny has already responded 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.559
 after our driver made the end of what belongs to the website 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.770
 No, I can say he has and betrayed his friends now 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.729
 therefore mean 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:31.469
 Law professor Volker Rieble is therefore becoming a civilian resistance 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.980
 that i could well imagine that server might be together too 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.900
 the union or citizens group 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.020
 just because then advertising against this discussed saying here will be 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.390
 I would not let it in because of my appearance, although I'm good at it 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.180
 Renault speak to nice little video clip then someday there will be 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.339
 People too with buy one 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:53.650
 can help themselves behave sun so it is only self 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.369
 Today the game is over 

00:05:56.369 --> 00:05:58.810
 Racism is explained Murray was driving the car 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.050
 It can not understand everything explained the association will soon become one 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.289
 elapse
