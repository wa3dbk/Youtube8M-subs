these<00:01:52.979> cases<00:01:53.399> because<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:53.790> don't<00:01:53.939> make<00:01:53.970> your

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
these cases because they don't make your

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
like the GPS Bluetooth Wi-Fi signal

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.550 
like the GPS Bluetooth Wi-Fi signal
reception<00:04:13.120> but<00:04:13.540> so<00:04:13.690> far<00:04:13.900> can<00:04:14.169> say<00:04:14.319> that<00:04:14.470> the

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
reception but so far can say that the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.770 
reception but so far can say that the
quality<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.130> phone<00:04:15.370> is<00:04:15.579> very<00:04:16.180> nice<00:04:16.450> now<00:04:16.750> i

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.509 
quality of the phone is very nice now i
think<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.349> the<00:04:17.440> battery<00:04:17.739> inside<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.310> going

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
think that the battery inside is going

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.640 
think that the battery inside is going
to<00:04:18.639> be<00:04:18.729> about<00:04:18.910> two<00:04:19.239> thousand<00:04:19.599> milliamps<00:04:20.139> here

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
to be about two thousand milliamps here

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.959 
to be about two thousand milliamps here
we<00:04:20.769> can<00:04:20.919> already<00:04:21.039> see<00:04:21.310> that<00:04:21.340> it<00:04:21.579> does<00:04:21.729> come

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:21.969 
we can already see that it does come

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.399 
we can already see that it does come
pre-installed<00:04:22.270> with<00:04:22.690> some<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.080> google

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409
