00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
because it does a lot of damage but

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.640 
because it does a lot of damage but
because<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> weight<00:01:06.570> your<00:01:07.140> character

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
because of the weight your character

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.070

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
some reason it seems that it's a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.149 
some reason it seems that it's a
one-shot<00:01:13.860> kill

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
one-shot kill

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310
