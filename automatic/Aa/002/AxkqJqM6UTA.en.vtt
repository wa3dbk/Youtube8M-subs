discussing how to get rid of the fogging
situation<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.820> these<00:00:08.970> masks<00:00:09.780> so<00:00:10.349> January<00:00:10.590> when

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
situation on these masks so January when

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.680 
situation on these masks so January when
you<00:00:10.950> pick<00:00:11.099> up<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.309> mask<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:12.360> know<00:00:12.420> people

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
you pick up a mask you know people

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.060 
you pick up a mask you know people
always<00:00:12.780> tell<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.139> know<00:00:13.259> use<00:00:13.440> some<00:00:13.469> toothpaste

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
always tell you know use some toothpaste

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.799 
always tell you know use some toothpaste
and<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.969> know<00:00:15.059> there's<00:00:15.210> different<00:00:15.570> kind<00:00:15.719> of

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
and you know there's different kind of

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.019 
and you know there's different kind of
procedures<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.379> things<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.070> do<00:00:17.220> using

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
procedures and things you can do using

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.970 
procedures and things you can do using
anti-fog<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.900> all<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.199> which<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.890> know

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
anti-fog and all that which you know

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.980 
anti-fog and all that which you know
works<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.430> an<00:00:20.520> extent<00:00:20.939> but<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.420> my<00:00:21.539> experience

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
works to an extent but for my experience

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.990 
works to an extent but for my experience
the<00:00:22.230> best<00:00:22.260> way<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.650> get<00:00:22.920> rid<00:00:23.100> of<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.369> foggy<00:00:23.640> mask

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the best way to get rid of a foggy mask

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.750 
the best way to get rid of a foggy mask
is<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:25.230> basically<00:00:25.439> burn<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.130> silicone<00:00:26.609> layer

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
is to basically burn that silicone layer

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000 
is to basically burn that silicone layer
off<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.269> inside<00:00:27.660> in<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> manufacturing

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
off the inside in the manufacturing

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.490 
off the inside in the manufacturing
process<00:00:29.150> what<00:00:30.150> happens<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.929> kind<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.260> mold

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
process what happens is kind of a mold

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500 
process what happens is kind of a mold
and<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.769> squeezes<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> mask<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.090> some<00:00:33.420> of

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
and it squeezes on the mask and some of

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.970 
and it squeezes on the mask and some of
that<00:00:33.600> silicone<00:00:33.899> gets<00:00:34.290> embedded<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.920> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that silicone gets embedded on the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.340 
that silicone gets embedded on the
inside<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.820> lens<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.329> what<00:00:37.110> I'm<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
inside of the lens so what I'm going to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.680 
inside of the lens so what I'm going to
show<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> guys<00:00:37.739> today<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.370> how<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> burn<00:00:39.420> that

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
show you guys today is how to burn that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.229 
show you guys today is how to burn that
silicone<00:00:40.140> layer<00:00:40.290> off<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.879> rid<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
silicone layer off and get rid of the

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.060 
silicone layer off and get rid of the
nasty<00:00:43.200> fog<00:00:43.620> anyway<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.710> make<00:00:46.710> sure<00:00:46.739> you

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
nasty fog anyway so just make sure you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.299 
nasty fog anyway so just make sure you
have<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> tempered<00:00:48.170> tempered<00:00:49.170> glass<00:00:49.320> mask<00:00:50.010> if

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
have a tempered tempered glass mask if

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.040 
have a tempered tempered glass mask if
it's<00:00:50.460> plastic<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:51.120> would<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.449> recommend<00:00:51.690> this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
it's plastic I would not recommend this

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.090 
it's plastic I would not recommend this
because<00:00:52.260> you're<00:00:52.379> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> burn<00:00:52.770> through<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
because you're going to burn through the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.160 
because you're going to burn through the
lens<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.489> that's<00:00:53.610> no<00:00:53.789> good<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.989> make

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
lens and that's no good so just make

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
lens and that's no good so just make
sure<00:00:55.199> it's<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.500> tempered<00:00:55.800> glass<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:57.090> mask<00:00:57.270> we

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
sure it's a tempered glass the mask we

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.630 
sure it's a tempered glass the mask we
have<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.079> spittin<00:00:58.739> micro<00:00:59.160> mask<00:00:59.340> and

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
have here is the spittin micro mask and

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.670 
have here is the spittin micro mask and
all<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.660> need<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.840> really<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.469> lighter

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
all you need is really just a lighter

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.100 
all you need is really just a lighter
you're<00:01:02.579> going<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.809> essentially<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.019> you're

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
you're going to essentially what you're

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.660 
you're going to essentially what you're
going<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.260> do<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.799> light<00:01:05.460> that

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
going to do is just like light that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.060 
going to do is just like light that
flame<00:01:05.939> underneath<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.510> lens<00:01:06.799> don't<00:01:07.799> put<00:01:07.950> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
flame underneath the lens don't put it

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.830 
flame underneath the lens don't put it
right<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.850> put<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.720> know

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
right on if you just put it you know

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.500 
right on if you just put it you know
close<00:01:10.170> enough<00:01:10.470> where<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:10.890> actually<00:01:11.070> see

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
close enough where you can actually see

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.420 
close enough where you can actually see
that<00:01:12.510> silicone<00:01:13.080> slowly<00:01:13.500> burning<00:01:13.920> off<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.369> don't

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
that silicone slowly burning off I don't

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
that silicone slowly burning off I don't
know<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.700> guys<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.090> see<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.509> there<00:01:15.920> but

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
know if you guys can see it on there but

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.410 
know if you guys can see it on there but
you'll<00:01:17.070> notice<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.549> silicone<00:01:17.970> slowly

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you'll notice that silicone slowly

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.920 
you'll notice that silicone slowly
starting<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.020> peel<00:01:19.320> away<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.420> that's<00:01:21.420> usually

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
starting to peel away and that's usually

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.560 
starting to peel away and that's usually
what<00:01:22.049> causes<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.560> fogging<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.580> there<00:01:23.759> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
what causes the fogging on there and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.090 
what causes the fogging on there and
it's<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> huge<00:01:25.080> pet<00:01:25.290> peeve<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.590> mine<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.979> what

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
it's a huge pet peeve of mine and what

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
it's a huge pet peeve of mine and what
you'll<00:01:26.220> notice<00:01:26.520> there<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> see<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
you'll notice there you see that that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.319 
you'll notice there you see that that
fog<00:01:28.430> starting<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> form<00:01:29.759> which<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.090> same

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
fog starting to form which is the same

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.880 
fog starting to form which is the same
thing<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.659> happens<00:01:30.990> when<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.650> on<00:01:31.770> your

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
thing what happens when it's on your

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.770 
thing what happens when it's on your
face<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.299> body

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
face your you know you have that body

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.870 
face your you know you have that body
heat<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.130> trapped<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.640> cold

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
heat and you know trapped with the cold

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.580 
heat and you know trapped with the cold
water<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> outside<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.229> mask<00:01:37.409> will
