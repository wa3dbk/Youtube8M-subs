particular smart was not designed to be
a<00:01:12.030> motorway<00:01:12.540> car<00:01:12.899> however<00:01:13.079> I'm<00:01:13.590> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.579> take

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
a motorway car however I'm going to take

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.920 
a motorway car however I'm going to take
it<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> motorway<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:16.440> any<00:01:17.430> car<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.720> my

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
it on the motorway because any car in my

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.649 
it on the motorway because any car in my
opinion<00:01:19.580> should<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.760> capable<00:01:20.940> of<00:01:21.270> motorway

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
opinion should be capable of motorway

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.760 
opinion should be capable of motorway
trap<00:01:23.479> okay<00:01:24.479> I'm<00:01:24.630> doing<00:01:24.870> 60<00:01:25.260> on<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.380> motorway

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
trap okay I'm doing 60 on the motorway

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.110 
trap okay I'm doing 60 on the motorway
but<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.040> do

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.830 

bury<00:01:30.780> something

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
bury something

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.859 
bury something
okay<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.859> new<00:01:34.070> smart<00:01:34.429> fortwo<00:01:34.700> ed<00:01:35.240> is<00:01:35.570> going

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
okay so the new smart fortwo ed is going

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.599 
okay so the new smart fortwo ed is going
to<00:01:35.929> have<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.049> higher<00:01:36.320> top<00:01:36.560> speed<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.829> about<00:01:36.950> 70

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
to have a higher top speed of about 70

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:39.069 
to have a higher top speed of about 70
it<00:01:38.149> doesn't<00:01:38.420> stop<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.719> from<00:01:38.750> feeling

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
it doesn't stop you from feeling

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.069 
it doesn't stop you from feeling
vulnerable<00:01:39.439> on<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:40.100> freeway<00:01:41.049> bearing<00:01:42.049> down

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
vulnerable on the freeway bearing down

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.990 
vulnerable on the freeway bearing down

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.920 

it's<00:01:48.480> scaring<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.790> new<00:01:50.970> smart<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.780> going

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it's scaring the new smart is not going

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.720 
it's scaring the new smart is not going
to<00:01:52.020> win<00:01:52.080> any<00:01:52.140> prizes<00:01:52.560> when<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:52.950> comes<00:01:53.160> to<00:01:53.430> speed

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
to win any prizes when it comes to speed

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.390 
to win any prizes when it comes to speed
however<00:01:54.540> all<00:01:54.990> those<00:01:55.290> batteries<00:01:55.800> down<00:01:56.070> low

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
however all those batteries down low

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.600 
however all those batteries down low
give<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.300> smart<00:01:57.630> ed<00:01:58.170> an<00:01:58.440> advantage<00:01:59.220> over<00:01:59.400> its

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
give the smart ed an advantage over its

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.480 
give the smart ed an advantage over its
petrol<00:02:00.090> counterpart<00:02:00.650> feels<00:02:01.650> much<00:02:02.280> more

petrol counterpart feels much more

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.219 
petrol counterpart feels much more
sturdy<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.300> wind<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.870> think<00:02:04.110> it's

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
sturdy in the wind and I think it's

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.490 
sturdy in the wind and I think it's
because<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.619> way<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> batteries<00:02:05.310> just

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
because the way of the batteries just

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.699 
because the way of the batteries just
you<00:02:07.500> know<00:02:07.619> good<00:02:08.429> really<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:10.500> good<00:02:10.649> news

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you know good really and the good news

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.760 
you know good really and the good news
doesn't<00:02:11.400> stop<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:12.380> there's<00:02:13.380> one<00:02:13.560> thing
