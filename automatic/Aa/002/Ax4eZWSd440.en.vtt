00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.600 
material well I better be careful what I
say<00:03:42.629> about<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.200> other<00:03:43.290> guys<00:03:43.739> in<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.099> team<00:03:44.280> but

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
say about the other guys in the team but

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.020 
say about the other guys in the team but
who<00:03:45.450> are<00:03:45.569> all<00:03:45.690> brilliant<00:03:46.170> but<00:03:46.610> it's<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.910> think

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
who are all brilliant but it's I think

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.330 
who are all brilliant but it's I think
it's<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.510> bit<00:03:48.690> tricky<00:03:49.140> for<00:03:49.349> them<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.709> take<00:03:49.950> sort

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
it's a bit tricky for them to take sort

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.890 
it's a bit tricky for them to take sort
of<00:03:51.440> requests<00:03:52.440> perhaps<00:03:52.890> for<00:03:53.250> me<00:03:55.340> no<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.780> know

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
of requests perhaps for me no you know

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.110 
of requests perhaps for me no you know
it's<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.349> think<00:03:58.980> it's<00:03:59.340> just<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.730> weird

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
it's I think it's just a weird

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.050 
it's I think it's just a weird
environment<00:04:00.780> for<00:04:00.930> them<00:04:01.079> to<00:04:01.110> be<00:04:01.349> you<00:04:01.860> know

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
environment for them to be you know

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.309 
environment for them to be you know
asked<00:04:03.060> by<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.209> girl<00:04:03.540> who<00:04:03.780> knows<00:04:04.019> something

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319

asked by a girl who knows something
about<00:04:04.560> bikes<00:04:05.010> what<00:04:05.280> how<00:04:05.579> she<00:04:05.640> wants<00:04:06.030> it

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090
