00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.640
 Yes 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.529
 just for a beginner it is 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:24.670
 sometimes not easy from de gea too 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.250
 change or cfg I still have 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:31.030
 let time come up with an exercise 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.520
 Especially for beginners is very quiet 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.800
 quite easy just step by step 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.090
 go ahead 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:44.920
 we'll just go straight to three 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:48.510
 through the d major you know that now 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.510
 plays from the side of at 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.050
 now you see the little finger on it 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.730
 on the third bund.de side and lifts 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.060
 the fingers just play on again 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.060
 the side 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.850
 he is that you already have these three fingers 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.850
 free and grass for a major 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.890
 the same must be done again from the beginning 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.890
 de 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.110
 how to play here also work only up 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.470
 at the moment so up to this gate 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.470
 a bit tough 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
 d 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.549
 G 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.549
 a 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080
 d 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.290
 a 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.640
 and gradually even if we are now 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.640
 notice 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.569
 that we have room for this you can 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.569
 So slowly your fingers up 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:28.780
 the page comes step by step 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.780
 then 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.270
 Sometime 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.270
 especially the chord goes 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.160
 the little finger on it and tries 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.110
 now let the two fingers 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.490
 but still plays by a de 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.490
 side and then again 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.670
 and then just listen to the sounds 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.700
 so if you do that every day now only 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.830
 I guarantee you five minutes 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.830
 you hear that by the end of the week 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.050
 and it can get faster and faster 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.060
 So neither I'll do it again 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.610
 Just place each page 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.019
 importing 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.019
 b 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.019
 the 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.079
 I did have to consciously stop times 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:26.800
 taken away so you see what sounds 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.800
 I grab and someday 

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:38.959
 Imagine how the 100 meter run 

00:04:35.929 --> 00:04:40.339
 if more than 1000 meters run - one 

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:42.679
 a bit short the distance but 1000 

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:45.229
 meter run if you give the same gas 

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:47.719
 do not you get it anymore? 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:53.080
 let time go piece by piece 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:53.080
 step by step the way forward 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.470
 Alone from this harmony 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.909
 their combination of these three harmonies 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.190
 is again wonderful song 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:05.830
 but we make a difference 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.900
 another time until then 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.169
 i hope i could help her and 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.169
 bye
