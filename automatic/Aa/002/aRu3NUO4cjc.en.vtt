00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.509
 a yellow roar against a red robot is it 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.650
 a war between and then I'm not 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.650

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.900
 they are thrown under make even calder 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.270
 this is one 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.220
 here 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.140
 what the fuck was that 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.140
 move goes deeply does 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:38.660
 to 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.940
 well then go more moves than put 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.280
 these can hardly be found in 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 a game 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.690
 padova 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.949

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.019
 yes but it does nothing done has burned 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:57.800
 to that instead strong because it hunts the 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.989
 chainsaws will drive away what they like but 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.500
 I can't hunt then I learned 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:09.300
 a nice move looks can not 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.710
 drive away nothing

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.300

 the game has discovered a new move 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.930
 trying to make a fatality that sucks 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.770
 among the votes we would remit would be all 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.400
 music 3 May because if we don't learn to 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.310

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.780
 these things are quite complicated 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.939
 then to carry out this concept 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.939

 parade enough that the most active does 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.479
 according to the first move 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.490
 only by creating waves does it develop over 5 m 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:11.129
