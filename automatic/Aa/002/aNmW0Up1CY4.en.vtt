00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
 Hello everyone 

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.640
 Today, I will show you how to transform the baby's room 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.600
 In a fantastic jungle 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.480
 Only for really brave kids! 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.740
 THE JUNGLE - Part 1: Painting the walls 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.000
 This is the room that will transform in our Jungle 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.740
 To do this, I will use a paint for the walls 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.200
 And specific adhesives for decoration 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.860
 I'm going to have a professional result, without spending a fortune 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.420
 Here is the material I will use 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.640
 Painting for the walls 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.440
 Masking tape 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.440
 Paint rolls 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.360
 Pencil 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360
 Paint brushes 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.220
 Grid for draining the roll 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.760
 Dry and stick to mix the paint 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.320
 And an extension for the roll 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.960
 To decorate a child's room we do not use too bright colors: 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.040
 The baby will spend a lot of time in the room, 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.600
 Sometimes he plays, sometimes he sleeps. 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.640
 Here are the colors we have chosen 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.100
 This yellow, for the top 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.380
 And this green for the lower part. 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.140
 Let's start covering the parts that you do not mess with the masking tape. 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.080
 At this point, we covered everything I did not want to get dirty 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:58.700
 The floor, with a cellophane, you can also use old leaves or cartons 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.420
 Let's draw our lawn on the wall 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.600
 We start more or less from here. Use a pencil 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.660
 Draw sharp shapes, 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.000
 which remind a little grass. 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.560
 If the design does not convince you, you can correct it because it will be covered by the paint. 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.880
 We finally begin to paint I dilute the color according to the instructions 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.320
 Now, I'm starting to paint the pieces you can not catch up with the roll, 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.380
 so I will use the brush. 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.820
 Let's start with the edges of our lawn. 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.920
 Let's start with the color of the upper part, 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.000
 so if we make mistakes, we will fix them with green 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.480
 Well, now I can take the ladder and paint the top 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.320
 I suggest you ask for help, especially if you are pregnant! 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.660
 At this point we can roll, and thanks to the extension does not need the ladder 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.920
 Dip the roll in the paint and drain well 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.780
 The movement must be vertical, from top to bottom. 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.600
 If you put the masking tape on, it's a breeze! 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.980
 Now we can start painting the base 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.880
 in order to better follow the tips of the grass, I will use before a small brush 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.700
 Now I can take the brush a little bigger and make all the edges and where the parts did not come with the roller 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.140
 Here I try to go back possible 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.460
 I also do these tips because here with roll is a little difficult 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.300
 The movement is always vertical 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.540
 Do not worry if you still see the marks on the wall. 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.900
 the paint is still drying, after you will not see anything. 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.700
 When the wall is dry, you have to paint a second time. 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:09.260
 It is very important: do not forget to give the second layer 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 The result will be really professional. 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.140
 And here is the result after the second layer 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.420
 I removed the tape and put the plates 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.980
 Now, wait 2 or 3 weeks, because the walls are completely dry 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.060
 After, I can apply my stickers. 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.440
 In the meantime, I will buy them online at www.leostickers.fr
