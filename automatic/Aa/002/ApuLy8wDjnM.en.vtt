00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.930 
but I'd rather do it by there know where
I<00:03:06.090> see<00:03:06.780> with<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.260> if<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:08.270> were<00:03:09.270> if<00:03:09.330> again<00:03:09.709> the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
I see with that if I were if again the

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.490 
I see with that if I were if again the
middle<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.120> F<00:03:12.209> chord<00:03:12.450> there<00:03:12.690> note<00:03:12.989> which

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
middle of the F chord there note which

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.570 
middle of the F chord there note which
is<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.680> eye<00:03:13.800> on<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.280> g<00:03:14.430> string

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.440
