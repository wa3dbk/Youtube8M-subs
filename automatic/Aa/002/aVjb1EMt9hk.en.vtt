boat it's in good shape the main problem
with<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.279> boat<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.699> cosmetics<00:00:21.449> upholstery

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
with the boat is cosmetics upholstery

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.179 
with the boat is cosmetics upholstery
the<00:00:22.800> upholstery<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.430> these<00:00:23.640> three<00:00:23.970> seats<00:00:25.189> is

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the upholstery on these three seats is

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.019 
the upholstery on these three seats is
bad<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.680> no<00:00:28.680> big<00:00:28.890> deal<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> recover<00:00:29.609> they<00:00:29.849> come

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
bad and no big deal to recover they come

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.479 
bad and no big deal to recover they come
out<00:00:30.210> easy<00:00:30.510> or<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.830> guess<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.160> could<00:00:32.309> put<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
out easy or you I guess you could put a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.680 
out easy or you I guess you could put a
cover<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.910> rip<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.649> i<00:00:34.649> would<00:00:35.340> i<00:00:35.760> would<00:00:36.149> recover

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
cover a rip but i would i would recover

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.280 
cover a rip but i would i would recover

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.010 
them these two seats stowaway and i'm
sure<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:40.770> why<00:00:40.950> they're<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.340> better<00:00:41.520> shape

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
sure that's why they're in better shape

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.560 
sure that's why they're in better shape

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
that goes over the whole boat it is a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.639 
that goes over the whole boat it is a
2000<00:00:50.719> 17-footer<00:00:52.460> it<00:00:53.460> has<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> mercury<00:00:54.390> 50<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
2000 17-footer it has a mercury 50 on it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.599 
2000 17-footer it has a mercury 50 on it
now<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.860> says<00:00:56.160> tracker<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.360> tracker<00:00:57.719> was<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
now it says tracker but tracker was a

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.510 
now it says tracker but tracker was a
made<00:00:59.609> by<00:00:59.789> mercury<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:01.350> two<00:01:01.620> thousand<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.399> it's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
made by mercury in two thousand so it's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.880 
made by mercury in two thousand so it's
the<00:01:02.609> same<00:01:02.640> motor<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.750> mercury<00:01:04.229> 50<00:01:06.890> some

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
the same motor as a mercury 50 some

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.679 
the same motor as a mercury 50 some
people<00:01:08.189> didn't<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.460> tracker<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.330> early

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
people didn't like tracker in the early

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
people didn't like tracker in the early
days<00:01:09.869> because<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.320> were<00:01:10.380> evinrude<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.939> this
