off<00:05:52.870> okay<00:05:53.320> that's<00:05:54.130> all<00:05:54.310> you<00:05:54.460> do<00:05:54.610> is<00:05:54.729> lean<00:05:55.060> it

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
off okay that's all you do is lean it

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.570 
off okay that's all you do is lean it
back<00:05:55.240> like<00:05:55.570> that<00:05:55.750> so<00:05:56.169> it<00:05:57.100> doesn't<00:05:57.370> get<00:05:57.430> in<00:05:57.550> the

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
back like that so it doesn't get in the

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.600 
back like that so it doesn't get in the
way<00:05:57.640> and<00:05:58.060> now<00:05:58.120> I<00:05:58.419> do<00:05:58.750> is<00:05:58.870> install<00:05:59.140> the<00:05:59.200> light<00:05:59.610> so
