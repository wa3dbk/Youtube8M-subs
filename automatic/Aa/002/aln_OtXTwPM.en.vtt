 has long been 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:32.099
 I think and then I take a further 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:40.530
 choose a place find out yes it is install 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:44.849
 you came here this is necessary 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:55.829
 close the finish now this but us 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:04:03.750
 don't need it so the only way we are 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:06.460
 they run the pilot pilot like this 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.450
 so as not to interfere 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:22.290
 and of course we create any animation 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:29.830
 animation for example he runs so so 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:34.270
 so let know know what is bad 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:40.980
 The character is now there, of course, but I 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.980
 I'll show you how to get any figures 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:53.760
 so a little bit of moving here and so 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:57.490
 some sort of garbage opened up close 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:05.050
 so you write down what you write down 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:12.790
 so here so here so here so here so 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:16.390
 here so here so well well I do not know well 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:27.240
 what does not work in principle should 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:40.740
 something should happen and so so so 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:40.740
 so little so so so so so so 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:55.090
 Type here so do here so here so 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:59.160
 so here so here so here so here 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.160
 so here 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:18.590
 so so so so so so so so 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.439
 so here are the articles that I take off 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:26.349
 via step can studio 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:28.419
 they are through bandits and this is a new other 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:35.599
 this 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:38.270
 this is very important because you understand what 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:46.210
 claim to finding a studio and then many people write 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:46.210
 bandits well here so what we got 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:04.129
 catch and how bad you are when fast 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:08.500
 it is straight smoothly as if now the caboose 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:12.580
 mysticism will some kind of game lays yes 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:38.409
 Thank you all for watching and before

00:07:49.810 --> 00:08:02.949
