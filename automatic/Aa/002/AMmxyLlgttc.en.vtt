 sophisticated so I hope everyone

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.660
 to see with great affection this evident 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.700
 good as always we're going to start 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.800
 passing us a shadow test by 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.660
 all our eyelid this will make 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.150
 our shadows last a lot more 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.690
 time and paprika as they are in 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.690
 our palette 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.060
 this time I will use this 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.190
 palette of the brand costales things is 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.290
 super super good I recommend it to 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.720
 everyone so let's start happening 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.750
 we a cocoa color for all our 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.330
 basin and let's blur it we can 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.280
 use this type of brush and after 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.550
 change it for this other one that is a 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.380
 little thinner so with this 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.930
 we can blend the color very well 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.280
 degrading always upwards without 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.280
 lose the bow shape 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.570
 right away we will use this color is 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.540
 a mustard and we're going to put it all 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.490
 our mobile eyelid let's put it to 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.880
 little touches with the help of a brochita 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.880
 flat 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.640
 two 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.560
 now let's take a brown color this 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.320
 it's a little bit darker than the previous one 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.570
 and we're going to put it on the outer edge 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.570
 in order to enhance our look 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.770
 and we are going to blur very well we are 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.440
 using a smaller broach but it is a 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.990
 little bit chubby so it's not going to help 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.990
 very much to blur this area 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.290
 for the lower area of our eyebrows 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.290
 let's use a matte vanilla 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.770
 we went immediately to delineate with 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.750
 delineator of preferences that you 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.200
 wish I'm using this in a way 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.790
 of the pen is of the fifth mark and therefore 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.790
 let's make today an outline 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.920
 super classic but at the same time very finite and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.450
 I'm taking the phone as a reference 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.450
 that I have in the external song 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.329
 do not 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.810
 and then we're going to apply our 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.670
 eyelashes this is preferably if 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.400
 you want it you can simply 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.379
 do it with mascara and I'm 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.660
 using a little eyelash today 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.480
 of the brand time on 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.520
 now let's darken a little and give 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.660
 color our water line using 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.780
 this pencil is green tone cited so it's 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.660
 of the Veronica brand 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.480
 and after that girls we're also going to 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.640
 take color to give a little color to 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.830
 our lower eyelid like a shadow 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.830
 very vibrant green 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.390
 and all these girls colors are from the 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.790
 palette that at the beginning I put the 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.740
 little photo then to end our 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.020

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.020

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.330

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:51.000
 and that's how our eyes finish now for 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.190
 finish the we are not going to take this pencil 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.760
