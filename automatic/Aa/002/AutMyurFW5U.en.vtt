00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.640
 and 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.630
 hello all guys I'm the cat that wins 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.720
 and in today's video we have sugar here 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.610
 that the poor thing has a wound like that 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.369
 that the poor woman unfortunately is not going to 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.950
 serve as a model to teach you what 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.580
 do in these cases it's worth I have to 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.480
 say that in cases of serious injuries 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.930
 you should take them to a veterinarian 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.690
 because maybe they need points 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.629
 antibiotics whatever but good in the 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.160
 case of wounds so small because in 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.280
 principle is not necessary then 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.250
 You can do some cures at home and now 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.650
 it will be enough worth here we see the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.030
 patita to see if it is appreciated and is that 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.329
 I do not want to touch on the much for not 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.329
 hurt him 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.079
 here on the leg will be appreciated or not 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.190
 will appreciate 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.799
 there you can see a little bit in all 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.940
 the little fingers has a little area 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:12.030
 blood coagulated a little bit 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.820
 in this crime in particular he has been 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.580
 lifted the skin a little but only from 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.290
 superficial way is to say the nail the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.830
 musculature does not know this 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.770
 committed 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.560
 I do not know what could happen to him the truth is 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.340
 that looks like it has been 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.200
 a blow throwing himself from the pond as if 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:37.829
 sometimes they do not go down the ramp and discarded 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.240
 it must have hit him like that but 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.600
 you will see that I have no idea because it is that 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.390
 it's never done in wounds them so 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.950
 I have no idea but good as you see is 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 a superficial wound that will cure 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.310
 fast way then naturally it's worth 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.119
 has not fractured any simple nothing 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.460
 nothing's worth it's just that wound like that 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.590
 What we can do is cure you with 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.770
 povidone iodine 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.610
 what I always say is 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.069
 not bad in this case is this brand 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.230
 is usually betadine the brand that you have 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.970
 it's going to be fine if it's a 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.459
 very high concentration men to 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.800
 10% is doing well that is what we usually 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.959
 use at home if it is a concentration more 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.360
 high, then you can reduce a little 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.690
 with water, as you can see, the turtle is 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.550
 active on the wall so see 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.530
 sometimes they are looks and the best is not 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.020
 do a little better 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.180
 this 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.700
 the area because it does notice that it has been 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.440
 hit or that has fallen with the leg to 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.540
 backwards because not if it was a fight not 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.480
 it would be like this let's continue to notice that there is 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.410
 been that then what we do 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.410
 well, we can catch 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.290
 in gaza paper to protect a little bit 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.450
 see is that tending with the mobile in 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.940
 the hand since I only have one hand is worth 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.940
 and we miss everything 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.870
 than with one hand and with the turtle 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.300
 hiding the leg this is a disaster 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.030
 to catch walking the normal thing is that you have 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.490
 the two hands and then there is no 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.220
 kind of problem but clear when 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.870
 have on an available hand and 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.210
 writing that I have to hire some 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.430
 professional camera so I recorded myself 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.400
 well now I'll give it a little better 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.590
 when the video ends but good 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.520
 idea is that you can take a little 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.690
 of 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.810
 of iodine and we left it to the little 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.110
 we leave in dry area so that for 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.430
 It absorbs the skin a little 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.250
 then they can enter the water 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.550
 perfectly what is important is that the 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.150
 turtle is active that you see it well no 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.230
 have problems and nothing you can repeat 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.959
 for times a day 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.690
 a few days we go in two or three days the 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.120
 turtle because you will notice that the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.430
 takes to the area a lot better than you 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.090
 is healing a lot if the thing 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.699
 will get worse is very rare in this case in 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.709
 this type of wound if it would get worse to decide 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.870
 if infected that the times you have the 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.910
 very swollen little leg that can not be 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.790
 move now you should go to a 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.320
 veterinarian because maybe the injury is 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.960
 something more serious 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:36.639
 and it only as an antiseptic 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.910
 you are not going to fix it so to continue 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.000
 throwing a little more for him 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:46.770
 penetrate more into what the wound has been 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.770
 and good is a mini counselor 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.770
 that will serve you in case one day you had a 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.479
 emergency to appeal is worth so 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.210
