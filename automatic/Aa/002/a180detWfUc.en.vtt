00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello people welcome again 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:09.510
 back to the meanwhile third and 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.009
 last partie needs a windows xp pc 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.049
 or laptop can do extremely fast 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:19.199
 so far I have already given you two tips 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:27.330
 shown and this is now the third and 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:29.189
 last tip so finally on city then 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.000
 on settings and on 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:39.719
 Control Panel then this opens 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:49.190
 window and then I would have to go up here in 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:52.559
 enter this search field percent camp 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.649
 percent how that is written 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 I hide now below 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:01.670
 then he gets on like parents are looking for her 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.170
 that and then come me such files 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.210
 the files that are just as it is 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.500
 is just from windows 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.450
 saved that the files needed 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.960
 you just can not do it all 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.650
 Clear 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.970
 so that's all and less gram that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:25.369
 it will unnecessarily save the consumed 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:31.439
 it will make you slow down and 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:34.200
 so it gets slower and I'm in 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.290
 internet stop so soft then it will be 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.860
 they will always be new 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.090
 everything here again and again made and 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.299
 you have to stop over again 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.079
 delete so a magnet is everything and 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.079
 that leaves everything 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:57.180
 and you really need there too 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:05.930
 not became 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.930
 some do not go trying to clear 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.109
 and yes if just not going there must 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.439
 stop but necessary 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:23.780
 and then still hold the trash 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:27.939
 teachers and then you actually have 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.620
 even the pc made extremely fast 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.959
 and that was the third one 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.000
 part i thank you again 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.909
 we have then see each other 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.909
