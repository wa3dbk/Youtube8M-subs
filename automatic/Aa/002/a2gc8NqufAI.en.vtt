00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.390 

I've<00:00:03.240> grown<00:00:03.540> up<00:00:03.570> skateboarder<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.859> started

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
I've grown up skateboarder and I started

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.600 
I've grown up skateboarder and I started
snowboarding<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:07.319> remember<00:00:07.919> being<00:00:08.309> half

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
snowboarding and I remember being half

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.759 
snowboarding and I remember being half
asleep<00:00:08.780> and<00:00:09.780> thinking<00:00:10.170> about<00:00:10.230> snowboarding

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
asleep and thinking about snowboarding

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.850 
asleep and thinking about snowboarding
and<00:00:11.219> skateboarding<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:13.200> realize<00:00:13.559> you'd<00:00:13.740> be

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
and skateboarding and I realize you'd be

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.369 
and skateboarding and I realize you'd be
the<00:00:13.950> coolest<00:00:14.190> thing

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
the coolest thing

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.650 
the coolest thing
if<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.130> could<00:00:17.339> ride<00:00:17.609> like<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> snowboard<00:00:18.570> on

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
if you could ride like a snowboard on

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.499 
if you could ride like a snowboard on
the<00:00:18.779> pavement<00:00:19.730> what<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.759> realized<00:00:21.060> pretty

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
the pavement what I realized pretty

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.839 
the pavement what I realized pretty
early<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.929> is<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> snowboard<00:00:23.220> has<00:00:23.489> to<00:00:23.669> go

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
early on is that a snowboard has to go

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.870 
early on is that a snowboard has to go
to<00:00:23.880> move<00:00:24.509> sideways<00:00:24.899> over<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.769> snow<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
to move sideways over the snow and a

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.970 
to move sideways over the snow and a
skateboard<00:00:27.329> dozens<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.680> ability

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
skateboard dozens and it's that ability

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.639 
skateboard dozens and it's that ability
and<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.820> ability<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> control<00:00:30.720> how<00:00:31.320> much

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:31.649 
and the ability to control how much

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.530 
and the ability to control how much
you're<00:00:31.859> moving<00:00:32.160> laterally<00:00:32.579> over<00:00:32.879> the<00:00:33.059> surface

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
you're moving laterally over the surface

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.439 
you're moving laterally over the surface
it<00:00:33.809> makes<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.379> snowboard<00:00:34.920> ride<00:00:35.159> so<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.670> need<00:00:35.970> so

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
it makes a snowboard ride so you need so

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.540 
it makes a snowboard ride so you need so
different<00:00:36.870> from<00:00:37.079> skateboard

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
different from skateboard

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.630 
different from skateboard
and<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:40.170> realized<00:00:40.559> if<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.829> could<00:00:41.010> get<00:00:41.340> that

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and I just realized if I could get that

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.630 
and I just realized if I could get that
snowboard<00:00:42.329> motion<00:00:42.870> onto<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> pavement<00:00:43.640> but

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
snowboard motion onto the pavement but

00:00:44.640 --> 00:01:06.359 
snowboard motion onto the pavement but
that<00:00:44.790> would<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> coolest<00:00:45.360> ride<00:00:45.690> ever

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.760 

the<00:01:07.369> snowboard<00:01:07.880> has<00:01:08.090> two<00:01:08.479> basic<00:01:08.770> components

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
the snowboard has two basic components

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.190 
the snowboard has two basic components
has<00:01:10.720> steel<00:01:11.720> edges<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:13.850> has<00:01:14.030> a<00:01:14.060> ptex<00:01:14.869> base

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
has steel edges and it has a ptex base

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.350 
has steel edges and it has a ptex base
the<00:01:15.560> steel<00:01:15.799> edges<00:01:16.310> are<00:01:16.580> what<00:01:16.820> allow<00:01:16.940> you<00:01:17.119> to

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
the steel edges are what allow you to

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.320 
the steel edges are what allow you to
lock<00:01:17.630> in<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.320> hold<00:01:18.619> a<00:01:18.770> tight<00:01:18.979> car<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:20.060> base<00:01:20.299> is

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
lock in and hold a tight car the base is

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.420 
lock in and hold a tight car the base is
what<00:01:20.720> allows<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:21.320> slide<00:01:21.560> free<00:01:22.190> board

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
what allows you to slide free board

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.280 
what allows you to slide free board
works<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.090> same<00:01:23.119> way<00:01:23.330> you've<00:01:23.810> got<00:01:23.840> these

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
works the same way you've got these

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.889 
works the same way you've got these
swiveling<00:01:25.039> Center<00:01:25.520> wheels<00:01:25.759> that<00:01:26.420> stimulate

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
swiveling Center wheels that stimulate

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.539 
swiveling Center wheels that stimulate
the<00:01:27.020> base<00:01:27.229> you've<00:01:27.590> got<00:01:27.740> these<00:01:27.920> outer<00:01:28.220> wheels

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
the base you've got these outer wheels

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.639 
the base you've got these outer wheels
to<00:01:28.850> simulate<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.420> edges<00:01:29.840> just<00:01:30.500> like<00:01:30.619> a

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
to simulate the edges just like a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:31.930 
to simulate the edges just like a
snowboard<00:01:31.220> you're<00:01:31.430> going<00:01:31.549> to<00:01:31.610> roll<00:01:31.759> your

snowboard you're going to roll your
weight<00:01:32.149> from<00:01:32.390> edge<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.899> base<00:01:33.110> depend<00:01:33.619> what

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
weight from edge the base depend what

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.139 
weight from edge the base depend what
you<00:01:33.950> want<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.220> do<00:01:34.280> with<00:01:34.399> your<00:01:34.520> board<00:01:34.789> you<00:01:35.000> want

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
you want to do with your board you want

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:36.310 
you want to do with your board you want
to<00:01:35.240> hold<00:01:35.360> it<00:01:35.420> tight<00:01:35.659> turn<00:01:35.899> you're<00:01:36.140> going<00:01:36.259> to

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
to hold it tight turn you're going to

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.779 
to hold it tight turn you're going to
put<00:01:36.470> all<00:01:36.619> your<00:01:36.740> weight<00:01:36.799> on<00:01:36.950> your<00:01:37.070> edges<00:01:37.490> hold
