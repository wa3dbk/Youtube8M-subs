00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:10.480
 then he took this formula weapon 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:13.220
 requires a transplant 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.110
 overgrown phalaenopsis yes that's how them 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.720
 I will change the words to make them very much 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.570
 bottom is yellow leaves why is it 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.210
 there is a fact that here is the root 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.270
 new growing it breaks through the bases 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.690
 leaf through and after that only through 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.730
 some time begins to die off 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:35.569
 that's why itâ€™s connected 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.399
 yellowing the veins are damaged and of course 

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:42.069
 conduction is still difficult 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.600
 and the leaf begins to die such leaves 

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:47.359
 advisable when transplanting of course 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.729
 remove peduncles rarely punch 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.399
 the leaves did not recognize you the grooves come out and 

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:54.949
 grow up and root still trying 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:58.120
 grow less down although up too 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.899
 happens so this one happens 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.789
 damage to the sheet here we see 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:07.570
 leaf damage to the peduncle just as well 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:10.189
 so the sheet after some time 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.039
 die in principle when selected 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.280
 plants in the store especially participate 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:20.299
 people choose after on sale when 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.530
 already blooming flowering plants from accomplishes 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.109
 but it is advisable to remove the flowers here 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.450
 such some plants spike 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:33.380
 it is advisable to cut off as its best 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.259
 prune it better prune 3 buds 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.710
 on the peduncle below we take and believe 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.070
 nodes one two three count nila 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.570
 the third node is 2-3 centimeters higher 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.829
 we cut for what it needs it 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.710
 for that of this circumcision 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:54.450
 peduncle dormant buds wakes up new 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.520
 the bud is how we saw this plant 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.380
 color here from such sleeping buds went 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.140
 new flower stalk that is flower stalk 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.299
 continue to grow beyond that 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.759
 phalaenopsis fruit is celebrated new 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.700
 Naturally, the spike stem logic is worth it 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.130
 peduncle can reduce up to three times 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.840
 approximately that is if we are all the time 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.140
 it can be cut off periodically 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.640
 sprinkle all new and new buds such 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.160
 phalaenopsis can reduce 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.420
 23 years after that, usually 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.580
 death perishes in principle fully at all 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.090
 these poor inevitably through some 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.840
 time 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.540
 that's just for the reason that this 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.750
 only concerns hybrid dutch yes 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.230
 Well, not only Dutch Malaysian 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.430
 no matter why they are so high 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:51.840
 the content of hormones in plants is very 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:54.000
 many flower stalks appear old as 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.130
 would keep growing start growing but 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.049
 that's very bad why look 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.959
 the lower leaves are damaged by the roots they 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.299
 die off and the top too broken 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.160
 peduncle is certainly a joy that 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.650
 the plant blooms here and says 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.100
 that he did not have long to live and now 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.290
 frequent blooms like this lead to 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.989
 depletion of a plant because well not 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.280
 will have time to form plants 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.920
 powerful stem and shortened 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.410
 rosette new leaves because 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.389
 just can't cope with that 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.790
 the number of flowers and gradually 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:33.410
 the plant starts to die off 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.269
 die off and that's what turns such 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.630
 often from his flowering plants here in 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.359
 example there street these flower stalks which 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.760
 which is also dry old peduncle it 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.310
 new formed from the growth point at 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.099
 A dish that's rotten 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.790
 reiterated growth point struck new 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.190
 peduncle 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.220
 and plants die completely killed 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.220
 how often is 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.130
 yes fact the life of plants of them 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.070
 shops for nasa sent not 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.920
 more than 23 years 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.290
 well maybe sometimes a little bit late 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.470
 much too depleted bloom 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.380
 plants look and new flower stalks and 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.530
 old here you see he brought down without ceasing 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.620
 two years it's an old flower girl tanos 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:24.740
 past this year have not had time to bloom 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.380
 the previous one is already climbing new 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.750
 inflorescence of the bud that is a plant 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.230
 exhausted and turns into such 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.010
 here is much emaciated with damaged 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.920
 leaves 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:41.570
 quietly going dying as if 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.240
 for pro flowers see his life just 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.480
 can you transfer on interest sleds and 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.600
 trimming these peduncles right now 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.900
 went kidney so as not to suffer his account 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.750
 it is not necessary to cut off but 2-3 times higher 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.230
 centimeter knot where the kidney went to 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:04.160
 dry out the end heard long and the kidney does not 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:07.430
 no sauce c equally fast that's it exactly 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.940
 Well, it looks like a comparison is not a chapter 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.370
 transplanted plant from above to the room 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.110
 appropriate to class here is sphagnum moss 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:20.870
 to support in the background wet 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.950
 the roots of the fact that the house is very dry and for 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.419
 to salt and when watering 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.260
 filtered by this com they settle on 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.050
 sphagnum 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.470
 we periodically replace it we throw out 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.850
 and put a new one, preferably weak 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.900
 always been alive it prolongs life 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.900
 plants are also very strong
