back so it's nice and tidy up front it's

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.400 
back so it's nice and tidy up front it's
pretty<00:04:06.669> good-looking<00:04:07.180> case<00:04:07.389> it's<00:04:08.199> pretty

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
pretty good-looking case it's pretty

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.580 
pretty good-looking case it's pretty
light<00:04:08.620> also<00:04:09.280> too<00:04:09.730> has<00:04:09.879> got<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.209> power<00:04:10.590> supply

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
light also too has got the power supply

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.970 
light also too has got the power supply
down<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.609> bottom<00:04:12.760> rather<00:04:13.090> than<00:04:13.239> in<00:04:13.359> the<00:04:13.419> top

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
down the bottom rather than in the top

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.589 
down the bottom rather than in the top
so<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.010> will<00:04:15.370> see<00:04:15.489> how<00:04:15.549> that<00:04:15.730> works<00:04:15.849> out<00:04:16.060> and

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:16.599 
so I will see how that works out and

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.689 
so I will see how that works out and
this<00:04:16.660> appears<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.169> be<00:04:17.260> a<00:04:17.380> hundred<00:04:18.310> twenty

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
this appears to be a hundred twenty

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.180 
this appears to be a hundred twenty
millimeters<00:04:19.150> am<00:04:19.299> rather<00:04:20.260> than<00:04:20.470> an<00:04:20.620> eighty<00:04:20.799> one

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
millimeters am rather than an eighty one

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.370 
millimeters am rather than an eighty one
of<00:04:21.310> those<00:04:21.459> are<00:04:21.609> pretty<00:04:21.729> loud<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:23.229> mean

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
of those are pretty loud so I mean

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.770 
of those are pretty loud so I mean
overall<00:04:23.680> is<00:04:23.830> pretty<00:04:24.070> looking<00:04:24.400> case<00:04:24.780> feels

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
overall is pretty looking case feels

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.469 
overall is pretty looking case feels
pretty<00:04:26.400> it's<00:04:27.400> pretty<00:04:27.460> light<00:04:27.909> but<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:28.240> doesn't

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
pretty it's pretty light but it doesn't

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.830 
pretty it's pretty light but it doesn't
go<00:04:28.539> flimsy<00:04:28.990> at<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.139> same<00:04:29.349> time<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:30.720> see<00:04:31.720> is

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
go flimsy at the same time and see is

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.510 
go flimsy at the same time and see is

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
all blacked out powder coating on the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.580 
all blacked out powder coating on the
inside<00:04:33.990> everybody<00:04:34.990> cares<00:04:35.229> about<00:04:35.440> that

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
inside everybody cares about that

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.640
