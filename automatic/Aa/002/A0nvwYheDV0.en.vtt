this<00:00:17.820> week<00:00:18.060> we're<00:00:18.240> going<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.449> look<00:00:18.600> at<00:00:18.810> how<00:00:19.080> we

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
this week we're going to look at how we

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.529 
this week we're going to look at how we
make<00:00:19.740> progress<00:00:19.980> uphill<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.970> our<00:00:21.150> skis<00:00:21.510> and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
make progress uphill with our skis and

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.800 
make progress uphill with our skis and
skins<00:00:25.010> so<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> first<00:00:26.340> thing<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.810> realize

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
skins so the first thing to realize

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.179 
skins so the first thing to realize
about<00:00:27.840> skinning<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> normal

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
about skinning is that it's not a normal

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.339 
about skinning is that it's not a normal
walking<00:00:29.609> motion<00:00:30.119> we're<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.900> lifting<00:00:31.080> our

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
walking motion we're not lifting our

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.840 
walking motion we're not lifting our
needs<00:00:31.590> very<00:00:31.740> high<00:00:31.920> because<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> weight<00:00:32.820> of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
needs very high because of the weight of

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.030 
needs very high because of the weight of
the<00:00:33.059> ski<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.480> boots<00:00:33.780> it's<00:00:34.530> much<00:00:34.710> more<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:34.950> a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the ski in the boots it's much more of a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.760 
the ski in the boots it's much more of a
gliding<00:00:35.430> motion<00:00:36.440> likewise<00:00:37.440> we're<00:00:37.649> not

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
gliding motion likewise we're not

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.400 
gliding motion likewise we're not
pressing<00:00:38.399> our<00:00:38.790> skis<00:00:39.420> into<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> snow<00:00:40.110> because

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
pressing our skis into the snow because

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.930 
pressing our skis into the snow because
that<00:00:40.530> creates<00:00:40.739> too<00:00:41.010> much<00:00:41.160> friction<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:41.879> a

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
that creates too much friction so it's a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.470 
that creates too much friction so it's a
happy<00:00:42.239> medium<00:00:42.629> between<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.989> two<00:00:44.210> secondly<00:00:45.210> we

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
happy medium between the two secondly we

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.389 
happy medium between the two secondly we
want<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.780> make<00:00:45.930> sure<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.410> nice<00:00:46.559> even<00:00:47.160> pace

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
want to make sure it's a nice even pace

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.410 
want to make sure it's a nice even pace
where<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.450> talk<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:50.190> not<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.059> too<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.390> of

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
where we can talk and not be too out of

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.470 
where we can talk and not be too out of
breath<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:52.710> should<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.370> case<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.120> making

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
breath it should be a case of making

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.470 
breath it should be a case of making
steady<00:00:55.050> progress<00:00:55.170> uphill<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.309> keeping<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
steady progress uphill but keeping a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.450 
steady progress uphill but keeping a
good<00:00:58.199> body<00:00:58.379> temperature<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.190> don't<00:00:59.370> get

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
good body temperature so we don't get

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.700 
good body temperature so we don't get
too<00:00:59.670> hot<00:00:59.850> and<00:00:59.940> too<00:01:00.000> cold<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.629> keeping<00:01:01.590> our

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
too hot and too cold and keeping our

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.860 
too hot and too cold and keeping our
energy<00:01:02.039> levels<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.520> legs<00:01:03.120> strength<00:01:03.390> good<00:01:03.629> for

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
energy levels in legs strength good for

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.469 
energy levels in legs strength good for
our<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.530> our<00:01:04.559> descent<00:01:04.979> which<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.420> for<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
our for our descent which is for the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.789 
our for our descent which is for the
most<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.750> us<00:01:06.840> while<00:01:07.080> we're<00:01:07.229> going<00:01:07.380> uphill<00:01:07.560> in

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
most of us while we're going uphill in

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.390 
most of us while we're going uphill in
the<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:08.070> place

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.950 

okay<00:01:13.400> let's<00:01:13.700> have<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.909> quick<00:01:14.570> look<00:01:14.690> at<00:01:14.840> the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
okay let's have a quick look at the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.510 
okay let's have a quick look at the
binding<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.380> see<00:01:15.530> how<00:01:15.680> it<00:01:15.770> works<00:01:15.979> in<00:01:16.130> context

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
binding to see how it works in context

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.550 
binding to see how it works in context
of<00:01:16.670> skinning<00:01:17.080> just<00:01:18.080> orientate<00:01:18.530> ourselves

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
of skinning just orientate ourselves

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.990 
of skinning just orientate ourselves
this<00:01:19.009> is<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.390> toe<00:01:20.390> piece<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.520> on<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.549> Dean<00:01:22.790> fit

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
this is the toe piece and on a Dean fit

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.240 
this is the toe piece and on a Dean fit
binding<00:01:23.420> pin<00:01:23.930> binding<00:01:24.380> and<00:01:24.530> I'll<00:01:24.830> just<00:01:24.979> limit

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
binding pin binding and I'll just limit

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.670 
binding pin binding and I'll just limit
it<00:01:25.340> once<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.940> once<00:01:26.659> the<00:01:26.840> boot<00:01:27.020> is<00:01:27.170> clipped<00:01:27.470> in

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
it once the once the boot is clipped in

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.290 
it once the once the boot is clipped in
like<00:01:27.860> that<00:01:28.100> when<00:01:28.460> you're<00:01:28.580> skinning<00:01:28.820> uphill

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
like that when you're skinning uphill

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.980 
like that when you're skinning uphill
it's<00:01:29.780> worth<00:01:30.640> popping<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.030> the<00:01:32.420> toe<00:01:32.630> piece<00:01:32.780> up

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
it's worth popping the the toe piece up

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.149 
it's worth popping the the toe piece up
like<00:01:33.140> that<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.409> that<00:01:33.500> helps<00:01:33.740> lock<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:34.070> in

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
like that and that helps lock it in

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.950 
like that and that helps lock it in
place<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:34.640> your<00:01:34.880> scheme<00:01:35.240> will<00:01:35.450> not<00:01:35.600> come

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
place so that your scheme will not come

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.820 
place so that your scheme will not come
off<00:01:35.990> while<00:01:36.860> you're<00:01:37.070> skinning<00:01:37.369> uphill<00:01:38.830> while

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
off while you're skinning uphill while

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.310 
off while you're skinning uphill while
you're<00:01:39.950> skiing<00:01:40.159> downhill<00:01:40.369> have<00:01:41.119> this<00:01:41.390> more

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
you're skiing downhill have this more

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.139 
you're skiing downhill have this more
flat<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:42.649> that<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.280> release<00:01:43.520> mechanism<00:01:44.030> can

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
flat so that the release mechanism can

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.109 
flat so that the release mechanism can
still<00:01:44.390> work<00:01:44.570> unless<00:01:44.810> you're<00:01:45.500> um<00:01:45.800> an<00:01:46.460> extreme

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
still work unless you're um an extreme

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.040 
still work unless you're um an extreme
skier<00:01:47.390> but<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:48.440> we're<00:01:48.590> not<00:01:48.649> doing<00:01:48.800> that<00:01:48.950> today

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
skier but so we're not doing that today

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.290 
skier but so we're not doing that today
at<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.200> rear<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.500> ski<00:01:51.770> on<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.970> dune<00:01:53.119> for

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
at the rear of the ski on the dune for

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.370 
at the rear of the ski on the dune for
bindings<00:01:53.600> like<00:01:53.720> every<00:01:53.899> other<00:01:53.960> binding<00:01:54.319> we

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
bindings like every other binding we

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.899 
bindings like every other binding we
have<00:01:54.500> brakes<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.009> also<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.399> heel<00:01:55.610> piece

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
have brakes and also the heel piece

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.800 
have brakes and also the heel piece
which<00:01:56.210> as<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.229> swivels<00:01:57.679> it<00:01:57.890> changes<00:01:58.399> its

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
which as it swivels it changes its

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.630 
which as it swivels it changes its
height<00:01:59.810> in<00:02:00.170> terms<00:02:00.500> of<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:01.130> riser

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
height in terms of the riser

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.460 
height in terms of the riser
as<00:02:01.789> it's<00:02:02.090> known<00:02:02.300> so<00:02:02.690> this<00:02:02.840> is<00:02:02.960> on<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.170> flat

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
as it's known so this is on the flat

inches now this is important feature of
the<00:02:27.590> binding<00:02:27.950> which<00:02:28.070> helps<00:02:28.370> us<00:02:28.459> stay<00:02:28.700> more

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
the binding which helps us stay more

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.580 
the binding which helps us stay more

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
comfortable as the slope with skinning

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.220 
comfortable as the slope with skinning
up<00:02:30.709> gets<00:02:30.950> steeper<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.370> steeper<00:02:31.720> however<00:02:32.720> an

up gets steeper and steeper however an

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.410 
up gets steeper and steeper however an
easy<00:02:33.829> mistake<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.280> make<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.940> use<00:02:35.180> these

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
easy mistake to make is to use these

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.390 
easy mistake to make is to use these
risers<00:02:35.750> far<00:02:36.230> more<00:02:36.410> often<00:02:36.680> than<00:02:36.829> is<00:02:36.950> required

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
risers far more often than is required

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.699 
risers far more often than is required
and<00:02:38.329> generally<00:02:38.900> you'll<00:02:39.049> find<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.560> you'll

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
and generally you'll find that you'll

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.090 
and generally you'll find that you'll
have<00:02:39.859> a<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.160> more<00:02:40.850> efficient<00:02:41.359> skin<00:02:41.750> if<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.829> keep

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
have a a more efficient skin if you keep

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.729 
have a a more efficient skin if you keep
the<00:02:43.220> Rises<00:02:43.640> low<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.780> try<00:02:45.079> and<00:02:45.109> follow<00:02:45.650> a

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
the Rises low and you try and follow a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
skinning track which is fairly mellow so

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.340

for<00:02:48.560> me<00:02:48.680> while<00:02:48.920> I'm<00:02:49.100> guiding<00:02:49.870> my<00:02:50.870> rule<00:02:51.170> of

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
for me while I'm guiding my rule of

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.400 
for me while I'm guiding my rule of
thumb<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.100> if<00:02:52.730> I'm<00:02:53.239> having<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.840> use<00:02:54.200> my

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
thumb is that if I'm having to use my

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.470 
thumb is that if I'm having to use my
Rises<00:02:54.799> at<00:02:54.920> all<00:02:55.160> then<00:02:55.730> I'm<00:02:55.850> probably<00:02:56.000> putting

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
to be rising in and falling inside my

to be rising in and falling inside my
liner<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.680> getting<00:03:24.250> rub<00:03:24.460> points<00:03:24.850> but<00:03:25.450> at<00:03:25.630> the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
same time I don't want them my feet to

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.490 
same time I don't want them my feet to
be<00:03:28.030> clamped<00:03:28.480> down<00:03:28.510> into<00:03:28.960> my<00:03:29.080> boot<00:03:29.320> because

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
be clamped down into my boot because

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.430 
be clamped down into my boot because
that<00:03:29.800> makes<00:03:30.010> for<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:31.060> uncomfortable<00:03:32.020> skinning

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
that makes for a uncomfortable skinning

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.380 
that makes for a uncomfortable skinning
but<00:03:32.890> also<00:03:33.040> much<00:03:33.400> harder<00:03:33.760> work<00:03:33.970> as<00:03:34.180> we<00:03:34.300> don't

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
but also much harder work as we don't

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.500 
but also much harder work as we don't
get<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:34.750> same<00:03:35.250> freedom<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.400> stride<00:03:37.120> and

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
get the same freedom of stride and

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.850 
get the same freedom of stride and
length<00:03:37.720> of<00:03:37.900> stride<00:03:38.110> while<00:03:38.320> we're<00:03:38.500> skinning

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
length of stride while we're skinning

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.640 
length of stride while we're skinning
also<00:03:39.580> we<00:03:40.540> need<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:40.780> make<00:03:40.900> sure<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.110> our<00:03:41.380> boots

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
also we need to make sure that our boots

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.250 
also we need to make sure that our boots
are<00:03:41.980> are<00:03:42.640> in<00:03:42.880> walk<00:03:43.180> mode<00:03:43.420> rather<00:03:43.750> than<00:03:43.990> ski

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
are are in walk mode rather than ski

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.710 
are are in walk mode rather than ski
mode<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:45.100> allows<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.300> cuff<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.690> the

mode and this allows the the cuff of the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.480 
mode and this allows the the cuff of the
boot<00:03:46.960> to<00:03:47.200> move<00:03:47.410> backwards<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.040> forwards<00:03:48.340> much

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
boot to move backwards and forwards much

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.330 
boot to move backwards and forwards much
much<00:03:48.940> more<00:03:49.150> freely<00:03:49.420> for<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.440> better<00:03:50.890> gliding

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
much more freely for a better gliding

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.180 
much more freely for a better gliding
action<00:03:56.010> ok<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:57.070> this<00:03:57.670> week<00:03:57.910> we've<00:03:58.120> looked<00:03:58.420> at

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
action ok so this week we've looked at

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.100 
action ok so this week we've looked at
some<00:04:00.190> basic<00:04:00.220> skinning<00:04:00.850> techniques<00:04:01.210> and<00:04:01.450> how

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
some basic skinning techniques and how

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.230
