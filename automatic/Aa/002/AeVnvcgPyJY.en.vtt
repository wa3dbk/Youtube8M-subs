00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
I'm guessing it's not going to need a

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.369 
I'm guessing it's not going to need a
saddle<00:00:47.820> or<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.539> will<00:00:48.780> already<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
saddle or that it will already have the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.619 
saddle or that it will already have the
saddle<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.829> once<00:00:50.190> its<00:00:50.370> time<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:50.700> it's

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
saddle on it once its time because it's

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
saddle on it once its time because it's
not<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.870> craftable<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.800> not<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> app<00:00:53.370> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
know there's no model yet but that will

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.970 
know there's no model yet but that will
be<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> next<00:01:00.809> update<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> course

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
be in in the next update and of course

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.759 
be in in the next update and of course
if<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:03.149> will<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.359> able<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.750> spawn<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.619> in

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
if I will be able to spawn it in in

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.920 
if I will be able to spawn it in in
single<00:01:05.100> player<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.549> also<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.780> make<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
single player I also do that and make a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.590 
single player I also do that and make a
video<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.680> if<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.130> possible<00:01:08.600> but

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
video about that if that is possible but

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.210 
video about that if that is possible but
we'll<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.020> wait<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.350> see<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> I'm

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
we'll have to wait and see if it is I'm

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.590 
we'll have to wait and see if it is I'm
guessing<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.670> will<00:01:11.820> be<00:01:12.030> possible<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.570> course

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
guessing it will be possible of course

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.719
