00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
outside first so it's got an aluminium

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.560 
outside first so it's got an aluminium
back<00:00:09.240> with<00:00:09.630> plastic<00:00:10.139> sides<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:12.150> finish<00:00:12.420> isn't

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
too bad you can probably see there's a

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.000 
too bad you can probably see there's a
bit<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.580> chip<00:00:15.570> looking<00:00:16.470> thing<00:00:16.680> underneath

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
bit of a chip looking thing underneath

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.279 
bit of a chip looking thing underneath
the<00:00:17.310> Escape<00:00:17.670> key<00:00:17.750> so<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:19.080> was<00:00:19.170> there

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the Escape key so that was there

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.290 
the Escape key so that was there
anything<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.680> noticed<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.250> also<00:00:20.520> down<00:00:20.730> here<00:00:20.760> I

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
anything I noticed and also down here I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.929 
anything I noticed and also down here I
thought<00:00:21.689> I've<00:00:21.840> got<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> bit<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.350> black<00:00:22.590> on<00:00:22.939> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
thought I've got a bit of black on the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.340 
thought I've got a bit of black on the
edge<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.240> rim<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.420> 1/2<00:00:24.840> scratcher<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
edge of the rim and 1/2 scratcher the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.349 
edge of the rim and 1/2 scratcher the
actual<00:00:25.560> finish<00:00:25.859> came<00:00:26.099> off<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.150> quite

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
actual finish came off so that was quite

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.070 
actual finish came off so that was quite

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
off graphics pretty disappointing to be

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.900 
off graphics pretty disappointing to be
honest<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.660> graphics<00:00:37.079> light<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> most

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
honest so the graphics light is the most

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.160 
honest so the graphics light is the most

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
just really struggles like the jar and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.889 
just really struggles like the jar and
stuffs<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:44.969> good<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.629> actual

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
stuffs really good but the actual

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.549 
stuffs really good but the actual
graphics<00:00:46.559> you'll<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:47.940> really<00:00:48.120> choppy

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.890 

wait<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.829> slide

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:16.539 

sekime<00:00:57.710> says<00:00:57.980> starts<00:00:58.430> lagging

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:34.760 

the<00:01:17.030> spake<00:01:17.299> is<00:01:17.479> a<00:01:17.509> really<00:01:17.840> good<00:01:18.020> thing

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.039 

I<00:01:34.799> mean<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.579> probably<00:01:35.670> fire<00:01:36.030> buddy<00:01:36.450> out<00:01:36.689> I'm

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
I mean it's probably fire buddy out I'm

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:48.210 
I mean it's probably fire buddy out I'm
not<00:01:37.500> good<00:01:37.770> enough

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.750 

so<00:01:48.790> you<00:01:48.850> get<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.150> point<00:01:49.360> anyways<00:01:49.720> than<00:01:49.900> that

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
so you get the point anyways than that

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.340 
so you get the point anyways than that
so<00:01:51.760> something<00:01:52.120> like<00:01:52.240> jetpack<00:01:52.750> joyride<00:01:53.170> which

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
so something like jetpack joyride which

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.990 
so something like jetpack joyride which
is<00:01:53.500> like<00:01:53.680> low<00:01:53.890> res<00:01:54.100> obviously<00:01:54.520> runs<00:01:54.730> really

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
is like low res obviously runs really

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.730 
is like low res obviously runs really
well

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.080
