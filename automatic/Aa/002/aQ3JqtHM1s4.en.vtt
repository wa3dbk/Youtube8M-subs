00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.619 
longer handle drooped shoulders now the
idea<00:02:21.430> behind<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.879> it's<00:02:22.150> very<00:02:22.269> similar<00:02:22.540> the

idea behind that it's very similar the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.440 
force on you're hitting the ball because
the<00:02:38.650> handles<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.040> little<00:02:39.130> bit<00:02:39.340> longer<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:40.330> it's

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the handles a little bit longer so it's

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.990 
the handles a little bit longer so it's
going<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:40.690> design<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.050> hit<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.319> further<00:02:41.590> and

going to design to hit it further and
the<00:02:43.000> troop<00:02:43.300> shoulders<00:02:43.900> you'll<00:02:44.349> see<00:02:44.530> on<00:02:44.590> a

number of bats at the moments become
quite<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.150> popular<00:02:46.209> feature<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.530> idea<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:47.950> that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
quite a popular feature the idea is that

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.380 
quite a popular feature the idea is that
you're<00:02:48.160> not<00:02:48.340> going<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.489> be<00:02:48.610> using<00:02:49.000> any<00:02:49.120> of<00:02:49.209> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
you're not going to be using any of the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.120 
you're not going to be using any of the
wood<00:02:49.569> that<00:02:49.810> you're<00:02:49.900> missing<00:02:50.349> so<00:02:50.830> they<00:02:50.950> can

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
wood that you're missing so they can

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.130 
wood that you're missing so they can
reinvest<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.970> work<00:02:52.150> down<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.930> make<00:02:53.110> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
reinvest this work down to make a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.880 
reinvest this work down to make a
chunkier<00:02:53.920> middle<00:02:54.549> and<00:02:55.110> per<00:02:56.110> more<00:02:56.440> wood<00:02:56.709> behind

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
chunkier middle and per more wood behind

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.470 
chunkier middle and per more wood behind
the<00:02:57.160> area<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:57.730> are<00:02:57.760> gonna<00:02:58.000> be<00:02:58.180> hitting

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
the area that you are gonna be hitting

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.000 
the area that you are gonna be hitting
the<00:02:58.599> ball<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.380> certainly<00:02:59.739> is<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.890> case

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
the ball and that certainly is the case

the ball and that certainly is the case
with<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.519> tea<00:03:00.730> tea<00:03:01.030> I<00:03:01.390> mean<00:03:01.720> you'll<00:03:01.870> notice

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
with the tea tea I mean you'll notice

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.319 
with the tea tea I mean you'll notice
here<00:03:02.410> how<00:03:02.620> long<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.700> middle<00:03:04.000> is<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.120> mean

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
here how long this middle is I mean

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.000 
here how long this middle is I mean
you're<00:03:04.480> starting<00:03:04.900> from<00:03:05.019> almost<00:03:05.230> up<00:03:05.680> here<00:03:05.890> by

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
you're starting from almost up here by

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.789 
you're starting from almost up here by
the<00:03:06.069> stickers<00:03:06.670> all<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.450> way<00:03:07.599> down<00:03:07.630> here<00:03:08.140> this

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
the stickers all the way down here this

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.710 
the stickers all the way down here this
might<00:03:09.040> be<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.370> chunky<00:03:09.790> estoy<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.239> any<00:03:10.390> junior

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
might be the chunky estoy of any junior

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.330 
might be the chunky estoy of any junior
bout<00:03:11.019> on<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> market<00:03:11.680> it's<00:03:11.799> absolutely

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
bout on the market it's absolutely

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.520 
bout on the market it's absolutely
massive<00:03:12.670> all<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.180> way<00:03:13.299> down<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:14.200> don't<00:03:14.380> see

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
massive all the way down you don't see

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.229 
massive all the way down you don't see
any<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.190> middle<00:03:15.489> it's<00:03:15.670> all<00:03:15.940> the<00:03:16.120> way

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
any just the middle it's all the way

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.120 
any just the middle it's all the way
down<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.930> that's<00:03:17.079> particularly<00:03:17.500> important

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
down and that's particularly important

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.979 
down and that's particularly important
for<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.280> junior<00:03:18.519> cricketer<00:03:19.060> because<00:03:19.690> we're<00:03:19.870> not

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
for a junior cricketer because we're not

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.720 
for a junior cricketer because we're not
all<00:03:20.140> middling<00:03:20.530> everything<00:03:20.950> as<00:03:21.099> juniors<00:03:21.549> and

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
all middling everything as juniors and

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.759 
all middling everything as juniors and
therefore<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.600> means<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:23.079> if<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.560> don't

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
therefore it means that if you don't

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.170 
therefore it means that if you don't
exactly<00:03:24.190> middle<00:03:24.609> it<00:03:24.700> you're<00:03:24.819> still<00:03:25.030> getting

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
exactly middle it you're still getting

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.300 
exactly middle it you're still getting

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
little bit of concave and just to keep

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.699 
little bit of concave and just to keep
the<00:03:36.880> weight<00:03:37.090> down<00:03:37.120> it's<00:03:37.989> not<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.200> lot<00:03:38.500> there

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
the weight down it's not a lot there

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:39.900 
the weight down it's not a lot there
which<00:03:38.859> means<00:03:39.100> are<00:03:39.190> still<00:03:39.340> getting<00:03:39.430> quite<00:03:39.880> a

about a 60 mil spine something along

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.969 
about a 60 mil spine something along
those<00:04:28.270> lines<00:04:28.479> they're<00:04:29.050> quite<00:04:29.770> difficult

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
those lines they're quite difficult

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.629 
those lines they're quite difficult
second<00:04:30.370> reading<00:04:30.520> up<00:04:30.729> but<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:30.940> just<00:04:30.970> goes

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639
