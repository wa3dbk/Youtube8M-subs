sonic<00:00:39.420> actor<00:00:39.829> he<00:00:40.829> on<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.520> started<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.420> him

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
sonic actor he on I started out with him

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.779 
sonic actor he on I started out with him
because<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.320> first<00:00:43.590> game<00:00:43.950> i<00:00:44.100> ever<00:00:44.129> played<00:00:44.280> was

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
because the first game i ever played was

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.310 
because the first game i ever played was
on<00:00:45.320> sonic<00:00:46.320> adventure<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.860> battle<00:00:47.250> back<00:00:47.399> in

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
on sonic adventure to battle back in

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.279 
on sonic adventure to battle back in
2001<00:00:49.320> when<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.920> supported<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> gamecube

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
2001 when we supported to the gamecube

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.520 
2001 when we supported to the gamecube
so<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:53.210> thought<00:00:54.210> he<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> badass<00:00:55.079> kind<00:00:55.440> of

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so I I thought he was the badass kind of

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.049 
so I I thought he was the badass kind of
type<00:00:55.710> sonic<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:57.140> I<00:00:58.140> think<00:00:58.620> his<00:00:59.010> cocky<00:00:59.550> voice

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
type sonic and I think his cocky voice

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.939 
type sonic and I think his cocky voice
you<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.609> sounded<00:01:02.609> really<00:01:03.030> cool<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:04.260> also

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
you know it sounded really cool but also

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.000 
you know it sounded really cool but also
for<00:01:05.519> Jason<00:01:06.030> Griffith<00:01:06.210> he<00:01:07.200> started<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.740> in

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
for Jason Griffith he started out in

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.050 
for Jason Griffith he started out in
2006<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.330> Sonic<00:01:09.930> Sonic<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> Hedgehog<00:01:11.060> 2006

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
2006 with Sonic Sonic the Hedgehog 2006

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.649 
2006 with Sonic Sonic the Hedgehog 2006
mix<00:01:12.990> gin<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.240> little<00:01:15.509> bit

mix gin and I think it was a little bit

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.130 
mix gin and I think it was a little bit
better<00:01:15.840> than<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.890> expected<00:01:17.689> not<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:18.960> any

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
