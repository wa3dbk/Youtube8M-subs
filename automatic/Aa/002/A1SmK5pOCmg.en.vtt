00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 now happy because it's just 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.240
 certain colleague that I have a team a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.160
 group that is already with consolidated output 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.469
 has won important things there are things 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.500
 important to play the end of the year as well 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.640
 I'm very happy to be here. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.640
 well this group 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.080
 a mix not of people experience with 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.790
 guys but I think that good things are 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:32.890
 see well you have to rebound in the tournament 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.750
 but this one I have confidence that happens to them 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.180
 they will come out on what expectations in 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.620
 continue because as you said you know 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.809
 they know and they have to add in the tournament 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.790
 but they also have a like 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.080
 International ahead here what 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.400
 think about playing when it came it was field 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.020
 which is of this duality of having to 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.489
 fight the average table and at the same 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.379
 time an international competition 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.350
 as the South American Cup endorses the 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.699
 player mentality this one always 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.960
 leave now on the ride after you 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.370
 you have to adapt to the situation of 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.920
 every club this is a club that what 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.540
 we say there are important things 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.390
 for playing like the South American Cup but 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.640
 in the tournament 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.680
 unfortunately I think that it is more 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.790
 below what was expected but these 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.790
 players to lift 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.890
 knowing that there are teams that are worse 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.460
 that hurricane and that play worse so 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.350
 one 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.970
 when you have good players for sure 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.549
 because it is consolidated, it always depends on 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:31.180
 a change point that looks as it left 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.180
 we want justice to this Argentine 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.140
 experience not as much as ours 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.460
 today the important thing is that because of that 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.350
 come here and hopefully I can 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.940
 quickly adapt that my company 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.940
 know and you can give a hand 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.319
 and it 's good but I'm out there in saint 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.140
 I enjoyed mont sometimes when I do not 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.020
 I had to go to the bank 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.940
 he respected more than he had no partner 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.410
 because this drink was seen to something else 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.920
 so the truth is that it was a 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.340
 experience in brazil in yemen too 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.020
 so good are things that I've 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.210
 shared with very important young people in 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.160
 brazil so of those things I think that 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.660
 now that you're in they make it be a lot 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.760
 how much can all that experience think 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.860
 international you have for this 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.890
 moment of your career is important 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.620
 because one is 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.940
 is as accustomed adapted from this 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.360
 different situation has touched me 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.400
 fight imperial descent save me with 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.150
 defense the last the last ball 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.920
 against Moor and I have had to leave champion 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.600
 the truth that I have gone through many 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.390
 stages of football so 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.830
 how to see what we find here in 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.560
 hurricane 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.820
 the first ones try to adapt quickly 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.320
 in the group get rhythm of 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.180
 party after good to be 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.570
 technician's disposition to tell me 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.570
 accurate
