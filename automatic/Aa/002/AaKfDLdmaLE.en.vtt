00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.930
 My name is William Marcelo Maya and I am 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.420

 good we release energy and bad 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.740
 behaviors nervous dogs dogs 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.330
 aggressive what we do is level the 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.820
 energy with the sole objective that the 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.710
 puppy can socialize at home and 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.740
 with the owners and in the street the puppy 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.540
 when he arrives here he stresses he does not like it 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:38.809
 the issue of becoming a hairdresser does not 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.760
 like this machine 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.640
 blocks 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:49.519
 what will be then what I can 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.760
 to do is to press hard like this and do the 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.260
 hair 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.890
 then you will not like it either 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.890
 it gets tense 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.420
 then what we seek with the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:06.210
 health allowance attracts me and wants 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.210
 leave then we look for two options 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:15.300
 we look for two options we put this 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.390
 we press adjusting 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.390
 and they harass you at the hairdresser 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.670
 in lost who want to bite and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.420
 give voice to the here and start doing 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.220
 despair if the dog was healthy do not 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.500
 like what you are doing in the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.780
 hairdressers is usually the eras or is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 not read or find abuse 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.409
 to be able to do hairdressing the dog 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.180
 we seek to teach the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.979
 dogs to be allowed to do hairdressing 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.979
 through the canine gym one 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.110
 discipline of power leveling what are 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.690
 the body parts of the dog that is 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.759
 difficult to cut when I did not have this 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.010
 process these parts of here the stoke 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.710
 what is called the little face 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.500
 to the part of here from the genitals the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.130
 tail and hands do not like to be left 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.020
 cut it plain and simple as is 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.700
 level their energy they calm down and 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.680
 They trust us to be able to do them 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.170
 the hair since we are accompanying them 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.610
 in a process that they discover in their 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.610
 brain that is the discipline 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.390
 if you realize it is already 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.950
 registration law 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.750
 it's the hardest part they saw that I do not know 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.880
 they always left 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.970
 so with that we avoid the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.570
 abuse to the weight love love but what 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.030
 first it is exercise and discipline 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.670
 exercise discipline love the same 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.450
 because it is spoiled but in 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.450
 stabilized
