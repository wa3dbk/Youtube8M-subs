00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.620
 hi everyone with you and today we are 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.480
 collect electronic kit that is both 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.620
 always came to me from china 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.139
 autowatering scheme 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.429
 who helped me came with ebey with us 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.949
 immediately printed circuit boards 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.869
 1 pcb we have the circuit itself 2 y 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.539
 us is a sensor that fit 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.960
 on the ground itself and then here we have ourselves 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.750
 part of which is the lm324 chips here 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.429
 so she looks relat which 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.170
 will activate the autowatering mechanism 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.260
 that is anyone pump or similar 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.030
 which will flood the water 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.680
 All other small parts also noticed 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.870
 here we have LEDs that will be 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.430
 be an indication i.e. north of pieces 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.079
 but rather all when we press 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.149
 this button we have stadiums 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.190
 climb and display the level of dryness 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.079
 the earth in general is such an interesting scheme 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.820
 Now we will collect everything but unfortunately the video 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.890
 will be inferior divide it into two 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.449
 parts now we will collect it check on 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.190
 performance and then I will 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.660
 collect a homemade pump and do 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.640
 the device of autowatering by the way in a set 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.050
 there was no instruction but it 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.000
 uncritical because the PCB 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.710
 all well- marked let's begin 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.270
 collect the first parts that would 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.939
 expose as always resistors have 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.790
 us and a bunch of 9 resistors that we have on 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.860
 47 kilo we have here on the PCB 9 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.750
 pieces you can guess what it is they 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.670
 the value of all other resistors we 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.570
 measure with a multimeter again 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.640
 as always say 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.710
 driving multimeters link in description 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.820
 marking resistors where you can find out 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.680
 resistor rating 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.390
 for now i'm going to scheme can 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.490
 go to the channel for tea on if you 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.350
 interesting package from china then you there them 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.350
 will find a link to it will be in the description 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.820
 Further, we are Stalin ceramist and so 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.440
 the way they look they are different be 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.900
 attentive they have markings 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.370
 digital and exactly the same labeling us 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.280
 repeats the printed circuit board rus we 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:54.920
 here on the capacitor 104 and here 104 we 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.420
 marking on the printed circuit board further 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.150
 we insert diodes like this 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.260
 they look like we have a glass case 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.420
 they are marked on printed marking 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.850
 We have a little card here. 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.440
 four bottom one top orientate 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.510
 signal output strip is black 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.460
 strip from the strip side we have a minus 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.060
 that is, here we have a cache strip on 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.060
 printed circuit board 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.670
 then insert the polar capacitors in 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.710
 There are 2 different things in the set. 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.810
 on the printed circuit board and specified face value 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.520
 that's the way they are not marked with 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.970
 the sides of the shaded part is ours 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.920
 minus 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.840
 ipo legs are oriented long plus 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.190
 short minus or if for some 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.640
 reason you cannot determine by 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.680
 legs 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.490
 from the negative contact side and there is 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.490
 such a white strip 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.200
 now let's insert transistors with us 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.300
 there are two things they are the same and 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.070
 we are guided as always we are on the body 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.900
 the semicircle on the case is exactly the same 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.970
 semicircle we have on the circuit board that is 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.250
 on its labeling and in the same way we 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.870
 we insert we have 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.550
 colored leds blessing on 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.709
 printed circuit board signed where what color 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.450
 embed and we have here polar 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.850
 there is a long leg plus a short leg 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.450
 minus and on the label also indicated where 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.450
 plus where is minus 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.650
 next we insert our chips can 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.430
 do it with the help who contributed 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.680
 in set 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.510
 but I'm going to do without this focus 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.250
 the key that is us here is the key 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.840
 something deepening and that is the same 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.220
 recess in our printed marking 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.570
 board that is at the combine and arrange 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.070
 we have dedicated places for 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.080
 she inserts the relief here 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.940
 you can not go wrong because 5 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.350
 contacts 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:47.590
 we only have to put the button and 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:49.210
 various connectors which also 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.690
 the circuit board needs to be soldered in two 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.190
 such connectors 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.140
 I gathered everything here 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.960
 our device is powered by 5 volts 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.880
 then we can power from usb connector for 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.610
 hitched to him a bunny here we have our 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.380
 the victim is a flower he is not particularly dry but I 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.470
 I think this is quite enough to stick 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.140
 return there and the last is all ours 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.470
 We disconnect xiaomi power bank 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.260
 we have lit LEDs for some reason 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.510
 not all yellow is off but I look 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.360
 he soldered exactly the right plan let's 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.480
 click that is, look at us yellow 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.790
 stadium does not burn 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.470
 click just triggered relay apparently 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.830
 can be very dry let's try 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.470
 pour water and see what happens 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.820
 where then damn h1 turns off just 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.560
 wash it just does not know is going yellow 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.840
 burning seems to me that he is defective 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.480
 maybe similar but paired but 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.420
 absolutely correct in general so i dont 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.010
 I know it all works 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.460
 when we let go then it should work 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.030
 or something like that okay all let's 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.060
 let's go see what changes that is 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.310
 field directly to the sensor and we now 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.070
 just clicked the relay that is apparently he 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.020
 automatic watering has tripped and disconnected that is 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.970
 before that on the boom was activated if 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.100
 we would connect a pump to it 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.990
 deflated the water as soon as we poured it 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.850
 turned off that is so we have 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.980
 working scheme will use the pump 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.450
 that is, you yourself will do that is when 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.940
 our sensor pulled between these 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.920
 contacts there is no connection on the idea 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.900
 with us now or activated and should 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.850
 would work the pump and how we only 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.950
 we put it wet ground on the arrow 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.720
 switches, that is, the pump is turned off 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.000
 or vice versa depending on how you do 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.740
 since here we have 3 relay contacts in 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.150
 In general, this is the scheme of childhood, to which I 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.280
 I do not understand why we do not work 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.260
 yellow LED maybe some kind of cant 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.300
 but the fact that it does not work can 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.770
 try to insert another stadium i 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.570
 not exactly marks the way everything should 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.610
 work I think that depending on 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.950
 level for example we are now lit green 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.600
 It means that it is watered when we have 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.640
 on will be more or less dry switch 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.840
 on yellow when completely dry on red 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.120
 I think this way is all business 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.590
 In general, such a device works further 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.520
 We will collect the pump but it is already in 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.710
 next video 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.480
 Well, do not like paradise designer 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.070
 interesting thing to water somebody 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.780
 plants but the only thing is 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.270
 designed for only one plant 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.460
 there is on each plant such a thing of 4 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.470
 dollar collects impractical general 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.240
 for the interest of this thing can be collected but 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.160
 by the way if you have one plant 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.110
 dry it is likely and others can then 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.610
 time to water everything since i think 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.890
 that in some conditions the earth will dry 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.020
 equally and watching for one flower 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.640
 and water the others and with you was jackson 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.810
 sign and like bets if you 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.580
 I liked this video 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.670
 Today we have gathered to electronic kit 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:34.530
 left side when 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.530
 collect already automatic watering and in general for now
