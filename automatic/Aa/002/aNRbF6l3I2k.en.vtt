00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:08.049
 [Music] 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.049
 [Applause] 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.940
 tall trees catch a lot of wind and high 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.769
 Light poles too, that became clear today 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.769
 rush the storm for the future 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.250
 in the run-up to tomorrow 's bq 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.470
 evening against main class aswh 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.180
 just below in the selection 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.680
 leadership of today's year 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.390
 nail man 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.790
 and although the focus was of course on the 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.800
 cup match it was again of course 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.070
 a topic of conversation 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.199
 what a breeze so they take if 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.269
 soccer player and also as a trainer but as 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.920
 especially the football is that 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.629
 worst weather you 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.449
 but can imagine weighing is never further 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.550
 but rain wind that is very nice 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.050
 the power of the storm appeared during the 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.950
 training then the micoach performance 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.450
 center 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.450
 was literally blown over 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.920
 Suzie which suddenly 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.170
 and all my coach tents to the plain 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.480
 that meant going after the drove 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.400
 is incredible and he just stood out 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.040
 very proud and their museum 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.690
 completely flat yes and we would of course 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.830
 because of that profit we would enter 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.540
 train 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.729
 I have more in half 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.610
 when the 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.950
 did it pretty well then 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.350
 the tent actually but that was still too 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.540
 but then there was a lamp in you 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.550
 actually on 2 threads 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.710
 I can only hold it , I also have a deck 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.800
 said he would know it was king yet 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.750
 bar at the entrance too and luckily it is 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.310
 been a good choice to take on 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.690
 very good decision 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.210
 yes otherwise that maybe none at all 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.100
 players hated him to 2 each 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.690
 morality 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.000
 luckily there was only speech 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.830
 damage experienced players 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.479
 at the glass under storm 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.080
 only the durability of many starts 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:59.470
 hairstyle was tested and danny covers 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.850
 got the best out of it there 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.160
 do part of the selection tonight 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.750
 along with young ajax against dordrecht 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.880
 And therefore, Frank will be the farmer for it 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.979
 cup duel less how to learn than normal 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.140
 never much less 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.350
 we will be the right player tonight 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.690
 player but I normally think so 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.680
 nothing after that 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.989
 azea it is just better to resist 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.430
 dordrecht to play there too for example 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.400
 kenneth vermeer that normally all roads 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.269
 plays matches and yes against dordrecht 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.930
 normally 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.079
 he gets more to do 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.599
 then mr hence hence mickey of the heart 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.200
 and mark smits on the field without 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.629
 yes today a wiki will too 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.160
 in the goal state tomorrow today had to 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.019
 mission of hard they do some more 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.580
 help the government 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.830
 lasse schÃ¶ne and ricardo van rhijn 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.560
 train with pim van dord and be light 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.209
 doubt cases of tomorrow ruben ligeon 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.160
 is a certainty he is completely back again 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.160
 fit 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.830
 ruben can be used yes luckily the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.769
 test all get up well 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.810
 so that will also start tomorrow Sat. 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.260
 very cup in the right back they yes 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.209
 That's why you're so happy that old ones again 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.130
 against aswh there is also a place in the 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.569
 selection for elton acolatse 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.569
 the left winger of the a1 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.750
 yes she has of course grabbed a few times 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.560
 trained the good impression 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.349
 abandoned 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.510
 hence we reward that train hope 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.670
 his team against aswh can work on the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.110
 shape and scoring capacity 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.549
 you should certainly not underestimate it 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.130
 of course you just have to have this lesson 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.019
 normally sentences are just these 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.850
 all and almost all former pros 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.210
 so like you 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.560
 don't give everything 100 cm then they can 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.030
 with that pace and then they have 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.580
 just enough football anyway but for it 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.590
 to make it a difficult evening for you 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.480
 we will and must have a lot of stripes 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.430
 and then I have no problems 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.280
 stayed 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.720
 a storm raging over the Netherlands would be nice 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.190
 for a piece of that energy 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.060
 go see tomorrow again yes I hope so 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.739
 be able to organize a big storm tomorrow 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:06.569
 on our side ajax aswh starts tomorrow 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.230
 evening at a quarter to seven in the 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.230
 Amsterdam arena 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.010
 [Music] 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.010
