with<00:01:00.890> iPhone<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.270> iPad<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.629> iPod<00:01:04.439> Touch<00:01:04.860> as

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
with iPhone and iPad and iPod Touch as

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.100 
with iPhone and iPad and iPod Touch as
long<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.729> you've<00:01:05.850> got<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> fifth<00:01:06.570> generation

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
long as you've got the fifth generation

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.210 
long as you've got the fifth generation
which<00:01:07.500> has<00:01:07.799> Siri<00:01:08.220> now<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.500> think<00:01:11.070> is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
which has Siri now so that I think is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100 
which has Siri now so that I think is
probably<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.880> best<00:01:12.030> headset<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.960> can

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
probably the best headset that you can

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.490 
probably the best headset that you can
get<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> moment<00:01:13.590> for<00:01:14.600> iPod<00:01:15.600> Touch<00:01:15.900> because

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
get at the moment for iPod Touch because

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
get at the moment for iPod Touch because
of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> Siri<00:01:17.189> functionality<00:01:17.970> other<00:01:18.540> than

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
of the Siri functionality other than

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.649 
of the Siri functionality other than
that<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.409> Bluetooth<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> bows<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that the Bluetooth or the bows and the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.499 
that the Bluetooth or the bows and the
jawbone<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.729> relatively<00:01:23.729> indistinguishable

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
jawbone are relatively indistinguishable

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.810 
jawbone are relatively indistinguishable
when<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.750> comes<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.170> pure<00:01:25.470> sound<00:01:25.650> quality<00:01:26.159> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
when it comes to pure sound quality the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.020 
when it comes to pure sound quality the
bow<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> however<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.229> you'll<00:01:28.890> notice<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.460> little

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
bow is however is you'll notice a little

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.450 
bow is however is you'll notice a little
bit<00:01:30.150> smaller<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.829> also<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.130> little<00:01:32.369> bit

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
bit smaller and it's also a little bit

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.240 
bit smaller and it's also a little bit
lighter<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.170> some<00:01:34.170> people<00:01:34.439> said<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.979> fit

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
lighter so some people said that it fit

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.280 
lighter so some people said that it fit
more<00:01:35.430> comfortably<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> stayed<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.020> ear

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
more comfortably and stayed in the ear

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.410 
more comfortably and stayed in the ear
better<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.369> earpiece<00:01:38.790> they<00:01:38.970> thought<00:01:39.210> was

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
better the earpiece they thought was

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.600 
better the earpiece they thought was
better<00:01:39.630> sculpted<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.320> was<00:01:41.009> less<00:01:41.220> likely<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
better sculpted and was less likely to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.679 
better sculpted and was less likely to
fall<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:43.220> mmm<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.689> half-a-dozen

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
fall out so mmm you know half-a-dozen

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.230 
fall out so mmm you know half-a-dozen
one<00:01:46.079> weighs<00:01:46.290> six<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.040> other<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.460> roughly

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
one weighs six the other it's roughly

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.039 
one weighs six the other it's roughly
the<00:01:48.360> same<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:49.759> given<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.820> price<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:51.930> I'd

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the same but given the price I think I'd

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
the same but given the price I think I'd
probably<00:01:52.350> go<00:01:52.829> with<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.979> jawbone<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.670> said

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
probably go with the jawbone as I said

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.690 
probably go with the jawbone as I said
if<00:01:54.119> Siri<00:01:54.689> was<00:01:54.899> an<00:01:55.020> issue<00:01:55.219> thanks<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.369> watching
