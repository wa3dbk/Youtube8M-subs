00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.359
 what there is camp from what what we go from you 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.300
 for our season 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.130
 nature u are there again i still not them 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.130
 kept on nagging 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.570
 the journalists and well what do I have 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.570
 answer 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.910
 I said it is about year again 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.699
 we still want a good year 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.070
 that then became known through the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.019
 newspapers and leading a life of its own 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.949
 and then it actually started to walk whole 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.949
 fast in the woods 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.170
 pastis bred forests 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.500
 it is mainly due to the series 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.690
 have played a match 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 very good at it 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.379
 I could match that yellow here king 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.890
 physically good 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 I have had little trouble with it mentally 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.050
 I can still go so yes ns as long as that 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.670
 all is well where we want 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.920
 had to stop to the changing rooms for hours 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.300
 they had a role then take me with you 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.520
 on a competition day 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.070
 you are in the dressing room you are 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.020
 there then yes my they roll first to one 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.100
 To nikolai you naturally have a good one 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.850
 way and in addition yes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.970
 if i have things in again then i am 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.920
 I want the one who peels certain things 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.160
 from the couch also along with it wrong 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.830
 with the trainers of course and in the 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.030
 I try to dress people up in the dressing room 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.789
 to pay over if the note is shaken and 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.200
 well that that's my role about this 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.110
 team is saying a lot there are none 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.970
 leaders their leader is in the dressing room 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.580
 well look good you also need leaders 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.530
 in the field and have a good one there 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.250
 So we have a lot about tracks this week 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.039
 so it is often the older ones 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.090
 boys and young people with a lot 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:03.509
 football qualities 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.420
 look who should help the others and me 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.759
 hope that used now and that we will 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.739
 that we you do not need a precise one or 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.500
 two loud voices but we can continue 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.200
 more for me to do another 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.260
 traces to do it better than 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.940
 then this must do me their yes yes there is 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.739
 often said about you that you like the culture 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.390
 guard people within the club 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.220
 do you believe in the responding people yourself 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.680
 to say, and sometimes we think 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.690
 find in the show very well i know 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.080
 whatever we have to twente of course 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.020
 was and how it is so I can 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.520
 certain things and indicate 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.490
 not much has changed in that 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.290
 time yes the play of course in a nice 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.400
 new stadium with many more people 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.600
 and we are now playing in a championship 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.300
 only what's around the club 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.830
 it happens itself yes it is not that much 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.090
 changed because I think the milk 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.370
 mentality still himself and that 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.850
 motivation of 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:13.230
 can fly away so I get my 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:22.810
 motivation I want to win and 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:25.060
 good at and and and a nice game 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.130
 the equalizer earned it 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.750
 equalizer 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.700
 Last Sunday you played gaming 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.800
 equal to pec zwolle 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.750
 coming home was not exactly hot 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.830
 it is also received at such a moment 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.830
 nice to be playing football 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.079
 yes but you have to actually have to 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.739
 also consider what the supporters feel and 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.480
 I we are players and yes there are 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.500
 two hours that also disappointed you 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.049
 a 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.519
 and these are the disbursements kind and but 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:59.079
 well now we need each other and 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.450
 It is also important that the shot is 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.610
 certain culture or this club 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.420
 how do you view the situation yourself 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.600
 at the time 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.660
 do you think that is the reason for panic 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.820
 no yes panic panic there 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:17.229
 and measures how we play because that is not 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.970
 good but don't look at the stand on the 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.709
 rankings there are four of them 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.660
 Snow four points off the front runner 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.910
 so yes we basically have everything 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.180
 none had to take care of it alone 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.630
 that we reach very quickly through our level and 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.340
 and and and that much must be much better and and 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.169
 well this week already have a lot 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.620
 talk sessions are mutual with the 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:42.490
 trainer in with bill and this is sick 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.039
 yes so yes now we have to show you 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.669
 on a good one i hope it is 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.560
 audience behind our hearts and good 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.229
 what that times were really really hard 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.660
 necessary and in this situation so that we too 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.700
 with confidence and standing in the field 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.640
 run and show that too 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.640
 and with a spin to win 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.270
 Sunday'm just against the zwolle 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.740
 put you in the gallery yes that's why it was 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.210
 because I walk in and it 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.610
 we pour in from 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.280
 Nicola bothered me 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.950

 I suffer from my calf and I have one 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:32.680
 little muscle in torn and I am now 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.220
 two until it lasts up to 3 weeks and then sweet 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.539
 more 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.490
 yes some people would say 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.340
 old age I'm going yes then they may 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.500
 say the will certainly be so but it 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.120
 is no different 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.140
 next Thursday you go new 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.030
 signing a contract 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.430
 yes with new contract how are you 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.310
 look like this contract 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:55.900
 a year what i have now yes i want whole 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:57.700
 wise to your 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.349
 to do a yes and good at it 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.479
 the club has only one its words 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.280
 if we would, it is not that difficult 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.200
 it is also understandable of course 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.050
 and then that really becomes the best of all 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.420
 very last year or I now also have maria 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.860
 is 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.930
 that my last mission just so 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.940
 layer that normally no longer do 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.160
 and we'll see what comes to me 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.390
 annoying that people are constantly on 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.820
 keep hammering 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.950
 no what is excel or sometimes so then 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.810
 marc-marie so much out 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.960
 You also have to mock a little more 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:29.600
 that make you feel that you are old and 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.820
 show that you have two to very many 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.880
 able'm like you been up'm sure 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.860
 in most people can on this 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.010
 age no longer do what i am 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.520
 can and therefore difficult very happy very 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.520
 be proud of
