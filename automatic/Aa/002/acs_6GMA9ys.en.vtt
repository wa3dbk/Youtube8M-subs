00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.089
 you people came guessed small request 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.949
 from moody's fitch 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.369
 If I could not even show you one 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.529
 makes vegan corridors and yes I have to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.430
 to say to that what I have already 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.439
 I did not do that before 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.240
 just show how to make a bratwurst 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.239
 and you can do that completely 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.770
 easy to convert to caries there he comes 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.850
 For the most part I believe on the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.340
 sauce as far as I know yes that's ok 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.059
 so what it takes, of course, for the first time since 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.300
 a fixed four tablespoons and the amount 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.640
 should now either for two smaller ones 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.620
 Sausages are enough or just for one 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.780
 big and a curly mane the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.719
 consistency does not become so rubbery 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.359
 but just a little bit softer and 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.390
 a tablespoon vegetable broth and there you can 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.790
 take her salt now if you like 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.530
 you should, however, in the water 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.260
 that he subsequently gives into the dough rhine 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.570
 dissolve because otherwise a bit 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.040
 difficult is under to knead 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.689
 By the way, spices can now take 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.790
 So what you want to you can 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.680
 example, make cumarin or even 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.439
 make corey into the bratwurst if 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.979
 you want I have one here now 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.670
 small spoonful of chilli powder 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.310
 keep tablespoon paprika and 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.630
 No spoonful of black pepper 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.939
 what fits in well now are too 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.299
 example dry herbs 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.579
 so could the provence rosemary 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.649
 marjoram whatever can you be happy 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.540
 you can actually take what you guys 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.780
 I would like a small one then 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.680
 room and I will be so small now 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.680
 as possible stones 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.100
 If you want, you can just as well 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.299
 small rub or puree 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.659
 but I like doing that if that 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.659
 scrap 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.940
 they can do that right now 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.010
 to give bowl and ever 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.470
 operate 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.830
 then come two tablespoons of rapeseed oil or 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.130
 olive oil and then a little cold 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.390
 water 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.590
 I usually do that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.340
 snout but I will now 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.890
 sakes must 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.990
 and that could easily be in the dough 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.190
 mix in 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.070
 so that was seven to eight now 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.050
 tablespoon of water may be the problem anymore 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.230
 is actually that it stops at 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.910
 Cook properly with water soaked 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.460
 and just as only rises as 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.060
 Register and you can prevent that 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:54.710
 just by a bit 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:57.350
 You can do that with fresh foil 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.830
 then take a dough, so I have 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.000
 the dough now divided by two 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:10.640
 Here you can already a bit in the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:16.360
 give length to the slide and 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.709
 then try rolling that up and doing that 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.630
 to leave as little space as possible 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:27.350
 really nice to do tight and also 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.070
 really as little air in the 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.070
 foil is in it 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.909
 and finally a little further 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:42.640
 press and not synonymous as correct 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:43.810
 therefore, and the outer two 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:52.030
 You can best follow with you 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:56.650
 rubber bands so and the 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.290
 others now, too, you need 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.700
 a pot with water and also completely 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.769
 small stage you can then the 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.310
 Sausage until they are cooked 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:09.220
 that should then depending on the size or or 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.579
 depending on the thickness about 20 to 30 minutes 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.659
 take is this was 20 minutes in 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.630
 you can now easily make out app 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:20.289
 and just leave the pot on the 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.680
 plate stands for about one more 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:26.139
 half an hour so that the two bratwurst 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.460
 still be able to do a little bit of 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.150
 Half an hour you can him first 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.070
 Take it out and on a plate completely 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.990
 Let cool a little bit 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:45.010
 then you only need scissors 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:48.419
 to cut another page and the 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.419
 sausage then quite simply express 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.699
 in the reason you could now already 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.270
 eat like that 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:05.249
 but that is of course again 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:11.520
 sautÃ© briefly so if that's what it means 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:12.620
 then the baskets into a life of all 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:20.129
 People are nice 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:25.020
 We wait for the brown women 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:32.270
 enough are just take out and 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:32.270
 make in your vegan bratwurst so 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:42.870
 I definitely say a lot and also 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.460
 pretty much so if you are yours 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.439
 bratwurst not so funny 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.419
 Maybe then just want to now 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.419
 dipped tablespoon of vegetable stock 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.719
 awaits the fields and now you come 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.300
 there to eat something you want 

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:01.860
 either hold your cards curry sauce 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.659
 or what ever 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.270
 and they would know the continuity too 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:08.370
 I did not test it in there 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.069
 but then I think only half way 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.379
 be thick because they are probably on the 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.639
 Grill darken very quickly and you 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.870
 You can also omit the roast and 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.110
 Can you just know a bit 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.959
 make it thicker and then as 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.399
 use cutout for example 

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:25.919
 yes is definitely a diverse 

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:29.339
 recipe how do you find that sense 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.639
 Have fun while copying and until the 

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:31.639
 next time
