situation<00:01:37.820> for<00:01:38.180> me<00:01:38.390> like<00:01:38.720> I<00:01:38.870> said<00:01:38.930> before<00:01:39.140> it's

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
situation for me like I said before it's

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.310 
situation for me like I said before it's
my<00:01:39.770> my<00:01:40.160> second<00:01:40.490> family<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.960> race<00:01:42.140> with

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.530 
my my second family and to race with
them<00:01:42.500> is<00:01:42.770> just<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.670> dream<00:01:43.880> come<00:01:44.060> true<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.450> be

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
on the main series grids dream come true

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.640 
on the main series grids dream come true
so<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:47.300> homebush<00:01:47.630> weekend<00:01:47.960> works<00:01:48.170> perfectly

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
so the homebush weekend works perfectly

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.440 
so the homebush weekend works perfectly

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
five years old just trying to figure out

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.250 
five years old just trying to figure out
a<00:02:21.640> way<00:02:21.790> how<00:02:21.819> you're<00:02:22.209> going<00:02:22.299> to<00:02:22.420> do<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:23.080> right

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
a way how you're going to do the right

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.600 
a way how you're going to do the right
things<00:02:23.500> through<00:02:23.709> go-karting<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.459> then

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
things through go-karting and then

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.220 
things through go-karting and then
conformal<00:02:25.299> forward<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.750> then<00:02:25.810> make<00:02:26.080> sure

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
conformal forward and then make sure

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.660 
conformal forward and then make sure
you're<00:02:26.349> in<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.470> right<00:02:26.500> position<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.010> get<00:02:27.190> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
you're in the right position to get the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.309 
you're in the right position to get the
main<00:02:27.849> series<00:02:28.209> drive<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.750> know<00:02:28.840> I've<00:02:29.170> been

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
main series drive and you know I've been

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.530 
main series drive and you know I've been
probably<00:02:30.099> waiting<00:02:30.549> longer<00:02:31.150> than<00:02:31.299> i<00:02:31.420> would

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
probably waiting longer than i would

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.630 
probably waiting longer than i would
have<00:02:31.569> liked<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.739> know<00:02:32.799> patient<00:02:33.459> gonna<00:02:33.579> be

perform and what's happening walking to
a<00:02:41.769> racy<00:02:41.950> at<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.160> moment<00:02:42.519> the<00:02:42.670> trend<00:02:43.239> they<00:02:43.540> were

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
a racy at the moment the trend they were

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.350 
a racy at the moment the trend they were
getting<00:02:43.900> better<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.349> cars<00:02:44.530> getting<00:02:44.769> better

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
getting better the cars getting better

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
getting better the cars getting better
obviously<00:02:46.360> there's<00:02:46.480> some<00:02:46.599> new<00:02:46.750> stuff<00:02:47.049> going

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
obviously there's some new stuff going

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.569 
obviously there's some new stuff going
on<00:02:47.440> next<00:02:47.650> year<00:02:47.920> which<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.160> look<00:02:48.280> forward<00:02:48.489> to

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
on next year which I look forward to

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.580 
on next year which I look forward to
meeting<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.569> getting<00:02:49.810> involved<00:02:50.079> with<00:02:50.290> and

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
meeting and getting involved with and

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.350 
meeting and getting involved with and
yeah<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.459> think<00:02:51.579> it's<00:02:51.790> going<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.030> be<00:02:52.150> perfect

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
yeah I think it's going to be perfect

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.569 
yeah I think it's going to be perfect
for<00:02:52.599> me<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.810> again<00:02:53.590> James<00:02:53.950> Rosenbergs<00:02:54.430> are

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
for me and again James Rosenbergs are

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.370 
for me and again James Rosenbergs are
key<00:02:54.760> there<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.150> he's<00:02:55.269> showed<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:55.959> lot<00:02:56.109> of<00:02:56.139> faith

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
key there and he's showed a lot of faith

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.780 
key there and he's showed a lot of faith
in<00:02:56.410> all<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.980> drivers<00:02:57.220> he's<00:02:57.430> going<00:02:57.609> to<00:02:57.670> move

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
in all the drivers he's going to move

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.220 
in all the drivers he's going to move
then<00:02:58.000> hopefully<00:02:58.660> he's<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.840> same<00:02:58.989> with<00:02:59.109> me

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
then hopefully he's the same with me

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.890 
then hopefully he's the same with me
