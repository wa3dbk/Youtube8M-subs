I'm going to talk about resizing an

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.009 
I'm going to talk about resizing an
image<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:07.350> printing<00:00:08.340> or<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.179> web<00:00:09.330> one<00:00:09.929> of

my Facebook friends asked I would talk

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.609 
my Facebook friends asked I would talk
about<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.320> here<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.160> go<00:00:15.199> as<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.320> see<00:00:16.500> I've

about this so here we go as you see I've

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.920 
about this so here we go as you see I've
got<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.830> nice<00:00:17.190> little<00:00:17.520> starfish<00:00:18.270> with<00:00:18.539> some

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
got this nice little starfish with some

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.650 
got this nice little starfish with some
water<00:00:19.380> flowing<00:00:20.130> over<00:00:20.580> them<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.000> let's<00:00:21.480> say<00:00:21.630> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
water flowing over them and let's say I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.410 
water flowing over them and let's say I
want<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> print<00:00:22.650> I'll<00:00:23.640> go<00:00:23.789> up<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.939> image

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
want to do a print I'll go up to image

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.339 
want to do a print I'll go up to image
I'm<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.680> Photoshop<00:00:26.519> Elements<00:00:26.789> by<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.269> way<00:00:27.480> go

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
I'm in Photoshop Elements by the way go

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.560 
I'm in Photoshop Elements by the way go
down<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.619> resize<00:00:29.630> go<00:00:30.630> over<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.019> image<00:00:31.410> size<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
down to resize go over to image size and

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.910 
down to resize go over to image size and
again<00:00:33.570> there's<00:00:33.870> probably<00:00:34.260> different<00:00:34.530> ways<00:00:34.710> to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
again there's probably different ways to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.270 
again there's probably different ways to
do<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> how<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.280> start

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
do this but this is how I do it I start

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.100 
do this but this is how I do it I start
off<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.790> resolution<00:00:39.420> depending<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.930> what

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
off with my resolution depending on what

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.720 
off with my resolution depending on what
resolution<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.739> want<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.190> let's<00:00:41.399> say<00:00:41.520> I'm<00:00:41.610> going

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
resolution I want so let's say I'm going

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.880 
resolution I want so let's say I'm going
to<00:00:41.820> print<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.059> my<00:00:42.270> big<00:00:42.570> printer<00:00:42.930> my<00:00:43.110> 7880

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
to print on my big printer my 7880

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.310 
to print on my big printer my 7880
absinthe<00:00:44.370> 24<00:00:45.030> inch<00:00:45.210> wide<00:00:45.420> printer<00:00:45.780> which<00:00:46.140> has

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
absinthe 24 inch wide printer which has

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.799 
absinthe 24 inch wide printer which has
a<00:00:46.590> lot<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> resolution<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.610> might<00:00:48.360> set<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.629> at

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
a lot of resolution I might set it at

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.060 
a lot of resolution I might set it at
300<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.489> will<00:00:50.730> go<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:52.070> document

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
300 and then I will go to the document

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.840 
300 and then I will go to the document
size<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.640> says<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:55.789> working<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.910> inches<00:00:57.590> now

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
size it says here working in inches now

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.479 
size it says here working in inches now
depending<00:00:59.850> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.859> frame<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.340> is

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
depending on the frame that this is

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.490 
depending on the frame that this is
going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:02.850> into<00:01:03.180> let's<00:01:03.449> say<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.379> was

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
going to go into let's say that it was

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.370 
going to go into let's say that it was
going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.010> an<00:01:05.129> 8<00:01:05.309> by<00:01:05.519> 10<00:01:05.820> frame<00:01:06.380> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
going to go in an 8 by 10 frame and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
going to go in an 8 by 10 frame and
let's<00:01:07.979> say<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> wanted<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> print<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> paper

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
let's say I wanted to print on the paper

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.810 
let's say I wanted to print on the paper
which<00:01:09.840> was<00:01:09.960> 8<00:01:10.110> by<00:01:10.290> 10<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.189> run<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.520> all<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> way

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
which was 8 by 10 and run it all the way

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.300 
which was 8 by 10 and run it all the way
to<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.119> edges<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.659> I've<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.770> want<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.100> size

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to the edges and I've one want to size

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.719 
to the edges and I've one want to size
my<00:01:14.549> image<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.880> 8<00:01:15.210> by<00:01:15.360> 10<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:16.740> would<00:01:17.159> want<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.549> take

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
my image to 8 by 10 I would want to take

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.600 
my image to 8 by 10 I would want to take
off<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.270> constraint<00:01:19.170> proportions<00:01:19.920> all

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
off this constraint proportions all

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120 
off this constraint proportions all
right<00:01:20.790> because<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.990> had<00:01:22.560> constraint

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
right because if I had constraint

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.480 
right because if I had constraint
proportions<00:01:23.939> put<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.360> there<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.439> made<00:01:26.250> my

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
proportions put on there and I made my

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.020 
proportions put on there and I made my
width<00:01:27.299> which<00:01:27.540> would<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> 10<00:01:28.229> inches<00:01:28.640> at<00:01:29.640> 10

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
width which would be the 10 inches at 10

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.749 
width which would be the 10 inches at 10
you<00:01:30.240> see<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> heights<00:01:31.259> would<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.650> 6<00:01:31.920> point<00:01:32.220> 6<00:01:32.490> 2

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
you see the heights would be 6 point 6 2

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.660 
you see the heights would be 6 point 6 2
so<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> won't<00:01:33.270> work<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.689> my<00:01:33.869> 8<00:01:34.110> by<00:01:34.259> 10<00:01:34.439> frame<00:01:34.740> but

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
so it won't work in my 8 by 10 frame but

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.880 
so it won't work in my 8 by 10 frame but
if<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.850> take<00:01:36.030> off<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.810> constraint<00:01:37.320> proportions

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
if I take off the constraint proportions

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.060 
if I take off the constraint proportions
that<00:01:38.670> allows<00:01:38.909> me<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> adjust<00:01:39.659> both<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.740> height

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that allows me to adjust both the height

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.340 
that allows me to adjust both the height
and<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:43.110> width<00:01:43.970> independently<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.810> I

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
and the width independently so that I

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.350 
and the width independently so that I
can<00:01:46.710> make<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.460> it'll<00:01:47.579> fit<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> frame<00:01:48.149> now

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
can make it so it'll fit that frame now

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.609 
can make it so it'll fit that frame now
it's<00:01:48.509> going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> change<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.320> configuration

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it's going to change the configuration

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.210 
it's going to change the configuration
of<00:01:50.340> course<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> image<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.649> click<00:01:52.890> OK

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
of course of the image so if I click OK

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.060 
of course of the image so if I click OK
you're<00:01:53.759> gonna<00:01:53.880> see<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.270> image<00:01:54.710> whoops<00:01:55.710> let's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
you're gonna see the image whoops let's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.880 
you're gonna see the image whoops let's
take<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.340> back<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.490> full<00:01:56.790> frame<00:01:57.259> will<00:01:58.259> change<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
take it back to full frame will change a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.469 
take it back to full frame will change a
little<00:01:59.009> bit<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.909> only<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.329> knows

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
little bit but the only one that knows

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.959 
little bit but the only one that knows
that<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.840> changed<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.610> when<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.850> go

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
that it's changed is you so when you go

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.959 
that it's changed is you so when you go
to<00:02:03.030> print<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.420> out<00:02:04.250> you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.909> said

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
to print this out you know like I said

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.660 
to print this out you know like I said
it<00:02:06.210> may<00:02:06.770> format<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> little<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:08.250> different<00:02:08.580> in

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
it may format a little bit different in

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.949 
it may format a little bit different in
size

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
size

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.089 
size
same<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:10.739> 11<00:02:11.069> by<00:02:11.159> 14<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:12.180> know<00:02:12.209> 16<00:02:12.659> by<00:02:12.810> 20s<00:02:13.170> 24

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
same with 11 by 14 you know 16 by 20s 24

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.240 
same with 11 by 14 you know 16 by 20s 24
by<00:02:14.280> 36<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:15.170> 18<00:02:16.170> by<00:02:16.290> 24s<00:02:16.890> they're<00:02:16.980> all<00:02:17.099> going<00:02:17.190> to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
by 36 is 18 by 24s they're all going to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.880 
by 36 is 18 by 24s they're all going to
be<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.400> little<00:02:17.610> bit<00:02:17.790> different<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.840> again<00:02:18.959> most

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
be a little bit different but again most

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.740 
be a little bit different but again most
of<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.010> time<00:02:20.099> it's<00:02:20.400> not<00:02:20.580> changing<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.599> that

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
of the time it's not changing it that

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.240 
of the time it's not changing it that
drastically<00:02:22.319> where<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.650> image<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.040> going<00:02:23.190> to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
drastically where the image is going to

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.860 
drastically where the image is going to
be<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.400> problem

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
be a problem

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.229 
be a problem
the<00:02:25.560> only<00:02:25.650> time<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.010> might<00:02:26.190> see<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> difference

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
the only time you might see a difference

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.970 
the only time you might see a difference
when<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.420> start<00:02:27.720> changing<00:02:27.959> those<00:02:28.290> formats<00:02:28.739> as

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
when you start changing those formats as

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.420 
when you start changing those formats as
if<00:02:29.159> you<00:02:29.280> were<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:30.000> shoot<00:02:30.209> people<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:32.250> we

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
if you were to shoot people and so we

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.580 
if you were to shoot people and so we
know<00:02:32.640> basically<00:02:33.090> kind<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.079> shape<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.470> a

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
know basically kind of the shape of a

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.069 
know basically kind of the shape of a
person's<00:02:34.950> face<00:02:35.250> so<00:02:35.549> if<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.930> reformatted<00:02:36.930> and

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
person's face so if you reformatted and

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.690 
person's face so if you reformatted and
the<00:02:37.140> frame<00:02:37.379> change<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:38.010> might<00:02:38.190> make<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.519> face

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
the frame change it might make the face

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.750 
the frame change it might make the face
wider<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.360> skinny<00:02:39.690> or<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:40.680> know<00:02:40.799> narrower<00:02:41.159> so

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
wider or skinny or you know narrower so

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.130 
wider or skinny or you know narrower so
then<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.269> might<00:02:42.420> be<00:02:42.450> able<00:02:42.629> to<00:02:42.690> see<00:02:42.840> difference

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
then you might be able to see difference

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.080 
then you might be able to see difference
but<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.319> with<00:02:43.440> nature<00:02:43.709> photography<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.940> don't

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
but it with nature photography we don't

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.300 
but it with nature photography we don't
see<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.450> much<00:02:45.629> of<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.959> change<00:02:46.859> or<00:02:47.099> where<00:02:47.190> it's

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
see that much of a change or where it's

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.580 
see that much of a change or where it's
not<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.640> noticeable<00:02:48.019> now<00:02:49.019> let's<00:02:49.230> say<00:02:49.379> that<00:02:49.530> I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
not that noticeable now let's say that I

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.140 
not that noticeable now let's say that I
wanted<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.450> put<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.629> on<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.140> web<00:02:52.760> go<00:02:53.760> back<00:02:54.000> to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
wanted to put this on the web go back to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.830 
wanted to put this on the web go back to
image<00:02:54.299> resize<00:02:55.340> image<00:02:56.340> sizes<00:02:56.819> now<00:02:57.420> instead<00:02:57.750> of

image resize image sizes now instead of

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.660 
image resize image sizes now instead of
doing<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.140> down<00:02:58.290> here<00:02:58.349> in<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.650> document<00:02:59.280> sizes

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
doing it down here in the document sizes

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.250 
doing it down here in the document sizes
which<00:02:59.819> works<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.239> inches<00:03:00.659> as<00:03:00.840> you<00:03:00.900> can<00:03:01.079> see

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
which works in inches as you can see

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.949 
which works in inches as you can see

work in in pixels instead of in inches
and<00:03:14.040> what<00:03:14.489> I<00:03:14.519> usually<00:03:14.910> do<00:03:15.269> on<00:03:15.480> my<00:03:15.720> web<00:03:16.620> images

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.020 
and what I usually do on my web images
as<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:17.970> put<00:03:18.180> my<00:03:18.209> pixels<00:03:18.810> at<00:03:19.019> 600<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:19.889> then<00:03:20.700> I<00:03:20.730> let

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
as I put my pixels at 600 and then I let

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.949 
as I put my pixels at 600 and then I let

when I have the constraint proportions

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.740 
when I have the constraint proportions
put<00:03:27.150> on<00:03:27.799> click<00:03:28.799> OK<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.609> that'll<00:03:30.389> take<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.660> as

put on click OK and that'll take it as
you<00:03:30.870> see<00:03:31.019> down<00:03:31.139> to<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.349> very<00:03:31.560> small<00:03:31.950> file<00:03:32.250> and

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
you see down to a very small file and

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.979 
you see down to a very small file and
then<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.810> will<00:03:34.109> go<00:03:34.260> in<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.650> click<00:03:34.889> save<00:03:35.459> as<00:03:35.989> and

it'll ask me where I want to put it if

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.430 
it'll ask me where I want to put it if
it<00:03:38.819> puts<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.180> in<00:03:39.269> my<00:03:39.419> pictures<00:03:39.599> here<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.079> might

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
it puts it in my pictures here I might

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.500 
it puts it in my pictures here I might
just<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:41.370> know<00:03:41.400> put<00:03:41.730> on<00:03:41.819> at<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.060> end<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.449> the

just you know put on at the end of the
file<00:03:42.750> maybe<00:03:43.290> 600<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.549> tells<00:03:44.790> me<00:03:44.910> that

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
file maybe 600 and that tells me that

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.420 
file maybe 600 and that tells me that
that<00:03:45.510> image<00:03:46.260> has<00:03:46.410> been<00:03:46.560> resized<00:03:46.949> for<00:03:47.129> 600<00:03:47.760> oh

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
that image has been resized for 600 oh

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.689 
that image has been resized for 600 oh
also<00:03:50.430> on<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:51.349> you<00:03:52.349> can<00:03:52.530> I<00:03:52.859> don't<00:03:53.129> really<00:03:53.400> do

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
also on the you can I don't really do

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.210 
also on the you can I don't really do
this<00:03:53.940> but<00:03:54.379> some<00:03:55.379> people<00:03:55.620> like<00:03:55.769> to<00:03:55.799> do<00:03:56.069> their

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
this but some people like to do their

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.520 
this but some people like to do their
resolution<00:03:56.849> at<00:03:57.139> 72<00:03:58.139> dpi<00:03:59.099> and<00:04:00.109> then<00:04:01.109> so<00:04:01.470> you

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
resolution at 72 dpi and then so you

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.729 
resolution at 72 dpi and then so you
would<00:04:01.739> set<00:04:01.919> your<00:04:01.949> resolution<00:04:02.699> first<00:04:03.359> at<00:04:03.739> 72

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
would set your resolution first at 72

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.750 
would set your resolution first at 72
and<00:04:04.889> then<00:04:05.579> go<00:04:05.790> up<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.209> do<00:04:07.019> your<00:04:07.290> 600<00:04:08.099> pixels<00:04:08.519> on

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
and then go up and do your 600 pixels on

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.680 
and then go up and do your 600 pixels on
the<00:04:09.239> longest<00:04:09.690> side<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:12.090> would<00:04:12.209> change<00:04:12.510> it

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
the longest side and it would change it

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.039 
the longest side and it would change it
now<00:04:13.379> I<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:14.609> leave<00:04:15.329> it<00:04:15.359> whatever<00:04:15.750> resolution

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
now I just leave it whatever resolution

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.839 
now I just leave it whatever resolution
that<00:04:16.410> happens<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.739> be<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.010> put<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.280> at<00:04:17.370> 600

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
that happens to be and put it at 600

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.849 
that happens to be and put it at 600
pixels<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.419> don't<00:04:18.900> really<00:04:19.019> worry<00:04:19.260> about<00:04:19.349> to<00:04:19.739> all

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
pixels I don't really worry about to all

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.050 
pixels I don't really worry about to all
that<00:04:20.010> stuff<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.700> know

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
that stuff you know

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.960 
that stuff you know
people<00:04:21.780> stealing<00:04:22.019> my<00:04:22.169> image<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.650> all<00:04:22.740> that

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
people stealing my image and all that

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.490 
people stealing my image and all that
smartness<00:04:24.030> at<00:04:24.270> 600<00:04:24.750> pixels<00:04:25.050> it's<00:04:25.230> a<00:04:25.320> pretty

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
smartness at 600 pixels it's a pretty

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.290 
smartness at 600 pixels it's a pretty
small<00:04:25.620> file<00:04:26.370> even<00:04:26.760> at<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.940> higher<00:04:27.060> resolution

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
small file even at the higher resolution

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.629 
small file even at the higher resolution
so<00:04:27.960> but<00:04:28.800> some<00:04:28.980> people<00:04:29.220> that<00:04:29.340> are<00:04:29.430> worried

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
so but some people that are worried

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.280 
so but some people that are worried
about<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.940> higher<00:04:30.090> resolution<00:04:30.300> images<00:04:31.050> being

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
about the higher resolution images being

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.650 
about the higher resolution images being
out<00:04:31.410> there<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:32.040> can<00:04:32.160> put<00:04:32.370> it<00:04:32.460> at<00:04:32.580> 7,200<00:04:33.330> dpi

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
out there you can put it at 7,200 dpi

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.140 
out there you can put it at 7,200 dpi
first<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.350> then<00:04:34.889> go<00:04:35.040> up<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.520> then<00:04:35.669> change

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
first and then go up and then change

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.480 
first and then go up and then change
your<00:04:36.419> longest<00:04:36.960> side<00:04:37.200> of<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.530> image<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:38.010> 600

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
your longest side of the image to 600

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.060 
your longest side of the image to 600
pixels<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.030> that's<00:04:39.450> how<00:04:39.690> I<00:04:39.720> resize<00:04:40.650> for<00:04:40.980> all

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
pixels and that's how I resize for all

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.920 
pixels and that's how I resize for all
my<00:04:41.220> web<00:04:41.400> images<00:04:42.500> again<00:04:43.500> with<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.750> images<00:04:45.750> that

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
my web images again with the images that

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.620 
my web images again with the images that
I'm<00:04:46.050> resizing<00:04:46.500> for<00:04:47.100> my<00:04:49.280> my<00:04:50.280> frames<00:04:50.669> again<00:04:51.270> I'll

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
I'm resizing for my my frames again I'll

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.450 
I'm resizing for my my frames again I'll
take<00:04:51.870> off<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.230> constraint<00:04:52.680> proportions<00:04:53.220> and

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
take off the constraint proportions and

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.090 
take off the constraint proportions and
then<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.330> will<00:04:54.510> go<00:04:54.660> into<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:55.410> width<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:55.919> this

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
then I will go into the width of this

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.940 
then I will go into the width of this
image<00:04:56.430> and<00:04:56.610> let's<00:04:56.790> say<00:04:56.910> I'm<00:04:57.000> doing<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.360> 14<00:04:58.229> by<00:04:58.470> 11

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
image and let's say I'm doing a 14 by 11

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.430 
image and let's say I'm doing a 14 by 11
the<00:04:59.190> width<00:04:59.370> would<00:04:59.520> be<00:04:59.669> 14<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:01.200> height

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
the width would be 14 and the height

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.640 
the width would be 14 and the height
would<00:05:01.710> be<00:05:01.770> 11th<00:05:02.639> oh<00:05:02.990> I'm<00:05:03.990> sorry<00:05:04.200> I<00:05:04.350> forgot<00:05:04.380> to

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
would be 11th oh I'm sorry I forgot to

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.159 
would be 11th oh I'm sorry I forgot to
change<00:05:04.889> my<00:05:05.389> resolution<00:05:06.389> back<00:05:06.570> to<00:05:06.750> 300<00:05:07.020> and

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
change my resolution back to 300 and

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.860 
change my resolution back to 300 and
then<00:05:10.169> I<00:05:10.229> would<00:05:10.470> go<00:05:10.620> and<00:05:10.860> resize<00:05:11.669> it<00:05:11.850> so<00:05:12.150> then<00:05:12.780> it

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
then I would go and resize it so then it

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.590 
then I would go and resize it so then it
would<00:05:12.930> be<00:05:13.050> all<00:05:13.169> ready<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.530> print<00:05:13.860> at<00:05:14.070> 11<00:05:14.370> by<00:05:14.460> 14

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
would be all ready to print at 11 by 14

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.230 
would be all ready to print at 11 by 14
at<00:05:15.600> 300<00:05:16.290> resolution<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:17.130> that's<00:05:17.790> it<00:05:18.000> pretty

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
at 300 resolution and that's it pretty

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.050 
at 300 resolution and that's it pretty
simple<00:05:18.360> so<00:05:19.260> hope<00:05:20.220> that<00:05:20.280> helps<00:05:20.430> you<00:05:20.700> out<00:05:20.729> thanks
