think<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.360> an<00:01:42.630> illegal<00:01:43.290> but<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> think<00:01:43.799> it's

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
think it's an illegal but I think it's

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.639 
think it's an illegal but I think it's
too<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.850> too<00:01:45.240> overpowered<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:46.350> didn't

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
too like too overpowered we didn't

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.380 
too like too overpowered we didn't
clearly<00:01:46.829> understand<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.240> never

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
clearly understand that because we never

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.499 
clearly understand that because we never
used<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.079> course<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.560> affected<00:01:49.979> me<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
hard I'm probably gonna pick an S

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.089 
hard I'm probably gonna pick an S
because<00:02:09.959> he's<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.590> best<00:02:10.709> player<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.009> the

because he's the best player in the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.960 
because he's the best player in the
world<00:02:11.190> in<00:02:11.430> my<00:02:11.580> opinion

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
world in my opinion

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.210 
world in my opinion
somehow<00:02:12.420> he

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
somehow he

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.880 
somehow he
yester<00:02:13.610> does<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.090> crazy<00:02:14.390> kills<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.050> it

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
yester does this crazy kills and it

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.400 
yester does this crazy kills and it
doesn't<00:02:16.250> seem<00:02:16.430> human<00:02:16.910> it's<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.420> good<00:02:17.600> but

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
doesn't seem human it's so good but

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.530 
doesn't seem human it's so good but
personality-wise<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.700> probably<00:02:20.210> going<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.480> be

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
personality-wise is probably going to be

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.990 
personality-wise is probably going to be
Pasha<00:02:20.960> it's<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.680> really<00:02:22.010> nice<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.460> funny<00:02:22.760> guy

Pasha it's a really nice and funny guy

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.510 
Pasha it's a really nice and funny guy
in<00:02:23.150> one<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.930> best<00:02:24.110> as<00:02:24.260> well<00:02:24.440> if<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.130> think<00:02:25.370> I

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
in one of the best as well if I think I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.100 
in one of the best as well if I think I
can<00:02:25.730> compete<00:02:26.030> with<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.300> best<00:02:26.420> snipers<00:02:26.840> in

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
can compete with the best snipers in

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.770 
can compete with the best snipers in
seas<00:02:27.580> yes<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.850> think<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.360> can<00:02:29.480> do<00:02:29.570> that

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
seas yes I think I can do that

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.710 
seas yes I think I can do that
but<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.920> aw<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.610> better<00:02:31.910> than<00:02:32.120> me<00:02:32.360> that's<00:02:32.570> why

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
but the aw is better than me that's why

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.720 
but the aw is better than me that's why
is<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.020> number<00:02:33.230> one<00:02:33.380> sniper<00:02:33.860> in<00:02:34.100> the<00:02:34.160> team<00:02:34.370> so

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
is the number one sniper in the team so

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.700 
is the number one sniper in the team so
it's<00:02:35.090> also<00:02:35.270> hard<00:02:35.630> because<00:02:35.720> I'm<00:02:36.200> not<00:02:36.320> playing

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
it's also hard because I'm not playing

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.500 
it's also hard because I'm not playing
it<00:02:36.830> all<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.100> time<00:02:37.310> I<00:02:37.520> think<00:02:37.910> I<00:02:38.000> can<00:02:38.150> be<00:02:38.270> better

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
it all the time I think I can be better

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.260 
it all the time I think I can be better
than<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.440> am<00:02:39.620> at<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.860> time<00:02:40.100> but<00:02:40.370> yeah<00:02:40.820> I<00:02:40.970> think<00:02:41.030> I

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
than I am at a time but yeah I think I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.300 
than I am at a time but yeah I think I
can<00:02:41.420> compete<00:02:41.600> with<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:42.200> know<00:02:42.470> if<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.070> any

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
can compete with I know if I have any

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.360
