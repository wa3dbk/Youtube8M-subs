00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.890
 hello all this is the second video of 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.049
 commodore 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.240
 here I will teach the system 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.150
 speech recognition and the synthesizer 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.460
 of voice with these two things what 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.400
 we get is that the robot speaks to us and 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.600
 listen to us then I will teach you 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.310
 more or less the commands that I have put 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.540
 it has few because it is quite 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.280
 complicated and I've also gotten that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.380
 move your mouth while talking 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.020
 also that is complicated because you have to 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.060
 make the controller communicate 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.010
 of the ones you are against the albos 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.450
 you have to communicate with the software 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.730
 voice recognition and that's 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.590
 complicated but good so big 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.340
 features this what is unplugged 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.440
 via a with 31 usb to the computer 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.970
 on the other hand it is plugged in to be you 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.280
 the controller of the herbs 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.410
 to the 220 volt network with a 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.900
 transformer that will give 6 to 7 volts 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.310
 to the servos and it 's just that and 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.380
 then the recognition software 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.000
 voice that is charged to the computer in a 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.860
 future will have its own speakers 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.320
 and his own microphone but now it depends 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.020
 of the computer then well let's see 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.150
 more or less how is the system starts 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.150
 the voice control that is a program 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.260
 designed for that and now you're going to see what 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.260
 what do you do with commodore 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.830
 I looked to the right 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.260
 Look to the left 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.780
 I look forward 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.350
 who you are 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.350
 I am a corporal 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.010
 who is David 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.610
 there you can notice that the robot what 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.610
 he designed 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:06.409
 and 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:08.800
 you have esther you have done a bit of 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.180
 mess but who is this 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.180
 you are a girl 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.130
 when the world is going to end 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.549
 but I'm not able to answer 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.549
 to which it opens 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.100
 Well, those are the commands that 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.100
 moment recognizes look to the left 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.880
 as you see the system so that it moves the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.730
 denture is that it's from a game that 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.890
 I had magic the prep and showed a 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.840
 thing like that was called what makes it move 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.780
 with a serbo using a wire is 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.470
 until it is a system 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.670
 original we could say and the eyes are 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.810
 ping pong balls divided by the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.180
 half 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.080
 aesthetics is something that will have to be 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.630
 improve but good 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.440
 the robot itself has a pretty system 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.570
 sophisticated in terms of software and the 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.210
 hardware for the moment three servos and 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.030
 in the future it will have little lights in the 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:09.000
 eyes and such and surely some sensor 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.110
 proximity temperature to make 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.110
 things when you approach him 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.099
 and good nothing more than that apart then 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.079
 there's a whistle in the system 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.840
 voice recognition so that if 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.370
 I tell you open me twitter 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.250
 Well, it opens a small window with 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.569
 twitter 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.190
 Well that is of little use compared 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.560
 to the robot that's something to find 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.890
 the computer because nothing else this is the 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.120
 second video of how there will be more and there will be 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.120
 improved the little robot 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.860
 but he thought
