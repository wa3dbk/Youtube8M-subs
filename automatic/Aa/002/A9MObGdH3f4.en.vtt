00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.879
 we are in the stand of locks edges 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.969
 Peruvian locks 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:16.900
 we are accompanied by miguelÃ¡ngel yumi manager 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:18.460
 Canton commercial for Latin America 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.230
 tell us a little bit what we are going 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.360
 to do what we are going to demonstrate in this 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.220
 hello occasion what about if we go to 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.599
 show that the canton lock is 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.210
 one step action and innovation 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.130
 we realize that nowadays 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.199
 the locks has a weak point that 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.730
 I can detach it from the inside 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.680
 with simple hammering that is what 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.839
 we are going to demonstrate here and we are also going to 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.059
 demonstrate that our lock supports 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:43.180
 an incredible amount of blows which 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.100
 it makes it more secure in that sense it 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.769
 he said in previous days that 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.979
 Canton mowers have evolved have 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.390
 evolved and as I say the thief is going to 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.430
 evolve what is learned in the 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.839
 way as to be able to violate a 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.699
 lock and we always try 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.350
 be one step or two steps ahead of 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.360
 them and this is one of the way 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.189
 us as we prove it by innovating 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.710
 the locks making many changes 

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:08.500
 year after year we also talk about locks 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.780
 for wood and locks for welding 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.640
 Exactly if it's already for metal doors 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.500
 or gates or also for carrying 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.790
 wood we have a type for each 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.290
 need 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.370
 well what do you think if we see the 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.370
 show let's go 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.650
 do not
