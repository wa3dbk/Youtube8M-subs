hello<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.410> miles<00:00:08.010> blue<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:08.610> just<00:00:08.790> like<00:00:08.910> to

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
hello this is miles blue I just like to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.220 
hello this is miles blue I just like to
take<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.150> bowl<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.450> your<00:00:09.510> time<00:00:09.750> discuss

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
take a bowl of your time discuss

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.379 
take a bowl of your time discuss
something<00:00:10.469> about<00:00:10.710> let's<00:00:11.309> go<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:12.059> didn't<00:00:12.300> know

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
something about let's go you didn't know

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.410 
something about let's go you didn't know
us<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:12.660> kind<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.990> floating<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.340> sky<00:00:14.639> you

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
us it's kind of floating in the sky you

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.510 
us it's kind of floating in the sky you
can<00:00:15.509> see<00:00:15.570> rocket<00:00:16.230> dusters<00:00:16.650> down<00:00:16.859> below<00:00:17.190> but

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
can see rocket dusters down below but

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.650 
can see rocket dusters down below but
now<00:00:19.160> so<00:00:20.160> getting<00:00:20.400> into<00:00:20.609> some<00:00:20.939> like<00:00:21.150> weird<00:00:21.420> or

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
now so getting into some like weird or

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.750 
now so getting into some like weird or
physics<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.470> pretty<00:00:22.740> obvious<00:00:23.220> here<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.519> we

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
physics it's pretty obvious here that we

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.570 
physics it's pretty obvious here that we
have<00:00:23.910> some<00:00:24.449> kind<00:00:24.720> of<00:00:24.900> force<00:00:25.500> that's<00:00:26.070> keeping

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
have some kind of force that's keeping

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.349 
have some kind of force that's keeping
the<00:00:26.910> stadium<00:00:27.449> up<00:00:28.580> opposing<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.880> natural

now<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.960> people<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.950> intelligent<00:00:35.610> systems

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
now the people at intelligent systems

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.000 
now the people at intelligent systems
who<00:00:36.239> made<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.690> game<00:00:36.750> thought<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
who made this game thought it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.680 
who made this game thought it
splitsville<00:00:38.579> it's<00:00:38.700> holding<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.120> midair<00:00:39.360> let's

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
splitsville it's holding in midair let's

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.959 
splitsville it's holding in midair let's
come<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.020> an<00:00:40.110> excuse<00:00:40.440> ah<00:00:40.620> poor<00:00:41.489> Rockets

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
come up with an excuse ah poor Rockets

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.110 
come up with an excuse ah poor Rockets
thrusters<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> bottom<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.430> few<00:00:44.430> problems

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
thrusters on the bottom a few problems

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.990 
thrusters on the bottom a few problems
with<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.420> however<00:00:46.070> yes<00:00:47.070> rocket<00:00:47.579> thrusters

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
with this however yes rocket thrusters

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.690 
with this however yes rocket thrusters
can<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.360> used<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.750> keep<00:00:48.899> things<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.590> midair<00:00:49.860> but

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
can be used to keep things in midair but

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.010 
can be used to keep things in midair but
the<00:00:50.789> thing<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.329> normally<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:51.809> done

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
the thing is it's normally not done

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.750 
the thing is it's normally not done
because<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.770> incredibly<00:00:53.460> unreliable

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
because they are incredibly unreliable

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.220 
because they are incredibly unreliable
how<00:00:54.300> many<00:00:54.449> things<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.750> actually<00:00:54.899> see

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
how many things do you actually see

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
how many things do you actually see
floating<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.860> mid-air<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.430> rocket

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
floating in mid-air with a rocket

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.010 
floating in mid-air with a rocket
thruster<00:00:57.090> normally<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.449> see<00:00:57.600> something<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
thruster normally you see something to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.630 
thruster normally you see something to
shoot<00:00:58.170> up<00:00:58.320> into<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> sky<00:00:58.949> from<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.399> rocket

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
shoot up into the sky from a rocket

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.270 
shoot up into the sky from a rocket
unless<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.870> like<00:01:01.109> NASA<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.890> equipment

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
unless you have like NASA like equipment

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.729 
unless you have like NASA like equipment
to<00:01:02.579> keep<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:02.969> those<00:01:03.149> thrusters<00:01:04.110> stabilized

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
to keep all those thrusters stabilized

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.350 
to keep all those thrusters stabilized
you're<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.309> gonna<00:01:05.489> have<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> lot<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:05.939> luck<00:01:06.180> with

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
you're not gonna have a lot of luck with

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.780 
you're not gonna have a lot of luck with
this<00:01:06.770> not<00:01:07.770> exactly<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> most<00:01:08.280> reliable<00:01:08.580> thing

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
this not exactly the most reliable thing

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.969 
this not exactly the most reliable thing
I<00:01:09.119> mean<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.360> kind<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.659> shows<00:01:09.869> some<00:01:10.229> kind<00:01:10.890> of

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I mean it kind of shows some kind of

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.370 
I mean it kind of shows some kind of
balance<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.640> whoever<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.990> could<00:01:13.200> just

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
balance here whoever you could just

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.899 
balance here whoever you could just
imagine<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.920> those<00:01:14.070> rocket<00:01:14.490> thrusters

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
imagine one of those rocket thrusters

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.640 
imagine one of those rocket thrusters
malfunctioning<00:01:15.659> glitz<00:01:16.080> Ville<00:01:16.290> just<00:01:16.500> gonna

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
malfunctioning glitz Ville just gonna

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.230 
malfunctioning glitz Ville just gonna
topple<00:01:17.040> over<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:17.939> fall<00:01:18.210> straight

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
topple over and then just fall straight

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.859 
topple over and then just fall straight
to<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> ground<00:01:19.020> killing<00:01:19.350> many<00:01:19.680> people<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.189> it

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
to the ground killing many people on it

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.210 
to the ground killing many people on it
the<00:01:21.869> other<00:01:21.900> thing<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.380> consider<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the other thing to consider is just the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.100 
the other thing to consider is just the
sheer<00:01:23.580> amount<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.939> power<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.479> takes<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
sheer amount of power it takes just to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.140 
sheer amount of power it takes just to
simply<00:01:25.470> keep<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.860> thing<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.310> limped<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.939> mean

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
simply keep this thing and limped I mean

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.090 
simply keep this thing and limped I mean
just<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.170> about<00:01:28.409> an<00:01:28.530> order<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.890> thing

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
just think about an order for that thing

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.770 
just think about an order for that thing
to<00:01:29.220> stay<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.610> those<00:01:29.820> rocket<00:01:30.150> nurses<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.659> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
to stay up those rocket nurses have to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.310 
to stay up those rocket nurses have to
push<00:01:31.079> enough<00:01:31.890> air<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.340> stop<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> crap<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
push enough air and stop the crap and

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.130 
push enough air and stop the crap and
gas<00:01:34.740> powder<00:01:35.130> down<00:01:35.729> just<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.210> keep<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.780> have

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
gas powder down just to keep it up have

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.480 
gas powder down just to keep it up have
you<00:01:37.229> ever<00:01:37.350> actually<00:01:37.500> thought<00:01:37.829> how<00:01:38.040> much<00:01:38.159> power

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you ever actually thought how much power

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.910 
you ever actually thought how much power
that<00:01:38.790> would<00:01:38.880> take<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.450> swear<00:01:40.200> grumble<00:01:40.710> over

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that would take I swear grumble over

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520 
that would take I swear grumble over
here<00:01:41.159> must<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.460> really<00:01:41.850> rich<00:01:42.210> or<00:01:42.479> gas<00:01:43.020> bill<00:01:43.409> is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
here must be really rich or gas bill is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.060 
here must be really rich or gas bill is

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
up with an interesting theory that all

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.850 
up with an interesting theory that all
the<00:01:51.119> guests<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> stadium<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.380> powered<00:01:52.829> by

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
the guests to the stadium is powered by

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.429 
the guests to the stadium is powered by
the<00:01:53.100> sewage<00:01:53.759> system<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.570> glitz<00:01:54.899> Ville<00:01:55.110> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the sewage system in glitz Ville so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.749 
the sewage system in glitz Ville so
basically<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.950> whole<00:01:56.100> stadium<00:01:56.340> staying

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
basically the whole stadium staying

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
basically the whole stadium staying

poopoo I'm not exactly sure if I buy
that<00:02:01.890> theory<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> most<00:02:02.939> valid

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
that theory but it's the most valid

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
that theory but it's the most valid
thing<00:02:03.420> I've<00:02:03.570> heard<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:03.990> far<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.500> we'll<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.740> with

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
thing I've heard so far so we'll go with

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.580 
thing I've heard so far so we'll go with
that<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.390> not<00:02:06.479> least<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:07.259> it's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that and that's not least know it's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.199 
that and that's not least know it's
impossible<00:02:07.890> for<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.429> thing<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> be<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.849> orbit

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
impossible for this thing to be in orbit

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.910 
impossible for this thing to be in orbit
as<00:02:09.360> current<00:02:09.690> altitude<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.410> see<00:02:10.619> clouds

that<00:02:11.520> means<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> troposphere

that<00:02:12.900> means<00:02:13.110> it's<00:02:13.260> with<00:02:13.440> it

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that means it's with it
