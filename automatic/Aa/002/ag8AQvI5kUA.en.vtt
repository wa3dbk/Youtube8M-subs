00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.360
No Sign of Rise

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.000
A whole year of dedication and devotion

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.140
Much burden, no concern

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.820
I heard that we've been turning out profitable

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.620
But until now 
No reward ?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.180
Working so hard, where is my cash ?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.820
Tet is coming, no paying

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.160
If my wife knows about this now

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.120
For sure I will be grounded

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:47.140
Finally, Boss has come forward 
Promising a reward

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.600
All my time paid off 
But no

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.880
For this 
 Bonus is not worth it

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.400
Working so hard, where is my cash ?

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.900
Maybe boss doesn't care about us anymore

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.360
If my wife knows about this now

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.040
For sure I will be grounded

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.020
Price are so high , But no wage rise

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.360
Waiting... 
Still no sign

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.860
We are losing our minds

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.280

We do this for passion

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.900

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.220
Leaving all of you behind
