supports<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.359> those<00:00:30.510> are<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> two<00:00:31.230> champions

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
supports but those are the two champions

that<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.830> think<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.550> most<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> this

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
that I think get the most out of this

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.780 
that I think get the most out of this
combo<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.960> anyway<00:00:34.260> here's<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> way<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> set<00:00:35.700> up
