00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.789 
see and I just think that that's very
interesting<00:02:21.040> on<00:02:21.370> my<00:02:21.459> last<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:23.349> sitting<00:02:23.680> down

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
interesting on my last the sitting down

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.369 
interesting on my last the sitting down
and<00:02:23.980> talking<00:02:24.129> video<00:02:24.569> called<00:02:25.569> real<00:02:25.780> talk<00:02:25.989> that

and talking video called real talk that

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.170 
and talking video called real talk that
so<00:02:27.219> many<00:02:27.340> people<00:02:27.579> are<00:02:27.700> like<00:02:27.849> oh<00:02:28.030> it's

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
so many people are like oh it's

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.729 
so many people are like oh it's
refreshing<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.719> see<00:02:28.840> like<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:29.469> side<00:02:29.709> of

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
refreshing to see like this side of

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.009 
refreshing to see like this side of
youtubers<00:02:30.189> but<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.549> reality<00:02:30.670> it's<00:02:30.969> yeah<00:02:31.930> we

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
youtubers but in reality it's yeah we

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.129 
youtubers but in reality it's yeah we
don't<00:02:32.200> show<00:02:32.409> it<00:02:32.560> but<00:02:32.829> that<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:34.750> bound<00:02:35.019> to

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
don't show it but that is bound to

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.699 
don't show it but that is bound to
happen<00:02:35.319> we<00:02:35.889> are<00:02:35.920> humans<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:36.819> I<00:02:37.379> think<00:02:38.379> that

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
happen we are humans and I think that

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.199 
happen we are humans and I think that
that's<00:02:38.859> important<00:02:39.549> to<00:02:39.609> remember<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.909> you

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
that's important to remember that you

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.589 
that's important to remember that you
are<00:02:40.239> no<00:02:40.480> lesser<00:02:41.069> than<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.549> youtuber<00:02:43.060> because

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
are no lesser than a youtuber because

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.080 
are no lesser than a youtuber because
just<00:02:44.019> because<00:02:44.290> they<00:02:44.919> have<00:02:45.159> a<00:02:45.189> following<00:02:45.609> or

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
just because they have a following or

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.580 
just because they have a following or
what<00:02:46.239> not<00:02:46.419> at<00:02:46.870> YouTube<00:02:47.139> events<00:02:47.439> when
