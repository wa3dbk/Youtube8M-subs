00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
way that I usually do it is using kind

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.950 
way that I usually do it is using kind
of<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.560> combination<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.520> pressure<00:01:12.180> release<00:01:12.720> and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
of a combination of pressure release and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.560 
of a combination of pressure release and
positive<00:01:13.770> reinforcement<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> will

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
positive reinforcement so what I will

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.280 
positive reinforcement so what I will

tall<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.759> I'll<00:01:44.909> keep<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:45.479> high<00:01:45.630> as<00:01:45.689> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
tall so I'll keep it here as high as I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.780 
tall so I'll keep it here as high as I
can<00:01:45.960> get<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:46.590> when<00:01:47.280> she<00:01:47.430> puts<00:01:47.670> her

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
can get it and then when she puts her

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.520 
can get it and then when she puts her
head<00:01:47.939> down<00:01:48.119> even<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:50.899> then<00:01:51.899> I'm<00:01:52.229> going

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
head down even a little then I'm going

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.710 
head down even a little then I'm going
to<00:01:53.360> make<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> basically<00:01:55.110> give<00:01:55.290> her<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.439> click

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.230 

and<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.590> give<00:02:00.800> her<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.160> little<00:02:01.520> reinforcement

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
and then give her a little reinforcement

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.820 
and then give her a little reinforcement
here<00:02:02.360> now<00:02:02.870> part<00:02:03.110> of<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.230> reason<00:02:03.290> that<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.590> keep

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
here now part of the reason that I keep

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.470 
here now part of the reason that I keep
my<00:02:03.980> hand<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.610> halter<00:02:04.820> especially<00:02:05.330> as<00:02:05.390> I'm

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
my hand on the halter especially as I'm

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.570 
my hand on the halter especially as I'm
going<00:02:05.750> for<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.050> treat<00:02:06.320> is<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:07.040> she<00:02:07.190> doesn't

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
going for that treat is that she doesn't

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.310 
going for that treat is that she doesn't
learn<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:07.880> do<00:02:08.030> any<00:02:08.240> other<00:02:08.330> behaviors<00:02:09.110> like

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
learn to do any other behaviors like

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.140 
learn to do any other behaviors like
coming<00:02:09.680> over<00:02:10.040> and<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.490> know<00:02:10.610> grabbing<00:02:10.880> my

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
coming over and you know grabbing my

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.590 
coming over and you know grabbing my
shirt<00:02:11.450> as<00:02:11.720> I'm<00:02:12.260> getting<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.680> food<00:02:12.980> out<00:02:13.160> and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
shirt as I'm getting that food out and

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.660 
shirt as I'm getting that food out and
she's<00:02:14.600> got<00:02:14.780> some<00:02:14.960> other<00:02:15.110> manners<00:02:15.470> work<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:16.490> do

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
she's got some other manners work to do

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:26.300 
she's got some other manners work to do
just<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:17.060> general

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:35.660 

I<00:02:32.209> found<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.420> using<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:35.370> know<00:02:35.430> with

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
I found that using this you know with

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.460 
I found that using this you know with
kind<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.940> using<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.390> positive<00:02:36.569> reinforcement

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
kind of using the positive reinforcement

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.990 
kind of using the positive reinforcement
and<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:37.770> to<00:02:37.860> really<00:02:38.160> basically<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.760> hand

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
and just to really basically the hand

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.670 
and just to really basically the hand
just<00:02:39.180> laying<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.660> very<00:02:39.810> light<00:02:40.020> pressure<00:02:40.260> on<00:02:40.440> top

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
just laying a very light pressure on top

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.000 
just laying a very light pressure on top
of<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.920> head<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.340> get<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.390> lot<00:02:42.690> less<00:02:42.950> kind<00:02:43.950> of

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
of the head you get a lot less kind of

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.479 
of the head you get a lot less kind of
anxiety<00:02:44.550> behaviors<00:02:45.060> from<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> horse<00:02:46.280> then<00:02:47.280> if

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
anxiety behaviors from the horse then if

00:02:47.489 --> 00:03:02.920 
anxiety behaviors from the horse then if
you<00:02:47.640> put<00:02:47.880> pressure<00:02:48.090> up<00:02:48.420> there

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.030 

and<00:03:04.819> then<00:03:05.819> also<00:03:06.060> by<00:03:06.900> having<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.530> hand<00:03:07.769> on<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and then also by having the hand on the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.399 
and then also by having the hand on the
holder<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.640> kind<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.299> end<00:03:09.540> up<00:03:09.719> usually<00:03:10.200> having

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
holder I kind of end up usually having

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:11.990 
holder I kind of end up usually having
two<00:03:10.739> queues<00:03:11.099> meaning<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.549> can<00:03:11.730> just<00:03:11.879> grab

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
two queues meaning that I can just grab

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.940 
two queues meaning that I can just grab
the<00:03:12.209> halter<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.719> ask<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.409> horse<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.650> lower

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
the halter and ask the horse to lower

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.599 
the halter and ask the horse to lower
their<00:03:14.129> head<00:03:14.310> or<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:15.480> can<00:03:15.930> put<00:03:16.109> my<00:03:16.200> hand

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
their head or I can put my hand

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:29.809 
their head or I can put my hand
basically<00:03:17.609> up<00:03:17.700> on<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:17.969> pole<00:03:27.019> and<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:29.400> key<00:03:29.609> is

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
basically up on the pole and the key is

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.910 
basically up on the pole and the key is
just<00:03:29.849> do<00:03:30.239> your<00:03:30.540> very<00:03:30.689> best<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:31.200> stay<00:03:31.500> with<00:03:31.799> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
just do your very best to stay with the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.979 
just do your very best to stay with the
horse<00:03:32.129> when<00:03:32.370> they<00:03:32.519> throw<00:03:32.760> their<00:03:32.909> head<00:03:33.150> if<00:03:33.510> they

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
horse when they throw their head if they

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.349 
horse when they throw their head if they
move<00:03:34.200> their<00:03:34.379> head<00:03:34.530> side<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.799> side<00:03:35.090> because<00:03:36.090> if

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
move their head side to side because if

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.970 
move their head side to side because if
they<00:03:36.629> learn<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.139> by<00:03:37.290> throwing<00:03:37.650> their<00:03:37.799> head

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
they learn that by throwing their head

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.460 
they learn that by throwing their head
up<00:03:38.159> you<00:03:38.700> take<00:03:39.090> your<00:03:39.299> hand<00:03:39.540> away<00:03:39.689> or<00:03:40.079> you<00:03:40.169> lose

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
up you take your hand away or you lose

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.140 
up you take your hand away or you lose
your<00:03:40.650> grip<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.069> hotter<00:03:41.280> then<00:03:41.970> they're

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
your grip of the hotter then they're

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.460 
your grip of the hotter then they're
going<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.299> learn<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.750> they<00:03:42.959> get<00:03:43.109> a<00:03:43.139> release

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
going to learn that they get a release

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.229 
going to learn that they get a release
there<00:03:43.829> and<00:03:44.069> they<00:03:44.340> might<00:03:44.489> decide<00:03:44.849> that<00:03:44.909> that's

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
there and they might decide that that's

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.539 
there and they might decide that that's
easier<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:45.959> better<00:03:46.079> than<00:03:46.889> actually<00:03:47.310> lowering

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
easier and better than actually lowering

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:54.740 
easier and better than actually lowering
the<00:03:47.730> head<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:53.909> found<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.359> this<00:03:54.510> usually

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
the head and I found that this usually

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.319 
the head and I found that this usually
works<00:03:55.349> best<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.829> a<00:03:55.889> few<00:03:56.099> sessions<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.030> meaning

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
works best in a few sessions so meaning

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.929 
works best in a few sessions so meaning
I'll<00:03:57.419> do<00:03:57.659> you<00:03:57.989> know<00:03:58.109> like<00:03:58.379> three<00:03:58.950> four<00:03:59.819> or<00:03:59.879> five

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
I'll do you know like three four or five

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.030 
I'll do you know like three four or five
minute<00:04:00.480> sessions<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.139> normally<00:04:01.859> they'll

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
minute sessions and normally they'll

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:24.790 
minute sessions and normally they'll
have<00:04:02.219> it<00:04:02.340> pretty<00:04:02.669> solid<00:04:03.180> within<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.599> time

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.990 

so<00:04:25.800> I'm<00:04:25.919> actually<00:04:26.100> waiting<00:04:26.460> here<00:04:26.700> because<00:04:26.880> if

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
so I'm actually waiting here because if

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.640 
so I'm actually waiting here because if
see<00:04:27.210> if<00:04:27.419> she<00:04:27.660> lifts<00:04:27.960> their<00:04:28.080> head<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.230> little<00:04:28.470> bit

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
see if she lifts their head a little bit

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.430 
see if she lifts their head a little bit
then<00:04:29.270> they're<00:04:30.270> more<00:04:30.510> quickly<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.990> put<00:04:31.139> it<00:04:31.260> down

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
then they're more quickly to put it down

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.840 
then they're more quickly to put it down
if<00:04:31.620> it's<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.830> little<00:04:31.950> bit<00:04:32.160> higher<00:04:32.340> than<00:04:32.610> if<00:04:32.730> it's

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
if it's a little bit higher than if it's

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:44.980 
if it's a little bit higher than if it's
already<00:04:33.120> really<00:04:33.450> low

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.559 

and<00:04:46.160> then<00:04:47.160> this<00:04:47.310> is<00:04:47.370> just<00:04:47.729> kind<00:04:47.940> of<00:04:48.030> a<00:04:48.150> general

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
and then this is just kind of a general

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.900 
and then this is just kind of a general
rule<00:04:48.810> of<00:04:49.080> using<00:04:49.590> positive<00:04:49.979> reinforcement<00:04:50.039> or

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
rule of using positive reinforcement or

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.879 
rule of using positive reinforcement or
using<00:04:51.210> food<00:04:51.389> with<00:04:51.599> horses<00:04:51.900> but<00:04:52.199> I'm<00:04:52.680> always

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
using food with horses but I'm always

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.890 
using food with horses but I'm always
making<00:04:53.729> sure<00:04:53.940> that<00:04:54.120> our<00:04:54.240> heads<00:04:54.389> straight<00:04:54.720> when

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
making sure that our heads straight when

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:02.689 
making sure that our heads straight when
I<00:04:54.930> give<00:04:55.139> her<00:04:55.229> that<00:04:55.259> treat<00:05:01.069> and<00:05:02.069> she<00:05:02.580> already

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
I give her that treat and she already

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.390 
I give her that treat and she already
feels<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.360> me<00:05:03.389> like<00:05:03.509> she's<00:05:03.990> starting<00:05:04.259> to<00:05:04.710> kind

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
feels to me like she's starting to kind

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.760 
feels to me like she's starting to kind
of<00:05:05.460> get<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.759> idea<00:05:05.789> of<00:05:06.270> it<00:05:09.349> so<00:05:10.349> we'll<00:05:10.530> do<00:05:10.650> it<00:05:10.680> a

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
of get the idea of it so we'll do it a

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.020 
of get the idea of it so we'll do it a
few<00:05:10.949> more<00:05:11.099> times<00:05:11.159> here<00:05:13.699> and<00:05:14.699> part<00:05:14.909> of<00:05:14.940> the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
few more times here and part of the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.430 
few more times here and part of the
reason<00:05:15.210> I<00:05:15.300> Paul<00:05:15.509> is<00:05:15.629> in<00:05:15.720> between<00:05:15.810> two<00:05:16.199> is<00:05:16.319> I

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
reason I Paul is in between two is I

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.659 
reason I Paul is in between two is I
just<00:05:16.500> kind<00:05:16.800> of<00:05:16.830> let<00:05:17.009> her<00:05:17.099> eat<00:05:17.280> her<00:05:17.310> treat

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
just kind of let her eat her treat

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:29.860 
just kind of let her eat her treat
process<00:05:18.479> for<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.750> minute

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.260 

and<00:05:30.710> what<00:05:30.860> she's<00:05:31.070> probably<00:05:31.400> learned<00:05:32.000> is

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
and what she's probably learned is

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.120 
and what she's probably learned is
there's<00:05:32.780> probably<00:05:32.900> times<00:05:33.380> in<00:05:33.590> the<00:05:33.680> past<00:05:33.889> where

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
there's probably times in the past where

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.980 
there's probably times in the past where
people<00:05:34.160> if<00:05:34.550> you<00:05:34.669> know<00:05:34.699> grabbed<00:05:35.000> her<00:05:35.120> halter<00:05:35.360> to

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
people if you know grabbed her halter to

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.110 
people if you know grabbed her halter to
do<00:05:36.169> something<00:05:36.710> or<00:05:37.310> done<00:05:37.550> something<00:05:37.970> around

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
do something or done something around

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.760 
do something or done something around
her<00:05:38.270> head<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:38.510> since<00:05:38.930> she's<00:05:39.110> big<00:05:39.320> horse<00:05:39.560> she

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 
her head and since she's big horse she

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.020 
her head and since she's big horse she
probably<00:05:39.919> learned<00:05:40.130> that<00:05:40.370> throwing<00:05:40.729> that<00:05:40.850> head

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
probably learned that throwing that head

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.600 
probably learned that throwing that head
up<00:05:41.180> is<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.389> pretty<00:05:41.660> effective<00:05:41.930> way<00:05:42.169> of<00:05:42.610> getting

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
up is a pretty effective way of getting

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.320 
up is a pretty effective way of getting
that<00:05:43.729> person<00:05:44.180> to<00:05:44.680> let<00:05:45.680> go<00:05:45.940> so<00:05:46.940> that's<00:05:47.090> probably

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
that person to let go so that's probably

00:05:47.330 --> 00:06:02.320 
that person to let go so that's probably
why<00:05:47.540> she<00:05:48.530> keeps<00:05:48.740> coming<00:05:48.919> back<00:05:49.100> to<00:05:49.280> that<00:06:01.330> so

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
why she keeps coming back to that so

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.610 
why she keeps coming back to that so
there<00:06:02.510> I<00:06:02.540> didn't<00:06:02.810> even<00:06:02.870> have<00:06:03.110> to<00:06:03.320> bring<00:06:03.470> the

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
there I didn't even have to bring the

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.969 
there I didn't even have to bring the
hand<00:06:03.830> up<00:06:04.930> and<00:06:05.930> this<00:06:06.169> is<00:06:06.320> where<00:06:06.500> they<00:06:06.620> start<00:06:06.919> to

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
hand up and this is where they start to

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:08.800 
hand up and this is where they start to
just<00:06:07.610> kind<00:06:07.790> of<00:06:07.850> through<00:06:08.030> conditioning<00:06:08.330> she's

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
just kind of through conditioning she's

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.480 
just kind of through conditioning she's
learning<00:06:09.169> that<00:06:09.320> my<00:06:09.830> hand<00:06:10.010> comes<00:06:10.250> on<00:06:10.400> the

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
learning that my hand comes on the

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.800 
learning that my hand comes on the
halter<00:06:10.700> and<00:06:11.060> then<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:11.240> other<00:06:11.360> one<00:06:11.510> goes<00:06:11.660> up

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
halter and then the other one goes up

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.140 
halter and then the other one goes up
there<00:06:11.990> then<00:06:12.919> she<00:06:13.130> lowers<00:06:13.370> her<00:06:13.400> head<00:06:13.669> and<00:06:14.030> she

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
there then she lowers her head and she

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:24.840 
there then she lowers her head and she
gets<00:06:14.330> reinforced

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.430 

now<00:06:25.480> there<00:06:25.660> I<00:06:25.690> could<00:06:25.930> have<00:06:25.990> done<00:06:26.140> a<00:06:26.170> better<00:06:26.320> job

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
now there I could have done a better job

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.140 
now there I could have done a better job
I<00:06:26.620> should<00:06:26.740> have<00:06:26.980> kept<00:06:27.160> my<00:06:27.220> hand<00:06:27.550> on<00:06:27.730> the<00:06:27.850> harder

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
I should have kept my hand on the harder

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.540 
I should have kept my hand on the harder
by<00:06:28.750> letting<00:06:29.080> go<00:06:29.230> she<00:06:29.290> kind<00:06:29.680> of<00:06:29.770> popped<00:06:30.370> back<00:06:30.490> up

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
by letting go she kind of popped back up

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.850 
by letting go she kind of popped back up
and<00:06:30.910> came<00:06:31.060> towards<00:06:31.390> me<00:06:31.450> so<00:06:32.440> we'll<00:06:32.560> do<00:06:32.650> it<00:06:32.680> maybe

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
and came towards me so we'll do it maybe

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.410 
and came towards me so we'll do it maybe
once<00:06:33.130> more<00:06:33.400> and<00:06:33.610> then<00:06:33.700> I<00:06:33.730> think<00:06:33.970> this<00:06:34.150> will<00:06:34.300> be

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.420 
once more and then I think this will be

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:42.690 
once more and then I think this will be
a<00:06:34.450> really<00:06:34.660> good<00:06:34.840> session<00:06:35.200> for<00:06:35.410> her<00:06:35.500> oh<00:06:41.700> and

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
a really good session for her oh and

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.360 
a really good session for her oh and
again<00:06:42.760> there<00:06:43.680> could<00:06:44.680> I<00:06:44.740> get<00:06:44.890> my<00:06:45.010> hand<00:06:45.190> on<00:06:45.280> the

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
again there could I get my hand on the

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.560 
again there could I get my hand on the
holder<00:06:45.610> but<00:06:45.760> she's<00:06:45.910> actually<00:06:46.060> being<00:06:46.330> pretty

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
holder but she's actually being pretty

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.850 
holder but she's actually being pretty
good<00:06:46.750> as<00:06:46.930> far<00:06:46.960> as<00:06:47.140> not<00:06:47.350> bringing<00:06:47.680> her<00:06:47.740> head

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
good as far as not bringing her head

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.430 
good as far as not bringing her head
over<00:06:48.030> okay<00:06:49.030> I<00:06:49.270> think<00:06:49.780> this<00:06:50.050> is<00:06:50.110> going<00:06:50.380> to

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
over okay I think this is going to

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.190 
over okay I think this is going to
conclude<00:06:50.950> our<00:06:51.280> session<00:06:51.850> here<00:06:52.300> with<00:06:52.480> Fiona<00:06:52.750> and

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
conclude our session here with Fiona and

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.160 
conclude our session here with Fiona and
I<00:06:53.830> honestly<00:06:54.160> have<00:06:54.580> not<00:06:54.790> done<00:06:55.180> any<00:06:55.540> of<00:06:55.870> the<00:06:56.020> head

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:56.170 
I honestly have not done any of the head

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.170 
I honestly have not done any of the head
lowering<00:06:56.560> with<00:06:56.680> her<00:06:56.860> before<00:06:57.040> I've<00:06:57.700> only<00:06:57.940> done

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
lowering with her before I've only done

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.460 
lowering with her before I've only done
just<00:06:58.480> a<00:06:58.570> little<00:06:58.810> bit<00:06:58.930> of<00:06:59.020> work<00:06:59.230> basically

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470 
just a little bit of work basically

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.650 
just a little bit of work basically
conditioning<00:07:00.340> her<00:07:00.490> to<00:07:00.700> that<00:07:00.850> click<00:07:01.180> sound<00:07:01.480> so

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 
conditioning her to that click sound so

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.540 
conditioning her to that click sound so
that<00:07:01.780> she<00:07:01.930> understands<00:07:02.530> that<00:07:02.560> that<00:07:02.830> what<00:07:03.370> that

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
that she understands that that what that

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.630 
that she understands that that what that
means<00:07:03.820> and<00:07:04.120> I<00:07:04.990> think<00:07:05.020> that<00:07:05.470> she<00:07:06.070> did<00:07:06.460> really

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640 
means and I think that she did really

expect that especially in the beginning
she's<00:07:18.310> probably<00:07:18.460> going<00:07:18.640> to<00:07:18.700> throw<00:07:18.940> the<00:07:19.060> head

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.170 
she's probably going to throw the head

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 
happens especially if they have a

happens especially if they have a
behavior<00:07:24.220> like<00:07:24.340> that<00:07:24.400> that's<00:07:24.760> worked<00:07:25.000> for

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 
behavior like that that's worked for

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.510 
behavior like that that's worked for
them<00:07:25.330> in<00:07:25.450> the<00:07:25.510> past<00:07:25.690> they'll<00:07:26.380> usually<00:07:26.620> do<00:07:27.130> it<00:07:27.280> a

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 
them in the past they'll usually do it a

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.700 
them in the past they'll usually do it a
few<00:07:28.360> times<00:07:28.420> like<00:07:28.930> it'll<00:07:29.140> take<00:07:29.350> a<00:07:29.380> little<00:07:29.560> while

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:29.710 
few times like it'll take a little while

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.550 
few times like it'll take a little while
for<00:07:30.100> them<00:07:30.220> to<00:07:30.520> basically<00:07:30.820> realize<00:07:31.630> that<00:07:32.080> it's

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 
for them to basically realize that it's

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:33.940 
not going to work anymore so you just

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.400 
not going to work anymore so you just

have to work through that be patient

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.950 
have to work through that be patient
through<00:07:35.590> that<00:07:35.710> process<00:07:35.920> and<00:07:36.400> then<00:07:36.960> they're

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 
through that process and then they're

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.270
