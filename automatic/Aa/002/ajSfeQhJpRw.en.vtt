part they're right I have had a second
channel<00:02:27.880> previously<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:29.350> really<00:02:29.680> hard

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
channel previously and it's really hard

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.390 
channel previously and it's really hard
to<00:02:30.010> manage<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.610> if<00:02:31.269> I<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.780> travel<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.709> plan

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
to manage and if I can travel and plan

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.289 
to manage and if I can travel and plan
on<00:02:33.549> doing<00:02:33.820> this<00:02:33.910> more<00:02:34.350> via<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.590> road<00:02:36.299> it's

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
on doing this more via the road it's

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.300 
on doing this more via the road it's
going<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.600> be<00:02:37.720> extremely<00:02:37.900> hard<00:02:38.500> to<00:02:39.100> maintain

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
going to be extremely hard to maintain

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.300 
going to be extremely hard to maintain
Bowl<00:02:39.760> channel<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:40.420> there's<00:02:41.230> really<00:02:41.680> no<00:02:42.070> reason

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310
