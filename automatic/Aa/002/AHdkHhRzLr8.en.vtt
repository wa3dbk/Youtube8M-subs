00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
found I struggled with the most was that

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.380 
found I struggled with the most was that
they<00:00:20.189> would<00:00:20.310> use<00:00:20.490> all<00:00:20.670> these<00:00:20.820> terms<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.359> I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
they would use all these terms that I

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.970 
they would use all these terms that I
wasn't<00:00:21.810> really<00:00:21.929> familiar<00:00:22.199> with<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.769> am

wasn't really familiar with I am

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.310 
wasn't really familiar with I am
familiar<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.759> them<00:00:24.090> now<00:00:24.300> because<00:00:24.779> I'm<00:00:25.050> so

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
familiar with them now because I'm so

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.410 
familiar with them now because I'm so
used<00:00:25.349> to<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.070> use<00:00:26.490> them<00:00:26.609> all<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.849> tire<00:00:27.060> and

I've<00:00:27.509> watched<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.929> million<00:00:28.289> videos<00:00:28.619> myself<00:00:29.160> but

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I've watched a million videos myself but

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.730 
I've watched a million videos myself but
at<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> start<00:00:30.390> there<00:00:30.900> were<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.439> was<00:00:31.560> like<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
at the start there were it was like a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.860 
at the start there were it was like a
completely<00:00:32.340> foreign<00:00:32.669> language<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.300> me<00:00:33.330> which

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
completely foreign language to me which

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.080 
completely foreign language to me which
made<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.200> very<00:00:34.230> difficult<00:00:34.560> to<00:00:35.280> copy<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.910> look

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
made it very difficult to copy the look

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.970 
made it very difficult to copy the look
and<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.539> on<00:00:36.600> myself<00:00:36.809> because<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.710> wasn't

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and do it on myself because I wasn't

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.010 
and do it on myself because I wasn't
really<00:00:38.250> sure<00:00:38.399> where<00:00:38.940> different<00:00:39.539> eye<00:00:39.719> shadow

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
really sure where different eye shadow

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410 
really sure where different eye shadow
should<00:00:40.289> go<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.829> for<00:00:41.640> instance<00:00:42.030> they<00:00:42.239> would

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
should go and for instance they would

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.510 
should go and for instance they would
say<00:00:42.629> put<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.289> the<00:00:43.379> crease<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.010> had<00:00:44.340> no

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
say put this in the crease and I had no

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.549 
say put this in the crease and I had no
idea<00:00:44.550> where<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> crease<00:00:45.360> was<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.870> so

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
idea where the crease was and so

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889 
idea where the crease was and so
basically<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.760> video<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.359> going<00:00:48.449> to<00:00:48.660> break

the<00:01:50.540> color<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:51.049> apply<00:01:51.470> here<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:51.979> usually

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
the color you apply here is usually

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.070 
the color you apply here is usually
going<00:01:52.850> to<00:01:53.030> be<00:01:53.119> your<00:01:53.299> most<00:01:53.450> dominant<00:01:53.900> or

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
vibrant color if you are going for a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.120 
vibrant color if you are going for a
really<00:01:56.540> colorful<00:01:56.780> look<00:01:57.290> using<00:01:57.530> most<00:01:57.890> bold

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
really colorful look using most bold

really colorful look using most bold
color<00:01:58.430> here<00:01:58.700> otherwise<00:01:59.479> you<00:01:59.750> can<00:01:59.930> use<00:02:00.080> a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
color here otherwise you can use a

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.200 
color here otherwise you can use a
really<00:02:00.380> central<00:02:00.680> base<00:02:01.040> color<00:02:01.369> usually<00:02:02.030> when

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
really central base color usually when

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.480 
really central base color usually when
I'm<00:02:02.360> going<00:02:02.720> for<00:02:03.110> a<00:02:03.140> neutral<00:02:03.799> look<00:02:04.009> I<00:02:04.220> will

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
I'm going for a neutral look I will

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.249 
I'm going for a neutral look I will
apply<00:02:04.790> my<00:02:05.240> lightest<00:02:05.750> color<00:02:05.990> here<00:02:07.959> the<00:02:08.959> next

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
apply my lightest color here the next

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.559 
apply my lightest color here the next
step<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.950> apply<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.369> transition<00:02:11.000> color<00:02:11.270> in

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
step is to apply a transition color in

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.330 
step is to apply a transition color in
the<00:02:11.810> crease<00:02:11.959> or<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.350> socket<00:02:12.770> line<00:02:12.920> so

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
the crease or the socket line so

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.040 
the crease or the socket line so
basically<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.000> would<00:02:14.090> be<00:02:14.270> applying<00:02:14.690> color

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
basically you would be applying color

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.050 
basically you would be applying color
over<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.680> dotted<00:02:15.950> line<00:02:16.040> which<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.580> sitting

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
over this dotted line which is sitting

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.350 
over this dotted line which is sitting
in<00:02:17.150> my<00:02:17.300> cruise<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:18.319> find<00:02:18.560> your<00:02:18.709> crease<00:02:18.950> it's

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
in my cruise to find your crease it's

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.479 
in my cruise to find your crease it's
easiest<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.540> look<00:02:20.840> down<00:02:21.440> rather<00:02:21.860> than<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.370> have

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
easiest to look down rather than to have

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.250 
easiest to look down rather than to have
your<00:02:22.670> eyes<00:02:22.819> closed<00:02:23.209> having<00:02:23.989> your<00:02:24.110> eyes

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
your eyes closed having your eyes

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.229 
your eyes closed having your eyes
slightly<00:02:24.560> open<00:02:25.069> will<00:02:25.310> actually<00:02:25.850> make<00:02:26.030> that

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
slightly open will actually make that

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.360 
slightly open will actually make that
more<00:02:26.480> visible<00:02:27.019> and<00:02:27.170> you'll<00:02:27.709> find<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.220> lot

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
more visible and you'll find it's a lot

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.090 
more visible and you'll find it's a lot
easier<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.790> locate<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.720> also<00:02:30.200> found<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.890> when

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
easier to locate I also found that when

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.009 
easier to locate I also found that when
I<00:02:31.130> was<00:02:31.400> beginning<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:32.090> little<00:02:32.540> trick<00:02:32.720> i<00:02:32.840> would

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
I was beginning a little trick i would

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.080 
I was beginning a little trick i would
use<00:02:33.200> was<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.560> apply<00:02:33.800> some<00:02:34.130> foundation<00:02:34.790> across

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
use was to apply some foundation across

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.720 
use was to apply some foundation across
my<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.269> just<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.780> very<00:02:35.989> thin<00:02:36.230> layer<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.709> then<00:02:37.400> I

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
my I just a very thin layer and then I

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.790 
my I just a very thin layer and then I
would<00:02:37.910> leave<00:02:38.090> my<00:02:38.269> eyes<00:02:38.450> open<00:02:39.080> for<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.380> minute<00:02:39.680> or

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
would leave my eyes open for a minute or

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.380 
would leave my eyes open for a minute or
so<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.250> then<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.489> found<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.090> would<00:02:41.209> just

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
so and then I found that it would just

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.150 
so and then I found that it would just
naturally<00:02:41.569> crease<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.560> there<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:42.980> you<00:02:43.069> would

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
naturally crease in there and you would

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.770 
naturally crease in there and you would
sort<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.519> have<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> little<00:02:43.910> bit<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.299> buildup

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
sort of have a little bit of a buildup

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.400 
sort of have a little bit of a buildup
in<00:02:45.049> that<00:02:45.230> crease<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:46.600> tend<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.720> use<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:48.049> medium

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
in that crease I tend to use a medium

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.500 
in that crease I tend to use a medium
sort<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:48.950> color<00:02:49.190> here<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:50.030> trick<00:02:50.299> is<00:02:50.480> to

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
sort of color here and the trick is to

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.330 
sort of color here and the trick is to
make<00:02:50.840> sure<00:02:50.870> that<00:02:51.080> it's<00:02:51.440> always<00:02:51.890> blended

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
make sure that it's always blended

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.860 
make sure that it's always blended
through<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.700> crease<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.360> you've<00:02:53.450> got<00:02:53.660> no

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
through the crease so that you've got no

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.800 
through the crease so that you've got no
harsh<00:02:54.140> lines

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.780 

the<00:02:58.810> next<00:02:59.080> step<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.530> locate<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.130> outer<00:03:00.520> be

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
the next step is to locate the outer be

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.080 
the next step is to locate the outer be
this<00:03:01.450> line<00:03:02.200> usually<00:03:02.590> runs<00:03:03.010> up<00:03:03.370> along<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.940> line

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
this line usually runs up along the line

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.180 
this line usually runs up along the line
i've<00:03:04.270> already<00:03:04.420> got<00:03:04.720> from<00:03:04.960> my<00:03:05.230> eye<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.590> eye<00:03:05.920> brow

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
i've already got from my eye to eye brow

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.970 
i've already got from my eye to eye brow
and<00:03:06.520> then<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.150> comes<00:03:07.420> back<00:03:07.630> in<00:03:08.140> along<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.800> edge

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
and then it comes back in along the edge

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.130 
and then it comes back in along the edge
of<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.310> crease<00:03:09.700> it's<00:03:10.330> only<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.720> very<00:03:11.020> small

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
of the crease it's only a very small

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.860 
of the crease it's only a very small
area<00:03:11.830> and<00:03:12.250> usually<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:12.910> want<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.240> apply<00:03:13.570> your

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
area and usually you want to apply your

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.810 
area and usually you want to apply your
darkest<00:03:14.380> color<00:03:14.620> here<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.190> that<00:03:15.340> it<00:03:15.490> really

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
darkest color here so that it really

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.970 
darkest color here so that it really
defines<00:03:16.060> your<00:03:16.480> eye<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.960> it<00:03:17.380> makes<00:03:17.620> your<00:03:17.770> eyes

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
defines your eye and it makes your eyes

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:32.640 
defines your eye and it makes your eyes
appear<00:03:18.610> larger<00:03:31.140> sometimes<00:03:32.140> you<00:03:32.320> can<00:03:32.500> actually

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
appear larger sometimes you can actually

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.580 
appear larger sometimes you can actually
make<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.490> be<00:03:33.730> into<00:03:34.209> a<00:03:34.270> triangle<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.050> fill<00:03:35.410> in

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
make that be into a triangle and fill in

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.380 
make that be into a triangle and fill in
that<00:03:35.740> hole<00:03:35.800> space<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.670> you've<00:03:36.850> got<00:03:36.880> more

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
that hole space so that you've got more

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.420 
that hole space so that you've got more
of<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.540> color<00:03:37.990> concentrated<00:03:38.950> into<00:03:39.130> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
of that color concentrated into the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.580 
of that color concentrated into the
outer<00:03:39.610> edge<00:03:39.910> rather<00:03:40.510> than<00:03:40.810> just<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.290> small

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
outer edge rather than just a small

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:55.310 
outer edge rather than just a small
amount<00:03:41.740> coming<00:03:42.670> up<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.240> along<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.720> crease

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.720 

another<00:03:56.320> look<00:03:56.560> that<00:03:56.770> you<00:03:56.890> might<00:03:57.100> like<00:03:57.130> is<00:03:57.550> to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
another look that you might like is to

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.850 
another look that you might like is to
actually<00:03:57.910> extend<00:03:58.450> that<00:03:58.780> dark<00:03:59.110> color<00:03:59.410> further

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
actually extend that dark color further

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.860 
actually extend that dark color further
along<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.459> crease<00:04:00.730> rather<00:04:01.360> than<00:04:01.600> just

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
along the crease rather than just

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.320 
along the crease rather than just
keeping<00:04:02.350> you<00:04:02.440> in<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.709> confined<00:04:03.190> area<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.910> that

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
keeping you in a confined area and that

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.390 
keeping you in a confined area and that
is<00:04:04.390> going<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.900> make<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.170> I<00:04:05.230> appear<00:04:05.800> even<00:04:06.190> Marge

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
is going to make the I appear even Marge

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.220 
is going to make the I appear even Marge
I<00:04:06.640> it's<00:04:06.880> going<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.120> get<00:04:07.269> more<00:04:07.540> depth<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.959> the

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
I it's going to get more depth to the

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.140 
I it's going to get more depth to the
eye<00:04:08.260> socket<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.100> it's<00:04:09.700> going<00:04:09.850> to<00:04:09.940> give<00:04:10.120> a

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
eye socket and it's going to give a

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.440 
eye socket and it's going to give a
really<00:04:10.480> beautiful<00:04:10.660> look<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:15.910> I<00:04:15.940> already

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
some eyeshadow to the lower lash line I

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.990 
some eyeshadow to the lower lash line I
always<00:04:49.630> begin<00:04:50.110> by<00:04:50.350> applying<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.979> dark<00:04:51.250> color<00:04:51.580> to

always begin by applying a dark color to
the<00:04:52.180> outer<00:04:52.510> third<00:04:53.020> so<00:04:53.440> to<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.860> left<00:04:54.100> hand<00:04:54.310> side

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
the outer third so to the left hand side

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.090 
the outer third so to the left hand side
and<00:04:55.020> usually<00:04:56.020> it's<00:04:56.140> the<00:04:56.320> same<00:04:56.530> color<00:04:56.770> as<00:04:56.950> I

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
and usually it's the same color as I

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.830 
and usually it's the same color as I
applying<00:04:57.490> my<00:04:57.700> outer<00:04:57.880> V<00:04:58.120> just<00:04:58.419> so<00:04:58.570> that<00:04:58.720> it

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
applying my outer V just so that it

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.900 
applying my outer V just so that it
transitions<00:04:59.590> in<00:04:59.770> really<00:05:00.070> nicely

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
transitions in really nicely

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.240 
transitions in really nicely
you<00:05:01.150> then<00:05:01.360> want<00:05:01.390> to<00:05:01.900> apply<00:05:02.230> some<00:05:02.770> lighter

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
you then want to apply some lighter

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.370 
you then want to apply some lighter
eyeshadow<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.300> inner<00:05:04.660> corner<00:05:05.140> of<00:05:05.290> your

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
eye and basically that's just going to

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.330 
eye and basically that's just going to
highlight<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.500> make<00:05:08.710> your<00:05:08.830> eyes<00:05:08.950> appear
