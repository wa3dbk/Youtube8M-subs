00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.800
 when did we get percent in a pool one Android one at that time 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.440
 But often there is already a way I am then 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.250
 initially as a volunteer added so that we already have one 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.100
 a quarter was 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.740
 and in the meantime 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.780
 Staff tests have grown so much that we meanwhile 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.600
 So new solid 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.650
 Forces in the 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.240
 Office in the baskets are in the office in the commercial 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.929
 Area are old 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.309
 The areas do not necessarily portray a visitor within the web 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.510
 his game is on 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.480
 but the limit the game organization of the expiry goal has the say 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.000
 Event area the animals in the office accordingly 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.260
 prepared 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.229
 So the percent 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.840
 the advantage one saves he worked the last one 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.470
 and 12 years we have ascended the first basketball league 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.060
 and thanks to the support of the fun pool of a club where we are today 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.380
 Meanwhile, percent of eighth 70 sponsors 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.240
 apn and 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.060
 Main sponsors here in particular 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.820
 like the EVN and the long-term care insurance or institutes 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.820
 to ensure that success 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.580
 he plays in his direction of building the country in 2004 has become the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.990
 Contact the team again 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.390
 completely changed 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.720
 through the center others and for years the daily contact with the players 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.890
 enjoy the 4 very much and the players also approve 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.940
 So right from the sides 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.500
 Yes, that is the good soul of Barth rushed and I think many have too 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.790
 right then 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.269
 I am very calm what my colleagues also certify me 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.069
 and of course that can be helpful in a variety of ways our sponsors 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.569
 our players on a helper aside we have very good 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.009
 Relationship with the fans for nice constant contact 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:22.479
 I like the main thing Dr at the start of the suggestions has also times 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:23.969
 Criticism was also normal 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:25.869
 He can come by anytime 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:29.789
 Auer with call and so far we clarify much on the short service route and 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.369
 Umea and currently incredibly important 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.729
 what the fans are here 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:37.129
 See Ai AR not just as the Rain Tristan payment method but as part of the 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.129
 whole and I think that we arrived very well 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.409
 around the spectators also very many 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.389
 Volunteers in our book are somewhere between 30 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.430
 and 50 people, however 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.379
 they will not succeed at them 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.519
 and I think it is not high enough to estimate that after today's time 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.479
 People then volunteer 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:20.989
 who work on the success 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.299
 that works too 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.090
 for us as 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.540
 Company to set the same signs as a theme was clearly the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.779
 sustainability 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:33.029
 and that's why we've been around for some time 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:34.190
 all players without 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.519
 Young and also the 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.150
 SEB boss of the center on NaturWatt Strom 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.370
 Watch Dallas just switched us over to power appears there important 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.459
 regenerative energy sources 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.669
 to acquire 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:50.969
 with schnapps foreword until then that's all project we've got in the train 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.379
 to continue Â» 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.609
 Artest Kiss Sion 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.239
 We can also make a contribution 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.689
 the co2 is reduced and have there 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.109
 Minna goalkeeper found a partner 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.850
 in the project competence 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.770
 and we are now so far that we have the Co 2 output percentage of the vehicles 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.480
 our players and also 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.169
 Co2 emissions are generated by energy production from the tissue 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:17.919
 center 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.720
 and for the EWEA Wehner 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.590
 that we can compensate them within the framework of the competence-informed 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.340
 So our claim is obviously much more to do than 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.490
 PS maybe doing all in Alan accruing 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.729
 we want here 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.729
 To further develop and develop talents from the region 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.789
 We'll do that with the many bases in the region 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.249
 Weser and Ems 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.549
 and finally to Herne some years then have the opportunity to have this 

00:04:51.549 --> 00:04:54.599
 Talents Metin the first breed to integrate the team 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:56.300

 m whether sponsor for the insurance Oldenburg the action Zitzmann 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.509
 Teenagers and children between the ages of six and fourteen then have the chance 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.680
 Just look behind the scenes of the boss of the home game and have a 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.449
 Super close contact with the team they run with 2 percent 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.449
 on the field 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.379

 Dubai found a dream job 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:40.430
 So for me personally is convinced 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.430
 more completely crazy bird 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.949

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.610
 the second ballot elected to bring forward 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.669
