00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.029
 after seven generations dedicated to 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.620
 medicine the garcía have come to enter 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.170
 in the guinness book of records 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.230
 even thanks to them was introduced in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.250
 spain neurosurgery 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.250
 martial doctor 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.000
 carlos of command how is it 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.529
 very well one of the members of a saga 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.810
 medical 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:30.789
 yesterday at 2,790 and 1790 cactus and so many has 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.789
 there were seven people who crave 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.820
 and well I'm one more of his uncle 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.129
 introduced neurosurgery in Spain -31 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.140
 and since then we have neurosurgery 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.880
 heavy 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.020
 how many years have you worked as 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.020
 neurosurgeon in this hospital 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.110
 and why are you still coming here man 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.420
 because one has the monkey he can 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.030
 leave it no man apart from that what 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:07.059
 I have been granted the small privilege 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.059
 to be there in the chair of merits 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:19.620
 let's see if we see if there it looks 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.620
 clearly the process of displacement 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.340
 74 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.170
 why 71 years not how much we said more 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.630
 to the conservative to follow the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.270
 complications and fix the one that has already 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.270
 displaced that will continue to embrace 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:37.270
 by the degenerative character 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.580
 neurosurgeons also to both the plan 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.690
 It is a thing that is a reference 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.780
 for many but I value that for me 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.400
 as a service manager 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.400
 It is the best that each city 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.860
 and currently president of the company 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.250
 of neurology you have worked together 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.940
 with Carlos a few years 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.759
 and I in 74 who was still a student of 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.120
 medicine when you arrive at the hospital 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.430
 and Carlos Garcia was the role of 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.530
 surgeon your father were Europeans and 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.910
 how much the career has influenced 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.040
 from your father or your father's work 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.000
 so that you have dedicated yourself to this I 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.390
 I think a lot more besides my father 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.010
 there were four guys children you know new 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.660
 neurology and neurosurgery 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.660
 neurologists and neurosurgeons 5 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.360
 we come to invade your space 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.460
 that's where he works then in the 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.730
 hospital in these two books the hospital 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.250
 valence general of 1500 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:55.940
 500 years of history of sax doctor jj 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:58.730
 what is juan josé garcía rollán is that yes 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.010
 is that your uncle started showing later 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.930
 black then and in the end he realized that 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.660
 had to solve cases that did not 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.660
 they could fix otherwise 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.660
 operating 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.180
 the neurosurgeon who works rather on 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.820
 the family of the saga how many 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.310
 neurosurgeons there is or has been in this 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:26.360
 good family 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:30.140
 2 344 and medical doctors I have it here yes 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.000
 to do this job 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.640
 I made this picture the family tree 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.319
 of the garcía doctors infection is your 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.870
 exact family room here is the 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:43.670
 first that starts in my selection those 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:47.480
 67 second martyr to the psychiatrist in 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.989
 stone third garcia knight and then 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.790
 string me here as continuator of the 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.220
 goal work 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.890
 for all this you are in the book 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.959
 guinness of the records that certifies 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.090
 that the family of doctors with greater 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.769
 tradition is the family barcia of several 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.549
 next days practicing medicine 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:10.580
 since July 2, 1792 for seven 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.790
 generations there was an English family 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.640
 waiter 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:19.150
 but the neighborhoods 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.010
 it is unrepeatable one that is born in this 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.140
 family is the default destination 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.540
 how many operations has this done in its 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.540
 my daughter asked me and she says 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.900
 how many will you have done 4,000 insurance 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.900
 yes 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.870
 40 years 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.870
 multiplied by 100 annually as little 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:45.639
 well we left the hospital we go now 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:50.030
 we go to school guadalaviar and there 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:53.320
 my daughter works as a biology teacher 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.320
 hi how about 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.530
 has been his patient or he will not know about the 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.390
 family history for more or less 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.680
 more or less I know that it's all a 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:15.520
 institution in the general hospital and 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.520
 see you later 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.009
 this is where your matilde daughter works 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.660
 I was not waiting here 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.520
 Hello 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.330
 this welcome 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:37.840
 daughter of doctor garcía if the first thing the 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.539
 first part matilde garcía is from the 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.220
 saga of neurosurgeons and doctors 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:47.020
 many people who have dedicated themselves to 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:50.139
 all this yes very many that was 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.759
 sitting being a doctor yes yes but at 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.960
 final I decided on the pharmacy that 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.110
 it also has to do with the world 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.110
 sanitary 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.160
 the classes and I think your father threw you 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.340
 a hand for some practice shows you 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.340
 help 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.919
 these are his other two children who 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.020
 dictate neuroscience this is the greatest 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.759
 of the children are making a 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.610
 investigation for example here as the 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:22.210
 Alcohol affects the brain young 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:25.080
 we are all going for the same subject 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:28.840
 Carlos Garcia Jorge Gonzalez Barcia 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:32.280
 matilde the three people in the saga who 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.280
 continue with neuroscience 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.730
 if you were not born in the family 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.550
 García you had dedicated to this because 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.320
 I know but in my family since I was little 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.690
 in family conversations in the 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.280
 table noon at night always 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.350
 When my father arrived, he counted 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.630
 anecdotes of his work from the 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:57.580
 operations of the patients of his day to 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:07:01.210
 day and that undoubtedly does not flow 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.980
 leaving it on Sundays in the car 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.730
 we went to the field says yes but before 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:10.780
 how many hospitals have to happen is 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:14.380
 the brain this 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:18.160
 is here in this little figure is the 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:21.310
 pituitary gland which is the gland that governs 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.780
 all of our hormones today is 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.400
 difficult to be a neurosurgeon 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.010
 prepare a lot to be a neurosurgeon 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.010
 you have to be lucky for the first time 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:31.810
 Then luck because there are few places left 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.090
 but before approving the mir with a 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:37.300
 good number so you can can 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:39.810
 choose neurosurgery and center where is 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.810
 train
