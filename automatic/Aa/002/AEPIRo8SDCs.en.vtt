00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
the maiden trim fight of the AMD hawk
with<00:01:29.770> 120-millimeter<00:01:30.810> Danny<00:01:31.810> Mac's<00:01:32.200> fan

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:02:30.830 

sounds<00:01:40.210> good

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:03:43.250 

where'd<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:31.900> go

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.670 

so<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.409> outcome<00:03:44.980> was<00:03:45.750> as<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.930> can<00:03:47.140> see<00:03:47.470> there

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
so the outcome was as you can see there

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.970 
so the outcome was as you can see there
should<00:03:47.829> be<00:03:48.040> our<00:03:48.129> spring<00:03:48.579> here<00:03:49.319> my<00:03:50.319> gear<00:03:50.680> gave

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
should be our spring here my gear gave

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.839 
should be our spring here my gear gave
out<00:03:51.280> so<00:03:52.140> that's<00:03:53.140> what<00:03:53.409> calls<00:03:53.890> to<00:03:54.310> gear<00:03:54.549> a<00:03:54.579> rip

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
out so that's what calls to gear a rip

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.360 
out so that's what calls to gear a rip
out<00:03:55.030> on<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.239> other<00:03:55.359> side<00:03:56.069> should<00:03:57.069> have<00:03:57.280> her

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
out on the other side should have her

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.660 
out on the other side should have her
spring<00:03:57.730> on<00:03:57.939> it<00:03:58.060> like<00:03:58.209> this<00:03:58.450> one<00:03:59.310> the<00:04:00.310> spring

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
spring on it like this one the spring

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.500 
spring on it like this one the spring
came<00:04:00.939> out<00:04:01.269> on<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.019> other<00:04:02.109> side<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:03.180> that's<00:04:04.180> it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
came out on the other side so that's it

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.069 
came out on the other side so that's it
something<00:04:05.260> that<00:04:05.290> can<00:04:05.530> be<00:04:05.709> repaired<00:04:06.840> look<00:04:07.840> for

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
something that can be repaired look for

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.280 
something that can be repaired look for
the<00:04:08.139> next<00:04:08.319> flight<00:04:08.909> of<00:04:09.909> the<00:04:10.090> AMD<00:04:10.569> hawk<00:04:10.840> with<00:04:11.139> the
