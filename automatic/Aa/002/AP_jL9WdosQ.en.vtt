00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
Bruce what is the secret well the secret

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.070 
Bruce what is the secret well the secret
is<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> make<00:01:01.469> sure<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.980> when<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.870> mount<00:01:03.870> your

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is to make sure that when you mount your

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.649 
is to make sure that when you mount your
plug<00:01:04.350> there's<00:01:05.309> three<00:01:05.610> ports<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.180> that

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
plug there's three ports on it that

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.870 
plug there's three ports on it that
allow<00:01:06.930> for<00:01:07.530> three<00:01:07.799> wires<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.340> as<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
allow for three wires and as you see the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480 
allow for three wires and as you see the
wire<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> Vantage<00:01:09.840> motor<00:01:10.110> has<00:01:10.770> also<00:01:11.189> has

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
wire on the Vantage motor has also has

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.840 
wire on the Vantage motor has also has
three<00:01:11.850> wires<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.650> your<00:01:13.830> ground<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
three wires so this is your ground and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.120 
three wires so this is your ground and
that<00:01:15.030> grounds<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.080> entire<00:01:16.409> motor<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.979> both

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
that grounds the entire motor the both

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.950 
that grounds the entire motor the both
the<00:01:17.340> 12-volt<00:01:17.790> system<00:01:18.090> that's<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> motor

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
the 12-volt system that's in the motor

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.130 
the 12-volt system that's in the motor
and<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.680> 36<00:01:20.250> volt<00:01:20.490> system<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.570> yellow<00:01:21.869> wire

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and the 36 volt system this yellow wire

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.530 
and the 36 volt system this yellow wire
is<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:23.070> 12-volt<00:01:23.549> system<00:01:23.790> which<00:01:24.150> makes<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
is the 12-volt system which makes the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
is the 12-volt system which makes the
motor<00:01:24.750> go<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.380> down<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> buttons<00:01:26.610> are

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
motor go up and down and the buttons are

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.429 
motor go up and down and the buttons are
on<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.000> handle<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.990> press<00:01:28.229> those

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
on the handle so when you press those

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
on the handle so when you press those
the<00:01:28.710> voltage<00:01:29.070> goes<00:01:29.310> through<00:01:29.579> there<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.000> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the voltage goes through there and I so

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.090 
the voltage goes through there and I so
it<00:01:30.180> makes<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.479> motor<00:01:30.689> go<00:01:30.900> up<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.200> down<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
it makes your motor go up and down this

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.960 
it makes your motor go up and down this
red<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.880> for<00:01:33.780> 36<00:01:34.320> volts<00:01:34.680> or<00:01:34.920> 36<00:01:35.460> volts<00:01:35.820> is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
red one is for 36 volts or 36 volts is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.030 
red one is for 36 volts or 36 volts is
what<00:01:36.000> drives<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.689> motor<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.140> gives<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> 101

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
what drives the motor to gives it 101

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.990 
what drives the motor to gives it 101
pounds<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.579> thrust

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
pounds of thrust

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.569 
pounds of thrust
so<00:01:39.509> alls<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.840> does<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.229> drive<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.680> motor<00:01:40.890> if

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
so alls it does is drive the motor if

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.609 
so alls it does is drive the motor if
you<00:01:41.850> should<00:01:42.090> happen<00:01:42.299> when<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.170> hooking<00:01:43.470> up

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
you should happen when you're hooking up

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.859 
you should happen when you're hooking up
this<00:01:43.799> plug<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.909> these<00:01:45.090> connections

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
this plug to not get these connections

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.620 
this plug to not get these connections
right<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:47.100> put<00:01:47.369> 36<00:01:47.970> volts<00:01:48.299> through<00:01:48.450> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
right you put 36 volts through that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.319 
right you put 36 volts through that
12-volt<00:01:49.170> wire<00:01:49.979> you're<00:01:50.430> gonna<00:01:50.579> do<00:01:50.790> damage<00:01:51.180> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
12-volt wire you're gonna do damage to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.390

mistake<00:01:59.720> so<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:01.080> best<00:02:01.290> thing<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.560> do<00:02:01.800> is<00:02:02.010> to

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
mistake so the best thing to do is to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.880 
mistake so the best thing to do is to
get<00:02:02.370> yourself<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.850> voltmeter<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:03.710> check<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
get yourself a voltmeter and check the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.650 
get yourself a voltmeter and check the
plug<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.280> make<00:02:05.460> sure<00:02:05.670> when<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.000> comes<00:02:06.270> out<00:02:06.480> that

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
plug to make sure when it comes out that

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.499 
plug to make sure when it comes out that
your<00:02:06.810> plug<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.200> wired<00:02:07.440> to<00:02:08.280> correspond<00:02:08.880> with<00:02:09.119> it

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
your plug is wired to correspond with it

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.550 
your plug is wired to correspond with it
with<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.929> plug<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.830> other<00:02:10.979> side<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.460> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
with the plug on the other side of the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.620 
with the plug on the other side of the
wall<00:02:13.560> here<00:02:13.860> so<00:02:14.730> what<00:02:14.940> we're<00:02:15.090> gonna<00:02:15.150> do<00:02:15.450> is

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
wall here so what we're gonna do is

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.750 
wall here so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:02:15.780> gonna<00:02:15.840> find<00:02:16.500> out<00:02:16.710> where<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.100> 12<00:02:17.400> volts

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
we're gonna find out where the 12 volts

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.810 
we're gonna find out where the 12 volts
is<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.180> where<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.420> 36<00:02:18.990> volts<00:02:19.320> come<00:02:19.740> in<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.700> we

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
is and where the 36 volts come in so we

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.140 
is and where the 36 volts come in so we
have<00:02:20.970> our<00:02:21.090> meter<00:02:21.330> here<00:02:22.460> so<00:02:23.460> we're<00:02:23.640> gonna<00:02:23.790> test

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
have our meter here so we're gonna test

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.250 
have our meter here so we're gonna test
until<00:02:24.600> we<00:02:24.720> find<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.170> proper<00:02:25.530> voltage<00:02:25.709> so

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
until we find the proper voltage so

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.040 
until we find the proper voltage so
right<00:02:28.260> now<00:02:30.709> on<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:31.980> these<00:02:32.910> two<00:02:33.209> terminals<00:02:33.510> we

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
right now on this these two terminals we

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.400 
right now on this these two terminals we
have<00:02:34.290> 11<00:02:34.709> volts<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.480> would<00:02:36.690> make<00:02:36.840> this

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
have 11 volts so that would make this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.740 
have 11 volts so that would make this
one<00:02:37.830> on<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.070> bottom<00:02:38.280> our<00:02:38.670> ground<00:02:39.120> which<00:02:39.720> is

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
one on the bottom our ground which is

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.340 
one on the bottom our ground which is
the<00:02:39.930> black<00:02:40.230> lighter<00:02:40.530> here<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.600> 12<00:02:42.930> volts

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
the black lighter here and the 12 volts

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.760 
the black lighter here and the 12 volts
for<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.740> up<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.610> down<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.090> motor<00:02:45.740> will<00:02:46.740> be

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
for the up and down on the motor will be

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.160 
for the up and down on the motor will be
the<00:02:47.220> yellow<00:02:47.430> wire<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.270> will<00:02:48.450> mount<00:02:48.780> into

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
the yellow wire and it will mount into

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.320 
the yellow wire and it will mount into
here<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.950> this<00:02:50.280> yellow<00:02:50.610> white<00:02:50.880> or<00:02:50.910> yellow

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
here so this this yellow white or yellow

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.300 
here so this this yellow white or yellow
wire<00:02:51.570> goes<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:52.230> they<00:02:52.709> know<00:02:52.860> that<00:02:52.980> it's

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
wire goes to that they know that it's

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.310 
wire goes to that they know that it's
gonna<00:02:53.459> go<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.940> post<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.930> guess<00:02:55.140> by

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
gonna go in that post and I guess by

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.500 
gonna go in that post and I guess by
process<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:56.010> elimination<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.940> way<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.300> the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
process of elimination the way it is the

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.509 
process of elimination the way it is the
next<00:02:57.810> yeah<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.290> always<00:02:58.440> wanted<00:02:58.830> now<00:02:59.010> always<00:02:59.310> 1

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
next yeah you always wanted now always 1

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.100 
next yeah you always wanted now always 1
a<00:02:59.550> double<00:02:59.940> check<00:03:00.180> just<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.480> make<00:03:00.570> sure<00:03:00.900> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
a double check just to make sure the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.710 
a double check just to make sure the
voyage<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.620> proper<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.519> we<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.910> 39<00:03:03.450> volts

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
voyage is proper so we have 39 volts

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.210 
voyage is proper so we have 39 volts
here<00:03:03.989> and<00:03:04.200> that's<00:03:04.320> because<00:03:04.650> your<00:03:04.800> batteries

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
here and that's because your batteries

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.800 
here and that's because your batteries
are<00:03:05.370> new<00:03:05.519> and<00:03:05.730> they're<00:03:05.910> they've<00:03:06.360> got<00:03:06.600> they

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
are new and they're they've got they

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.930 
are new and they're they've got they
before<00:03:07.320> they're<00:03:07.470> fully<00:03:07.680> charged<00:03:08.130> then<00:03:08.790> you'll

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
before they're fully charged then you'll

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.229 
before they're fully charged then you'll
get<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.150> variance<00:03:09.600> between<00:03:09.980> 32<00:03:10.980> or<00:03:11.190> 34<00:03:11.820> volts

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
get a variance between 32 or 34 volts

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.710 
get a variance between 32 or 34 volts
and<00:03:12.450> up<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.870> 39<00:03:13.560> volts<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:14.850> that's<00:03:15.120> that's<00:03:15.570> what

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
and up to 39 volts so that's that's what

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.750 
and up to 39 volts so that's that's what
we're<00:03:15.870> gonna<00:03:15.989> do<00:03:16.230> now<00:03:16.410> is<00:03:16.440> mount<00:03:17.070> that<00:03:17.280> plug<00:03:17.550> on

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
we're gonna do now is mount that plug on

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.100 
we're gonna do now is mount that plug on
here<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.600> we're<00:03:18.720> gonna<00:03:18.810> fire<00:03:19.170> up<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.380> motor

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.110 

so<00:03:26.110> we'll<00:03:26.319> check<00:03:26.470> again<00:03:26.680> for<00:03:27.040> our<00:03:27.340> ground<00:03:27.610> as

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
so we'll check again for our ground as

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:39.420 
so we'll check again for our ground as
being<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.630> black<00:03:34.080> 30<00:03:35.280> 39<00:03:36.280> 39<00:03:36.970> volts<00:03:37.330> and<00:03:38.430> we're

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
being the black 30 39 39 volts and we're

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.520 
being the black 30 39 39 volts and we're
yellow<00:03:39.700> we<00:03:39.970> could<00:03:40.269> see<00:03:41.700> 11<00:03:42.700> bullets<00:03:42.970> Wow

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
yellow we could see 11 bullets Wow

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.250 
yellow we could see 11 bullets Wow
perfect<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.420> should<00:03:46.420> be<00:03:46.450> able<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.900> take<00:03:47.110> our

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
perfect so should be able to take our

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:56.070 
perfect so should be able to take our
handle<00:03:47.620> now
