00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
from the other bridge this is like

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:03.520 
from the other bridge this is like
destroyed<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.200> yeah<00:02:58.540> floaties<00:03:02.380> here's<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
destroyed and yeah floaties here's the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.570 
destroyed and yeah floaties here's the
final<00:03:03.710> slides<00:03:04.250> come<00:03:04.520> down<00:03:04.730> from<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.240> genes

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
final slides come down from the genes

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.120 
final slides come down from the genes
this<00:03:07.580> is<00:03:07.790> this<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.390> like<00:03:08.690> the<00:03:08.990> end<00:03:09.200> game<00:03:09.530> area<00:03:09.920> I

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
this is this is like the end game area I

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.470 
this is this is like the end game area I
think<00:03:11.320> some<00:03:12.320> of<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:13.090> mostly<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.330> end

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
think some of this mostly of the end

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.500 
think some of this mostly of the end
game<00:03:14.600> will<00:03:14.960> be<00:03:15.110> like<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.490> tree<00:03:16.940> but<00:03:17.240> yeah

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
game will be like in the tree but yeah

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.480 
game will be like in the tree but yeah
