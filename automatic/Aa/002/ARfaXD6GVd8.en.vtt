00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.780
 another little traditional in Mexico and very 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.269
 rooted are the gorditas that is with the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.070
 same mass of corn so that they see the 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.000
 importance of the basis of success 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.000
 everything was corn 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.220
 we are going to make it equal to hydrate it with a 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.220
 little oil 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.610
 salt and we will stir it as very well 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.980
 our mass is already made treated with 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.710
 a little oil and here is what 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.860
 let's do let's go on a chubby one 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.500
 chubby that we can have hundreds of 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.470
 fillings can be meat can be that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.890
 that exists is the form and how we are going to 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.190
 do we are going to take a test like this and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.190
 same 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.870
 we're going to do a concave is 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.940
 this figure but here we are going to put 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.850
 as traditional in mexico that is meat 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.330
 of pork that is created its juice and in 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.330
 butter we call it carnitas 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.659
 those carnitas this that is chopped 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.520
 we say crumbs crumbs of carnitas 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.630
 we are going to fill in with this you 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.300
 they have 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.580
 some pork 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.890
 cooked and then spend some oil 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.000
 we can substitute that flavor or if not that 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.310
 that can also be can be chicken or 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.990
 some filler that is dry can not be 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.290
 because it would destroy our 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.740
 our dough would open and it would be watery 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.110
 then what will we do 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.830
 fill it with something dry perfect very 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.680
 well we have our fill we have 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.170
 our stand and with the palm of your hand 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.820
 with the shape of the hand we are going to do 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.490
 this 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.950
 let's wrap if you are watching 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.770
 as it continues wrapping with the dough 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.950
 I'm like pinching doing this until 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.950
 that the mass completely covers our 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.099
 filling 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.720
 and we can do our chubby if 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.580
 we do it only with the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.390
 hand is going to be a little thick but 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.290
 we have the solution in our bag 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.590
 reusable tortillas footmen and 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:31.030
 soups that what I do I 'm going to clap 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.030
 palmer is doing this 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.160
 I'm going to give you a round shape and 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.380
 also thick when I know that I can no longer 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.520
 palmear the most when you start again 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.520
 it would be the filling 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.660
 coordination 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:15.460
 the same and when they start using 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.860
 inside that to say that they are already 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.160
 our favorite gorditas when I'm 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.010
 finished let's really see the point 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.830
 which we can open the very easily 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.830
 and if the seeds the insurance is done 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.090
 is 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.090
 let's put on a plate 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.410
 let's make an easy 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.540
 Y 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.830
 and he would have grown is done 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.830
 and has 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:10.300
 and we will accompany it 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.300
 with everything 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.890
 and her 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.690
 can not pass here 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.340
 and we have a lot of consistency and flavor 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.900
 very nice 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.900
 well, we have something refreshing 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.240
 and good 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.159
 and good 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.159
 it is clear 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.430
 we have the same technique as the first 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:03.439
 White 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:08.089
 what 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.800
 and here we are going to fill it 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.300
 nothing 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:40.650
 really what can be green 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.990
 obviously with a little sauce 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.110
 for money 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.740
 chubby girl 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.740
 the version of the folios
