00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
thought I might as well do a little bit

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.200 
thought I might as well do a little bit
of<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.890> tour<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.460> same<00:00:29.670> texture<00:00:30.119> but

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
of a tour on the same texture but

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.669 
of a tour on the same texture but
there's<00:00:30.330> two<00:00:30.510> other<00:00:30.720> texture<00:00:31.080> packs<00:00:31.320> as<00:00:31.500> well

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679

I use the most I like the way the
glowstone<00:01:14.159> looks<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.030> most<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> time

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
glowstone looks this is most of the time

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.730 
glowstone looks this is most of the time
I<00:01:15.960> built<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.439> was<00:01:16.680> on<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:18.320> even<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.560> go

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
I built this was on that even if we go

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
I built this was on that even if we go
over<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.189> more<00:01:20.460> natural<00:01:20.880> area<00:01:21.210> say<00:01:21.509> over

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
over to a more natural area say over

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.960 
over to a more natural area say over
here<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:24.710> bedrock<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.920> nice<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.460> black<00:01:26.640> which

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
here the bedrock is nice and black which

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
here the bedrock is nice and black which
is<00:01:27.090> what<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.270> use<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.540> my<00:01:27.780> walls<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.409> find<00:01:29.220> out

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
is what I use for my walls here find out

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.710 
is what I use for my walls here find out
when<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> switch<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> out<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.420> texture

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
when I switch it out of this texture

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.410 
when I switch it out of this texture
pack<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.500> bedrock<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.700> black<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.270> this

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
pack the bedrock is not as black as this

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
pack the bedrock is not as black as this
which<00:01:33.659> means<00:01:33.810> doesn't<00:01:34.170> make<00:01:34.259> us<00:01:34.409> look<00:01:34.530> as<00:01:34.710> cool

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
which means doesn't make us look as cool

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
which means doesn't make us look as cool
but<00:01:35.000> if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> look<00:01:36.329> everything<00:01:36.630> has<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:37.470> of

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
but if you look everything has more of

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.700 
but if you look everything has more of
like<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.100> guess<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> city<00:01:38.729> texture<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.710> this

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
like a I guess a city texture to it this

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.200 
like a I guess a city texture to it this
is<00:01:40.770> my<00:01:41.130> favorite<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.640> all<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.880> them<00:01:42.060> this

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
is my favorite out of all of them this

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.940 
is my favorite out of all of them this
is<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> one<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.540> play<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:42.960> day<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> day<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.530> even

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
is the one I play with day to day I even

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.740 
is the one I play with day to day I even
find<00:01:44.189> when<00:01:44.430> when<00:01:44.850> looking<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> different

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
find when when looking at the different

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.440 
find when when looking at the different
ores<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.409> whatnot<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.939> look<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.329> them

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
ores and whatnot if you look at them

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.700 
ores and whatnot if you look at them
they're<00:01:48.600> pretty<00:01:48.720> straightforward<00:01:49.079> easy<00:01:49.500> to

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
they're pretty straightforward easy to

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.350 
they're pretty straightforward easy to
see<00:01:49.950> when<00:01:50.250> you're<00:01:50.399> mining<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.090> don't<00:01:51.240> have

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
see when you're mining you don't have

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.710 
see when you're mining you don't have
