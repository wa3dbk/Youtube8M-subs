00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.220
 or welcome to this video I'll go 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.350
 show an excellent product that are 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.950
 more than a thousand models of folding in 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.900
 you can create thumbnails 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.269
 beautiful, how are you, bmw? 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.090
 made entirely of paper 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.990
 Do you have the models ready so far? 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.510
 records 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.150
 just get it printed on your 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.840
 common printer and you can then 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.820
 necklace 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.640
 it shows the tabs where you go 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.650
 paste is a very simple process 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.739
 you print on your printer is on 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.570
 paper or if you prefer a paper 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.940
 a little thicker you can buy 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.610
 on any stationery and so you create 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.770
 fully miniature toys 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.920
 made on paper that are the wheels of 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.149
 bmw the capo all in rich detail 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.489
 on a natural scale nÃ© were to get a bmw 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.460
 they actually did the measurements and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.329
 reduced to a small 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.910
 paper 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.850
 so you have quite an object 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.670
 proportional to the actual size 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.770
 the result will be thumbnails like these 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.439
 and there are many models of cars 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.549
 different models of airplanes and we will see 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.380
 here for example the model of f 14 is that 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.780
 you can mount your home children 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.060
 they love this type of activity 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.570
 so it's a way for you to come back to the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.150
 childhood and will use the child 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.340

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.640
