 centimeters wide and 25 centimeters 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:39.310
 long to be able to elaborate what are the 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.910
 little flowers for the bow here we have 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.870

 this tour can get it mesh by 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.570
 meters so that they can elaborate the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.379
 monkey here I have a strip of 25 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.080
 centimeters wide and 45 centimeters 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.590

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.840
 I had the nice bun 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.120
 then we are going to do it this way 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.280
 to make the bow we are going to 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.229
 fold the tulle in half 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.229
 and we are going to start forming 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.950
 here I already have a rectangle of our 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.259
 of our tulle 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.210
 with our hand we are going to help and 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.430
 we started doing some folds in the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:32.870
 center to form what is 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.870
 our bow tie 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:45.490
 here I have a needle with the thread and we're going 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.490
 to start giving a few dates 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.460
 we cut and organize 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.860
 our bun 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.039
 which is going to be the base to place 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.409
 our flowers we have here 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.310

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.280
 very easy simple use cloth 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.819
 satin that is thin we doubled a 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.710
 Poquitico la punta 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.500
 we turn to the center 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.890
 and we started to sew all over the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.890
 selvedge 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.400
 before we finish we're going to in the part 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.530
 final make a fold so that we 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.069
 The meetings of the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.069
 little flower 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.310
 and we have 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.210
 all our fabric in the thread we start to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.450
 function and let's start from the part 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:08.780
 initial to bend forming our 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.780
 flower something very simple very easy 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.880
 when we have screwed it together 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.880
 let's make some stitches 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.250
 so that we are not going to release the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.250
 little flower 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.280
 do not 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.700
 d 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.700
 here we have already elaborated our flower 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.320
 if you can observe it 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.709
 what are we going to do already having the two 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.730
 little flowers that we are going to place our 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.250
 monkey 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.120
 we will use the same tone tape 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.810
 our tulle we put a little bit of 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.810
 silicone 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.090
 we put the tape 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.189
 to cover what the seam or thread 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.400
 you find in their homes they do it with 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.850
 more care so that they are left 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.300
 much nicer and we have here the base 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.770
 of our bun we have to paste 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.710
 our little flowers we put 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.870
 good silicone I advise you to 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.419
 that the silicone is not released 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.780
 heat about 15 minutes before the 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.340
 gun that is hot and not 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.639
 do not let us take off our 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.639
 flowers 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.050
 here in the center we are going to place the 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.500
 two little flowers that we made of fabric 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.720
 look how this mode looks beautiful and 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:04.770
 to finish you can get 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.750
 or buy some pebbles and put him 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.960
 with glue 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.550
 to brighten our bows 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.270
 we hope this idea this has not been 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.040
 liked until a next opportunity 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.630

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.320
 we invite you to wait for our next
