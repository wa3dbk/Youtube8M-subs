 USB that can turn red this one 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.400
 will spend three times more 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.740
 the energy is sv let's assume it goes 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.660
 connect the front of the cabinet and 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.940

 connect to the front of the case and 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.150
 recharge three times faster 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.570
