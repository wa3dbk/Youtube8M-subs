fire-breathing machine that is built

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.259 
fire-breathing machine that is built
both<00:00:17.619> for<00:00:18.039> the<00:00:18.099> street<00:00:18.400> and<00:00:18.580> for<00:00:18.970> the<00:00:19.029> track

both for the street and for the track

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.749 
both for the street and for the track
right<00:00:19.509> Russ<00:00:19.720> that's<00:00:20.289> right<00:00:20.589> whether<00:00:21.130> you<00:00:21.429> like

to write on the track the street or both
in<00:00:24.039> many<00:00:24.220> cases<00:00:24.669> the<00:00:25.089> Ninja<00:00:25.480> zx-10r<00:00:26.080> is<00:00:26.289> going

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:26.529 
in many cases the Ninja zx-10r is going

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.439 
in many cases the Ninja zx-10r is going
to<00:00:26.589> be<00:00:26.740> really<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.400> bike<00:00:27.550> of<00:00:27.699> choice<00:00:27.730> for<00:00:28.060> you

to be really the bike of choice for you

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.999 
to be really the bike of choice for you
actually<00:00:28.960> in<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.230> configuration<00:00:29.619> it<00:00:29.949> is

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
actually in the configuration it is

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.550 
actually in the configuration it is
right<00:00:30.220> now<00:00:30.339> you<00:00:30.400> notice<00:00:30.849> we<00:00:30.970> have<00:00:31.119> no<00:00:31.560> blinkers

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
right now you notice we have no blinkers

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.810 
right now you notice we have no blinkers
here<00:00:32.950> and<00:00:33.130> no<00:00:33.280> mirrors<00:00:33.640> with<00:00:33.790> integrated

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
design of the zx-10r isn't it oh

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.910 
design of the zx-10r isn't it oh
absolutely<00:00:37.840> we<00:00:38.170> know<00:00:38.410> that<00:00:38.560> a<00:00:38.590> lot<00:00:38.710> of<00:00:38.830> our

bike on the street want to come out and

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.800 
bike on the street want to come out and
try<00:00:42.760> track<00:00:43.120> day<00:00:43.300> or<00:00:43.450> maybe<00:00:43.630> they're

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
try track day or maybe they're

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.150 
try track day or maybe they're
accomplished<00:00:44.200> track<00:00:44.380> day<00:00:44.500> riders<00:00:44.770> so<00:00:44.950> we've

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
accomplished track day riders so we've

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.880 
accomplished track day riders so we've
made<00:00:45.430> the<00:00:45.610> zx-10r<00:00:46.120> very<00:00:46.600> easy<00:00:46.840> to<00:00:47.320> transform

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
made the zx-10r very easy to transform

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.070 
made the zx-10r very easy to transform
for<00:00:48.190> either<00:00:48.340> use<00:00:48.670> come<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.330> track<00:00:49.510> loss

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
for either use come to the track loss

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.630 
for either use come to the track loss
the<00:00:50.230> mirrors<00:00:50.470> pull<00:00:51.010> off<00:00:51.130> the<00:00:51.280> rear<00:00:51.430> tail

on<00:00:58.270> the<00:00:58.360> zx-10r<00:00:58.810> tell<00:00:59.080> us<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.200> little<00:00:59.320> bit<00:00:59.440> about

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
on the zx-10r tell us a little bit about

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.870 
on the zx-10r tell us a little bit about
that<00:00:59.770> absolutely<00:00:59.890> those<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.580> you<00:01:00.700> who<00:01:00.760> have

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
that absolutely those of you who have

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.700 
that absolutely those of you who have
seen<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.210> 2009<00:01:01.870> will<00:01:02.170> notice<00:01:02.470> a<00:01:02.530> slight

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
seen the 2009 will notice a slight

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.540 
seen the 2009 will notice a slight
difference<00:01:02.740> in<00:01:03.130> the<00:01:03.220> front<00:01:03.430> of<00:01:03.490> the

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
difference in the front of the

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.250 
difference in the front of the
motorcycle<00:01:03.790> we've<00:01:04.210> taken<00:01:04.510> a<00:01:04.629> lot<00:01:04.720> of<00:01:04.780> the<00:01:04.930> cues

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
motorcycle we've taken a lot of the cues

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.760 
motorcycle we've taken a lot of the cues
and<00:01:05.470> design<00:01:05.740> features<00:01:06.220> from<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:07.530> zx6r<00:01:08.530> and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
and design features from the zx6r and

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.370 
and design features from the zx6r and
incorporated<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:09.430> into<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.700> 2010<00:01:10.510> zx-10r

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
incorporated it into the 2010 zx-10r

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.500 
incorporated it into the 2010 zx-10r
so<00:01:11.620> an<00:01:11.890> overall<00:01:12.190> smaller<00:01:12.640> fairing<00:01:13.090> package<00:01:13.390> in

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
so an overall smaller fairing package in

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.060 
so an overall smaller fairing package in
the<00:01:13.570> front<00:01:13.840> it<00:01:14.140> looks<00:01:14.590> like<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.800> lighter

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
the front it looks like a lighter

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.610 
the front it looks like a lighter
motorcycle<00:01:15.820> so<00:01:16.540> in<00:01:16.630> addition<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:17.080> that<00:01:17.230> we

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
motorcycle so in addition to that we

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.649 
motorcycle so in addition to that we
have<00:01:17.830> an<00:01:18.220> updated<00:01:18.580> steering<00:01:18.970> damper<00:01:19.120> up<00:01:19.390> here

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
have an updated steering damper up here

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.440 
have an updated steering damper up here
so<00:01:20.050> that<00:01:20.080> improves<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:21.550> adjustability<00:01:22.090> for

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
so that improves the adjustability for

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.780 
so that improves the adjustability for
the<00:01:22.600> rider<00:01:22.780> they're<00:01:23.110> gone<00:01:24.070> ahead<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.340> improve

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
the rider they're gone ahead and improve

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.450 
the rider they're gone ahead and improve
the<00:01:24.940> shifting<00:01:25.330> mechanism<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.070> bike<00:01:27.220> so

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
the shifting mechanism of the bike so

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.790 
the shifting mechanism of the bike so
smoother<00:01:27.850> shifting<00:01:28.210> action<00:01:28.570> for<00:01:28.780> 2010<00:01:29.530> the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
smoother shifting action for 2010 the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.100 
smoother shifting action for 2010 the
titanium<00:01:30.700> exhaust<00:01:30.850> has<00:01:31.390> been<00:01:31.420> also<00:01:31.780> changing

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
titanium exhaust has been also changing

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.570 
titanium exhaust has been also changing
up<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.200> new<00:01:32.320> dimpled<00:01:32.620> finish<00:01:32.890> an<00:01:33.250> overall

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
up a new dimpled finish an overall

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.770 
up a new dimpled finish an overall
smaller<00:01:33.880> look<00:01:34.090> to<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.270> exhaust<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:34.659> that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
smaller look to the exhaust so that

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.240 
smaller look to the exhaust so that
approves<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.200> handling<00:01:35.470> applicability<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.190> the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
approves a handling applicability of the
