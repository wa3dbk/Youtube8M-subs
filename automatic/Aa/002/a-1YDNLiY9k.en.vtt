cut this longer than you need because

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.350 
cut this longer than you need because

you can always cut some off once it's

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
you can always cut some off once it's
baked<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.930> can't<00:01:49.200> add<00:01:49.470> any<00:01:49.740> more<00:01:49.979> pop<00:01:50.369> it

brown once it's completely cooled you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.020 
brown once it's completely cooled you
can<00:01:58.649> pick<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.280> size<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.969> up

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
can pick it up and just size it up

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.819 
can pick it up and just size it up
against<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> side<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.630> your<00:02:00.899> cake<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.590> don't

want it to be too long or it'll be too
top-heavy<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:03.960> I'm<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> cut<00:02:04.409> mine<00:02:04.590> off

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
top-heavy so I'm going to cut mine off

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.800 
top-heavy so I'm going to cut mine off
about<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.969> comes<00:02:06.149> down<00:02:06.360> quite<00:02:06.780> a

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
about here so that it comes down quite a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.779 
about here so that it comes down quite a
bit<00:02:07.049> shorter<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.740> cake<00:02:08.039> make<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> cut

watertight and it's not gonna absorb

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:23.020 
watertight and it's not gonna absorb
moisture<00:02:21.349> from<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.859> cake<00:02:22.099> making<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.700> soggy

moisture from the cake making it soggy

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.239 
moisture from the cake making it soggy
now<00:02:23.689> you<00:02:23.780> want<00:02:24.049> to<00:02:24.170> use<00:02:24.319> your<00:02:24.439> edible<00:02:24.889> marker

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:25.249

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
and I just marked out sort of even

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.800 
and I just marked out sort of even
intervals<00:02:28.310> along<00:02:28.609> the<00:02:28.909> way<00:02:29.239> so<00:02:29.299> I've<00:02:29.629> got

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
intervals along the way so I've got

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.289 
intervals along the way so I've got
seven<00:02:30.260> colors<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:30.829> need<00:02:31.040> seven<00:02:31.549> lines<00:02:31.909> so<00:02:32.269> I

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
seven colors I need seven lines so I

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.789 
seven colors I need seven lines so I
want<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.599> make<00:02:32.750> sure<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:33.109> I<00:02:33.170> kind<00:02:33.469> of<00:02:33.590> keep

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
want to make sure that I kind of keep

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.009 
want to make sure that I kind of keep
each<00:02:33.950> color<00:02:34.310> about<00:02:34.579> the<00:02:34.790> same<00:02:35.030> width<00:02:35.329> to<00:02:35.780> apply

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
each color about the same width to apply

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.780 
each color about the same width to apply
my<00:02:36.170> standing<00:02:36.620> sugar<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.040> started<00:02:37.639> with<00:02:37.760> a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
my standing sugar I started with a

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.759 
my standing sugar I started with a
paintbrush<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.599> just<00:02:38.870> painted<00:02:39.349> a<00:02:39.469> little

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
paintbrush and just painted a little

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.830 
paintbrush and just painted a little
section<00:02:40.159> and<00:02:40.310> then<00:02:40.579> place<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.359> sanding<00:02:41.810> sugar

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
section and then place the sanding sugar

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.140 
section and then place the sanding sugar
on<00:02:42.200> top<00:02:42.230> kind<00:02:42.709> of<00:02:42.859> sprinkled<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.519> but<00:02:43.969> this

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
on top kind of sprinkled it but this

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.309 
on top kind of sprinkled it but this
actually<00:02:44.419> proved<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:44.959> bit<00:02:45.079> problematic

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
actually proved a bit problematic

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.649 
actually proved a bit problematic
because<00:02:45.889> my<00:02:46.040> chocolate<00:02:46.519> was<00:02:46.669> drying<00:02:47.060> too<00:02:47.389> fast

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
because my chocolate was drying too fast

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:49.750 
because my chocolate was drying too fast
so<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:47.959> switched<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.439> the<00:02:48.530> ziploc<00:02:49.010> bag<00:02:49.280> method

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
so I switched to the ziploc bag method

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.159 
so I switched to the ziploc bag method
so<00:02:50.180> put<00:02:50.359> some<00:02:50.480> white<00:02:50.629> chocolate<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:51.079> the

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:51.169 
so put some white chocolate in the

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.559 
so put some white chocolate in the
ziplock<00:02:51.469> bag<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.010> snip<00:02:52.159> off<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.549> very<00:02:52.849> fine<00:02:53.239> tip

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
ziplock bag and snip off a very fine tip

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.119 
ziplock bag and snip off a very fine tip
and<00:02:53.719> rather<00:02:54.230> than<00:02:54.439> paint<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.799> down<00:02:54.949> with<00:02:55.069> the

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
and rather than paint you down with the

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.000 
and rather than paint you down with the
paintbrush<00:02:55.519> squirt<00:02:56.449> on<00:02:56.780> some<00:02:57.169> of<00:02:57.319> that<00:02:57.500> white

paintbrush squirt on some of that white

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.610 
paintbrush squirt on some of that white
chocolate<00:02:58.280> using<00:02:58.879> your<00:02:59.359> ziplock<00:02:59.719> bag<00:02:59.959> try<00:03:00.560> to

chocolate using your ziplock bag try to
roughly<00:03:01.069> follow<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.609> lines<00:03:01.819> that<00:03:02.060> you've

at the line of the color that it
corresponds<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:02.879> your<00:05:03.000> red<00:05:03.180> skittle<00:05:03.509> goes

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
chosen design here looks amazing but

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.839 
chosen design here looks amazing but
does<00:05:10.020> require<00:05:10.379> a<00:05:10.500> bit<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.889> time<00:05:11.279> in<00:05:11.310> skittle

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
does require a bit of time in skittle

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.760 
does require a bit of time in skittle
placing<00:05:12.330> probably<00:05:12.659> about<00:05:12.870> 30<00:05:13.139> to<00:05:13.319> 40<00:05:13.650> minutes

you the time in separating them within a
KitKat<00:05:41.460> cake<00:05:41.939> it's<00:05:42.120> best<00:05:42.360> to<00:05:42.449> have<00:05:42.539> ribbon

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
KitKat cake it's best to have ribbon

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.719 
KitKat cake it's best to have ribbon
around<00:05:43.199> the<00:05:43.500> outside<00:05:43.889> which<00:05:44.099> covers<00:05:44.580> up<00:05:44.699> the

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
around the outside which covers up the

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.279 
around the outside which covers up the
line<00:05:45.120> that<00:05:45.449> you<00:05:45.539> get<00:05:45.689> in<00:05:45.779> the<00:05:45.870> middle<00:05:46.020> of<00:05:46.169> a

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
line that you get in the middle of a

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.139 
line that you get in the middle of a
KitKat<00:05:46.500> family<00:05:47.069> block<00:05:47.279> but<00:05:47.460> it<00:05:47.550> also<00:05:47.699> holds

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:48.149 
KitKat family block but it also holds

00:05:48.149 --> 00:05:50.089 
KitKat family block but it also holds
everything<00:05:48.389> together<00:05:48.599> so<00:05:48.990> I<00:05:49.139> opted<00:05:49.529> for<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.800> red

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:50.099 
everything together so I opted for a red

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.070 
everything together so I opted for a red
ribbon<00:05:50.339> with<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:50.639> nice<00:05:50.849> big<00:05:51.149> red<00:05:51.330> bow<00:05:51.569> which

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
ribbon with a nice big red bow which

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.540 
ribbon with a nice big red bow which
matches<00:05:52.319> in<00:05:52.589> with<00:05:52.710> are<00:05:52.830> skittles<00:05:53.159> wrappers

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
matches in with are skittles wrappers

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.790 
matches in with are skittles wrappers
the<00:05:54.089> final<00:05:54.509> part<00:05:54.750> of<00:05:54.899> our<00:05:55.020> cake<00:05:55.289> and<00:05:55.319> I<00:05:55.560> think

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
the final part of our cake and I think

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.740 
the final part of our cake and I think
the<00:05:55.919> most<00:05:56.069> impressive<00:05:56.520> is<00:05:56.789> taking<00:05:57.240> one<00:05:57.719> of

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
the most impressive is taking one of

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.779 
the most impressive is taking one of
those<00:05:58.050> empty<00:05:58.349> skittles<00:05:58.949> wrappers<00:05:59.250> so<00:05:59.279> be<00:05:59.580> nice

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
those empty skittles wrappers so be nice

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.879 
those empty skittles wrappers so be nice
when<00:06:00.089> you<00:06:00.180> open<00:06:00.509> them<00:06:00.659> you<00:06:01.080> want<00:06:01.259> to<00:06:01.319> paint<00:06:01.620> in

when you open them you want to paint in

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.649 
when you open them you want to paint in
