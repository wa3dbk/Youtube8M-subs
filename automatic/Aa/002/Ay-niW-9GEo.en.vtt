you've got over a year and for the Grand
Prix<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.430> think<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.150> we<00:04:02.329> are<00:04:02.360> probably<00:04:02.840> very

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
Prix I think that we are probably very

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.640 
Prix I think that we are probably very
tight<00:04:04.700> on<00:04:05.269> time<00:04:06.310> being<00:04:07.310> perfectly<00:04:07.790> candid<00:04:08.060> but

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
tight on time being perfectly candid but

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.690 
tight on time being perfectly candid but
we'll<00:04:09.650> have<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:09.829> Grand<00:04:10.070> Prix<00:04:10.250> mixture<00:04:10.579> in

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
we'll have a Grand Prix mixture in

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.610 
we'll have a Grand Prix mixture in
November<00:04:11.299> all<00:04:12.110> right<00:04:12.230> what<00:04:12.350> we're<00:04:12.470> going<00:04:12.590> to

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
November all right what we're going to

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.850 
November all right what we're going to
do<00:04:12.709> here<00:04:12.950> is<00:04:13.850> I<00:04:14.150> feel<00:04:14.329> that<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:15.260> camera<00:04:15.620> shots

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
do here is I feel that the camera shots

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.349 
do here is I feel that the camera shots
don't<00:04:16.010> really<00:04:16.310> do<00:04:16.459> this<00:04:16.640> steepness<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.299> the

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
don't really do this steepness of the

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.860 
don't really do this steepness of the
hill<00:04:17.450> up<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.500> turn<00:04:18.680> more<00:04:18.890> injustice<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:20.600> this

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
hill up to turn more injustice so this

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.840 
hill up to turn more injustice so this
is<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.079> technical<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.859> very<00:04:22.250> scientific

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
is a technical and very scientific

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.890 
is a technical and very scientific
experiment<00:04:23.390> to<00:04:23.450> see<00:04:23.600> just<00:04:23.840> how<00:04:23.900> much<00:04:24.580> speed
