00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.299
 Today I make delicious vegetables and chips 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.770
 although from butternut pumpkin 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.570
 I still have a pumpkin from the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.090
 Winter camp as slow as you get here 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.139
 sees a few spots and gets 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.540
 that's why it's fast now 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.190
 processed I show you in this 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.500
 video a total of four different 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.500
 Varieties of pumpkin chips and pumpkin 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.150
 I cut the pumpkin to dice 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.150
 first apart and take that 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.010
 core case out there my pumpkin already 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.130
 I have a few unsightly places 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.130
 him 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.020
 for the pumpkin chips I cut with 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.660
 the vegetable slicer thin strips 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.950
 now the marinade comes to that fact 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.450
 very simple oil 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.680
 You can also take olive oil 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.750
 but I take it 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.440
 tasteless oil in this case and 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:59.059
 The rapeseed oil for me then comes salt 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:02.989
 with freshly ground pepper and one 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.170
 garana salad mix that gives the chips 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.820
 an exotic note you can too 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.130
 use any other spice for 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.509
 for example, paprika or a chili or her 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.509
 Simply put a weight on the salt pepper 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.430
 Mix the marinade is now with the 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.520
 chips mixed well so that all 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.020
 stripes are covered with nice 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.200
 the vegetable strips are now on the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.970
 floors of the vending machine distributed in case 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.890
 you have no vending machine you can 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.950
 the vegetable strips also in the oven 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.890
 just dry on a grate with 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.399
 baking paper at 50 degrees several hours 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.500
 long drying but looks from time to time 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.350
 The baskets do not burn 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.780
 They should be crispy at the end 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.780
 golden brown but definitely not too dark 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.240
 now comes the lid on top and the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.590
 Automat is started the pumpkins 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.000
 Chips are pretty thin because of that 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.080
 they probably just need it 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.080
 between four and five hours 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.739
 in the meantime, I'm doing mine 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.700
 pumpkin cubes I cut the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.440
 remaining pumpkin in small cubes for 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.489
 our second variant is dry me 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.489
 just the small cut 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.220
 pumpkin cubes I do not use any 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.400
 spices or other ingredients but 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.930
 really only the pumpkin this variant 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.319
 is great for example for 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.319
 cereal 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.060
 for my third variant, I make one 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.530
 marinade of lemon juice and honey that 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.400
 enters the pumpkin fritter afterwards 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.390
 really fresh and slightly sweet note 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.290
 just the juice of half a lemon 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.459
 Add some liquid honey 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.120
 Mix everything well and something 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.120
 let it through 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.950
 after a few hours of drying time 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.690
 now the gourds are ready 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.430
 have become pretty crispy and 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.590
 really tasty with the marinade 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.609
 delicious 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.409
 However, I had a little too much oil 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.690
 So you better used it 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.260
 less oil then the chips are off 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.260
 crispy 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.120
 now the automat is free again and 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.409
 I can distribute my pumpkin cubes 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.090
 so that my three variants are not 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.140
 namely mix for each variant 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.140
 a floor 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.950
 and now comes the same 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.780
 fourth variant also pumpkin cubes with 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.870
 lemon juice and honey I give now 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.060
 something all cinnamon added amends 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.020
 Stir and mix on this 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.850
 one of the floors distribute the 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.560
 Pumpkin cubes may need something 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.480
 longer than the pumpkin chips because they are 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.340
 thicker so everything is well distributed lid 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.670
 go on and go the drying 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.670
 process 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.830
 The pumpkin cubes are ready after the 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.720
 Drying time, they are very small 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.259
 become and really nice and tight 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.259
 crispy
