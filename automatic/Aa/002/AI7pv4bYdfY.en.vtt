00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 as soon as an advertisement appeared in our 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.130
 life especially television I started it 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.200
 comment parody make fun and 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.980
 released a lot of fillet tones two dozen 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.580
 fillet tones with only one purpose for me 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.060
 there was one most important task 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.970
 remove annoyance to advertise fun 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.210
 for you to see her and remember my 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.940
 a parody so she somehow amused you 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.829
 because advertising breaks into the inadequate 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.309
 time especially when we are not used to it 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.260
 It was at the beginning of the 90s that meant this 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.360
 was doing and I did but in one 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.039
 beautiful moment i thought well 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.149
 how much can this one form 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.469
 to exploit and here the bill is not for me 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:56.090
 enough I need to take a look at 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.520
 advertising in terms of trusting 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.210
 naive person because we are Soviet 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.680
 times used to believe 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.189
 printed believe that by 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.619
 TV we are told we are accustomed 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.790
 it sits in our mentality 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.630
 and I wanted to take a look 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.159
 in this way and thus 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.890
 sympathize with this man and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.310
 explain to him that you really do not need 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:32.810
 trust seriously and this story was born 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:36.180
 I wake up in the morning looking at the street 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.320
 huge billboard restored ad 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.250
 it says it 's time for you to rest on 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.170
 bermudas 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.170
 call them and send you 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.820
 Well, I think it is necessary as she cares no-till 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.130

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.979
