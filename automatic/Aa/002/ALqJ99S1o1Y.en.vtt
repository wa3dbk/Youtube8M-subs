looks really great Bremen has these
little<00:02:13.300> grab<00:02:13.630> handles<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.350> them<00:02:15.630> as<00:02:16.630> the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
little grab handles to them as the

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.559 
little grab handles to them as the
driver<00:02:17.470> for<00:02:17.860> boards<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:21.269> one<00:02:22.269> of<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.420> other

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
driver for boards on it one of the other

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.360 
driver for boards on it one of the other
things<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:22.900> Lehman<00:02:23.769> does<00:02:23.950> when<00:02:24.160> they<00:02:24.220> do

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
things that Lehman does when they do

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.479 
things that Lehman does when they do
these<00:02:24.459> conversion<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.239> they<00:02:25.480> change<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
these conversion is they change the

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.830 
these conversion is they change the
triple<00:02:27.489> clamps<00:02:27.850> these<00:02:28.120> pieces<00:02:28.420> right<00:02:28.780> here

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
triple clamps these pieces right here

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.320 
triple clamps these pieces right here
and<00:02:29.350> here<00:02:29.800> that<00:02:29.950> actually<00:02:30.700> change<00:02:31.030> them<00:02:31.239> as

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
and here that actually change them as

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.390 
and here that actually change them as
they<00:02:31.569> put<00:02:31.989> it<00:02:32.110> they<00:02:32.290> change<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.800> degree'<00:02:33.130> arm

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
they put it they change the degree' arm

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.550 
they put it they change the degree' arm
so<00:02:33.640> there's<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.819> little<00:02:33.970> bit<00:02:34.060> more<00:02:34.150> rake<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.230> it

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
so there's a little bit more rake and it

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.020 
so there's a little bit more rake and it
which<00:02:35.709> means<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.190> fork<00:02:36.580> has<00:02:36.760> pushed

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
which means that that fork has pushed

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.140 
which means that that fork has pushed
out<00:02:37.350> more<00:02:38.350> this<00:02:39.190> away<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:40.630> away<00:02:42.030> compared<00:02:43.030> to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
out more this away this away compared to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.880 
out more this away this away compared to
stock<00:02:43.450> which<00:02:43.780> helps<00:02:44.110> with<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.350> handling<00:02:44.739> and

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
stock which helps with the handling and

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.009 
stock which helps with the handling and
they<00:02:45.370> also<00:02:45.549> add<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.850> steering<00:02:46.269> stabilizer<00:02:46.420> and

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
they also add a steering stabilizer and

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.140 
they also add a steering stabilizer and
he's<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.410> really<00:02:47.739> I'm<00:02:47.860> not<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.130> huge<00:02:48.760> trike

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
he's just really I'm not a huge trike

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.539 
he's just really I'm not a huge trike
fan<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.630> be<00:02:49.720> honest<00:02:50.079> but<00:02:50.620> these<00:02:51.100> really

four boards there that we talked about

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.920 
four boards there that we talked about
with<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.579> heel-toe<00:03:28.000> shifter<00:03:28.480> on<00:03:28.599> this<00:03:28.750> other

things that Lehman adds is a parking

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.259 
things that Lehman adds is a parking
brake<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.980> this<00:03:36.370> is<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.609> parking<00:03:37.030> brake<00:03:37.239> and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
just put that down and it latches it

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.080 
just put that down and it latches it
just<00:03:40.629> pick<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.810> up<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.170> undo<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:44.700> will<00:03:45.700> crank<00:03:45.939> it

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
just pick it up to undo it will crank it

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.119 
just pick it up to undo it will crank it
