00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello everyone in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.839
 make a review about this double 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.870
 for sj reflex and action camera 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.599
 4000 logo pro I bought through 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.340
 amazon for about 33 euros and if you 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.230
 Interested in buying it after seeing the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.230
 video I left the link in the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.570
 description this stroller comes with the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.060
 articulated arm on which is the sj 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.710
 4000 and for all those who now 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.080
 are asking what is this 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.430
 little toy I put some videos 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.950
 recorded with him 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.530
 this video is recorded with a camera 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.900
 reflex canon eos 600d that has been placed 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.090
 on the articulated arm of the stroller 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.830
 and as you are seeing it is rotating 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.830
 in circles around the dog 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.450
 this other video is recorded with a s j 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.940
 4000 placed on the stroller as well 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.970
 that before is rotating on an object 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.950
 in this case a ball of the world 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.010
 the video that you are watching now too 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.780
 has been taken with a sj 4000 in this 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.670
 case I have let the car move 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.020
 downhill on a bike path there 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.600
 to keep in mind that the result 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.610
 will be more professional and softer 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.940
 smoother to the ground because the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.980
 stroller I hope that with these singles 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.990
 videos you have made to the idea of 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.970
 what can a device like 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.460
 is going back to the doll and I want 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.200
 show you how it is used in the axes of 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.570
 the wheels have some moths that 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.630
 they allow us to turn the shaft so that 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.969
 we can direct the trajectory 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.680
 the articulated arm with which it comes 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.960
 allows many different movements 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.600
 to place the camera in the angle that 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.119
 more we are interested in some of these 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.310
 strollers come without the arm but I 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.020
 I recommend buying it with him already 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.280
 that this arm greatly increases our 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.170
 recording possibilities 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.880
 so that they can be hooked 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.590
 camera types this dolly has a 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.540
 quarter-inch screw that is 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.850
 the one used by most tripod and 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.590
 camera accessories as you are 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.570
 seeing the articulated arm is a 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.540
 optional accessory so you can 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.450
 remove and we can directly place the 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.459
 camera based on the stroller but 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.590
 as you can see the recording angles 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.620
 they are drastically limited by not having a 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.230
 articulated arm and now what always 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.209
 I say if you liked the video give him a 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.209
