00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.549
 I'm sad 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:10.639
 it 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:11.669
 Ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.009
 we are sorry to have interrupted other programs 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.200
 a rare event 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.730
 very fast of these products 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.349
 a businessman was French tried to serve her beer 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:20.239
 favorite 

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.019
 do not put them in bags 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:23.390
 you want at all times 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.409
 for that we will broadcast the video 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.449
 but beware gentlemen banier to children who leaders as it could 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.449
 actually more afraid 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.590
 churchill 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.590
 chuck 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.579
 didier deschamps in mind 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.170
 the bill can 17 hours 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.170
 thanks for composing 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.360
 the abrogration 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.480
 very well I think we have the project reminiscent of business 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.290
 a bar is a job that wanted to remain anonymous these cuts we 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.750
 are proud that our trains 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.090
 no because I wanted to tell you that girls to extremely shocked by these 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.780
 places 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.830
 indeed compatible because it's not a drama it's captured elsewhere 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.990
 fallen and creature frames 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.020
 and that's so percent and know this daring 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.380
 there what can I tell you he does not go to do 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.470
 a performance and prague but 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.330
 that arcep has a lot more 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.330
 okay thank you mister dad why 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.220
 so we're going to take our third call to some trades 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.110
 christopher nolan fell 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.430
 but we will know the toad that the player may need humor I was born 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.790
 as the beautiful stormy days that shows a little too much to confess 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.280
 we must recognize crystals 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.210
 on the humor of two minutes of the game but the autonomy of 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 directors the author talks a lot about the world got it 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.289
 and maybe even a movie 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.759
 yohan demont backgrounds is immediate 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.189
 one of our sources 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:15.059
 we completely support dublin training the elderly 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.449
 development 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.449
 so we move forward in our research we immediately 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.799
 here we are going to take the 56th call a certain gentleman the first 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:29.939
 tourism 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.299
 but we are on the support bakou apa jerome the first 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.129
 and I wanted to tell you that I am deeply shocked by this video 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.640
 it's about diminishing and that whole man because they really have it 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.739
 managed to take off do you know 7 9% and not at all so why 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.209
 Western countries under occupation that will compete undertaken a business of 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.400
 paving so me my taste is the starting point of the days I do not have 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.379
 decided 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.379
 the author is a call that served absolutely nothing 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.739
 very well two lessons 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.180
 gold with the sandwich and reminds a certain gentleman wait much more 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.290
 long time possible but we are on the tulip course that I held to you 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.969
 specify that the man you can see this video that fishing does not do 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:13.520
 only that 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.350
 and it's not bad the next months the agreement is also not lucky 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.699
 to talk to him or not do it for military training 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.179
 he also spoke suddenly one the top secret the army 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:27.609
 but who is keen to do everything so that we can do in new york 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.779
 and he was selected to be part of the crew you are in 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.849
 remember from the pandemic a lot I remember 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.839
 who was very happy and jump in all directions 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:40.379
 let you go much further to more than 25 million viewers 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.540
 I do not care less than 25 million viewers it is necessary that the world 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.399
 know that the army is lying to us 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:47.739
 since leaving rotterdam 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.020
 it 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.020
 so that's it 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.929
 the sums raised during this call but this man had revealed 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.409
 information before 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.439
 the appointment is emission project 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.439
 information 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:10.329
 authorities 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:16.729
 elsewhere germany in athens
