00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:13.789
 that was the g1 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.349
 however the real on how to program how to navigate 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.009
 using a device that is little used flat 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.179
 It's very cold in this whole world. 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.800
 despite some analyzes 1 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.249
 positioned and referenced by me 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:32.730
 mitchell 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.470
 the use of the device itself 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.240
 - this is the deadlock 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.370
 it is little already the youngest 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.590
 this amount we have an example 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.620
 within an aircraft in initial thesis with an a300 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.930
 two hundred ninth time 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.970
 a medium-sized physical jet 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.970
 we have his quality 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.870
 is the first talking professing meters 4 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.470
 there are some models in the initial are used 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.030
 This is what I'm going to use today. 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.500
 it's the initial 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.880
 to the sky 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.030
 surrounded by marko ravanello clinton 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.400
 frank knows 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.480
 and if in this I think the error can be found in the 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.290
 on the internet alex has a massimo flyer page 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.540
 / g1 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.540
 I got it later 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.870
 in the case of 300 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.580
 of 4 200 he uses he has 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.720
 2 star star 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.720
 so we can see here 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.310
 spiritism two times 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.310
 and also has 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.750
 this to 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.850
 all iam little talks about the two countries 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.850
 so we talked about inertial for fla said mulet 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.490
 few journeys using this type of navigation 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.750
 do they can if late is the one to develop from the prudent 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.380
 sp in the air, do not 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.700
 a French panel most common English documentation 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.500
 the skeptic 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.500
 7 208 propus pt 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.859
 what they bc 10 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.819
 of a group during a fight and it was if then German group that got involved 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.329
 on the visit and techniques 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.369
 to quote 

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:25.529
 ah the campuses in our children clash that was tested for the singstar them 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.089
 initial use also 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.459
 and finally the 7 07 of family income 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.459
 I'm here atlantic 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.640
 is the same between these aircraft initial pressure a10 has difference 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.249
 between them 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.999
 mode of preparation mode of programming of the museum as it is today 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:49.559
 it is similar both the proacre people have almost 200 as pro 7 07 given 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.339
 given the rate 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:55.069
 this same police officer that the process of the adoption of the husband 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.949
 corridos 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.299
 his command besides town in a flat 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.189
 despite this the club was due to the present has a 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.019
 do not know that lucon is not returned 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.360
 and which altogether 7 07 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.119
 The data is from practice. 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:11.179
 already the initial one 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.269
 the 7 400 then it was pulled by the fall of Rossi 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.869
 a very different 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.289
 linense is what we will learn to talk about today 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.289
 The main difference is that you do not need to align avoiding 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.669
 Start showing to you. 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.669
 how do you align 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.329
 good first the girl was already prepared in the technique of the apeu 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.369
 he already speaks 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:42.919
 with which configured 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.919
 good luck 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.150
 that's when we got two positive farc 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.129
 the top three without these two if you will not be able to fly with the 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.440
 join the other 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.039
 take with the covered pan 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.289
 that the WOW or 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:04.289
 montserrat initio ceded 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:07.419
 said the experienced top 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.549
 here also have other stores that can be placed depending on the number of 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.079
 days that the use 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.229
 of the number of months you try 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.499
 this is one of them that is option 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:22.179
 he does an up there with a tennis player inem brings people like 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.499
 Tamargo 

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:26.599
 to start 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.029
 The planning I'm going to do will only give us 1 

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:33.389
 we are going to change this scourge that we define selection principles that after 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.479
 She made up her flight. 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.620
 and with more or less being 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.650
 as you lie the silver key 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.120
 better for right for me 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.120
 the feet that certainly is a bottom at the suggestion of the father 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.990
 eight years having paid 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.990
 you have several selection modes here 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:00.110
 Phew, we're going to select Firmo do Pit says 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.110
 the same way 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:06.559
 so here we have the coordinates 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.930
 geographical 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.930
 I had nothing was afterwards something great. 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:16.470
 only that before doing first we need to enter with the coordinates of the 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:19.469
 police 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.349
 nelson acosta 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.599
 at first you can do this two forms papa being this teaser two is 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.599
 once she shows the quail so kill herself 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:33.990
 Or you can search the chart 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.189
 had as real as possible 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.339
 can look at the letter is the position you are in the air the port 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:44.659
 the parking 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.089
 forcibly you are they have as geographic zones in case here I 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:51.089
 I do not know if you speak now with the teams. 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:53.460
 mouth of the iguaÃ§u as 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.740
 the strong Indian court then international national weathervane 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.190
 so how is it that I go the contract has estimated time of a list 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:02.900
 I'm going to enter that position. 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.419
 how will he do it, we can stop until a small 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:06.770
 display 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.770
 that has a number as if it were 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.400
 coarse mode 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.289
 Then grandson as the phone also counts. 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:18.339
 have some functions that would be 1 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.930
 numbers or letters slowly is that whoever has a button 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.059
 the two also adopt North system the 4s 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:27.370
 eight south and six 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.740
 Palestine 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.090
 so how are we going to enter this information into the coordinates for 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.259
 align our 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:35.330
 lie to carry
