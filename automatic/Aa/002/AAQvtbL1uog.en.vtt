00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
but the key to the system is that it

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.460 
but the key to the system is that it
creates<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:44.860> lot<00:05:45.010> of<00:05:45.070> turnovers<00:05:45.639> and<00:05:45.960> also<00:05:46.960> look

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
creates a lot of turnovers and also look

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.110 
creates a lot of turnovers and also look

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
everything they shot for 13 so if

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:52.950
