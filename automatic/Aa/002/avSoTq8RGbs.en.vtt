00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
okay so that's it I think the hair piece

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.800 
okay so that's it I think the hair piece
perfectly<00:07:24.610> I<00:07:24.940> know<00:07:25.060> it's<00:07:25.300> a<00:07:25.480> little<00:07:25.600> bit

different<00:07:26.230> color<00:07:26.500> but<00:07:27.430> I<00:07:27.460> think<00:07:28.030> it<00:07:28.300> actually

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450 
different color but I think it actually

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.780 
different color but I think it actually
looks<00:07:28.780> pretty<00:07:29.230> interesting<00:07:29.890> and<00:07:30.460> you<00:07:30.550> can<00:07:30.700> do

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790 
looks pretty interesting and you can do

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.430 
looks pretty interesting and you can do
so<00:07:30.940> many<00:07:31.060> things<00:07:31.210> with<00:07:31.630> this<00:07:31.750> hair<00:07:31.990> you<00:07:32.020> can

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 
so many things with this hair you can
