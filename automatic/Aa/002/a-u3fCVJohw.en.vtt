really<00:00:14.040> nice

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
really nice

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.000 
really nice
weighing<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.030> at<00:00:15.210> 27<00:00:15.870> pounds<00:00:16.049> which<00:00:16.500> makes<00:00:16.859> it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
weighing in at 27 pounds which makes it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.640 
weighing in at 27 pounds which makes it
feel<00:00:17.250> hefty<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> good<00:00:18.570> solid<00:00:18.840> bill<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.500> when

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
feel hefty but a good solid bill so when

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.529 
feel hefty but a good solid bill so when
you<00:00:19.800> take<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.010> few<00:00:20.220> tumbles<00:00:20.640> it's<00:00:21.180> not<00:00:21.390> gonna

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
you take a few tumbles it's not gonna

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.750 
you take a few tumbles it's not gonna
fall<00:00:21.840> apart<00:00:21.960> under<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.560> though<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.310> scratches

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.730 
fall apart under you though it scratches
up<00:00:23.880> easily<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.390> think<00:00:25.050> it'd<00:00:25.109> be<00:00:25.140> easy<00:00:25.470> enough

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
up easily I think it'd be easy enough

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.380 
up easily I think it'd be easy enough
for<00:00:25.980> most<00:00:26.070> people<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.490> carry<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.000> around<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
for most people that carry it around to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.960 
for most people that carry it around to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
around 7 or 8 miles per hour and they'll

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.620 
around 7 or 8 miles per hour and they'll
give<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.820> beeping<00:00:33.180> sound<00:00:33.450> when

give you a little beeping sound when
you're<00:00:33.719> going<00:00:33.989> max<00:00:34.170> speed<00:00:34.530> now<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.370> actually

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
you're going max speed now it's actually

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.030 
you're going max speed now it's actually
pretty<00:00:35.969> fast<00:00:36.329> an<00:00:36.600> average<00:00:36.989> jogging<00:00:37.530> speed<00:00:37.680> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
pretty fast an average jogging speed is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.250 
pretty fast an average jogging speed is
4<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> 6<00:00:38.760> miles<00:00:38.940> per<00:00:39.090> hour<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.230> a

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
4 to 6 miles per hour so this is like a

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.010 
4 to 6 miles per hour so this is like a
fast<00:00:40.590> jogging<00:00:41.190> pace<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.760> full<00:00:42.480> charge<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
fast jogging pace on a full charge it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.930 
fast jogging pace on a full charge it
can<00:00:43.110> go<00:00:43.260> somewhere<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> 15<00:00:44.129> miles<00:00:44.579> range

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
can go somewhere in the 15 miles range

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.389 
can go somewhere in the 15 miles range
which<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.360> pretty<00:00:45.600> insane<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.289> kept<00:00:46.890> using<00:00:47.070> mine

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
which is pretty insane I kept using mine

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.549 
which is pretty insane I kept using mine
over<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.910> over<00:00:48.120> tons<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.719> practice<00:00:48.930> riding

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
over and over tons of practice riding

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.650 
over and over tons of practice riding
and<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.280> took<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> few<00:00:50.700> days<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.090> finally<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and I took a few days to finally get it

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.810 
and I took a few days to finally get it
down<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> low<00:00:52.110> battery<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.370> carry<00:00:53.520> up<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
down to low battery it can carry up to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.479 
down to low battery it can carry up to
220<00:00:54.629> pounds<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.350> bonus<00:00:55.710> point<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.430> thing

220 pounds and a bonus point this thing

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.790 
220 pounds and a bonus point this thing
charges<00:00:57.239> fast<00:00:57.600> only<00:00:58.140> takes<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.469> couple<00:00:58.620> hours

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
