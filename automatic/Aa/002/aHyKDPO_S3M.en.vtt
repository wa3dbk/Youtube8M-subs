00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.170 

and<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.630> can<00:03:05.840> capture<00:03:06.110> it

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.300 

this<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.870> pretty<00:03:12.109> slippery<00:03:12.530> material<00:03:12.799> so<00:03:13.219> you

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
this is pretty slippery material so you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.860 
this is pretty slippery material so you
really<00:03:13.489> have<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.700> pull<00:03:13.909> your<00:03:14.090> wire<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.599> let<00:03:14.750> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
really have to pull your wire and let it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:27.800 
really have to pull your wire and let it
dig<00:03:15.170> into<00:03:15.379> the<00:03:15.620> material

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.040 

now<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.960> next<00:03:29.260> thing<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.470> do<00:03:29.710> is<00:03:29.740> to<00:03:30.070> take<00:03:31.050> more

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
now the next thing to do is to take more

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
ice dubbed shimmer fringe we're gonna

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:49.920 
ice dubbed shimmer fringe we're gonna
tie<00:03:35.800> in<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:36.030> casing<00:03:40.710> and<00:03:41.710> also<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.180> legs<00:03:48.930> so

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
so fibers I'm going to tie these in

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.270 
so fibers I'm going to tie these in
right<00:03:55.300> on<00:03:55.330> top<00:03:55.750> of<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:56.220> shank<00:03:57.220> of<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.430> hook

right on top of the shank of the hook
some<00:04:00.280> guys<00:04:00.459> will<00:04:00.760> use<00:04:01.540> one<00:04:01.900> piece<00:04:02.170> for<00:04:02.680> the

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
some guys will use one piece for the

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.370 
some guys will use one piece for the
casing<00:04:03.490> and<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.790> legs<00:04:04.030> and<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.810> body<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.290> the

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
tail all at once but I usually split it

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.810 
tail all at once but I usually split it
up<00:04:10.860> then<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:12.010> next<00:04:12.250> thing<00:04:12.370> we're<00:04:12.520> gonna<00:04:12.580> do<00:04:12.790> is

up then the next thing we're gonna do is

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.180 
up then the next thing we're gonna do is
we're<00:04:12.970> gonna<00:04:13.060> take<00:04:13.270> our<00:04:13.330> bead<00:04:14.070> we're<00:04:15.070> gonna

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
we're gonna take our bead we're gonna

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.740 
we're gonna take our bead we're gonna
push<00:04:15.489> it<00:04:15.670> back<00:04:15.850> slightly<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.150> have<00:04:19.359> just<00:04:19.660> a

push it back slightly so I have just a

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.830 
push it back slightly so I have just a
little<00:04:19.900> bit<00:04:20.169> of<00:04:20.260> space<00:04:20.470> right<00:04:20.940> up<00:04:21.940> by<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.390> eye

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
little bit of space right up by the eye

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.070 
little bit of space right up by the eye
of<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.410> hook<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.270> just<00:04:25.480> jump<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.900> bead

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
of the hook and I just jump the bead

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.290 
of the hook and I just jump the bead
with<00:04:26.290> my<00:04:26.470> thread<00:04:27.810> then<00:04:28.810> we're<00:04:28.900> gonna<00:04:29.020> pull<00:04:29.320> our

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
top and we're gonna split the ice tub

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.500 
top and we're gonna split the ice tub
shimmer<00:04:38.440> fringe<00:04:38.830> and<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.070> two<00:04:39.310> equal<00:04:39.790> clumps
