00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.390
 hollow but good at that moment he 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.590
 He decides to take the car to pass me no no 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.630
 there was space because I was holding back 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.310
 so I hit the right back and 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.510
 another piece I have the car and I 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.670
 throw the grass 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.310
 I do not intend to touch it in any 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.560
 then forget about not touching it 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.690
 when you run to inside low 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.610
 rhode to the step but product that he 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.900

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.790
 with the difference series 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.460
 my car is working well that is 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.040
 clear but 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.040
 it favored me that it was coming 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.810
 a hairy 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.190
 turning the best program 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:50.250
 this is going to be law 2 very well 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.459
 yes 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:13.300
 with the yellow tractor 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:17.680
 and you who look inside 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.170
 If you do not want to spend the charges and 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.100
 the suffers looking at the race and the guru 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.390
 that goes comfortably already in tip and very 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.490
 quiet good production of your tail 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.640
 Alejandro GarÃ³falo who watched 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:38.200
 and there follows the series with a martÃ­nez 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.200
 paulista claro tu viejo 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.930
 the truth that in the edition series a 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.180
 big difference so auto works 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.610
 ok let's see if we can improve something 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.530
 and see how far you can run it 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.190
 I'll try 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.190
 when we do 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.599
 I tell him 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.910
 you have to fix the night 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.959
 marianito and the crashed car that was left 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.959
 the car rafael 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.959
 wait 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.239
 Fernando Laborito said it and for you and 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.550
 that you scratch 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.840
 yellow flag and he left and here comes 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.450
 the face blunder yes 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.600
 there is thank you of the asparagus lens in the 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.210
 liga huerta and ricardito look what I 've 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.750
 made without a doubt that I think it leaves you 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:42.020
 to double the directions and there I 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.750
 to tender that is the first the first 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.320
 lack of control that I feel about the car and 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.150
 in a spin 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.670
 once I risk others it's that I wanted 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.290
 doing nothing crazy is just a rub 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.670
 where also product of the low 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.410
 temperature 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:00.770
 will go long ago hit him a tail 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.170
 n'roses kid sanchez or the facu regalia 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.630
 who was watching and rossi started to 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.140
 come back later they were going to solve 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.790
 as a substitute in the final and there he comes 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.880
 unruly rivals now it 's the turn of 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:17.060
 pole and now to diego aventÃ­n and up and 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.980
 you came behind ugalde to see rossi in 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.750
 6 turn forward well after the 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.920
 you forget so let's think about 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.850
 recover 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.520
 banderazo and victoria if I win small 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.500
 series and how important we can 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.810
 take it and make a series 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.310
 fairly fast 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.880
 as to ensure a very good 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.880
 starting position 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.840
