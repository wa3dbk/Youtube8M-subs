00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.400 

um<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:47.170> just<00:00:47.380> a<00:00:47.530> minor<00:00:47.740> ones<00:00:48.330> from<00:00:49.330> if<00:00:50.260> you

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
um it's just a minor ones from if you

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.930 
um it's just a minor ones from if you
get<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.560> certain<00:00:50.890> distance<00:00:51.280> away<00:00:51.580> the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
get a certain distance away the

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.820 
get a certain distance away the
characters<00:00:52.330> will<00:00:52.540> blow<00:00:54.990> people<00:00:55.990> behind<00:00:56.200> desks

characters will blow people behind desks
you<00:00:57.070> can<00:00:57.250> see<00:00:57.460> they're<00:00:57.640> like<00:00:57.820> through<00:00:58.300> but<00:00:58.780> uh

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.880 

I<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:08.020> here's<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.350> good<00:01:08.560> example<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.890> um

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
I like here's a good example of it um

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.940 
I like here's a good example of it um
eventually<00:01:12.960> eventually<00:01:13.960> their<00:01:14.710> legs

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
eventually eventually their legs

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:24.570 
eventually eventually their legs
disappear<00:01:15.700> but<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:18.310> kind<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.580> hard<00:01:23.580> um

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
disappear but it's kind of hard um

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.320 
disappear but it's kind of hard um
everything<00:01:25.509> else<00:01:25.690> is<00:01:25.900> basically<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.590> same

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
everything else is basically the same

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.320 
everything else is basically the same
just<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.570> camera<00:01:29.229> ankle<00:01:29.590> is<00:01:29.710> put<00:01:30.009> down

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
just the camera ankle is put down

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.940 
just the camera ankle is put down
further<00:01:31.330> um<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:34.060> cheat<00:01:34.300> code<00:01:34.330> works<00:01:34.899> for<00:01:35.290> both

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
further um the cheat code works for both

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.740 
further um the cheat code works for both
