this flash cs3 and ActionScript 3 lesson

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.070 
this flash cs3 and ActionScript 3 lesson
will<00:00:03.600> demonstrate<00:00:04.230> how<00:00:04.560> you<00:00:04.620> can<00:00:04.859> create<00:00:05.040> an

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 
will demonstrate how you can create an

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.110 
will demonstrate how you can create an
exposition<00:00:07.080> speed<00:00:07.440> menu<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.069> if<00:00:08.820> you<00:00:08.849> put

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
exposition speed menu and if you put

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.060 
exposition speed menu and if you put
your<00:00:09.240> mouse<00:00:09.450> onto<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:10.050> you<00:00:10.349> can<00:00:10.530> see<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.769> as

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
your mouse onto it you can see that as

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.789 
your mouse onto it you can see that as
you<00:00:11.309> mouse<00:00:11.969> goes<00:00:12.300> over<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.049> right<00:00:13.259> it

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
you mouse goes over to the right it

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.799 
you mouse goes over to the right it
slides<00:00:14.280> where<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.730> needs<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.179> then<00:00:15.360> as<00:00:15.599> your

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
slides where it needs to then as your

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.200 
slides where it needs to then as your
mouse<00:00:16.109> moves<00:00:16.920> over<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.460> left<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.880> slides

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
mouse moves over to the left it slides

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.120 
mouse moves over to the left it slides
back<00:00:18.390> if<00:00:18.869> you're<00:00:19.410> hanging<00:00:19.619> around<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
back if you're hanging around in the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.340 
back if you're hanging around in the
middle<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.520> can<00:00:20.640> see<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.570> speed<00:00:21.840> action

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
middle you can see that the speed action

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.460 
middle you can see that the speed action
it<00:00:22.650> decreases<00:00:23.449> the<00:00:24.449> more<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.810> go<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.439> side

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it decreases the more you go to one side

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.950 
it decreases the more you go to one side
the<00:00:25.920> faster<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> menu<00:00:26.730> will<00:00:26.880> move<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.300> you

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
the faster the menu will move and you

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.880 
the faster the menu will move and you
can<00:00:28.140> put<00:00:28.439> 20<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:30.330> 50<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:31.260> doesn't<00:00:31.619> matter<00:00:31.769> I

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
can put 20 to 50 it doesn't matter I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.290 
can put 20 to 50 it doesn't matter I
don't<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.219> don't<00:00:32.340> think<00:00:32.520> there'll<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.940> limit

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
don't I don't think there'll be a limit

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.720 
don't I don't think there'll be a limit
on<00:00:33.420> how<00:00:33.570> many<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.410> put<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.739> there<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.070> only

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
on how many you can put in there I only

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
on how many you can put in there I only
have<00:00:36.000> six<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.440> put<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
have six in there but you can put a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.220 
have six in there but you can put a
whole<00:00:37.860> bunch<00:00:38.190> more<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.750> they<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:39.989> sitting

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
whole bunch more and they can be sitting

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.470 
whole bunch more and they can be sitting
right<00:00:40.620> next<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.010> each<00:00:41.070> other<00:00:41.340> or<00:00:41.640> whatever<00:00:42.300> you

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
right next to each other or whatever you

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.220 
right next to each other or whatever you
want<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.649> long<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.129> define<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
want just as long as you define the the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.110 
want just as long as you define the the
landing<00:00:46.680> position<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.760> starting

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
landing position and the starting

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.200 
landing position and the starting
position<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.559> code<00:00:49.739> okay<00:00:50.610> let's<00:00:50.850> show<00:00:51.149> you

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
position in the code okay let's show you

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.350 
position in the code okay let's show you
the<00:00:51.420> Fla<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.910> code<00:00:55.070> now<00:00:56.070> we're<00:00:56.850> animating

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the Fla and the code now we're animating

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.709 
the Fla and the code now we're animating
let's<00:00:57.960> publish<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.649> again<00:00:59.300> we're<00:01:00.300> animating

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
let's publish that again we're animating

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.290 
let's publish that again we're animating
this<00:01:01.050> we're<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.530> using<00:01:01.770> YZ<00:01:02.250> or<00:01:02.640> we're<00:01:03.180> not

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
this we're not using YZ or we're not

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.939 
this we're not using YZ or we're not
using<00:01:03.539> tween<00:01:03.989> either<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.799> is

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
using tween either and this is

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.520 
using tween either and this is
ActionScript<00:01:05.580> 3<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.970> we're<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.840> using<00:01:07.110> math

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
ActionScript 3 and we're just using math

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.600 
ActionScript 3 and we're just using math
and<00:01:08.119> looping<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.830> accomplish<00:01:11.340> this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and looping to to accomplish this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.170 
and looping to to accomplish this
movement<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.479> so<00:01:13.380> that's<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.710> tweeze

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
movement and so that's not tweeze

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.320 
movement and so that's not tweeze
tweezer

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
tweezer

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.670 
tweezer
that's<00:01:16.170> not<00:01:16.409> tween<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.549> not<00:01:17.700> ease<00:01:18.680> okay

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that's not tween or is not ease okay

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.410 
that's not tween or is not ease okay
it's<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.490> math<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it's just math that's all it is the the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.690 
it's just math that's all it is the the
free<00:01:24.630> Fla<00:01:25.110> file<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.009> want<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.369> go<00:01:26.549> get

and<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> need<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.909> button<00:01:33.240> code<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.750> whole

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
and if you need the button code a whole

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.200 
and if you need the button code a whole
bunch<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.500> my<00:01:34.650> other<00:01:34.680> tutorials<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> have

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
bunch of my other tutorials have to have

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
bunch of my other tutorials have to have
button<00:01:36.570> code<00:01:36.780> inside<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.170> them<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.040> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
button code inside of them so it's up to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.920 
button code inside of them so it's up to
you<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.369> integrate<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.850> button<00:01:39.150> code<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
you to integrate the button code and the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.390 
you to integrate the button code and the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
less your spoon-fed the better off

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.520 
less your spoon-fed the better off
you'll<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:42.750> let's<00:01:42.990> take<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> look<00:01:43.320> at<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
you'll be so let's take a look at the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.819 
you'll be so let's take a look at the
code<00:01:43.740> now<00:01:46.340> first<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.030> first<00:01:48.270> frame<00:01:48.829> what

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
code now first in the first frame what

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.310 
code now first in the first frame what
we're<00:01:49.979> doing<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.579> stop<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> timeline<00:01:51.570> we

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
we're doing is we stop the timeline we

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.340 
we're doing is we stop the timeline we
initially<00:01:52.860> initialize<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> few<00:01:54.090> variables<00:01:54.540> or

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
initially initialize a few variables or

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.889 
initially initialize a few variables or
a<00:01:55.409> couple<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.829> variables<00:01:56.310> here<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> then<00:01:57.600> we

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
a couple of variables here and then we

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.719 
a couple of variables here and then we
add<00:01:58.079> an<00:01:58.259> event<00:01:58.350> listener<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.219> function

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
add an event listener and a function

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.749 
add an event listener and a function
that's<00:02:00.360> listening<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:01.290> if<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.680> mouse<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that's listening for if the mouse if the

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.630 
that's listening for if the mouse if the
user's<00:02:03.090> mouse<00:02:03.299> goes<00:02:03.570> over<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.049> menu<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:05.070> BG

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
user's mouse goes over this menu this BG

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.999 
user's mouse goes over this menu this BG
the<00:02:06.000> background<00:02:06.450> clip<00:02:06.719> if<00:02:06.960> their<00:02:07.560> mouse<00:02:07.740> goes

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
the background clip if their mouse goes

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.190 
the background clip if their mouse goes
over<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.879> start<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.300> up<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
over that then we start it up and the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.710 
over that then we start it up and the
way<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.470> start<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.860> up<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.190> send<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.030> frame

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
way we start it up is send it to frame

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.760 
way we start it up is send it to frame
two<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.260> we<00:02:13.379> say<00:02:13.530> go

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
two so we say go

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.210 
two so we say go
-<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.220> play<00:02:14.400> frame<00:02:14.970> -<00:02:15.240> and<00:02:15.620> it's<00:02:16.620> set<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.860> go<00:02:17.160> to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
- and play frame - and it's set to go to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.030 
- and play frame - and it's set to go to
and<00:02:17.520> play<00:02:17.700> frame<00:02:17.790> -<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.660> it'll<00:02:19.020> hit<00:02:19.470> frame<00:02:19.770> to

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
and play frame - so it'll hit frame to

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.850 
and play frame - so it'll hit frame to
do<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.730> code<00:02:20.910> there<00:02:21.240> or<00:02:22.020> execute<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.680> code

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
do the code there or execute the code

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.400 
do the code there or execute the code
there<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.370> then<00:02:23.610> hop<00:02:24.120> hop<00:02:24.660> right<00:02:24.870> along<00:02:25.200> over

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
there and then hop hop right along over

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.300 
there and then hop hop right along over
to<00:02:25.620> -<00:02:26.400> frame<00:02:26.850> three<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.740> I'm<00:02:28.740> frame<00:02:29.010> two

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
to - frame three and I'm frame two

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.660 
to - frame three and I'm frame two
you'll<00:02:29.850> see<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.390> there's<00:02:31.220> we're<00:02:32.220> removing

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
you'll see that there's we're removing

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.420 
you'll see that there's we're removing
the<00:02:32.790> event<00:02:33.060> listener<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.630> we<00:02:33.750> created<00:02:34.430> that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
the event listener that we created that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.660 
the event listener that we created that
we<00:02:35.580> added<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.420> first<00:02:36.630> frame<00:02:37.250> very<00:02:38.250> simple

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
we added on the first frame very simple

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.630 
we added on the first frame very simple
there<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.150> then<00:02:39.810> once<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.530> code<00:02:41.010> executes

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
there and then once that code executes

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.870 
there and then once that code executes
them<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.210> event<00:02:42.740> is<00:02:43.740> removed<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.610> event

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
them the event is removed the event

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.150 
them the event is removed the event
listener<00:02:45.330> is<00:02:45.570> removed<00:02:45.990> then<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.620> jumps<00:02:46.920> along

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
listener is removed then it jumps along

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.060 
listener is removed then it jumps along
to<00:02:47.310> frame<00:02:47.520> three<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.410> frame<00:02:49.410> three<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:51.680> if<00:02:52.680> you

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
to frame three and frame three is if you

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.830 
to frame three and frame three is if you
need<00:02:53.190> any<00:02:53.400> help<00:02:53.490> with<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:53.970> code<00:02:54.240> just<00:02:54.660> go

into the forum that developed PHP and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.110 
into the forum that developed PHP and
ask<00:02:57.240> for<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.900> be<00:02:57.990> explained<00:02:58.850> if<00:02:59.850> you

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
ask for it to be explained if you

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.180 
ask for it to be explained if you
understand<00:03:00.540> math<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.500> understand<00:03:01.920> if

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
understand math and you understand if

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.750 
understand math and you understand if
and<00:03:02.400> else<00:03:02.780> conditionals<00:03:03.780> then<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:05.610> should

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
have no problem understanding what I've

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.600 
have no problem understanding what I've
done<00:03:07.650> here<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.830> movie<00:03:11.130> clip<00:03:11.370> where

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
done here and the the movie clip where

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.210 
done here and the the movie clip where
where<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.240> resides<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.960> where<00:03:13.440> it<00:03:13.620> ends<00:03:14.070> up

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
where it resides and where it ends up

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.010 
where it resides and where it ends up
when<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.360> users<00:03:15.930> mouth<00:03:16.170> when<00:03:16.920> we<00:03:17.040> move<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.490> to

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
when the users mouth when we move it to

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.310 
when the users mouth when we move it to
about<00:03:19.020> ending<00:03:19.530> right<00:03:19.709> here<00:03:21.020> that<00:03:22.020> would<00:03:22.260> be

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
about ending right here that would be

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.970 
about ending right here that would be
this<00:03:22.860> number<00:03:23.310> here<00:03:23.730> negative<00:03:24.060> 330<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.770> got

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
this number here negative 330 so you got

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.230

understand what I'm doing here because
it's<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.700> simple<00:03:48.120> math<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.720> it's<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:50.390> simple

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
it's just simple math and it's a simple

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
if and else statements and then right

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.470 
if and else statements and then right
here<00:03:54.720> we<00:03:55.380> go<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:56.040> play<00:03:56.160> loop<00:03:56.520> after<00:03:56.880> this

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
here we go to and play loop after this

code executes in this in a split second

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.210 
code executes in this in a split second
it<00:04:00.840> keeps<00:04:01.110> looping<00:04:01.380> on<00:04:01.650> itself<00:04:01.950> and

it keeps looping on itself and

it keeps looping on itself and
everything<00:04:02.880> here<00:04:03.120> happens<00:04:03.510> about<00:04:03.720> 15<00:04:04.410> times

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
everything here happens about 15 times

15<00:04:07.620> times<00:04:07.950> every<00:04:08.550> second<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.750> loops<00:04:10.020> all

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
15 times every second and it loops all

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.740 
15 times every second and it loops all
the<00:04:10.320> way<00:04:10.560> back<00:04:10.800> to<00:04:11.340> not<00:04:12.000> all<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.239> way<00:04:12.360> back<00:04:12.540> but

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
the way back to not all the way back but

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.080 
the way back to not all the way back but
it<00:04:12.870> loops<00:04:13.050> back<00:04:13.140> to<00:04:13.440> frame<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.950> our<00:04:14.760> frame

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
it loops back to frame to our frame

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.220 
it loops back to frame to our frame
label<00:04:15.330> here<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:16.549> named<00:04:17.549> loop<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.900> that's<00:04:19.049> what

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
label here is named loop so that's what

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.610 
label here is named loop so that's what
it<00:04:19.320> does

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
it does

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.050 
it does
every<00:04:20.370> second<00:04:21.359> about<00:04:21.690> 15<00:04:22.229> times<00:04:22.669> so<00:04:23.669> here<00:04:23.940> we

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
every second about 15 times so here we

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.960 
every second about 15 times so here we
have<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.360> border<00:04:24.780> graphics

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
have the border graphics

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.600 
have the border graphics
here<00:04:26.690> we<00:04:26.810> have<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.230> menu<00:04:27.380> movieclip<00:04:28.220> itself

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
here we have the menu movieclip itself

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.120 
here we have the menu movieclip itself
and<00:04:28.930> here<00:04:29.930> we<00:04:30.020> have<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.350> background<00:04:30.560> clip

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
and here we have the background clip

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.280 
and here we have the background clip
which<00:04:31.400> is<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:31.760> blue<00:04:32.060> symbol<00:04:32.510> it's<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:33.020> movie

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
which is this blue symbol it's a movie

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.010 
which is this blue symbol it's a movie
clip<00:04:33.530> and<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:34.040> has<00:04:34.160> an<00:04:34.310> instance<00:04:34.640> name<00:04:34.730> of<00:04:35.150> BG

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
clip and it has an instance name of BG

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.820 
clip and it has an instance name of BG
clip<00:04:36.290> underscore<00:04:37.010> MC<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:38.720> so<00:04:39.350> that's<00:04:39.590> pretty

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
clip underscore MC and so that's pretty

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.550 
clip underscore MC and so that's pretty
much<00:04:39.950> how<00:04:40.100> it<00:04:40.340> works<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.900> it's<00:04:42.080> publish<00:04:42.410> it

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
much how it works and it's publish it

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.400 
much how it works and it's publish it
and<00:04:42.650> take<00:04:42.800> a<00:04:42.830> look<00:04:42.920> at<00:04:43.160> it<00:04:43.310> again

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
and take a look at it again

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.840 
and take a look at it again
so<00:04:45.410> yeah<00:04:45.680> depending<00:04:45.950> on<00:04:46.340> where<00:04:46.520> your<00:04:46.640> mouse<00:04:46.820> is

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
so yeah depending on where your mouse is

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.990 
so yeah depending on where your mouse is
on<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.630> menu<00:04:47.960> that<00:04:48.820> determines<00:04:49.820> the

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
on the menu that determines the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.900 
on the menu that determines the
exposition<00:04:50.690> speed<00:04:51.110> that<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.220> menu<00:04:52.580> will<00:04:52.730> move

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
exposition speed that the menu will move

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.720 
exposition speed that the menu will move
at<00:04:53.180> you<00:04:53.870> can<00:04:54.050> change<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.620> numbers<00:04:55.160> in<00:04:55.340> my<00:04:55.490> math

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
at you can change the numbers in my math

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.490 
at you can change the numbers in my math
and<00:04:56.060> have<00:04:56.750> it<00:04:58.300> go<00:04:59.300> at<00:04:59.480> speeds<00:04:59.810> where<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:00.260> need

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
and have it go at speeds where you need

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.140 
and have it go at speeds where you need
it<00:05:00.650> if<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:00.980> needed<00:05:01.130> a<00:05:01.250> little<00:05:01.370> slower<00:05:01.700> you<00:05:01.970> need

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
it if it needed a little slower you need

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.930 
it if it needed a little slower you need
a<00:05:02.180> little<00:05:02.390> faster<00:05:02.870> you<00:05:03.020> can<00:05:03.200> just<00:05:03.410> change<00:05:03.620> the

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
a little faster you can just change the

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.270 
a little faster you can just change the
the<00:05:04.940> ten<00:05:07.210> let's<00:05:08.210> see<00:05:08.450> right<00:05:08.780> here<00:05:09.290> you<00:05:10.160> can

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
the ten let's see right here you can

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.160 
the ten let's see right here you can
change<00:05:10.520> this<00:05:10.700> ten<00:05:11.000> to<00:05:11.420> be<00:05:11.540> a<00:05:11.570> different<00:05:11.930> number

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
change this ten to be a different number

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.920 
change this ten to be a different number
and<00:05:12.200> you'll<00:05:12.440> see<00:05:12.710> different<00:05:13.550> speeds<00:05:13.820> or<00:05:14.210> you

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
and you'll see different speeds or you

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.810 
and you'll see different speeds or you
can<00:05:15.050> change<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.530> frame<00:05:15.710> rate<00:05:15.770> I've<00:05:16.370> got<00:05:16.640> mine

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
can change the frame rate I've got mine

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.150 
can change the frame rate I've got mine
set<00:05:16.850> nice<00:05:17.419> and<00:05:17.630> healthy<00:05:17.810> to<00:05:18.140> thirty<00:05:18.410> but<00:05:19.070> you

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
set nice and healthy to thirty but you

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.790 
set nice and healthy to thirty but you
can<00:05:19.310> change<00:05:19.520> yours<00:05:20.080> to<00:05:21.080> be<00:05:21.200> whatever<00:05:21.380> you<00:05:21.590> want

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
can change yours to be whatever you want

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.050 
can change yours to be whatever you want
and<00:05:22.660> like<00:05:23.660> I<00:05:23.780> said<00:05:23.840> this<00:05:24.230> can<00:05:24.740> this<00:05:25.550> movie<00:05:25.910> clip

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
and like I said this can this movie clip

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.800 
and like I said this can this movie clip
can<00:05:26.330> have<00:05:26.860> twenty<00:05:27.860> five<00:05:28.160> fifty<00:05:28.580> images<00:05:29.540> in<00:05:29.690> it

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
can have twenty five fifty images in it

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.250 
can have twenty five fifty images in it
or<00:05:29.990> buttons<00:05:31.030> it<00:05:32.030> doesn't<00:05:32.419> matter<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:33.110> can

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
or buttons it doesn't matter you can

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.740 
or buttons it doesn't matter you can
also<00:05:33.410> put<00:05:33.770> a<00:05:33.800> mask<00:05:34.100> on<00:05:34.370> top<00:05:34.610> of<00:05:34.760> it<00:05:34.910> here<00:05:35.210> if<00:05:35.690> you

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
also put a mask on top of it here if you

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.120 
also put a mask on top of it here if you
didn't<00:05:36.050> want<00:05:36.080> it<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.290> go<00:05:36.470> all<00:05:36.590> the<00:05:36.710> way<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.860> the

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
didn't want it to go all the way to the

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.370 
didn't want it to go all the way to the
edge<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.850> it's<00:05:38.750> a<00:05:38.810> whole<00:05:38.930> bunch<00:05:39.140> of<00:05:39.200> fun

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
edge and it's a whole bunch of fun

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.840 
edge and it's a whole bunch of fun
things<00:05:39.620> you<00:05:39.710> can<00:05:39.770> do<00:05:39.980> with<00:05:40.130> this<00:05:40.250> but<00:05:40.730> this

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
things you can do with this but this

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.350 
things you can do with this but this
shows<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.150> good<00:05:41.479> way<00:05:41.690> without<00:05:41.900> using<00:05:42.460> a<00:05:43.460> big

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
shows a good way without using a big

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.840 
shows a good way without using a big
jumbled<00:05:45.080> mess<00:05:45.260> of<00:05:45.440> code<00:05:45.680> for<00:05:46.070> easing<00:05:46.700> and

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
jumbled mess of code for easing and

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.340 
jumbled mess of code for easing and
tweening<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:48.680> can<00:05:48.860> just<00:05:49.070> use<00:05:49.570> math<00:05:50.570> the<00:05:51.169> old

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
tweening you can just use math the old

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.860 
tweening you can just use math the old
fashioned<00:05:51.830> way<00:05:52.010> the<00:05:52.700> old-school<00:05:53.090> way<00:05:53.240> to
