00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
see what people are saying that there's

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.009 
see what people are saying that there's
not<00:02:21.920> really<00:02:22.160> much<00:02:22.430> difference<00:02:22.940> do<00:02:23.360> not<00:02:23.569> world

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
not really much difference do not world

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.119 
not really much difference do not world
warcraft<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:24.950> EverQuest<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.030> lot<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:27.129> this

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
warcraft and EverQuest in a lot and this

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.360 
warcraft and EverQuest in a lot and this
goes<00:02:28.430> on<00:02:28.579> to<00:02:28.850> continue<00:02:29.420> our<00:02:29.900> earlier<00:02:30.620> point

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
goes on to continue our earlier point

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.849 
goes on to continue our earlier point
with<00:02:32.060> animals<00:02:32.480> not<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.170> best<00:02:33.380> idea<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.769> think

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
with animals not the best idea I think

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.860 
with animals not the best idea I think
it<00:02:34.160> should<00:02:34.310> have<00:02:34.459> been<00:02:34.609> so<00:02:35.329> much<00:02:35.450> to<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.690> board

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
it should have been so much to the board

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.539 
it should have been so much to the board
line<00:02:36.049> style<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.620> have<00:02:36.680> four<00:02:36.889> players<00:02:37.040> or<00:02:37.370> you

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
line style you have four players or you

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.490 
line style you have four players or you
