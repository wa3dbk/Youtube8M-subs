00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello to all the greats of this fortune 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.580
 we are going to get the vehicle to der 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.940
 or already more known to all of us 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.139
 like the bugatti the truth is that this is 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.699
 a vehicle that all people 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.160
 they want and for those who know it 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.780
 you can find totally free in the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.520
 map of great authors 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.830
 this vehicle when you go to 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.940
 steal or get it and I will save 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.619
 in your garage he's going to tell you what 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.420
 can save since it's a vehicle 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.590
 stolen and already has the locator 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.050
 then to be able to save it 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.149
 you just have to follow the steps 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.190
 that I show in the video how to save 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.600
 stolen vehicles in your garage that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.340
 it will simply lower them in the description 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.390
 if you have not seen it yet, the only thing 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.610
 have to do is go to this 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.280
 location here that same place where 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.739
 the aero the bugatti in the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.750
 history there is a debate against the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.760
 vehicle then they always have to go 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.110
 legal day are very much in mind if they go 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.940
 they give option is never going to appear so 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.770
 except the bugatti never appeared to me 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.430
 of the green night has always seemed to me 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.989
 day as they realize and it is dried 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.539
 I am giving the child but that is one 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.670
 that appears there randomly is put at random 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.840
 and we're not going to steal it to show that 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.520
 They are until this is how I say 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.829
 arrive by day here are 8 in the 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.770
 tomorrow my game and if it does not disappear 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.990
 let's say that the first time or not 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.459
 appears after going several times all 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.439
 what we welcome them away and 

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.759
 come back and in case they disappear 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.009
 simply what they have to do is 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.920
 change the session to my girlfriend appeared the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.929
 I really had to do it enough 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.659
 times but that's why in the inco my advice 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.759
 is that they try to come back in case 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.950
 do not appear and if they have already moved 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.549
 many times in regression disappear 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.919
 it is best to change the session not 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.149
 they realize and we just stole it and 

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:46.319
 now they can do what they want with the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.299
 vehicle as I tell you can not 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.549
 save it directly in your garage 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.079
 it has to be the beginning the trick that 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.630
 I will leave in the description of this 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.130
 video is the only way to save 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.020
 Let 's say this super middleweight process 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.270
 garages already after you what 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.439
 keep in your garage and what you guys 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.209
 can do with it those who want 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.219
 you can just have it there for 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.399
 show our friends or just what 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.840
 they use to 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.580
 infinite here I'm going I'll go back to 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.560
 no site after giving them the samples 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.390
 freeze and I found that I'm going to appear 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.599
 then it 's another new to see what 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.370
 he responded automatically not me or is it not 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.470
 is our little face that right now we 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.300
 let's rob again to enjoy and 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.270
 this is my original vehicle of which I 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.620
 I got there there is the locator and from 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.780
 the map that that's the level and this what 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.230
 staff then how do I tell you this is 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.120
 the place to find the air as you 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.769
 I say try to look for it during the day 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.060
 and always appears to change the attention 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.440

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.209
