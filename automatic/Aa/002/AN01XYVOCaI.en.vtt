00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.529
 friends hello again with you again 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.809
 total and games and I also have quite 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.130
 interesting news 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.200
 for sure you remember that in assassin's 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.859
 creed unity was such a beginning of the game 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.369
 plate where there were different assassins and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.670
 new and old well friends 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.130
 one of our subscribers ruslan a 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.699
 threw us information about here 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.809
 of all this I will read it now and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.540
 give my opinion in the process 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.379
 assassin's creed the unity of 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.149
 games cut pretty much to them 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.660
 number of different places including 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.059
 mission data mission data files on this 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.180
 files are kept to this day 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.789
 attack the game itself does not use them here 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.289
 image from the game files can also be 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.530
 notice that in these missions 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.210
 attended and Nikolay Eagles Russian 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.390
 the office 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.250
 well friends this is all very disappointing 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.710
 there is for sure and heights like to do 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.490
 these missions are available to you in some kind 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.920
 mode is possible new but for some reason find 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.340
 file and we just did idle but 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.110
 they still have in the game they can 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.439
 perhaps in some way to use 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.490
 I don't know for sure but I guess 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.939
 there are some craftsmen who 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.200
 will be able to turn it all up somehow and 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.380
 maybe even play these here 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.159
 the missions are small ie the game here we are 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.469
 the beginning of the game we played for 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:47.100
 the templar don't remember his name just 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.289
 terrible name of duty and incomprehensible here and 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.340
 I would just like to play with the same 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:56.459
 Altair high to make this dinner Well 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:02.299
 This port someone norkin flour and more 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:02.299
 there is an auditor edward kenway 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:09.269
 Eagles the same Russian there is a bunch of pile 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.640
 many even worries can play here 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.640
 why do developers even cut out 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.700
 such a possibility is unclear perhaps they 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.239
 They want to release some 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.970
 bios paid which will give the opportunity 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.750
 here open all these missions here to play 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.299
 with these heroes of this we do not know friends 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.819
 but the information is very helpful thank you 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.410
 great 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.019
 if you watch this video thanks 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.680
 because we have been looking for a solution for a long time 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.750
 This problem was looking for a way out of the menu. 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.840
 played in the rift mechanic almost with 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.750
 ducks to open this menu but 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.489
 nothing worked well now at least 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.849
 it is understandable that it is understandable that it 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.889
 everything is impossible everything is so well 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.450
 friends thanks for watching I think this 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:06.510
 the information for you 2 is helpful and i think 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.079
 what can be all the same developers 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.019
 lead this further game but I don't even 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:15.470
 look with you thanks for watching 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.470
 bye everyone
