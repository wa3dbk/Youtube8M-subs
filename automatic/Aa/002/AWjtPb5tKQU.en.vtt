manager<00:02:36.720> for<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.900> long<00:02:36.990> time<00:02:37.230> obviously<00:02:37.410> that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
manager for a long time obviously that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.680 
manager for a long time obviously that
to<00:02:38.070> touch<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.610> what<00:02:38.850> he<00:02:38.940> did<00:02:39.120> at<00:02:39.210> Everton<00:02:39.540> it

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
to touch is what he did at Everton it

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.080 
to touch is what he did at Everton it
must<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:39.960> worked<00:02:40.080> him<00:02:40.320> then<00:02:40.820> but<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.910> didn't

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
work at United I think it's a case that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.510 
work at United I think it's a case that
one<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.780> should<00:02:46.500> we<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.860> doing<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:47.280> now

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
one is should we be doing this now

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.130 
one is should we be doing this now
