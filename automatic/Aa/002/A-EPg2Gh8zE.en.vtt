00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.899 
again and then it came up then the
just<00:02:35.040> click<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.909> it<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:36.319> it<00:02:37.319> sometimes<00:02:37.980> I

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
just click on it and it sometimes I

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:45.050 
just click on it and it sometimes I
think<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.329> most<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.900> us<00:02:40.049> it<00:02:40.349> is<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:43.400> brown<00:02:44.400> screen

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
think it most of us it is a brown screen

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.270 
think it most of us it is a brown screen
so<00:02:45.689> how<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.900> fix<00:02:46.170> those<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.560> you<00:02:46.799> click<00:02:47.099> this

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
so how you fix those is you click this

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.300

little Settings icon here and then it
goes<00:02:50.459> into<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:51.930> then<00:02:52.109> just<00:02:52.319> click<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
goes into this and then just click the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.949 
goes into this and then just click the
back<00:02:52.859> button<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.430> then<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.150> there<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.540> go

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
and those options here whatever and then

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.300 
and those options here whatever and then
I'm<00:03:00.689> just<00:03:00.870> going<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.200> jump<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:01.950> one<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
I'm just going to jump on this one the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.610 
I'm just going to jump on this one the
one<00:03:02.430> I'll<00:03:02.549> be<00:03:02.579> playing<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.349> then<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.500> can

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
one I'll be playing and then you can

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.170 
one I'll be playing and then you can
play<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:04.950> it's<00:03:05.159> probably<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.670> bit<00:03:05.819> laggy

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
play it it's probably a bit laggy

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.849 
play it it's probably a bit laggy
because<00:03:07.079> um<00:03:07.769> I<00:03:08.359> had<00:03:09.359> to<00:03:09.599> use<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> different

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
because um I had to use a different

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.800 
because um I had to use a different
screen<00:03:11.310> recorder<00:03:12.079> to<00:03:13.079> record<00:03:13.950> how<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:15.269> fix<00:03:15.569> it

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
screen recorder to record how to fix it

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.780 
screen recorder to record how to fix it
because<00:03:16.459> my<00:03:17.459> usual<00:03:18.000> one<00:03:18.319> just<00:03:19.319> recorded<00:03:20.040> it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
because my usual one just recorded it

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.879 
because my usual one just recorded it
didn't<00:03:21.150> record<00:03:21.420> these<00:03:21.750> things<00:03:22.109> like<00:03:22.709> the

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
didn't record these things like the

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.460 
didn't record these things like the
settings<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.370> such<00:03:23.549> so<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.819> had<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.120> switch

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
settings and such so I had to switch

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.990 
settings and such so I had to switch
screen<00:03:25.470> recorder<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.129> one<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.700> bit

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
screen recorder and this one is a bit

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.990 
screen recorder and this one is a bit
slower<00:03:27.359> maybe<00:03:28.349> a<00:03:28.560> bit<00:03:28.709> laggy<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:29.819> is

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
slower maybe a bit laggy but this is

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.720 
slower maybe a bit laggy but this is
heaps<00:03:30.389> good<00:03:30.659> but<00:03:31.170> uh<00:03:31.200> Mikey<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:32.099> don't<00:03:32.579> know<00:03:32.639> if
