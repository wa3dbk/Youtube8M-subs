 for target in company to talk 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.000
 today of my routine care of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.260
 face is gone so concerning marc 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.440
 medicine facials 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.960
 it's happening in three stages already I was 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.779
 maquis it's the first phase then 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.950
 it's the cleaning pass and finally the 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.020
 hydration phase 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.670
 so here are three states otherwise I have a 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.670
 mixed nature skin 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.130
 to begin with I am therefore using the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:51.080
 make-up remover double action efficiency and 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.960
 tolerance of chiroque then this 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.130
 makeup remover works very well and 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.990
 respects 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.480
 the sensitive area the contour of the eye 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.540
 geparo santis stinging or aggression 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.800
 did not need to rub 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.200
 a lot to get the 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.200
 waterproof makeup that eliminates 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.130
 perfectly very good makeup remover after 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.220
 in the same spirit I use 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.860
 always make-up removers by phase 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.990
 the texture a bit oily we are that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.930
 I make up with water proof the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.600
 most of the time especially so we were 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.510
 in my mind you have the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.130
 cleanser bayou bifaces there again who 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.930
 costs a little less than 3 euros so 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.790
 Excellent value 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.470
 I did not speak recently on the blog 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.930
 so if you're interested do not hesitate 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.670
 to see my opinion here is because 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.190
 it costs 10 euros it is worth it in 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.580
 anyway his first thing but he's 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.200
 very well then I continue the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.360
 make -up removal or make-up 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.850
 cleaning with the cleansing mousse 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.400
 oxygenating blow of brightness so with the flower 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.440
 of our pale that promises purity and brilliance 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.540
 complexion then it's a mousse it's 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.520
 a super surprise a very beautiful 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.940
 discovery that I did I'm delighted to 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.190
 this purchase simply because already 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.420
 it works very well yahoo of the 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.470
 first application you feel 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.740
 really a cleanse skin cleanse in 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.510
 depth and a brilliant result after 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.560
 a few weeks of use or three 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.890
 four weeks you really see 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.890
 also that the grain of 2 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.959
 pause tightens the skin is no longer 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.420
 smooth the features are finer 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.220
 populist 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.060
 it works so the ping effect is us 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.830
 well present and it only costs 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.870
 seven rounds and some 790 something 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.610
 like that for 200 milliliters 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.100
 it is advisable to use two pressures 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.260
 foam me I use a story I 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.940
 sufficient mens for the face so 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.640
 it's quite economical and 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.070
 it makes me think of the magical foot of 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.530
 garanciÃ¨re so I tested there is very 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.880
 a long time and we are we are on a 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.080
 similar result but for a price 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.370
 much lower since it is 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.130
 everything and it seems to me that the cheat 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.740
 magic cost around 2.30 euros 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.610
 so it's a lot more interesting and 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.800
 in addition I also like the delicate fragrance 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.630
 that she leaves after after an internship or 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.490
 not even really lather 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.570
 little on the face after I grant you 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:21.780
 that the bottle a care the bottle in 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.230
 either it's not very pretty it's cheap 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.520
 and that's why I like the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.400
 makes it plastic because 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.020
 good when you travel a lot it's light 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.730
 and it can be transported quite easily 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.050
 it's not very long but I think it 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.820
 could not have made a little effort because 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.650
 that it's a bit low-end 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.050
 but in any case the result is good 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.690
 present and well present so do not you 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.950
 do not trust appearances it's a very 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.980
 good product that is worth to be 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.140
 tried so I think as I said 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.060
 after three weeks three four 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.570
 weeks roughly I find a skin 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.440
 glittering a bread naked pore middle 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.810
 tightened 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.640
 so I like to alternate game 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.709
 since the project works 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.770
 very well to maintain its effectiveness 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.239
 I rock a week in a few words 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.860
 fifteen days or at the morning of the day 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.319
 as off on a cleansing gel 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.680
 much more basic where I took a 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.730
 cleaning gel from barbara gould that makes 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.520
 very much the job they are cleaning and 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.860
 curl it reminds me of a scrub that 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.310
 I tested there to be autopsies from 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.710
 chanel and it's pretty nice a 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.450
 monotype on the face that passes know 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.460
 all very well its pure and then it reveals 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.140
 classes is perfect so I like 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.660
 to switch and after a 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.850
 dozen days I when I see that 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.340
 my bread are really starting to tarnish 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.910
 that efficiency is not optimal 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:50.320
 as I laime I returned that with 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:54.850
 oxygenating foam removing blows 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.950
 of shine so I use these two there 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.530
 mainly this one and I love them 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.420
 a little bit to let go a little 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.490
 breathe the skin in that sense where it's 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.530
 like a micro pinin so that's a 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.200
 micro pin pin hindu function 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.990
 but still I prefer alternate 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.510
 finally after learned after having 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.990
 maquis and my skin to have well clean 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.760
 so I apply a cream of the sort at night 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.480
 oxygenating so it's a day cream 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.210
 and night 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.569
 it is the cream of the oxygenating trioxide of 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.979
 shine shots or cowbells 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:27.689
 I really liked these products I 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.960
 find it very accessible at the price level 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:32.990
 a very good result so yes I am 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.659
 party on what products blow of radiance 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.800
 and so I do not use it a crime of 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:40.289
 players though because I find 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.849
 that her texture is a little bit she's a 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.499
 little bit fat slightly thanks is 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.569
 finished slightly thanks to the tax the 

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:49.259
 evening it suits me very well for 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:52.349
 rehydrate the skin to let it go 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.669
 to rest detoxify and also activate 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.110
 cell renewal 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.740
 so I find it very quickly premiums of 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.729
 night and morning I find a skin 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.740
 quite sweet or creamed day horsehair 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.199
 two days between m 2 days i use 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.959
 so the generous rehydrating balm of 

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:12.270
 the iraq of the range hydra chrono plus 

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:15.209
 so it's a generous balm and 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.009
 moisturizer that will act deeply in 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:20.020
 does what happens is that I have 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:23.860
 chose this one because these 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.680
 tance recent weeks I have been I 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.449
 been heavily exposed to the sun which 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.500
 does my skin 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.419
 she still relaxed well she 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.699
 was pretty assaulted to miss it 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.800
 hydration and lost in tone 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:38.349
 So I did not go on this 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.120
 balm is west in quotation marks because 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.819
 that precisely it has a gel texture 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.810
 jackets that is ultra present as soon as 

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:49.720
 apply it refresh it soothes that 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.960
 relax so I chose this beautiful for the 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.699
 intense hydration side and after 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.539
 a few weeks of use 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.150
 actually I found one for 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:00.069
 rehydrate a little more tense repulp 

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.520
 so that's exactly what I had 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:03.370
 need 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.620
 I also like the finish after having 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:09.039
 applied the velvety finish the skin is 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:12.550
 very soft and mattify so despite its 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:13.940
 texture gel cream gel the skin absorbs 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.740
 fast enough 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.900
 the product how do you say it is that 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.700
 I have a skin that sees a lot so 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.340
 the missing skin perfectly the product 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:25.790
 and I find one to moisturize which I 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.830
 I'm pretty happy with this product I'm 

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.840
 I am very much the little body with the stems 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.850
 no fan of the jars in cream of day but 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.460
 I really like this guy for that 

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.910
 heals blow here it is here it is 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.830
