don't see much difference playing on
medium<00:02:50.120> difficulty<00:02:51.230> probably<00:02:52.230> could<00:02:52.350> play<00:02:52.500> on

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
medium difficulty probably could play on

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.860 
medium difficulty probably could play on
hard<00:02:52.860> because<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.520> medium<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:53.970> pretty<00:02:54.120> easy<00:02:54.300> but

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
hard because a medium is pretty easy but

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.660 
hard because a medium is pretty easy but
then<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.740> might<00:02:55.890> have<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.070> be<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> little<00:02:56.490> bit

then I might have to be a little bit

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.360 
then I might have to be a little bit

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
are so I smash these guys and then the

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.570 
are so I smash these guys and then the
gmat<00:05:28.420> pops<00:05:28.600> up<00:05:28.780> and<00:05:29.110> then<00:05:29.920> we<00:05:30.010> get<00:05:30.130> deeper<00:05:30.370> and

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
gmat pops up and then we get deeper and

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.010 
gmat pops up and then we get deeper and
deeper<00:05:30.760> into<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.150> space<00:05:31.360> station<00:05:31.720> station
