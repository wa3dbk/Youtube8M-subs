hello so sequel players today we'll be

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.260 
hello so sequel players today we'll be
going<00:00:03.990> over<00:00:04.310> which<00:00:05.310> scenario<00:00:05.490> map<00:00:05.879> that<00:00:06.120> I

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
going over which scenario map that I

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.930 
going over which scenario map that I
think<00:00:06.660> you<00:00:06.779> should<00:00:07.140> do<00:00:07.379> if<00:00:07.700> you're<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> new

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
think you should do if you're a new

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.150 
think you should do if you're a new
player<00:00:09.150> then<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.900> would<00:00:10.080> suggest<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.769> do

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
player then I would suggest that you do

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.799 
player then I would suggest that you do
normals<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.790> whichever<00:00:12.389> one<00:00:12.690> you're

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
normals and whichever one you're

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.720 
normals and whichever one you're
comfortable<00:00:13.410> with<00:00:13.469> but<00:00:14.160> I'll<00:00:14.250> tell<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.490> which

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
comfortable with but I'll tell you which

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.810 
comfortable with but I'll tell you which
ones<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.269> that<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.809> think<00:00:16.139> it's<00:00:16.289> really<00:00:16.619> good

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
ones that that I think it's really good

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.870 
ones that that I think it's really good
as<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:18.060> normals<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:19.470> drops<00:00:19.830> are<00:00:20.100> usually<00:00:20.760> not

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
as in normals the drops are usually not

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.150 
as in normals the drops are usually not
as<00:00:21.029> good<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.869> starts<00:00:22.260> getting<00:00:22.350> better<00:00:22.740> once

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
as good it starts getting better once

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.800 
as good it starts getting better once
you<00:00:23.369> get<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> normal<00:00:24.359> note<00:00:24.600> 5<00:00:25.439> 1<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.980> up<00:00:26.099> you

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
you get a normal note 5 1 and up you

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.870 
you get a normal note 5 1 and up you
will<00:00:27.810> notice<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.380> because<00:00:28.859> that's<00:00:29.279> when<00:00:29.550> you

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
will notice a because that's when you

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.120 
will notice a because that's when you
start<00:00:30.210> having<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.199> small<00:00:31.439> chance<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.949> get<00:00:32.099> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
start having a small chance to get a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.110 
start having a small chance to get a
three-star<00:00:32.759> item<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:35.250> three-star<00:00:35.730> monsters

three-star item the three-star monsters

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.729 
three-star item the three-star monsters
are<00:00:36.239> so<00:00:36.420> rare<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.290> shouldn't<00:00:37.559> worry

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
are so rare that you shouldn't worry

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.310 
are so rare that you shouldn't worry
about<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:39.210> rare<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.690> get<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
about it and it's rare to get one and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.280 
about it and it's rare to get one and
two<00:00:40.920> stars<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.610> drop<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.390> two<00:00:42.750> star<00:00:42.960> heroes

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
two stars the drop of two star heroes

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100 
two stars the drop of two star heroes
are<00:00:43.530> not<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.489> high<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.940> normals<00:00:45.329> but

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
are not that high in normals but

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.470 
are not that high in normals but
starting<00:00:46.530> from<00:00:46.590> 51<00:00:47.250> normals<00:00:47.640> you're<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
starting from 51 normals you're going to

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.760 
starting from 51 normals you're going to
have<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> small<00:00:49.050> chance<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.440> get<00:00:49.590> some

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
have a small chance to get some

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.920 
have a small chance to get some
three-star<00:00:50.190> items<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> would<00:00:51.420> suggest<00:00:51.539> you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
three-star items so I would suggest you

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.400 
three-star items so I would suggest you
either<00:00:52.260> form<00:00:52.620> 51<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> boss<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.899> stun<00:00:55.230> though

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
either form 51 the boss can stun though

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
either form 51 the boss can stun though
so<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.129> know<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.430> don't<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.699> strong

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
so you know if you don't have strong

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.189 
so you know if you don't have strong
enough<00:00:57.180> heroes<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.660> might<00:00:57.809> not<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:57.989> able<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
enough heroes you might not be able to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.090 
enough heroes you might not be able to
auto<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.190> then<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.449> course<00:01:00.629> 54<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.559> that's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
auto it and then of course 54 and that's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.799 
auto it and then of course 54 and that's
the<00:01:02.309> first<00:01:02.760> met<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:02.969> gives<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the first met that gives you a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.340 
the first met that gives you a
three-star<00:01:04.320> armor<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:04.949> well<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.750> even<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:07.229> you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
three-star armor as well and even if you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.850 
three-star armor as well and even if you
notice<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.860> go<00:01:07.979> back<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> four<00:01:09.119> stars

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
notice if you go back to four stars

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.590 
notice if you go back to four stars
normal<00:01:10.860> mode<00:01:11.010> they<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.400> give<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.090> start<00:01:12.330> items

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
normal mode they all give to start items

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.289 
normal mode they all give to start items
so<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.140> not<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.350> great<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.760> best<00:01:15.000> part

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
so it's not that great so the best part

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.510 
so it's not that great so the best part
once<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.170> hit<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> normal

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
once you can hit you you can do a normal

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.660 
once you can hit you you can do a normal
5154<00:01:20.520> or<00:01:21.150> maybe<00:01:21.450> even<00:01:21.540> 57<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
5154 or maybe even 57 then you have a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.219 
5154 or maybe even 57 then you have a
good<00:01:23.909> chance<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.299> getting<00:01:24.420> three<00:01:24.750> star<00:01:24.930> items

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
good chance of getting three star items

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.160 
good chance of getting three star items
and<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.130> drops<00:01:26.430> are<00:01:26.520> actually<00:01:26.880> decent<00:01:27.170> so

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
and the drops are actually decent so

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.620 
and the drops are actually decent so
that's<00:01:29.100> what<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> would<00:01:29.340> suggest<00:01:29.549> if<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.450> have

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that's what I would suggest if you have

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.090 
that's what I would suggest if you have
if<00:01:30.960> you're<00:01:31.110> strong<00:01:31.380> enough<00:01:31.409> just<00:01:31.890> do<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
if you're strong enough just do a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.530 
if you're strong enough just do a
scenario<00:01:33.060> map<00:01:33.450> five<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.170> up<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.759> 512<00:01:35.759> 512<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
scenario map five and up so 512 512 and

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.840 
scenario map five and up so 512 512 and
of<00:01:36.900> course<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> crafting<00:01:38.040> materials<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.610> all

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
of course the crafting materials are all

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.520 
of course the crafting materials are all
on<00:01:39.150> five<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.979> six<00:01:41.549> stages<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.659> let's<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.290> five

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
on five the six stages so let's see five

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.940 
on five the six stages so let's see five
six<00:01:43.829> or<00:01:44.509> not<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.899> hold<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.229> there's<00:01:46.829> no

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
six or not this one hold on there's no

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.160 
six or not this one hold on there's no
crusting<00:01:47.340> materials<00:01:47.729> yet<00:01:47.939> oh<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.570> dozen

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
crusting materials yet oh that's a dozen

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.679 
crusting materials yet oh that's a dozen
heart<00:01:49.649> hard<00:01:50.220> mode<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.909> normal<00:01:51.329> there's<00:01:51.570> no

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
heart hard mode so normal there's no

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.440 
heart hard mode so normal there's no
crafting<00:01:52.170> material<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.850> starting<00:01:53.850> from<00:01:53.909> hard

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
crafting material so starting from hard

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.959 
crafting material so starting from hard
mode<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:54.990> start<00:01:55.829> getting<00:01:56.040> crafting

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
mode you can start getting crafting

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.190 
mode you can start getting crafting
materials<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.490> they're<00:01:59.490> all<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.659> six

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
materials so and they're all on the six

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.620 
materials so and they're all on the six
stage<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> twelve<00:02:02.219> stage<00:02:02.490> as<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.329> see

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
stage and the twelve stage as you see

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.200 
stage and the twelve stage as you see
right<00:02:03.659> here<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:06.210> hard<00:02:06.869> mode

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
right here and in hard mode

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.480 
right here and in hard mode
the<00:02:08.750> bosses<00:02:09.200> have<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.500> lot<00:02:09.650> more<00:02:09.770> HP<00:02:09.980> but<00:02:10.310> you

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
the bosses have a lot more HP but you

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.950 
the bosses have a lot more HP but you
still<00:02:10.670> want<00:02:10.760> to<00:02:10.850> stick<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.240> the<00:02:11.330> original<00:02:11.420> so

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
still want to stick to the original so

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.500 
still want to stick to the original so
i'll<00:02:12.830> give<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.130> all<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.430> maps<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.360> think

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
i'll give you all the maps that I think

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.480 
i'll give you all the maps that I think
you<00:02:14.570> should<00:02:14.720> do<00:02:14.780> 11<00:02:15.460> 14<00:02:16.460> and<00:02:17.050> then<00:02:18.310> 17<00:02:19.310> is

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
you should do 11 14 and then 17 is

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.730 
you should do 11 14 and then 17 is
doable<00:02:19.700> as<00:02:19.970> well<00:02:20.150> but<00:02:20.360> 14<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:21.020> the<00:02:21.200> easiest<00:02:21.530> in

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
doable as well but 14 is the easiest in

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.050 
doable as well but 14 is the easiest in
my<00:02:21.860> opinion<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:22.400> then<00:02:23.240> in<00:02:23.450> stage<00:02:24.320> two<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:25.880> one

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
my opinion and then in stage two to one

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.620 
my opinion and then in stage two to one
step<00:02:26.630> fairly<00:02:27.200> easy<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.700> then<00:02:28.700> there's<00:02:29.060> 27

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
step fairly easy and then there's 27

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.070 
step fairly easy and then there's 27
which<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.320> like<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:30.740> do<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.720> then<00:02:32.720> of<00:02:33.050> course

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
which I like to do and then of course

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.660 
which I like to do and then of course
you<00:02:33.410> want<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.800> make<00:02:34.190> sure<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.400> have<00:02:34.520> the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
you want to make sure you have the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.910 
you want to make sure you have the
crafting<00:02:35.030> materials<00:02:35.420> which<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> 2<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.650> 12

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
crafting materials which is a 2 to 12

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.760 
crafting materials which is a 2 to 12
and<00:02:37.070> 26<00:02:37.880> but<00:02:38.540> depending<00:02:39.170> on<00:02:39.260> your<00:02:39.350> monsters

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
and 26 but depending on your monsters

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.190 
and 26 but depending on your monsters
you<00:02:40.130> might<00:02:40.400> not<00:02:40.580> be<00:02:41.000> able<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.360> solve<00:02:41.660> them<00:02:41.900> just

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
you might not be able to solve them just

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.240 
you might not be able to solve them just
yet<00:02:42.350> but<00:02:42.620> these<00:02:43.430> maps<00:02:43.760> are<00:02:44.030> vital<00:02:44.870> because

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
yet but these maps are vital because

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.270 
yet but these maps are vital because
what<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:46.700> will<00:02:46.910> get<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.860> Chargers<00:02:48.860> armor

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
what you will get is the Chargers armor

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.330 
what you will get is the Chargers armor
this<00:02:49.730> this<00:02:50.300> one<00:02:50.480> Horseman's<00:02:50.930> armor<00:02:51.320> but<00:02:52.190> not

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
this this one Horseman's armor but not

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.570 
this this one Horseman's armor but not
this<00:02:52.490> one<00:02:52.640> we're<00:02:53.240> going<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.420> go<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.600> the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
this one we're going to go to the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.620 
this one we're going to go to the
crafting<00:02:55.580> materials<00:02:55.940> later<00:02:56.090> but<00:02:56.360> i'll<00:02:56.390> tell

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
crafting materials later but i'll tell

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.560 
crafting materials later but i'll tell
you<00:02:56.720> why<00:02:56.810> it's<00:02:56.960> important<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:57.950> on<00:02:58.130> on

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
you why it's important and then on on

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.900 
you why it's important and then on on
hard<00:02:59.570> mode<00:02:59.630> 31<00:03:00.470> is<00:03:00.740> usually<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.370> most<00:03:01.400> the

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
hard mode 31 is usually the most the

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.750 
hard mode 31 is usually the most the
easiest<00:03:02.240> one<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.620> then<00:03:03.620> there's<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.280> I<00:03:04.580> think

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
easiest one and then there's a I think

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.460 
easiest one and then there's a I think
it's<00:03:05.140> 34<00:03:06.140> did<00:03:06.410> I<00:03:06.440> do<00:03:06.560> yeah<00:03:06.980> 3<00:03:07.310> 4<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:08.470> yeah

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
it's 34 did I do yeah 3 4 and yeah

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.800 
it's 34 did I do yeah 3 4 and yeah
that's<00:03:09.650> pretty<00:03:09.770> much<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.400> then<00:03:10.490> in<00:03:10.810> net

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
that's pretty much it and then in net

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.380 
that's pretty much it and then in net
for<00:03:11.840> for<00:03:12.440> one's<00:03:12.650> good<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:13.580> first<00:03:13.760> map<00:03:14.180> of

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
for for one's good so the first map of

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.260 
for for one's good so the first map of
every<00:03:15.190> section<00:03:16.190> is<00:03:16.310> usually<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.700> good<00:03:16.910> one<00:03:17.090> and

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
every section is usually a good one and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.450 
every section is usually a good one and
starting<00:03:18.170> from<00:03:18.380> five<00:03:18.620> onwards<00:03:18.650> that's<00:03:19.310> when

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
starting from five onwards that's when

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.130 
starting from five onwards that's when
you<00:03:19.610> start<00:03:19.850> getting<00:03:19.910> oops<00:03:20.330> you<00:03:21.260> start<00:03:21.500> getting

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
you start getting oops you start getting

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:30.840 
you start getting oops you start getting
oops<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.770> start<00:03:25.040> getting<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.940> four-star

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
oops you start getting the four-star

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.920 
oops you start getting the four-star
weapons<00:03:31.850> so<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.120> can<00:03:32.330> see<00:03:32.480> right<00:03:32.510> here<00:03:32.750> you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
weapons so you can see right here you

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.380 
weapons so you can see right here you
get<00:03:33.050> a<00:03:33.080> hit<00:03:33.260> machinery<00:03:33.740> swords<00:03:34.160> I've<00:03:34.940> gotten<00:03:35.300> a

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
get a hit machinery swords I've gotten a

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.050 
get a hit machinery swords I've gotten a
couple<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:36.190> 54<00:03:37.190> is<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.400> one<00:03:37.550> that<00:03:37.730> gives<00:03:37.940> you

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
couple and 54 is the one that gives you

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.150 
couple and 54 is the one that gives you
the<00:03:38.120> armor<00:03:38.660> at<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.780> 4th<00:03:39.020> armored<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.530> you

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
the armor at the 4th armored and you

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.500 
the armor at the 4th armored and you
need<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.370> do<00:03:40.460> a<00:03:40.490> lot<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.730> runs<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.090> think<00:03:41.330> I<00:03:41.360> did

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
need to do a lot of runs I think I did

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.350 
need to do a lot of runs I think I did
like<00:03:41.720> 100<00:03:42.530> plus<00:03:42.710> runs<00:03:42.950> before<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.310> got<00:03:43.520> one<00:03:43.640> but

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
like 100 plus runs before I got one but

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.270 
like 100 plus runs before I got one but
it's<00:03:44.390> worth<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.780> because<00:03:44.960> you<00:03:45.590> get<00:03:45.710> two<00:03:45.950> bonus

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
it's worth it because you get two bonus

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.040 
it's worth it because you get two bonus
stats<00:03:46.520> instead<00:03:46.820> of<00:03:46.910> one<00:03:47.180> which<00:03:47.750> I'll<00:03:47.900> show<00:03:48.020> you

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
stats instead of one which I'll show you

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.800 
stats instead of one which I'll show you
in<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.260> little<00:03:48.380> bit<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.880> 5<00:03:49.880> 11<00:03:50.330> is<00:03:50.420> really<00:03:50.660> good

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
in a little bit and 5 11 is really good

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.540 
in a little bit and 5 11 is really good
too<00:03:51.040> but<00:03:52.040> it's<00:03:52.190> very<00:03:52.310> hard<00:03:52.610> though<00:03:54.040> 570<00:03:55.040> gives

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
too but it's very hard though 570 gives

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.670 
too but it's very hard though 570 gives
the<00:03:55.700> accessory<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.690> really<00:03:57.080> good<00:03:57.230> as<00:03:57.320> well<00:03:57.500> so

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
the accessory and really good as well so

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.000 
the accessory and really good as well so
if<00:03:57.800> you<00:03:57.890> can<00:03:58.070> so<00:03:58.730> low<00:03:58.790> 57<00:03:59.480> then<00:03:59.840> I<00:04:00.170> suggest<00:04:00.770> that
