00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.620
 it takes 10 percent of acceptance on 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.450
 water weight if we measured 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.510
 water only a liter of water 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.930
 put 100 g of vinegar ok on the 10th for 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.420
 hundred is said to be acidulated to 10 percent 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:31.270
 then you break place in the pebbles na 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:33.760
 that you have available and in the water 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.199
 slightly acidulated you prepare with 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.809
 a whisk a spoon what 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:43.210
 you want and create a sort of vortex 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.210
 inside the water when you are 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:51.059
 created a nice vortex go to the center 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.059
 and pour your egg 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.059
 at this point if it boils too strong 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.620
 how it's doing my lower 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.889
 immediately the flame must always be alone 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:04.239
 take a look at that beautiful mozzarella 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:06.009
 it's just perfect cold water and I come 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.280
 put them on absorbent paper 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:13.450
 gently I am a man there is so it goes 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.939
 done gently ok we put them on 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.159
 here with the scissors 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.630
 we are going to cut because they are not alone 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.420
 inside and if you are not delicate the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.070
 break let's cut the ends 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.049
 those that are frayed in this 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.969
 way and we put them in a baking dish and we 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.670
 not even his two one by one baking dish a little 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.710
 little one because it is really enough for me if 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.090
 you make an appetizer you can do 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.700
 these eggs in a baking dish a little more 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.259
 large where all are inside 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.840
 look at something happens when like 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.469
 salt goes to eat will cut the egg and 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.469

 look how wonderful 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.179
 the beautiful liquid yolk will come out 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.369
 it can even be presented at the table 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.380
