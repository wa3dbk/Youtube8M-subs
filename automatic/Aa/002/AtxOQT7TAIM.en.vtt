00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.350 
hi this is Michael Kennedy and now we're
going<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.980> talk<00:00:08.220> about<00:00:08.250> hosting<00:00:08.970> your<00:00:09.120> web

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
going to talk about hosting your web

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.570 
going to talk about hosting your web
application<00:00:10.080> built<00:00:10.620> on<00:00:10.769> the<00:00:10.889> Microsoft<00:00:11.370> stack

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
application built on the Microsoft stack

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.070 
application built on the Microsoft stack
in<00:00:12.049> Microsoft<00:00:13.049> Azure<00:00:13.940> so<00:00:14.940> Microsoft<00:00:15.330> Azure<00:00:15.690> is

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
in Microsoft Azure so Microsoft Azure is

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.550 
in Microsoft Azure so Microsoft Azure is
a<00:00:16.410> really<00:00:16.949> large<00:00:18.050> full-featured<00:00:19.050> cloud

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
a really large full-featured cloud

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.410 
a really large full-featured cloud
hosting<00:00:20.070> platform<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:20.789> all<00:00:20.939> kinds<00:00:21.359> of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
hosting platform for all kinds of

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.240 
hosting platform for all kinds of
applications<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.380> especially<00:00:22.650> tuned

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
applications and it's especially tuned

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.410 
applications and it's especially tuned
for<00:00:23.490> hosting<00:00:23.850> asp.net<00:00:24.449> applications<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> what

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
for hosting asp.net applications so what

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.820 
for hosting asp.net applications so what
we're<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.080> first<00:00:28.289> see<00:00:28.680> how<00:00:28.769> to

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
we're going to do is first see how to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.439 
we're going to do is first see how to
create<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.160> website<00:00:29.340> we're<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> take<00:00:30.300> an

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
create a website we're going to take an

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.080 
create a website we're going to take an
existing<00:00:30.990> website<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.619> push<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.520> into<00:00:32.700> Azure

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
existing website and push it into Azure

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.770 
existing website and push it into Azure
on<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.320> cloud<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.040> running<00:00:35.309> there

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
on the cloud and see it running there

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.470 
on the cloud and see it running there
okay<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.380> what<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.100> need<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.610> log<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.329> to

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
okay so what you need to do is log in to

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.440 
okay so what you need to do is log in to
manage<00:00:39.840> windows<00:00:40.469> azure<00:00:40.680> comm<00:00:41.360> even<00:00:42.360> though

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
manage windows azure comm even though

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.540 
manage windows azure comm even though
the<00:00:42.570> name<00:00:42.719> recently<00:00:43.200> changed<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.829> domain<00:00:44.340> has

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the name recently changed the domain has

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310 
the name recently changed the domain has
not<00:00:44.760> when<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.539> log<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.899> you'll<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.170> at<00:00:46.260> your

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
not when you log in you'll be at your

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.869 
not when you log in you'll be at your
dashboard<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.250> have<00:00:47.340> many<00:00:47.610> many

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
dashboard here and you have many many

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.639 
dashboard here and you have many many
choices<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.539> we<00:00:48.750> could<00:00:48.930> create<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.320> cloud

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
choices so we could create a cloud

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.459 
choices so we could create a cloud
service<00:00:50.300> we<00:00:51.300> could<00:00:51.539> create<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.840> database<00:00:52.230> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
service we could create a database to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.200 
service we could create a database to
connect<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> our<00:00:53.039> web<00:00:53.219> application<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:54.059> could

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
connect to our web application we could

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.580 
connect to our web application we could
create<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.510> virtual<00:00:54.930> machine<00:00:55.350> for

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
create a virtual machine for

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.040 
create a virtual machine for
infrastructure<00:00:56.280> as<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> service<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.750> creates

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
infrastructure as a service it creates

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.860 
infrastructure as a service it creates
some<00:00:58.289> HD<00:00:59.219> insight<00:00:59.550> Hadoop<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.239> type<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> things

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
some HD insight Hadoop a type of things

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.590 
some HD insight Hadoop a type of things
we<00:01:01.590> could<00:01:01.739> even<00:01:01.890> set<00:01:02.280> up<00:01:02.309> caching<00:01:02.789> however

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
we could even set up caching however

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.810 
we could even set up caching however
well<00:01:04.049> typically<00:01:04.589> people<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.280> just<00:01:05.489> host

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
well typically people do to just host

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.429 
well typically people do to just host
their<00:01:06.119> their<00:01:06.479> basic<00:01:06.780> website<00:01:06.960> when<00:01:07.320> they're

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
their their basic website when they're

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.070 
their their basic website when they're
getting<00:01:07.650> started<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> create<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.610> website

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
getting started is to create a website

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.000 
getting started is to create a website
because<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> couple<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.740> them<00:01:10.860> here

you can see the website has been

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.499 
you can see the website has been
successfully<00:01:49.140> created<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.649> could<00:01:49.829> use<00:01:50.299> git<00:01:51.299> or
