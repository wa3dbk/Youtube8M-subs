here<00:02:04.469> which<00:02:04.649> goes<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.950> little<00:02:05.280> more<00:02:05.430> in-depth

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
here which goes a little more in-depth

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.330 
here which goes a little more in-depth
as<00:02:06.149> far<00:02:06.390> as<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.110> aperture<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> ISO

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
as far as the aperture and the ISO

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.150 
as far as the aperture and the ISO

the<00:02:31.410> Reds<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.100> I<00:02:32.280> mean<00:02:32.430> they<00:02:32.550> came<00:02:32.700> out<00:02:32.850> so

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
the Reds and the I mean they came out so

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.200 
the Reds and the I mean they came out so
clear<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.840> was<00:02:34.350> thrown<00:02:35.190> back<00:02:35.400> by<00:02:35.460> the<00:02:35.820> actual

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
clear I was thrown back by the actual

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.810 
clear I was thrown back by the actual
image<00:02:36.600> quality<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.740> maximum<00:02:38.280> aperture

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
image quality the maximum aperture

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.290 
image quality the maximum aperture
actually<00:02:39.300> varies<00:02:39.690> between<00:02:40.070> 3.0<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.130> 4.7<00:02:42.120> and

actually varies between 3.0 to 4.7 and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.780 
actually varies between 3.0 to 4.7 and
then<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.840> have<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.230> panoramic<00:02:43.980> view<00:02:44.550> which

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
frame then you line up you see that

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.920 
frame then you line up you see that
little<00:02:59.520> cursor<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.450> line<00:03:00.690> up<00:03:00.720> that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
little cursor you have to line up that

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.160 
little cursor you have to line up that
cursor<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.790> where<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.060> has<00:03:03.240> it<00:03:03.450> here<00:03:03.870> on

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
get your full panoramic view of if you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.100 
get your full panoramic view of if you
look<00:03:14.940> in<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> front<00:03:15.330> look<00:03:15.570> at<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.870> that's

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
look in the front look at that that's

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.430 
look in the front look at that that's
the<00:03:16.290> 5x<00:03:16.770> zoom<00:03:16.980> look<00:03:17.520> how<00:03:17.670> far<00:03:18.510> out<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:19.110> can<00:03:19.290> go

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
the 5x zoom look how far out it can go

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.870 
the 5x zoom look how far out it can go
so<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.710> can<00:03:19.830> take<00:03:20.010> pretty<00:03:20.220> good<00:03:20.310> pictures<00:03:20.730> if
