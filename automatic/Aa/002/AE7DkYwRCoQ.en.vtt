00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.730
 hello everybody knows so 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.980
 today a new video new 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.760
 how tahri on overflow domination 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.830
 Territorial war 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.950
 so as you could see on the 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.089
 title of the video is a nuclear I 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.249
 do not know yet if I will specify 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:21.289
 in a small but it's my first 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.669
 in any case I had never done 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.499
 sure nuclear I never really 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:28.640
 tried to do anyway and so 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:29.569
 it's a key that will be a little bit with 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.480
 several weapons that I had made 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:34.730
 some 1 2 million kinect the dessert 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.949
 a dozen clubists have a little bit to 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.840
 flap w a little that a 23 a little bit of 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.489
 everything but here you are 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.579
 in any case I have a lot of things to 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.129
 tell you so that's when when we 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.780
 know right away with the next 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.699
 videos that were going on my channel so 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.589
 my two montages in that editing 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.239
 that 4 of the waters of giving called 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.769
 django I released the trailer there is little 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.929
 almost a month or so I would say and 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.190
 you expect it a lot so I know 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.570
 the team I have for a long time 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.910
 given that bacon thriller and 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.080
 feel they already had all the clips 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.960
 but I have a lot of progress with the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.090
 editors and one class had edited by 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.480
 kode9 and I will spend the club lorrain 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.530
 are two days ahead tell them good 24 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.650
 hours after I passed the crisis it 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.030
 had already finished actually so what is 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.080
 rather rare we will say turn poetry and 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.870
 usually they take a little more than 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.870
 time here he was super motivated so 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.190
 he did a pretty good thing we were 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.470
 go see him so this weekend dives of 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.690
 claude after editing that will be 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.800
 edited by gaia nv so that's going to be a 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.850
 little shorter than I have less of whom 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.100
 think neither ping 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.520
 but it's going to be very, very good too 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.510
 wise little vulgar and so power on 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.560
 the prices so learned yesterday me I say 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.330
 we did not put all the dncaj 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.760
 from the beginning of the series 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.040
 until the end so we can see that at 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.980
 from the first run I was 11 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.580
 in a row I believe with only a 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.360
 equipped with dsr pounds except ballista I 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.950
 believe so here's the clip for dessert and 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.420
 on the second run you will see 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.610
 it's rather ballista is a bit of the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.380
 cw anyway I'm friends of the little ones 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.580
 finally you and take away the little moments 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.830
 it would happen better than people if 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.360
 pale is he has been no kilo what I 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.920
 wanted to remove but in any case where you 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.250
 and to have all the quileutes 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.450
 the kg injection but what do I 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.890
 will tell you else also the skyline 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.690
 we would not have spoken in may hall 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.790
 navigate beyond the description puts 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.860
 so the scalea so left the first 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.650
 lentz typing of money was that night 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.350
 of France so we won against 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.640
 the bnf in the final is a big big fat 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.810
 match so there is unfortunately the 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.150
 stream did not work for this finale 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.860
 but you were given the scores on 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:52.850
 twitter so it was a bep to the world 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:55.370
 we finished at 6 5 so it was super tight 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.300
 that I can tell you very big 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.590
 match but luckily I'm telling you 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.630
 say no stream so no 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.360
 replay available of the tc people 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.510
 who have emotions those who were on 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.510
 square 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.850
 it's a pity it happens the points of 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.209
 problem connection with the gear in all 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.959
 case a rather nice action so where 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.760
 people buy a little bit 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.900
 differently than we have this age spawn I 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.070
 thought he was pretty solid 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.380
 however once again a little 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.550
 not bad pitcher the wii has in my back 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.230
 a cord that had a performance in 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.790
 the taxant I have not seen them but I 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.530
 did not think he could spawn in the 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.930
 back when we were here no it's good to 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.390
 know you see what's in front of me 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.560
 I was looking for the glue is just a 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.670
 little capers and I apply the bowl this 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.510
 that I was a little distracted that everything 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.500
 the dough is aged to older 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.400
 attract him in the cudgel calculators 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.530
 for a bit of a pity 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.930
 and there I put internal but he likes 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.580
 kill any deaths of my running in front of who 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.040
 tarde in ta'qali killed at least five 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.040
 soldiers but you'll see that these 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.780
 games and cold which approved there w 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.980
 in fact what is decided that I 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.180
 play and I will convince you in good 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.860
 we talked about internship did not make me 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.250
 account that I linked a little bit in 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.150
 So here I crack and the little one 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.959
 lottery indicated 15 quines in a row and 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.070
 in fact I was not aware of 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.670
 chained I think that throw or a 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.190
 dozen in a row like this but 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.050
 you normally have I'll have the 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.760
 title so extermination chained museum 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.560
 layoffs that's not bad like so 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.269
 the brutal waze I chained super fast 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.800
 happened 15 of cronies of 25 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.150
 Super 8 kg movies the challenge by car to 4 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.110
 that I had never done and I had not 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.580
 of all kind were in fact I was saying 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.130
 makes good weather but I am a brutal 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.450
 it's a lot of 25 so I 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.669
 not sure what to do I had a little 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.700
 the pressure and 70 have this nuclear 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.530
 it could be nice and finally ben 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.200
 that's actually the moment I know 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.530
 not or too much where I was I was at 29 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.419
 so here's the skyline anyway but 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.350
