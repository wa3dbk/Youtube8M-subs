00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.240 
there's some reasonably good stuff on
there<00:05:08.509> so<00:05:09.509> in<00:05:09.930> summing<00:05:10.319> up<00:05:10.650> if<00:05:10.949> you<00:05:11.039> want<00:05:11.189> a

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
there so in summing up if you want a

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.879 
there so in summing up if you want a
cheap<00:05:11.490> airline<00:05:11.879> yes<00:05:12.389> it's<00:05:13.139> probably<00:05:13.409> a<00:05:13.650> good

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
cheap airline yes it's probably a good

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.730 
cheap airline yes it's probably a good
option<00:05:14.129> out<00:05:14.580> of<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.389> cheap<00:05:15.719> options<00:05:16.199> it'll

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
option out of the cheap options it'll

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.469 
option out of the cheap options it'll
get<00:05:16.889> you<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.009> cheap<00:05:17.310> ticket<00:05:17.550> most<00:05:17.909> likely<00:05:18.360> if

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
get you a cheap ticket most likely if

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.269 
get you a cheap ticket most likely if
you're<00:05:18.569> booked<00:05:18.719> in<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:18.930> right<00:05:19.110> day<00:05:19.319> just<00:05:19.979> use

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:20.279 
you're booked in the right day just use

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:21.980 
you're booked in the right day just use
their<00:05:20.520> system<00:05:20.729> to<00:05:21.150> check<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.479> different<00:05:21.810> days

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
their system to check the different days

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.469 
their system to check the different days
the<00:05:22.680> day<00:05:22.889> before<00:05:23.129> our<00:05:23.460> flights<00:05:23.969> and<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.300> day

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
the day before our flights and the day

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.719 
the day before our flights and the day
after<00:05:25.020> our<00:05:25.050> flights<00:05:25.560> were<00:05:25.949> actually<00:05:26.370> twice

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
after our flights were actually twice

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.969 
after our flights were actually twice
the<00:05:26.969> price<00:05:27.240> of<00:05:27.599> the<00:05:27.750> days<00:05:27.960> of<00:05:28.229> our<00:05:28.439> flights<00:05:28.770> we

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
the price of the days of our flights we

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.579 
the price of the days of our flights we
actually<00:05:29.310> changed<00:05:29.909> our<00:05:30.259> preference<00:05:31.259> when<00:05:31.439> we

00:05:31.579 --> 00:05:31.589 
actually changed our preference when we

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.879 
actually changed our preference when we
saw<00:05:31.830> that<00:05:32.099> we<00:05:32.219> could<00:05:32.370> get<00:05:32.550> half<00:05:33.509> half<00:05:34.379> the<00:05:34.650> cost

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
saw that we could get half half the cost

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.499 
saw that we could get half half the cost
of<00:05:35.129> flight<00:05:35.400> if<00:05:35.550> we<00:05:35.669> fly<00:05:35.879> on<00:05:35.969> a<00:05:36.029> different<00:05:36.300> day

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:36.509 
of flight if we fly on a different day

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:38.089 
of flight if we fly on a different day
so<00:05:36.569> we<00:05:36.870> just<00:05:37.020> changed<00:05:37.349> our<00:05:37.500> day<00:05:37.680> so<00:05:37.740> if<00:05:37.979> you've

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
so we just changed our day so if you've

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.010 
so we just changed our day so if you've
got<00:05:38.219> flexibility<00:05:38.879> to<00:05:39.029> do<00:05:39.210> that<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.750> won't<00:05:39.930> be

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
got flexibility to do that and won't be

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.350 
got flexibility to do that and won't be
with<00:05:40.169> you<00:05:40.289> all<00:05:40.439> as<00:05:40.589> well<00:05:42.319> so<00:05:43.319> yeah<00:05:44.360> generally

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
with you all as well so yeah generally

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.079 
with you all as well so yeah generally
frustrating<00:05:46.319> the<00:05:46.409> staff<00:05:46.680> are<00:05:46.860> okay<00:05:47.250> but<00:05:47.639> it

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.089 
frustrating the staff are okay but it

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:50.389 
frustrating the staff are okay but it
feels<00:05:48.509> cheap<00:05:48.810> everything<00:05:49.469> about<00:05:50.069> the<00:05:50.250> airline

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:50.399 
feels cheap everything about the airline

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:52.369 
feels cheap everything about the airline
from<00:05:51.000> when<00:05:51.180> you're<00:05:51.300> from<00:05:51.779> the<00:05:51.930> booking

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
from when you're from the booking

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.589 
from when you're from the booking
process<00:05:52.649> to<00:05:53.279> the<00:05:53.370> whole<00:05:53.550> process<00:05:54.089> we<00:05:54.330> actually

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
process to the whole process we actually

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.389 
process to the whole process we actually
took<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:54.960> media<00:05:55.139> relations<00:05:55.529> department<00:05:55.949> as

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:56.399 
took the media relations department as

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.959 
took the media relations department as
well<00:05:56.610> and<00:05:57.110> so<00:05:58.189> there<00:05:59.189> goes<00:05:59.339> the<00:05:59.610> feeling<00:05:59.909> of

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
well and so there goes the feeling of

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.089 
well and so there goes the feeling of
cheap<00:06:00.270> as<00:06:00.449> well<00:06:00.629> the<00:06:00.779> whole<00:06:00.990> thing<00:06:01.529> was<00:06:01.740> a<00:06:01.770> very

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
cheap as well the whole thing was a very

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:05.600 
cheap as well the whole thing was a very
very<00:06:02.219> cheap<00:06:02.520> experience<00:06:03.240> but<00:06:04.370> so<00:06:05.370> with<00:06:05.520> the

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
very cheap experience but so with the

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.139 
very cheap experience but so with the
fares<00:06:05.879> so<00:06:06.919> if<00:06:07.919> but<00:06:08.159> if<00:06:08.279> you<00:06:08.370> want<00:06:08.520> comfort<00:06:08.849> you

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:09.149 
fares so if but if you want comfort you

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:10.790 
fares so if but if you want comfort you
want<00:06:09.270> to<00:06:09.330> be<00:06:09.389> treated<00:06:09.689> really<00:06:09.839> well<00:06:09.960> and<00:06:10.560> you

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
want to be treated really well and you

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.230 
want to be treated really well and you
want<00:06:10.889> to<00:06:11.009> really<00:06:11.370> make<00:06:11.490> the<00:06:11.849> most<00:06:12.000> of<00:06:12.149> the

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
want to really make the most of the

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.480 
want to really make the most of the
flight<00:06:12.539> itself<00:06:13.080> you<00:06:13.830> might<00:06:13.979> want<00:06:14.159> to<00:06:14.189> consider

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
flight itself you might want to consider

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.670 
flight itself you might want to consider
one<00:06:14.699> of<00:06:14.729> the<00:06:14.909> other<00:06:14.939> airlines<00:06:15.500> because<00:06:16.500> you

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
one of the other airlines because you

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.980 
one of the other airlines because you
probably<00:06:16.860> get<00:06:17.069> better<00:06:17.219> service<00:06:17.699> but<00:06:17.939> if<00:06:18.899> you

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990 
probably get better service but if you

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.600 
probably get better service but if you
want<00:06:19.259> to<00:06:19.319> cheap<00:06:19.469> fare<00:06:19.740> these<00:06:20.099> guys<00:06:20.310> aren't<00:06:20.550> a

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
want to cheap fare these guys aren't a

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.610 
want to cheap fare these guys aren't a
bad<00:06:20.759> option<00:06:20.909> so<00:06:21.389> anyway<00:06:22.050> hope<00:06:22.439> that

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
bad option so anyway hope that

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.610 
bad option so anyway hope that
