hi guys um today I'm gonna make a
wireless<00:00:05.460> mouse<00:00:05.790> out<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.629> a<00:00:06.870> wired<00:00:07.290> mouse

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
wireless mouse out of a wired mouse

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.530 
wireless mouse out of a wired mouse
basically<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.840> just<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:11.090> can<00:00:12.090> if

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
basically this is just so you can if

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.419 
basically this is just so you can if
your<00:00:12.780> computers<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.590> one<00:00:13.769> side<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.190> room

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
your computers on one side the room

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.670 
your computers on one side the room
should<00:00:15.150> watching<00:00:15.509> movies<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:16.020> something<00:00:16.170> you

can use the most from your bed and it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.060 
can use the most from your bed and it
uses<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:21.390> antennas<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.260> whatnot<00:00:22.590> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
uses the antennas and whatnot to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.220 
uses the antennas and whatnot to
transmit<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:25.580> science<00:00:26.580> words<00:00:27.140> to<00:00:28.140> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
transmit it science words to the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.650 
transmit it science words to the
computer<00:00:28.699> so<00:00:29.699> I'm<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.060> teach<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.330> guys
