00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.040
 Hello everyone, I want to review today 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.440
 your charger besides 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.790
 winter 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.780
 the batteries in us started to sit down people 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.400
 started asking 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.530
 interest is ask tell mean 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.240
 I use this charger 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.610
 device it means on the charger 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.960
 automatic device same 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.800
 charging starting device without on 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.650
 prestart 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.469
 but you can run cars from it 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:43.260
 did not run but people told me that 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:47.429
 can we mean modelka pw 325 orion so 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.909
 look box is capable harry here it is 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.739
 the same as before the box means here 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:58.799
 here the parameters of his listed he 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:02.069
 I apologize to anyone 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:04.199
 interesting we pause read with 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:10.400
 bottom side is the same picture here 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.400
 the same if someone needs a barcode and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.880
 so I bought the charger back in 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.620
 2009 I end 14 and the truth 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.460
 to tell 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:28.620
 A number of people often used this 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.680
 used every five landed 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.970
 battery even i will tell you that 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.060
 it turned out to restore the battery 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.110
 students of 9 volts 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.910
 instruction 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.240
 Well, actually nothing here 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.240
 there is nothing special here about measures 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:56.030
 security here and how to use it 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.030
 device device is up to 20 amps 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.190
 no switch LEDs have the network 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.790
 have when we plug in and here 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.530
 This is an indicator. I don't know what it is . 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.010
 we burn all the time means 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.630
 how to put on charge connect to 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.220
 the battery is this regulator in 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.920
 extreme left position that is on 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.420
 minimum connect to the battery 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.220
 turn on the outlet and start to turn up 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.970
 I have the right value 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.239
 battery 75k means we put on 7 and 5 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.700
 amps and that's what I mean I certainly can 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.190
 charge more current you fast a 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.730
 I'm still a proponent to charge 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.280
 the standard can say so 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.320
 75-ku I will charge 75 amps in 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.959
 for 10 hours but more often it is 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.420
 The longer I put somewhere at ten o'clock 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.239
 take off 6 hours 15-20 so usually 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.410
 It turns out as a rule we put on the night 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.510
 never had any problems 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.690
 charges well and even if we leave 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.010
 at 10 o'clock here around the fourth hour 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.250
 This is more precisely the sixth number begins 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.000
 a little crawl down that is 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.900
 crawls somewhere up to 1 to 2 amps and 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.239
 stays like this 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.670
 the rest of the time on any battery 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.910
 whatever you buy new 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.560
 I recommend the battery to read all 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.329
 still 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.940
 manual to the battery and the time from 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.950
 time to do and in this his you his though 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.570
 to your charger at home 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.730
 he temperature drops a little 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.549
 recharged and so on and so forth 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.299
 but I will not go deep into 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.140
 the details 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:44.280
 that means the bottom of us here 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.280
 here is a readable sticker 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:04:04.170
 so without reloading read the instructions 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:07.300
 there is a department behind us here 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.620
 clear two terminals plus or minus 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:16.660
 and power 220 fan that is when 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.080
 we turn our device into a rocket with us 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.890
 the fan immediately turns on without 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:27.070
 load without load so i am now 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:35.170
 I will sort out the topics so as not to accidentally 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:40.360
 closed the departure immediately caught fire green 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:42.490
 indicator and hum fan but how 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.710
 whatever we do without any load 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.870
 no movement no 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.020
 there is no reaction but when we connect 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.970
 battery then immediately turning into 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.560
 we rises tension can 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.600
 use as power supply 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.030
 I even bought an ipad bike 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.410
 roamed home wheels I brought a compressor 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.020
 to pruning will be told in another 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.560
 video here brought your car 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.570
 compressor 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.460
 they let us down as we just pump 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.580
 not yet purchased a pump at the moment from 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:14.350
 I'm not here now decided to disappoint and 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.420
 I downloaded these here with the help of this 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.630
 same benefits used as a power supply 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.910
 then he shakes for 10 amps oh this 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.980
 I need to say well, that is, if less 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.190
 10 amps put on the compressor then 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:30.670
 Still, he does not give me a little 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.350
 turned off all this is not necessary well that is here 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.550
 This charger works great if 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.190
 Someone thought to buy not to buy 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.280
 jumps can recommend first he 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.530
 light compact and comfortable officer 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.570
 transformers him heavy here 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.840
 takes up little space keep it 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.730
 naturally given at home there is a battery 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.160
 discharged then still stored in it 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:55.330
 the car will be equal to the battery bolo 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.950
 that everything is home well, actually 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.860
 then you need something there 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.560
 we are counted 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.080
 have they ever been that sturdy by chance 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.310
 punitive only removed the terminal 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:09.289
 pain did not have time yet to unplug 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.979
 the terminal of pain was still terrible 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:15.110
 consist of protection if the terminals to the gate is it 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.030
 Immediately breaks it is necessary to remove it from 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.129
 sockets wait 30 seconds again 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:23.199
 plug in it will start well then 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:27.949
 there is such a device here oregon 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:30.349
 pw 325 for some home 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.969
 I can recommend using great 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:33.800
 the device has shown itself well now 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:38.419
 how old am i the fourteenth year am i 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:41.900
 bought somewhere early in the fall of 2009 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:43.879
 more than five years I will serve and charge 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.449
 and I and father gave me a brush 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:48.860
 use a bunch of batteries a bunch of times 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:50.719
 came and even launched to Kiev I 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.180
 he himself did not let the people become released 

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:54.860
 Under work, I recommend 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.099
 Of course, always read the instructions 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:01.580
 always read instructions from your 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:03.169
 battery what to its not all 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.860
 Thank you all for your attention and see you 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.860
