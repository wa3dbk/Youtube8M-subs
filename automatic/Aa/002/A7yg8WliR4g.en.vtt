00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.179
&gt;&gt;Hi I'm Chris from Music Radar and we're
here with Tommy Trash and we're at the

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.240
Magnetic festival in Prague. Tommy you're
about to go on, we can here drum rolls, excited?

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.090
&gt;&gt;Very. Its my first time in Prague so...
It sounded crazy out there.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.210
&gt;&gt;Yes. And what have you got lined up? I mean
the majority of your set now must be your

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.480
own material, is it?

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.020
&gt;&gt;Yeah a lot of it is depending on the gig but
yeah there's a lot of stuff that's been released,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.850
that's been tweaked and edited and there's
also some unreleased stuff as well.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.850
&gt;&gt;So how is it with getting tunes and finding
tunes nowadays, because the internet has xxx

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.010
so everybody can get a lot of what used to
be maybe exclusive and vinyl dig. Do you

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.710
have to work a lot harder now than you did
when you started?

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah there is because there's just so many
more things to sift through, so its a full

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.370
time job

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.719
&gt;&gt;So do you find yourself editing your own
tracks on planes?

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:10.910
&gt;&gt;Editing on planes and in hotel rooms, just
anywhere I can, any spare moment I have I'm

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.780
on the laptop.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.390
&gt;&gt;And what are you using, Ableton?

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.280
&gt;&gt;Ableton yeah, I mean I don't think theres
anything else really suitable for it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.990
&gt;&gt;And that's producing as well, or are you
a logi guy?

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.220
&gt;&gt;No, Ableton everything. Keep it all in house.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.229
&gt;&gt;Have you ever thought about going down the
Ableton route for DJing? Like Funk xxxx?

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.799
&gt;&gt;No no, not interested.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.020
&gt;&gt;Why is that though, are you still track
to track?

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.189
&gt;&gt;Well I used to use Serato back in the
day and I always spilled vodka on their laptops

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.369
so... That was a pretty good reason.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.290
&gt;&gt;Yeah, go through enough laptops then...

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.600
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.530
&gt;&gt;So now are you going to spill vodka on the
decks tonight?

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.860
&gt;&gt;No, no vodka free tonight... maybe a bit
of Heineken though!

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.640
&gt;&gt;And what have you got coming up?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.909
&gt;&gt;So there's the release on Boysnoize Records,
the remix for Destructo on that. Then there's

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:08.159
another tune on Size Records, an original
called Monkey In Love and we've done a film

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:12.079
clip, its kind of like a follow up from Monkey
See Monkey Do. We've teamed up with Jim Henson

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.909
crew, they do film clips with Jim Henson puppets.

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.480
&gt;&gt;Wow so that's mega exciting

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.480
&gt;&gt;Yeah I've been a fan of The Muppets since
I was a baby so to have a film clip...

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.909
&gt;&gt;So how was it sorted out though?

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:32.790
&gt;&gt;My manager just sprinkled his manager dust
and made it happen

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.609
&gt;&gt;So literally you just said "I want The Muppets"
and they just organised it

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:37.599
&gt;&gt;In a nutshell.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.459
&gt;&gt;So what's next? Ridley Scott?!

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.459
&gt;&gt;I don't know what's next, I mean that's
as far ahead as I can think right now.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.549
&gt;&gt;And let's just quickly talk about DJing,
generally, I mean you started in vinyl, like

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:58.049
you said, in Serato, and you've gone from
proper old school DJing in bars and stuff,

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.549
you've done the journey. How is it now for
you? Because is this like a whole different

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.200
experience, this front facing, mainroom gigs?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.879
&gt;&gt;Now it feels more like you're playing a
concert rather than doing a gig, rather than

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:18.089
doing like a DJ gig. I find that now people
come into the shows and they're expecting

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:23.319
to hear my original music or my remixes, or
anything that I've worked on that they're

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:31.290
familiar with. Whereas back in the day I didn't
really have a lot of tunes or my own stuff.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.919
&gt;&gt;So do you wish your sets could be longer?
I mean I know you're a busy guy but for a

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.100
guy that's come from the old DJ style...

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:46.819
&gt;&gt;Yeah I mean it would be nice to mix it up
a bit more and be able to do the really long

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.400
sets and play a bit more groove records, but
this is what it is right now so I'm not complaining,

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.249
and its still such a rush and such an honour
to be able to travel the world and play my

00:03:57.559 --> 00:04:06.099
music to lots of people. I feel really lucky,
its really a dream come true.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.010
&gt;&gt;So the dream's come true. What's next, what's
the next dream for Tommy Trash?

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.180
&gt;&gt;A singer in a band..! Haha no, I don't know,
I have no idea. I guess I just want to keep

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.099
doing what I'm doing and I guess I might start
making a little bit more underground stuff

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.490
at the moment and start experimenting a bit
more again.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:31.319
&gt;&gt;Does success enable you to do that? Just
be a bit more free on what you produce?

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:38.319
&gt;&gt;I think yes and no. I think that if you
have a big song and you're known for that

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.879
kind of sound people just want to hear more
of that.

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.100
&gt;&gt;Is that pressure for you in the studio?

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.759
&gt;&gt;I think its a little bit of pressure.

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.310
&gt;&gt;Do you open Ableton and go "right, that
was big..."

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:55.710
&gt;&gt;Well I don't do that as much anymore but
I used to do that once I had my first breakthrough

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.060
at the end. I did futurexxx which used the
same lead sound. It literally was the same

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:08.729
kind of thing but cut in a new way so, back
then I definitely used to use a lot of the

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:16.729
same presets from song to song. I think thats
run its course and now I'm just up for anything

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.500
and just experimenting again.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.139
&gt;&gt;And finally, what's on your tech rider?
What do you ask for in the DJ booth? What's

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:23.349
your tech rider?

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:36.349
&gt;&gt; 2 CDxx, 2000, 3 is good and 4 is amazing,
and just the DJ 900. 800 will do.

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.389
&gt;&gt;What's the worst set up you've ever DJed
on ever?

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:48.860
&gt;&gt;You know those dead on push buttons ones
from the 90s or maybe from the 80s, yeah I

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.659
was scared of them, I didn't use them too
much.

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:53.430
&gt;&gt;You can't really pitch on them can you...

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:00.430
&gt;&gt;The pitch bend it was like a plus and a
minus thing.. so you speed it up...

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.870
It was hilarious.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.879
&gt;&gt;Ok well thanks Tommy Trash, thanks for seeing
us today.

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:05.319
&gt;&gt;Thanks man, good chat.
