00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
the set in its tunneling you know get

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.160 
the set in its tunneling you know get
rid<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.069> it<00:02:18.250> but<00:02:18.400> if<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:18.969> it<00:02:19.209> I'd<00:02:19.900> work

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
rid of it but if you like it I'd work

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.170 
rid of it but if you like it I'd work
with<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.549> so<00:02:21.549> that's<00:02:21.670> what<00:02:21.819> happened<00:02:21.909> with

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
with it so that's what happened with

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
before all that it was tunneling for

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.809 
before all that it was tunneling for
about<00:02:27.879> 20<00:02:28.239> minutes<00:02:28.420> or<00:02:28.569> so<00:02:28.799> so<00:02:29.799> I'm<00:02:29.859> like<00:02:30.010> clay

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
about 20 minutes or so so I'm like clay

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.429 
about 20 minutes or so so I'm like clay
it's<00:02:30.939> no<00:02:31.120> good<00:02:31.329> so<00:02:31.659> you<00:02:32.049> know<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.170> did<00:02:32.379> the

it's no good so you know I did the
cotton<00:02:32.709> ball<00:02:32.829> trick<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.250> then<00:02:33.370> within<00:02:34.090> about

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
cotton ball trick and then within about

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.069 
cotton ball trick and then within about
let's<00:02:34.870> say<00:02:35.280> maybe<00:02:36.280> 15<00:02:36.790> minutes<00:02:37.000> or<00:02:37.359> something

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
let's say maybe 15 minutes or something

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.259 
let's say maybe 15 minutes or something
like<00:02:38.349> that<00:02:38.409> everything<00:02:39.370> kind<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.150> fell

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
like that everything kind of fell

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.599 
like that everything kind of fell
together<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.810> kicked<00:02:41.079> into<00:02:41.230> gear<00:02:41.319> so<00:02:41.739> you're

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
together and kicked into gear so you're

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.690 
together and kicked into gear so you're
looking<00:02:42.760> at<00:02:43.030> about<00:02:43.439> maybe<00:02:44.439> 40<00:02:45.159> minutes<00:02:45.430> worth

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
looking at about maybe 40 minutes worth

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.270 
looking at about maybe 40 minutes worth
of<00:02:45.939> burning<00:02:46.810> in<00:02:46.930> order<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.200> get<00:02:47.349> like<00:02:47.560> that

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
of burning in order to get like that

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.920 
of burning in order to get like that
result<00:02:48.489> we<00:02:48.790> love<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:49.359> you<00:02:49.480> know<00:02:49.569> the<00:02:49.720> deep
