00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
very long but if you splash something on

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.940 
very long but if you splash something on
it<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.600> won't<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.869> worry<00:01:49.049> too<00:01:49.200> much<00:01:49.229> on

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
it we won't have to worry too much on

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.399 
it we won't have to worry too much on
the<00:01:50.220> right<00:01:50.399> you've<00:01:50.579> also<00:01:50.729> got<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> new<00:01:51.409> volume

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
the right you've also got a new volume

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.889 
the right you've also got a new volume
up<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.130> down<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.579> well<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> power<00:01:54.630> button

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
up and down as well as a power button

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.870 
up and down as well as a power button
these<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:55.920> also<00:01:56.070> made<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.460> metal<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.729> they're

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
these are also made of metal and they're

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.810 
these are also made of metal and they're
really<00:01:57.030> nice<00:01:57.240> really<00:01:57.810> feel<00:01:58.049> high-quality<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
really nice really feel high-quality the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.340 
really nice really feel high-quality the
front<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.590> we<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.799> running<00:02:01.920> a

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
front you can see that we are running a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.600 
front you can see that we are running a
operating<00:02:04.350> system<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.890> cover<00:02:05.340> that's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
operating system the cover that's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.210 
operating system the cover that's
essentially<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> same<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:07.020> what<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.229> saw<00:02:07.259> with

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
essentially the same as what we saw with

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.960 
essentially the same as what we saw with
the<00:02:08.280> Droid<00:02:09.239> Razr<00:02:09.450> m<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.770> similar<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.250> fact

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
the Droid Razr m it's so similar in fact

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.940 
the Droid Razr m it's so similar in fact
the<00:02:12.720> opening<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.170> would<00:02:13.290> take<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> quick<00:02:13.710> look

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the opening I would take a quick look

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.510 
the opening I would take a quick look
here<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.940> see<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.680> obviously<00:02:16.680> doing<00:02:17.310> these

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
here you see that obviously doing these

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.090 
here you see that obviously doing these
is<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> screen<00:02:18.180> size<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:19.380> brightness

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
is that the screen size the brightness

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.550 
is that the screen size the brightness
and<00:02:20.190> everything<00:02:20.490> is<00:02:20.610> pretty<00:02:20.730> much<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.150> same

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
and everything is pretty much the same

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.950 
and everything is pretty much the same
this<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:22.710> has<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.890> slightly<00:02:23.280> less<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.630> bezel

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
this one has a slightly less of a bezel

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.720 
this one has a slightly less of a bezel
around<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.260> what<00:02:25.350> makes<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.740> device<00:02:26.160> feel

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
around it what makes this device feel

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.600 
around it what makes this device feel
like<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.120> has<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.240> large<00:02:27.450> screen<00:02:28.100> without<00:02:29.100> it

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
like it has a large screen without it

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.040 
like it has a large screen without it
being<00:02:29.850> actually<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.210> gigantic<00:02:30.540> stream<00:02:30.870> like

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
being actually a gigantic stream like

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.130 
being actually a gigantic stream like
this<00:02:31.080> one<00:02:31.380> is<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.720> besides<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.930> they're

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
this one is and besides that they're

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.200 
this one is and besides that they're
really<00:02:34.320> really<00:02:34.590> similar<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:35.850> essentially

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
really really similar the essentially

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.640 
really really similar the essentially
we're<00:02:36.330> at<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> same<00:02:36.630> speed<00:02:36.930> as<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.500> see

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
we're at the same speed as you can see

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.030 
we're at the same speed as you can see
