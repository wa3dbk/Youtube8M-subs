it looks like it does come preloaded
with<00:02:12.220> some<00:02:12.370> software<00:02:12.700> I<00:02:13.000> do<00:02:13.330> have<00:02:13.629> this

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
with some software I do have this

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.900 
with some software I do have this
connected<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.440> vehicle<00:02:14.920> I<00:02:15.040> have<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.430> BCI

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
connected to a vehicle I have the BCI

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.170 
connected to a vehicle I have the BCI
connected<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.569> 2011<00:02:17.200> Dodge<00:02:17.680> Charger<00:02:18.310> let's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
connected to a 2011 Dodge Charger let's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.330 
connected to a 2011 Dodge Charger let's
go<00:02:19.330> ahead<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.599> get<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.780> connect<00:02:20.379> connected

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
go ahead and get it connect connected

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.460 
go ahead and get it connect connected
and<00:02:21.700> let's<00:02:22.360> get<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.660> software<00:02:23.050> running<00:02:23.230> and

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
and let's get the software running and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.140 
and let's get the software running and
see<00:02:23.620> if<00:02:23.769> we<00:02:24.280> can<00:02:24.430> actually<00:02:24.550> access<00:02:24.849> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
see if we can actually access the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.960 
see if we can actually access the
software<00:02:25.510> without<00:02:25.599> registration<00:02:26.819> looks<00:02:27.819> like

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
software without registration looks like

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.780 
software without registration looks like
there<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:29.140> version<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.310> software<00:02:30.519> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
there is a version of the software and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.410 
there is a version of the software and
this<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.120> Chrysler<00:02:31.630> version<00:02:32.019> 1.01<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:34.269> then

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
this is Chrysler version 1.01 and then

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.089 
this is Chrysler version 1.01 and then
it<00:02:34.540> gives<00:02:34.660> me<00:02:34.720> two<00:02:34.959> options<00:02:35.380> particularly

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
it gives me two options particularly

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.360 
it gives me two options particularly
years<00:02:36.459> or<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:37.030> except<00:02:37.510> easier<00:02:38.160> go<00:02:39.160> ahead<00:02:39.280> and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
years or all except easier go ahead and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
different modules that are on this

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.050 
different modules that are on this
vehicle<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.830> it<00:03:40.830> looks<00:03:41.010> like<00:03:41.100> it's<00:03:41.820> pretty

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
vehicle and it looks like it's pretty

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.720 
vehicle and it looks like it's pretty
easy<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.690> see<00:03:42.870> when<00:03:43.050> there's<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.260> fault<00:03:43.560> code<00:03:43.740> it

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
easy to see when there's a fault code it

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.670 
easy to see when there's a fault code it
comes<00:03:44.910> up<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.180> red<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.990> instead<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.500> saying

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
comes up in red and it instead of saying

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.020 
comes up in red and it instead of saying
pass<00:03:46.920> no<00:03:47.130> fault<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.550> tells<00:03:47.730> you<00:03:47.850> how<00:03:47.970> many

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
pass no fault it tells you how many

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.240 
pass no fault it tells you how many
codes<00:03:48.360> are<00:03:48.540> on<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:48.750> particular<00:03:49.200> module<00:03:49.380> in

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
codes are on that particular module in

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.640 
codes are on that particular module in
this<00:03:50.430> case<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.880> tire<00:03:51.750> pressure<00:03:52.020> monitor<00:03:52.470> has

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
this case the tire pressure monitor has

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:07.400 
this case the tire pressure monitor has
one<00:03:53.120> DTC<00:03:54.120> stored<00:03:54.420> in<00:03:54.540> it

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.880 

okay<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.550> looks<00:04:08.700> like<00:04:08.820> it's<00:04:08.970> done<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.960> gives

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
okay it looks like it's done it gives

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.350 
okay it looks like it's done it gives
you<00:04:11.040> all<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.340> possible<00:04:11.760> modules<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.210> this

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
you all the possible modules that this

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
different values there we're going to go

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.580 
different values there we're going to go
ahead<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.010> back<00:05:00.130> out<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.340> this<00:05:00.550> right<00:05:00.760> now

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
as well yeah so here's all the different

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.210 
as well yeah so here's all the different
modules<00:05:09.350> that<00:05:09.380> you<00:05:09.500> can<00:05:09.620> access<00:05:09.770> so<00:05:09.979> let's<00:05:10.160> go

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
modules that you can access so let's go

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.610 
modules that you can access so let's go
ahead<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.430> click<00:05:10.550> on<00:05:10.699> tree<00:05:11.320> and<00:05:14.620> psych

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
ahead and click on tree and psych

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.070 
ahead and click on tree and psych
nothing's<00:05:15.949> happening<00:05:16.280> on<00:05:16.430> trees<00:05:16.930> we<00:05:17.930> may

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
nothing's happening on trees we may

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.930 
nothing's happening on trees we may
possibly<00:05:18.560> need<00:05:18.770> the<00:05:18.919> latest<00:05:19.190> version<00:05:19.669> that's

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
possibly need the latest version that's

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.969 
possibly need the latest version that's
the<00:05:20.060> reason<00:05:20.360> why<00:05:20.449> it<00:05:20.509> isn't<00:05:20.840> coming<00:05:20.990> up<00:05:21.199> we

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
the reason why it isn't coming up we

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.310 
the reason why it isn't coming up we
will<00:05:22.190> verify<00:05:22.880> this<00:05:23.180> as<00:05:23.509> soon<00:05:23.600> as<00:05:23.750> we<00:05:23.870> register

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
will verify this as soon as we register

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.320 
will verify this as soon as we register
the<00:05:24.440> unit<00:05:24.740> on<00:05:25.070> the<00:05:25.340> next<00:05:25.550> video<00:05:25.820> and<00:05:26.060> actually

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330 
the unit on the next video and actually

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.810 
the unit on the next video and actually
do<00:05:26.690> an<00:05:26.780> update<00:05:27.139> and<00:05:27.350> connect<00:05:28.190> it<00:05:28.310> to<00:05:28.400> a<00:05:28.430> vehicle

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
do an update and connect it to a vehicle

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.340 
do an update and connect it to a vehicle
so<00:05:28.970> we<00:05:29.090> will<00:05:29.300> come<00:05:29.509> back<00:05:29.660> to<00:05:29.840> this<00:05:29.960> and<00:05:30.169> see<00:05:30.259> if

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
so we will come back to this and see if

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.400 
so we will come back to this and see if
that's<00:05:30.530> available<00:05:30.650> in<00:05:31.039> the<00:05:31.100> next<00:05:31.370> update<00:05:32.410> from

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
that's available in the next update from

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.460 
that's available in the next update from
this<00:05:33.590> ring<00:05:33.860> though<00:05:34.009> you<00:05:34.070> can<00:05:34.370> save<00:05:35.320> which<00:05:36.320> it

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
this ring though you can save which it

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.670 
this ring though you can save which it
looks<00:05:36.650> like<00:05:36.800> you<00:05:36.919> can<00:05:37.100> save<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:38.320> vehicle<00:05:39.320> record

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
looks like you can save a vehicle record

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.580 
looks like you can save a vehicle record
you<00:05:40.370> can<00:05:40.550> change<00:05:40.789> the<00:05:40.910> name<00:05:41.090> of<00:05:41.240> it<00:05:41.360> up<00:05:41.990> to<00:05:42.050> 25

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
you can change the name of it up to 25

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.070 
you can change the name of it up to 25
characters<00:05:42.830> hit<00:05:43.280> OK<00:05:43.550> and<00:05:43.760> it<00:05:44.389> saves<00:05:44.630> it<00:05:44.810> on<00:05:44.930> to

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
characters hit OK and it saves it on to

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.230 
characters hit OK and it saves it on to
the<00:05:45.199> tool<00:05:45.410> you<00:05:46.340> also<00:05:46.460> have<00:05:46.699> the<00:05:46.820> option<00:05:47.120> of

quickly<00:06:05.249> race<00:06:05.429> I<00:06:05.639> believe<00:06:05.879> that<00:06:06.029> erases<00:06:06.449> all

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 
quickly race I believe that erases all

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:10.339 
quickly race I believe that erases all
codes<00:06:07.919> that<00:06:08.069> are<00:06:08.159> on<00:06:08.279> the<00:06:08.369> vehicle<00:06:08.929> okay<00:06:09.929> we'll

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
codes that are on the vehicle okay we'll

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.959 
codes that are on the vehicle okay we'll
take<00:06:10.499> you<00:06:11.269> okay<00:06:12.269> those<00:06:12.449> oh<00:06:12.689> it<00:06:13.019> selects<00:06:13.349> the
