00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
because I was thinking about me I am the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.060 
because I was thinking about me I am the
diamond<00:00:32.730> finder<00:00:33.329> not<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.350> best<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.860> I'm

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
diamond finder not the best but I'm

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.630 
diamond finder not the best but I'm
pretty<00:00:35.219> good<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.120> marked<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.200> off

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
pretty good at it so I marked it off

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.920 
pretty good at it so I marked it off
because<00:00:38.640> I<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.030> knew<00:00:39.360> there'd<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.570> diamond

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
because I just knew there'd be diamond

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.709 
because I just knew there'd be diamond
here<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.200> go<00:00:40.320> straight<00:00:40.770> down<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:41.510> just<00:00:42.510> give

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
here you go straight down here just give

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.680 
here you go straight down here just give
it<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> few<00:00:42.960> seconds<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.550> we<00:00:44.550> should<00:00:44.850> hit<00:00:45.000> like

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
it a few seconds and we should hit like

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.770 
it a few seconds and we should hit like
I<00:00:45.960> think<00:00:46.469> it's<00:00:46.620> four<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.250> five<00:00:47.460> diamond<00:00:48.120> I'm

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
and overtake though it's not the cave um

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.580 
and overtake though it's not the cave um
let<00:02:23.390> me<00:02:23.420> see<00:02:23.510> there<00:02:23.930> anything<00:02:24.079> else<00:02:24.380> on<00:02:24.500> this

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
let me see there anything else on this

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.960 
let me see there anything else on this
map<00:02:24.860> I<00:02:25.010> didn't<00:02:25.190> really<00:02:25.280> check<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.640> whole<00:02:25.790> map

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
map I didn't really check the whole map

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.729 
map I didn't really check the whole map
I<00:02:26.180> just<00:02:26.420> remember<00:02:26.870> seeing<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.349> thought<00:02:27.680> it

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
I just remember seeing that I thought it

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.500 
I just remember seeing that I thought it
was<00:02:27.829> pretty<00:02:27.980> cool<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.459> I<00:02:28.519> did<00:02:29.090> it<00:02:29.239> on<00:02:30.019> a

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
was pretty cool so I did it on a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.840 
was pretty cool so I did it on a
showcase<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.620> want<00:02:33.829> you<00:02:33.950> clay<00:02:34.280> over<00:02:34.639> here

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
showcase and I want you clay over here

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.280 
showcase and I want you clay over here
that's<00:02:35.000> useless<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:36.139> uh<00:02:37.989> they<00:02:38.989> don't<00:02:39.139> have<00:02:39.230> a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
that's useless is uh they don't have a

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.890 
that's useless is uh they don't have a
smelting<00:02:39.680> implemented<00:02:40.370> yet<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:40.819> you<00:02:40.900> just

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
smelting implemented yet so you just

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.210 
smelting implemented yet so you just
have<00:02:42.670> infinite<00:02:43.670> brick<00:02:47.590> there<00:02:48.590> anything<00:02:48.859> else

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
have infinite brick there anything else

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:55.890 
have infinite brick there anything else
in<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:49.459> map<00:02:49.730> no<00:02:52.239> got<00:02:53.239> a<00:02:53.299> big<00:02:53.450> ocean<00:02:53.859> biome

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
in this map no got a big ocean biome

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.140 
in this map no got a big ocean biome
that's<00:02:57.579> boring<00:02:59.049> ocean<00:03:00.049> biome<00:03:00.319> suck<00:03:01.150> nothing

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
that's boring ocean biome suck nothing

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.800 
that's boring ocean biome suck nothing
else<00:03:02.299> over<00:03:02.600> here<00:03:03.250> got<00:03:04.250> some<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:05.060> Gaia<00:03:05.299> or

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
else over here got some to Gaia or

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.319 
else over here got some to Gaia or
Tundra<00:03:06.109> what<00:03:06.500> everyone<00:03:06.769> call<00:03:07.010> it<00:03:10.239> yeah<00:03:11.239> I

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
Tundra what everyone call it yeah I

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.479 
Tundra what everyone call it yeah I
don't<00:03:11.540> think<00:03:11.690> there's<00:03:11.840> really<00:03:11.900> anything<00:03:12.200> else

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
don't think there's really anything else

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.960 
don't think there's really anything else
worthwhile<00:03:13.489> looking<00:03:14.239> at<00:03:14.569> it<00:03:14.660> on<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:14.840> map<00:03:15.079> I

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
worthwhile looking at it on this map I

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.270 
worthwhile looking at it on this map I
mean<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.299> don't<00:03:17.959> know<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.290> didn't<00:03:18.769> look<00:03:18.889> around

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280
