which is just called cat play toys and

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.280 
which is just called cat play toys and
I've<00:02:13.099> got<00:02:13.340> it<00:02:13.459> because<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:14.000> had<00:02:14.180> 16<00:02:14.810> beetles

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
I've got it because it had 16 beetles

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.350 
I've got it because it had 16 beetles
and<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.069> the<00:02:16.190> set<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.459> perfect<00:02:16.879> size<00:02:17.090> of

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.820 
and this is the set the perfect size of
Maryland<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:19.819> also<00:02:19.970> comes<00:02:20.330> with<00:02:20.450> like

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.009 
and so put two in at the moment he's got
a<00:02:28.730> blue<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.209> green<00:02:29.390> line<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:30.010> down<00:02:31.010> here<00:02:32.019> he's

that he's getting ready for a malt like

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.339 
that he's getting ready for a malt like
his<00:02:57.319> first<00:02:57.590> mall<00:02:57.920> his<00:02:58.519> baby<00:02:58.730> mark<00:02:59.060> and<00:03:00.049> because

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
his first mall his baby mark and because

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.600 
his first mall his baby mark and because
I've<00:03:00.470> been<00:03:00.590> doing<00:03:00.860> there's<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.099> reading<00:03:01.370> up<00:03:01.489> on

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
I've been doing there's a reading up on

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.839 
I've been doing there's a reading up on
it<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:01.790> he<00:03:02.239> has<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:03.430> he<00:03:04.430> went<00:03:04.459> quite

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
it and he has and he went quite

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.210 
it and he has and he went quite
aggressive<00:03:05.599> and<00:03:06.019> many<00:03:06.230> grumpy<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:07.040> think

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
aggressive and many grumpy and I think

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.650 
aggressive and many grumpy and I think
that's<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:07.459> due<00:03:07.819> to<00:03:07.879> the<00:03:08.090> fact<00:03:08.239> that<00:03:08.360> he's

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
that's just due to the fact that he's

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.110 
that's just due to the fact that he's
that<00:03:08.870> really<00:03:09.110> itchy<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.890> like<00:03:10.489> bothered<00:03:10.940> by

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
that really itchy and like bothered by

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.330 
that really itchy and like bothered by
it<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.739> but<00:03:12.739> then<00:03:12.859> we<00:03:12.950> didn't<00:03:13.160> know<00:03:13.220> whether

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
it and but then we didn't know whether

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.860 
it and but then we didn't know whether
it<00:03:13.430> was<00:03:13.489> that<00:03:13.760> or<00:03:13.880> whether<00:03:14.030> maybe<00:03:14.420> he's<00:03:14.690> got

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
it was that or whether maybe he's got

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.420 
it was that or whether maybe he's got
mice<00:03:15.109> because<00:03:15.500> he<00:03:15.709> has<00:03:15.889> been<00:03:16.130> scratching

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
mice because he has been scratching

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.170 
mice because he has been scratching
quite<00:03:16.819> a<00:03:16.850> lot<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:19.370> in<00:03:19.549> case<00:03:19.760> i<00:03:20.150> think

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
quite a lot and so just in case i think

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.589 
quite a lot and so just in case i think
i'm<00:03:20.480> gonna<00:03:20.600> get<00:03:20.810> some<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.730> my<00:03:22.730> spray<00:03:23.239> stuff

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.500 
i'm gonna get some and my spray stuff
whatever<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.440> call<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:25.209> because<00:03:26.209> he<00:03:26.359> did

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
whatever you call it and because he did

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.539 
whatever you call it and because he did
live<00:03:26.630> in<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:26.900> out<00:03:26.989> like<00:03:27.200> Avery<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.310> there<00:03:28.459> was

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
live in and out like Avery so there was

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.220 
live in and out like Avery so there was
a<00:03:28.579> chance<00:03:28.849> that<00:03:28.970> he<00:03:29.180> might<00:03:29.329> have<00:03:29.389> got<00:03:29.690> them<00:03:29.930> and

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.800 

so<00:03:33.230> anything<00:03:33.560> cos<00:03:33.920> it's<00:03:34.489> quite<00:03:34.790> an<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:37.359> quite<00:03:38.359> am

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
so anything cos it's quite an a quite am

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.250 
so anything cos it's quite an a quite am
big<00:03:39.380> thing<00:03:39.590> if<00:03:39.709> they<00:03:39.829> do<00:03:39.889> have<00:03:40.099> mics<00:03:40.340> because

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
big thing if they do have mics because

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.620 
big thing if they do have mics because
it<00:03:42.260> i<00:03:42.319> think<00:03:42.859> they<00:03:43.160> are<00:03:43.190> airborne<00:03:43.910> so<00:03:44.389> there's

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
it i think they are airborne so there's

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.500 
it i think they are airborne so there's
a<00:03:44.750> chance<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:45.079> you<00:03:45.260> could<00:03:45.380> like<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:46.010> i<00:03:46.700> don't

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
a chance that you could like and i don't

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.729

know like breed the minerals and then
and<00:03:49.299> I've<00:03:50.299> heard<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.230> don't<00:03:51.470> wanna<00:03:51.590> risk

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
my trio up because that would obviously

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.430 
my trio up because that would obviously
leave<00:05:12.490> one<00:05:12.639> by<00:05:12.789> himself<00:05:12.970> and<00:05:13.570> she<00:05:14.020> also<00:05:14.050> wanted

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
leave one by himself and she also wanted

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.240 
leave one by himself and she also wanted
to<00:05:14.530> introduce<00:05:14.740> two<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.729> like<00:05:15.910> one<00:05:16.710> lone<00:05:17.710> gerbil

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
to introduce two to like one lone gerbil

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.560 
to introduce two to like one lone gerbil
and<00:05:18.400> I<00:05:18.580> didn't<00:05:18.789> think<00:05:18.910> that<00:05:19.120> would<00:05:19.240> be<00:05:19.389> a<00:05:19.419> good

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
and I didn't think that would be a good

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.990 
and I didn't think that would be a good
idea<00:05:19.630> because<00:05:20.229> there'd<00:05:21.100> be<00:05:21.250> a<00:05:21.280> really<00:05:21.880> big

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
idea because there'd be a really big

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.180 
idea because there'd be a really big
chance<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.360> they<00:05:22.510> would<00:05:22.660> fight<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.289> so

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
chance that they would fight and so

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.360 
chance that they would fight and so
basically<00:05:24.669> I<00:05:24.910> just<00:05:25.210> turned<00:05:25.510> it<00:05:25.630> down<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:26.370> I've
