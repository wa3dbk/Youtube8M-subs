but<00:00:33.860> have<00:00:34.040> you<00:00:34.160> ever<00:00:34.340> wondered<00:00:34.489> how<00:00:34.879> tattooing

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
but have you ever wondered how tattooing

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.469 
but have you ever wondered how tattooing
really<00:00:35.960> works<00:00:36.460> you<00:00:37.460> may<00:00:37.610> know<00:00:37.820> that<00:00:37.850> we<00:00:38.180> shed

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:38.479 
really works you may know that we shed

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.770 
really works you may know that we shed
our<00:00:38.720> skin<00:00:38.890> losing<00:00:39.890> about<00:00:39.979> 30<00:00:40.430> to<00:00:40.640> 40,000<00:00:41.540> skin

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
our skin losing about 30 to 40,000 skin

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.960 
our skin losing about 30 to 40,000 skin
cells<00:00:42.080> per<00:00:42.409> hour<00:00:42.589> that's<00:00:43.339> about<00:00:43.580> a<00:00:43.640> million

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
cells per hour that's about a million

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.289 
cells per hour that's about a million
per<00:00:44.299> day<00:00:45.129> so<00:00:46.129> how<00:00:46.309> come<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.670> tattoo<00:00:47.000> doesn't

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:47.299 
per day so how come the tattoo doesn't

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:50.140 
per day so how come the tattoo doesn't
gradually<00:00:47.900> flake<00:00:48.229> off<00:00:48.440> along<00:00:48.860> with<00:00:49.129> them<00:00:49.339> the

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
gradually flake off along with them the

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.630 
gradually flake off along with them the
simple<00:00:50.540> answer<00:00:50.900> is<00:00:51.049> that<00:00:51.350> tattooing<00:00:52.070> involves

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
simple answer is that tattooing involves

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.820 
simple answer is that tattooing involves
getting<00:00:52.790> pigment<00:00:53.449> deeper<00:00:53.960> into<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.440> skin

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
getting pigment deeper into the skin

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.210 
getting pigment deeper into the skin
than<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.430> outermost<00:00:55.790> layer<00:00:56.269> that<00:00:56.540> gets<00:00:56.750> shed

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
than the outermost layer that gets shed

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.719
