 cooking the remains of the bombs remains a 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.050
 old recipe really traditional 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.820

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:28.189
 little butter in a pan 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.250
 so here they are simmering 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:38.910

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.879
 cinnamon the grapes that are going to 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.789

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.130
 pieces seduced by assigns then one 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.270
