 come from the truck division of 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.720
 company with water cooled 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.029
 two-cylinder diesel engine he makes 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.570
 even then 26 ps 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.160
 The type 180 is considered robust and 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.410
 undemanding machine 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.899
 That's the beginning of the successful one 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.059
 Tractor tradition at Steyr like many

 electronic book works regulation and 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.500
 to equip in format tax promises 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.280
 Slip minimization and fuel 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.800
 reduce 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:19.670
 In addition, so the quality of the plow 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:21.680
 work improves versatility proves 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.520
 steyr with the introduction of the multi

 rotations per minute offered 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.680
 so it is particularly suitable for the 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.320
 Combined PTO use as for 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.390
 example to load more the multi truck

 series is especially for 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.640
 optimized front cultivation possibilities 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.560
 for the first time, the steyr tractors with ax

 1999 tax will be stepless the cvt 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.310
 series is presented 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.259
 engine and gearbox are now let 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.300
 depending on the s tronic itself 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.150
 fixed and with the multi controller 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.830
 or the accelerator pedal still in control 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.560
 the same year, the tractors of the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.400
 cvt series as machine of the year 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.400
 excellent 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.340

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.250
 for example in very hilly areas 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.590
 after the takeover by fiat falls in 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.050
 2007 an important decision 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.739
 the location in santa valentin becomes the

 with three models with an output of 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.470
 99 to 114 ps are thus powerful 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.840
 and thrifty tugs on the market that
