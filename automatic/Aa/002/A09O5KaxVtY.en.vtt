kind of shimmery um so then I put it on

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:52.730 
kind of shimmery um so then I put it on
my<00:06:51.599> brow<00:06:51.840> bone<00:06:51.870> and<00:06:52.080> I<00:06:52.259> did<00:06:52.440> the<00:06:52.530> same<00:06:52.710> thing

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
my brow bone and I did the same thing

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.930 
my brow bone and I did the same thing
rather<00:06:53.039> than<00:06:53.159> a<00:06:53.280> little<00:06:53.400> bit<00:06:53.580> you<00:06:53.639> got<00:06:53.789> work

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
rather than a little bit you got work

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.270 
rather than a little bit you got work
fast<00:06:54.180> with<00:06:54.360> this<00:06:54.479> stuff<00:06:54.720> um<00:06:54.960> but<00:06:55.740> it<00:06:55.889> helped

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
fast with this stuff um but it helped

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.409 
fast with this stuff um but it helped
because<00:06:57.090> it<00:06:57.240> wasn't<00:06:57.599> like<00:06:59.419> contrasting

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
because it wasn't like contrasting

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.820 
because it wasn't like contrasting
enough<00:07:00.599> with<00:07:00.780> the<00:07:00.870> dark<00:07:01.080> I<00:07:01.229> think<00:07:01.409> cuz<00:07:01.560> I<00:07:01.650> don't

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
enough with the dark I think cuz I don't

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.320 
enough with the dark I think cuz I don't
have<00:07:01.979> that<00:07:02.219> much<00:07:02.460> dark<00:07:02.789> so<00:07:03.000> you<00:07:03.090> can't<00:07:03.240> really

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:03.330 
have that much dark so you can't really

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.959 
have that much dark so you can't really
tell<00:07:03.770> but<00:07:04.770> yeah<00:07:04.949> this<00:07:05.159> is<00:07:05.310> what<00:07:05.460> happens<00:07:05.849> and

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:05.969 
tell but yeah this is what happens and

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:07.159 
tell but yeah this is what happens and
then<00:07:06.060> you<00:07:06.150> put<00:07:06.330> the<00:07:06.360> liner<00:07:06.599> on<00:07:06.840> with<00:07:07.050> your

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169 
then you put the liner on with your
