00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.620
 not this Sunday, October 14 was 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.929
 held in the arena the first encouragement 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 a great party already recognized by the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.910
 cheerleader then you follow 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 now pictures of rodrigo fatturi 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.859
 of Christianity in the universe that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.859
 on the grass tv 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.589
 too cool is an emotion we see that 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 the staff is thrilled with this 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.430
 avalanche space was one of the great 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.500
 fights we had here 10 for 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.020
 convince that despite being in the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.670
 son in his stadium the guild is this 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.530
 The Avalanche trademark will 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.660
 many , many times in the arena 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.979
 what is the goalkeeper here at the front but 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.440
 suffered to be very close to the fans 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.450
 which is wonderful and I'm sure 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.210
 will always give crowded base 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.330
 I can say it's shocking. 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.580
 really is something elusive first 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.780
 1 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.720
 the stadium is something impressive by 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.330
 structure by convening him to the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.710
 and we are 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:50.280
 having this impression here seeing the general 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.060
 imagine 50 thousand for 4 35 thousand people 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.190
 that half of what will fit ac milan already 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.890
 will have an idea of â€‹â€‹what will be the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.280
 opponent has this crowd against 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.640
 inside the stadium it is in operation 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.429
 so it really is crazy 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.820
 it is a privilege to us as a gremista 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.610
 to enjoy being here bad to car 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.989
 it's a shiver of shivering the baby's skin 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.660
 throw away 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.630
 here the ladder they money go now it goes 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.200
 give an opinion will still say no to the whole 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.299
 People are exciting, and I do not 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.880
 He had come even with the coverage and 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.570
 Last time I saw there was no coverage 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.160
 too much there 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.930
 I want to see now that you started singing to 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.930
 see the noise 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.420
 if this is getting wonderful, it's not 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.890
 has not even imagined that she 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.470
 being thus 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.080
 But with each passing day is that 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.940
 the expected momentum of the first 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.380
 opportunity to enter coming from the guild 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.950
 playing in the field I think it will be a 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.950
 very big emotion 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.319
 in this task
