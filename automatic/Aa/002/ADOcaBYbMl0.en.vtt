00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
it up a little bit on the chord changes

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.490 
it up a little bit on the chord changes
so<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:14.250> G<00:00:14.519> country<00:00:14.969> thing

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.710 

and<00:00:19.070> it<00:00:19.490> goes<00:00:19.580> to<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:19.849> five<00:00:20.090> core<00:00:20.390> which<00:00:20.570> is

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
and it goes to the five core which is

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.159 
and it goes to the five core which is
the<00:00:20.840> D<00:00:22.509> something<00:00:23.509> that<00:00:23.630> a<00:00:23.660> lot<00:00:23.750> of<00:00:23.930> the

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
the D something that a lot of the

the D something that a lot of the
country<00:00:24.680> players<00:00:24.890> do<00:00:25.189> is<00:00:25.400> throw<00:00:25.939> in<00:00:26.119> some

little jazzy touches and one of the
easiest<00:00:31.910> or<00:00:32.180> most<00:00:32.360> basic<00:00:32.750> ones<00:00:32.930> is<00:00:33.140> to

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
easiest or most basic ones is to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.520 
easiest or most basic ones is to
anticipate<00:00:34.089> the<00:00:35.089> chord<00:00:35.390> change<00:00:35.690> by<00:00:36.050> going<00:00:36.410> a

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
anticipate the chord change by going a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.950 
anticipate the chord change by going a
half<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.949> step<00:00:37.190> sharp<00:00:38.000> so<00:00:38.930> if<00:00:39.079> you're<00:00:40.960> playing

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
half a step sharp so if you're playing

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.319 
half a step sharp so if you're playing
in<00:00:42.110> G<00:00:42.350> right<00:00:42.650> before<00:00:42.980> you<00:00:43.070> go<00:00:43.190> to<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.400> five<00:00:43.640> you

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
in G right before you go to the five you

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.270 
in G right before you go to the five you
pretend<00:00:44.900> as<00:00:45.110> if<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.440> rhythm<00:00:45.620> was<00:00:46.070> going<00:00:48.280> it's

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
pretend as if the rhythm was going it's

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.399 
pretend as if the rhythm was going it's
D<00:00:49.519> sharp<00:00:49.820> to<00:00:50.089> D<00:00:50.269> instead<00:00:50.689> of<00:00:50.809> straight<00:00:51.049> to<00:00:51.199> D

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
D sharp to D instead of straight to D

00:00:51.409 --> 00:01:01.060 
D sharp to D instead of straight to D
see<00:00:52.309> you'd<00:00:52.460> outline<00:00:52.939> that<00:00:59.470> which<00:01:00.470> is<00:01:00.650> all<00:01:00.890> I've

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
see you'd outline that which is all I've

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:13.270 
see you'd outline that which is all I've
done<00:01:01.280> is<00:01:01.580> I've<00:01:01.790> played<00:01:02.059> a<00:01:02.650> d7<00:01:03.650> chord<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:12.280> gone

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
done is I've played a d7 chord and gone

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:22.410 
done is I've played a d7 chord and gone
down<00:01:13.549> into<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.939> d6

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.570 

and<00:01:23.050> even<00:01:23.380> if<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.620> rhythm<00:01:23.890> guitar<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.430> bass

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
and even if the rhythm guitar the bass

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.570 
and even if the rhythm guitar the bass
isn't<00:01:24.910> playing<00:01:25.480> that<00:01:25.690> T<00:01:25.900> sharp<00:01:26.230> you<00:01:27.010> can<00:01:27.220> apply

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
isn't playing that T sharp you can apply

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:39.510 
isn't playing that T sharp you can apply
it<00:01:32.160> and<00:01:33.160> then<00:01:34.120> that<00:01:34.300> lands<00:01:34.660> on<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.900> five<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
it and then that lands on the five and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.040 
it and then that lands on the five and
get<00:01:39.700> better<00:01:39.880> than<00:01:40.030> just<00:01:40.210> do<00:01:40.360> a<00:01:40.390> major<00:01:40.660> scale

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
get better than just do a major scale

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:55.230 
get better than just do a major scale
down<00:01:41.290> to<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.830> to<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.610> one<00:01:45.600> from<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:51.360> 4s<00:01:54.240> so

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
down to that to the one from the 4s so

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.420 
down to that to the one from the 4s so
let's<00:01:55.420> let's<00:01:55.750> go<00:01:55.900> through<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.200> slowly<00:01:56.530> so

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
let's let's go through that slowly so

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.860 
let's let's go through that slowly so
when<00:01:57.580> we're<00:01:57.730> approaching<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.270> five<00:01:58.510> chord

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
when we're approaching the five chord

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.980 
when we're approaching the five chord
about<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.620> beat<00:01:59.950> before<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.580> hit<00:02:00.760> it<00:02:00.940> you<00:02:01.870> were

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
about a beat before you hit it you were

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.560 
about a beat before you hit it you were
to<00:02:02.050> anticipate<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.280> five<00:02:03.490> chord<00:02:03.790> but<00:02:04.000> going

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
to anticipate the five chord but going

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.920 
to anticipate the five chord but going
in<00:02:04.720> half<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:05.050> step<00:02:05.290> higher<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.890> D<00:02:06.330> sharp<00:02:07.330> seven

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
in half a step higher to a D sharp seven

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.340 
in half a step higher to a D sharp seven
so<00:02:08.530> here's<00:02:08.740> your<00:02:08.860> D<00:02:09.040> seven<00:02:09.990> here's<00:02:10.990> your<00:02:11.170> D

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
so here's your D seven here's your D

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.780 
so here's your D seven here's your D
sharp<00:02:11.650> seven<00:02:13.350> which<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:14.620> throw<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> five

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.170 

instead<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.000> one<00:02:19.750> three<00:02:20.350> seven<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.430> got<00:02:22.030> one

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
instead of one three seven I got one

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.810 
instead of one three seven I got one
five<00:02:22.420> seven<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.820> sounds<00:02:25.090> like<00:02:26.730> then<00:02:27.730> I

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
five seven so that sounds like then I

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.750 
five seven so that sounds like then I
slide<00:02:28.120> back<00:02:28.330> down<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.959> regular<00:02:29.260> five

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.010 

which<00:02:33.760> is<00:02:33.910> like<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> d6

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.170 

and<00:02:38.860> then<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.280> just<00:02:39.400> walked<00:02:39.550> round<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.880> bit<00:02:40.000> down

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
and then I just walked round a bit down

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.720 
and then I just walked round a bit down
to<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.420> G<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.590> slowly<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.220> thing<00:02:45.430> would<00:02:45.580> sound

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
to the G so slowly the thing would sound

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.670 
to the G so slowly the thing would sound
like<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.060> right<00:02:46.390> before<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.900> downbeat<00:02:47.380> of

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
like this right before the downbeat of

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.340 
like this right before the downbeat of
the<00:02:47.770> five<00:02:48.010> chord
