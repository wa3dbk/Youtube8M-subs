00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.150
 not in hundreds of thousands but in hundreds of millions 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.609
 situation over the past 4 years only 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.500
 worsened decreased financial 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.539
 autonomy of the city budget which 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 and self-sufficient in fact 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.329
 turned subsidized so in the tenth 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.120

 thirteenth year about 10 million 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.649
 rubles in terms of income performance 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.570

 Neftekamsk twelfth year 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.390
 ranked sixth in the 13th year 7 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.129
 place out of 7 what can we say 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.320
 when only on one school meal 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.629
 out of ten millions spent 5 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.729
 used ineffectively survey go 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.380
 In nowhere last year our editorial boards have already 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.210
 raised this question after all 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.040
 electronic bidding win two 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.500
 entrepreneur the rest with such 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.000
 conditions the way is closed 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.729

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.770
 balance sheet and cost over 10 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.290
 million rubles were used 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.340
 specified entrepreneurs without 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.530

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.220
 above average market prices in 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.799
 the region 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.479
 the result is a city ​​district budget 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.400
 lost revenues are not reimbursed 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.110
 expenses and municipal institutions on 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.970
 almost 5 million worth 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.560
 rubles but when it comes to 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.720
 construction previous figures 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.280
 become irrelevant repeatedly 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.050
 in the air of our program went up 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.180
 the question of what construction in the city 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.460
 starts with how social but in the end 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.380
 new outlets grow and this 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.110
 words found confirmation only 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.170
 more globally draw up 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.210
 game fact election land lots not 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.520
 significance before the initial wrong and 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.679
 decorated here building a hospital under 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.600
 construction of the stadium under construction 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.170
 some other object then 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.530
 happened 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.500

 you give for social construction 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.560
 close your eyes to what happened 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.040
 changing the purpose of this 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.010
 plot and need to chew them list 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.540

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.080
 you this is this hand off half the budget 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.850
 in urban honor I was honored 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.100
 endless change of developers and 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.960
 owners of the same building as 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.000
 for example on nikola berezovsky highway 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.920
 And as well as there such non-payment manipulation 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.300
 rent changes projects and 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.700
 violation of all imaginable and unthinkable 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.730
 Norm Commission saw interesting facts 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.440
 originally identified land 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.770
 repeatedly passed on from 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.890
 one from one law firm 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:27.160
 another at first we did not understand why this 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.960
 done when you looked at the debt 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.440
 on rent for land understood in 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.980
 what's up 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.170
 certain debt accumulates 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.550
 then transferred to the land 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.580
 most likely another or 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.860
 girl start taking sin on the soul we do not 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.860
 were able to watch 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.830
 prove that previous firms are paid 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.070
 bankrupt those taxes for the post 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.940
 which hung on it is written off here 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.620
 and this formed 240 million k 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.150
 the answer is the auditors called the deputy head on 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.650
 financial matters performing 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.900
 duties of the chair goats and 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.670
 Chairman of the City Council the truth is not true 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.660
 city ​​officials the situation is not 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.670
 improved verifiers made their findings 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.780
 part 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.780
 no badge and no gloves 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:24.550
 you heat the decor 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.050
 as a state in a state like them but 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.520
 It’s too early to make conclusions 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.800
 Chairman of the City Council of Deputies 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.080
 Dmitry Kryukov begin to correct 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.000
 situation is not possible yet because 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.919
 deputies do not have a full report 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.350
 a list of all violations and specific 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.720
 comments the fact is that we have so far on 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.639
 today there is no act of checking or 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.280
 any other document on 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.190
 the results of the audit are therefore 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.500
 any comments 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.710
 work plans or measures taken 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.290
 I think it will be given to discuss after 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.360
 receipt of this document verifier 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.530
 in turn promised to give input to the cause 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.389
 and transfer materials to 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.130
 law enforcement agencies to further 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.840
 proceedings and even sure that 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.340
 will take this control check 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.810
 how will measures be effective 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.580
 it's too early to say 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.260
 especially when you consider the fact that 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.479
 recent years have changed several 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.830
 heads of the city and almost completely changed 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.510
 composition of administration 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.220
