toros<00:00:09.360> lesson<00:00:09.840> 27<00:00:10.370> understanding<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> main

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
toros lesson 27 understanding the main

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.280 
toros lesson 27 understanding the main
function<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.300> before<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:12.809> start<00:00:13.080> off<00:00:13.170> this

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
function and before we start off this

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.230 
function and before we start off this
lesson<00:00:13.679> let<00:00:13.889> me<00:00:13.980> just<00:00:14.130> go<00:00:14.250> ahead<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.490> say<00:00:14.730> that

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
lesson let me just go ahead and say that

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.859 
lesson let me just go ahead and say that
this<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.630> not<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> very<00:00:16.289> in-depth<00:00:17.570> lesson<00:00:18.570> about

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
this is not a very in-depth lesson about

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.109 
this is not a very in-depth lesson about
the<00:00:18.930> main<00:00:19.320> function<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.949> I'm<00:00:20.730> just<00:00:20.910> going<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the main function is I'm just going to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.880 
the main function is I'm just going to
be<00:00:21.240> going<00:00:21.359> over<00:00:21.660> what<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> arguments<00:00:23.240> of<00:00:24.890> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
be going over what the arguments of the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.970 
be going over what the arguments of the
main<00:00:26.070> function<00:00:26.550> actually<00:00:26.970> mean<00:00:27.750> so<00:00:28.349> anyways

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
main function actually mean so anyways

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.890 
main function actually mean so anyways
let's<00:00:29.010> go<00:00:29.490> ahead<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.699> jump<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.449> lesson

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
let's go ahead and jump into the lesson

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.749 
let's go ahead and jump into the lesson
before<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.650> get<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> main<00:00:32.369> function

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
before we get to the main function

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.250 
before we get to the main function
though<00:00:32.880> we<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.300> understand<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.230> thing

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
though we have to understand one thing

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.520 
though we have to understand one thing
that<00:00:34.590> arrays<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.250> used<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.730> arguments<00:00:36.570> in

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that arrays can be used as arguments in

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.630 
that arrays can be used as arguments in
C<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.899> how<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:39.960> would<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.430> just

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
C and how you would do this is you just

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.889 
C and how you would do this is you just
have<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> create<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> function<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.690> already

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
have to create a function and already

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.080 
have to create a function and already
have<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> function<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.860> case<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.969> have

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
have a function in this case we have

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.420 
have a function in this case we have
void<00:00:45.390> some<00:00:45.870> function<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.500> then<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> specify

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
void some function and then you specify

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.490 
void some function and then you specify
that<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> argument<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.660> an<00:00:48.989> array<00:00:49.200> city<00:00:49.410> of

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
that the argument is an array city of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.760 
that the argument is an array city of
the<00:00:49.620> type<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.430> arg<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.780> brackets

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the type and then arg with the brackets

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.340 
the type and then arg with the brackets
so<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.520> know<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.300> an<00:00:54.420> array<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.930> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
so you know that it's an array and this

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.590 
so you know that it's an array and this
function<00:00:55.739> would<00:00:55.860> accept<00:00:56.250> an<00:00:56.370> argument<00:00:56.879> that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
function would accept an argument that

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.290 
function would accept an argument that
is<00:00:57.809> an<00:00:57.960> array<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.469> hints<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.820> pretty<00:01:00.059> straight

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
is an array of hints so pretty straight

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.889 
is an array of hints so pretty straight
border<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:01.879> now<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.149> understand<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
border there now that we understand a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.390 
border there now that we understand a
raisin<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.439> arrays<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:04.949> used<00:01:05.189> as

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
raisin that arrays can be used as

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.270 
raisin that arrays can be used as
arguments<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:07.140> go<00:01:07.290> through<00:01:07.619> what<00:01:08.010> these

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
arguments I can go through what these

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.020 
arguments I can go through what these
arguments<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:10.340> main<00:01:11.340> function<00:01:11.880> actually

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
arguments of the main function actually

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
arguments of the main function actually
mean<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:14.299> very<00:01:15.299> quick<00:01:15.810> refresher<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.710> course

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
mean so very quick refresher of course

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.760 
mean so very quick refresher of course
you<00:01:17.250> already<00:01:17.340> know<00:01:17.580> this<00:01:17.759> but<00:01:17.900> this<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
you already know this but this is a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.950 
you already know this but this is a
function<00:01:20.640> called<00:01:20.939> main<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.420> type<00:01:21.689> int

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
function called main of type int

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.050 
function called main of type int
remember<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.950> main<00:01:23.130> marks<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> entry<00:01:23.880> point

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
remember that main marks the entry point

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.020 
remember that main marks the entry point
of<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.420> program<00:01:25.049> now<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.150> new<00:01:27.420> stuff

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
of a program now on to the new stuff

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.640 
of a program now on to the new stuff
first<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> variable<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.439> this

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
first we have a variable and this

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.210 
first we have a variable and this
variable<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.189> argosy<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.409> an<00:01:34.740> int

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
variable is argosy and this is an int

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
variable is argosy and this is an int
variable<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:35.939> short<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.240> argument

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
variable that is short for argument

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.270 
variable that is short for argument
count<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.259> contains<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.860> number<00:01:38.189> of

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
count and this contains the number of

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.030 
count and this contains the number of
arguments<00:01:38.610> passed<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.630> program<00:01:40.110> now<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
arguments passed to the program now the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.139 
arguments passed to the program now the
next<00:01:41.400> thing<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.509> arg<00:01:42.899> v<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:44.030> we<00:01:45.030> know

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
next thing we have arg v and we know

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.399 
next thing we have arg v and we know
that's<00:01:45.299> an<00:01:45.509> array<00:01:45.659> because<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
that's an array because it as the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
that's an array because it as the
brackets<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.100> everything<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.579> this

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
brackets there and everything and this

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.639 
brackets there and everything and this
is<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.180> one-dimensional<00:01:48.990> array<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.320> strings

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
is a one-dimensional array of strings

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.359 
is a one-dimensional array of strings
which<00:01:49.979> stands<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.430> argument<00:01:51.060> vector<00:01:51.659> and

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
which stands for argument vector and

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.420 
which stands for argument vector and
it's<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:54.740> type<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.979> char<00:01:56.759> or<00:01:57.140> character<00:01:58.430> since

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
it's a type is char or character since

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.670 
it's a type is char or character since
it's<00:01:59.670> an<00:01:59.909> array<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.270> strings<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.409> also<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it's an array of strings and it's also a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.590 
it's an array of strings and it's also a
constant<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.549> can't<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.790> changed<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.509> we

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
constant so it can't be changed and we

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.969 
constant so it can't be changed and we
went<00:02:03.750> over<00:02:03.869> lesson<00:02:05.869> we<00:02:06.869> went<00:02:07.079> over<00:02:07.200> constants

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
went over lesson we went over constants

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.680 
went over lesson we went over constants
in<00:02:08.069> lesson<00:02:08.429> 7<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.209> go<00:02:09.300> back<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
in lesson 7 so you can go back and

just go ahead and Google that I'm sure
there's<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:22.140> think<00:02:22.290> there's<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.650> wikipedia<00:02:22.890> page

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
there's I think there's a wikipedia page

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.030 
there's I think there's a wikipedia page
about<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.239> there's<00:02:24.959> lots<00:02:25.170> information<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
about it there's lots information on the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.030 
about it there's lots information on the
main<00:02:26.280> function<00:02:26.940> everything<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:27.989> I'm<00:02:28.860> not

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
main function everything but I'm not

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.460 
main function everything but I'm not
going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.670> didn't<00:02:30.629> feel<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.319> was

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
going to I just didn't feel like it was

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.710

really<00:02:31.739> necessarily<00:02:32.190> necessary<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.330> go<00:02:33.480> over

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
really necessarily necessary to go over

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.050 
really necessarily necessary to go over
a<00:02:33.750> lot<00:02:34.110> about<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:35.040> main<00:02:35.250> function<00:02:35.730> because

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
a lot about the main function because

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.759 
a lot about the main function because
we're<00:02:36.480> not<00:02:36.599> going<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.810> be<00:02:36.930> needing<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.440> know<00:02:37.590> a

lot about it because this is one of our
last<00:02:41.129> lessons<00:02:43.790> referring<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:45.810> about<00:02:46.110> really

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
last lessons referring and about really

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.009 
last lessons referring and about really
the<00:02:46.500> sea<00:02:46.950> part<00:02:47.819> of<00:02:48.060> objective-c<00:02:48.690> there's<00:02:48.959> a

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
the sea part of objective-c there's a

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.089 
the sea part of objective-c there's a
lot<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.489> base<00:02:50.489> level<00:02:50.940> c<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.420> objective-c

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
lot of just base level c in objective-c

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.559 
lot of just base level c in objective-c
but<00:02:53.099> from<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:53.940> on<00:02:53.970> we're<00:02:54.269> going<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.450> be

but from now on we're going to be

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.870 
but from now on we're going to be
focusing<00:02:54.810> mainly<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.880> object-oriented

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
focusing mainly on the object-oriented

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.509 
focusing mainly on the object-oriented
part<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.630> objective-c<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.860> anyways<00:02:59.190> that's

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
part of objective-c so anyways that's

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.550 
part of objective-c so anyways that's
all<00:02:59.790> for<00:02:59.849> this<00:03:00.239> lesson<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:01.230> want<00:03:01.410> more

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
lesson going to be jumping back into

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.650 
lesson going to be jumping back into
object-oriented<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.790> objective-c<00:03:09.299> like<00:03:09.629> i

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
object-oriented of objective-c like i

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.110 
object-oriented of objective-c like i
