00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.640
 hated by some acclaimed by others 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.619
 RPGs with a system of 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.930
 turn-based battles usually already generate 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.580
 certain controversy around thousands of 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.290
 players worldwide 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.390
 bored by a combat scheme 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.670
 too rigid deep for a 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.920
 decision - making system paused and 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.140
 extensive what is certain is that with the 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.180
 over time the subgenre has been 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.040
 affected by the few modifications 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.019
 that the developers have made 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.000
 the main formula of the projects 

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.040
 brave lee default follows the foot of the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.989
 letter many of the elements more than 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.300
 proven within this subgenre by 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.309
 it is not surprising to find the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.839
 that maddie sima story where four 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.150
 young people will be responsible for 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.830
 stop a mystical cataclysm or else the 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.510
 classic clashes random 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.400
 while we walk the field of play 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.320
 but far from what you might think to 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.360
 At first sight, this release is from the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.220
 more refreshing within your bouquet from 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.200
 It's been a while since we discussed 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.330
 previously in the progress of the plot 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.190
 we accompany four protagonists who 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.290
 will travel the world in a magical 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.060
 crossing these are your starts your 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.979
 day suddenly when seeing as his 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.630
 beloved hometown ends up being 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.920
 consumed by a strange force 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.080
 cataclysmic back 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.670
 his brother in that tragedy tease himself 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.759
 embarks on the search for some 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.020
 survivor of that disaster 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.970
 later he will meet a 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.710
 enigmatic sorceress and two others 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.659
 young warriors with whom he will unite 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.880
 forces to finish with those with these 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.799
 events that hover over all 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.869
 reigns of humanity may not they 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.009
 this premise sounds too familiar if 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.210
 it is true that the story in 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.340
 general is full of cliches 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.649
 characteristic of much of the rpg 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.229
 of previous times the presentation of the 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.820
 it manages to refresh the pleasantly the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.590
 personality of the protagonists is 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.720
 quite predictable however to 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.610
 moments the characters break the mold 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.530
 by hilarious comments or 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.420
 extravagant behaviors at the end of the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.920
 day the development of the personality 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.280
 of the four makes us get hooked 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.630
 with the way of being of each of them 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.000
 honestly the plot presents several 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.039
 extremely slow and boring stretches the 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.930
 which feel like a vague excuse 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.120
 to lengthen the total duration of 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.950
 title by fortune your battle system 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.750
 it's so entertaining that it reaches 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.760
 keep the player's attention until 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.709
 in those tedious segments two pillars 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.840
 fundamentals make the battles 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.310
 feel both attractive and different 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.959
 the first one is the 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.970
 although they literally name the game 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.470
 When he was in combat , 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.630
 user has at his disposal the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.580
 break command or the default command to 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.500
 select brave the character is capable 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.660
 to perform multiple attacks or actions 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.340
 in a single shift in another way to 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.319
 activate default the protagonist is 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.000
 place in defensive position accumulating 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.069
 special points for the employment of the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.870
 break option this game mechanic is 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.940
 quickly converts to a variant 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.709
 essential for progress within the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.450
 title if not used properly 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.370
 the difficulty simply becomes 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.110
 overwhelming but if you devote the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.269
 necessary attention integrates a factor 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.400
 strategic of greater emotion to the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.049
 clashes the second key point 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.090
 of this project is the employment of 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.190
 Class exchange system based 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.260
 largely in the scheme introduced 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.900
 for the revolutionary final fantasy 5 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.549
 this aspect gives the possibility to each 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.530
 character to learn skills 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.750
 specific to certain professions after 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.700
 win in many battles between them is 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.900
 find monk black magician techniques 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.220
 and even pirate 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.049
 once the hero learned a 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.000
 special technique we can change your 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.799
 class and maintain the skills of another 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.140
 of the previous professions thanks to 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:31.790
 this we are able to create powerful 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.980
 gentlemen with spectacular 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.959
 and its magicians or a very skilled invoker 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.000
 in the use of the spears would be a serious 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.739
 mistake does not highlight the amazing address 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.599
 of art used in the project put 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.609
 that on this occasion this is perhaps the 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.310
 most important element of all the 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.629
 visual aspect is captivating 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.280
 literally from the first moment in 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.959
 that we started the odyssey until 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.760
 we got to turn off our console such and 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.920
 as we enjoyed it in final fantasy the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.049
 furious of light the graphic style we 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.670
 moves to a fantastic world that 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.530
 It looks like a beautiful illustration in 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.780
 movement that without counting that has 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.639
 covered to the smallest detail in 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.139
 this sense because we noticed it in the great 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.849
 amount of different costumes for 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.530
 the heroes depending on their class the 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.209
 soundtrack is just as memorable 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.680
 counting on instrumental arrangements to 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.870
 charge of the popular work composer 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.910
 rival best known for being part of 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.099
 the group that plays the opening 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.199
 of the anime version of attack on fire 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:23.000
 as if the developers were not enough 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.009
 they took advantage of creatively 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.630
 additional features of this 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.099
 nintendo laptop with certain 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.110
 extra activities that employ the 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.090
 sweet pass functionality when performing 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.860
 suit pass with other people who own 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.169
 the game we can recruit from certain 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.729
 form virtual characters that help 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.270
 to rebuild the town of tease or 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.490
 invoke 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.560
 to make a fleeting attack said 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.120
 integration is quite competent already 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.160
 that is not mandatory to conclude the 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.720
 nor is it as irrelevant as 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.150
 to go unnoticed outside of 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.980
 some bad details or brave ups and downs 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.900
 lee default is one of the best games 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.360
 of its kind available for nintendo 3ds 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.490
 The silicon study team achieved 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.440
 grant an almost perfect balance 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.970
 between the classic aspects of the genre and 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.890
 new dynamics that try 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.690
 evolve it in a way leaving 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.940
 a side that could be considered a 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.890
 spiritual sequel to forge box of light 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.240
 this is a courageous proposal that 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.280
 captures the essence of what ever 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.300
 we were so shocked by the saga more
