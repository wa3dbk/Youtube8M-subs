00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:08.970
 Let's go and see if it 's the second derivative of the tournament and feel that it's a cat. 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:14.459
 If you ask for the next derivative of Daiei on x 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:19.620
 So you have come to say that the second derivative and the third derivative in the animation so far 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:21.220
 Because catastrophe that of say the second derivative is to be differentiated twice was to differentiating the third floor 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.860
 Well derivative of the tournament 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.810
 2 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:29.039
 it n times important also here Wow at it is that the differential is still 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.399
 How to express 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.230
 Though some people to read Toka This Well if you read yn 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:41.550
 I solved Well another fact yourself do you think was the Well good to throw the Te n derivative of the Wye 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.390
 I say that when it's good it's different I'm saying this too fnx I'm also dni 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.750
 dxm 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.190
 Hey dnx dxm 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:53.390
 That I mean smoked n derivative effects dog Children's Museum of ne box first Bawai is I feel it 's 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:58.550
 After all I think that it is a formal call, so the problem is 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:04.040
 The first and second child the second floor It was the third child is okay Datte 2 times View second child differential of up to before I 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:09.640
 The third party and the third floor do not differentiate because the children's hall of this meeting 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.920
 When the n times it is differentiating many times is not in the derivative are troubled by differentiating n times 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.500
 Ne 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 Hey this is a herbal correct answer that I 'm differentiating, so I 'm half different now, but where are you 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.270
 Or I do not know what do I do to 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.520
 In half I say I'm right I say I'm differentiated 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.670
 this 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.610
 I guess the general term 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.220
 This way 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.210
 If you look at the cat's guess, you will remember the number b of mathematical induction 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.299
 Mathematical induction 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:46.420
 Whole of rules from a single one of the data even though it is super important Wow In it modern statement of say yesterday 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:54.140
 It's that sort of was the function as seen derive 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:58.970
 So it was to guess the general term from this example and I get to prove after the mathematical induction 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.930
 Neh mathematically, I'll do my own, and let 's go back to the 2 b 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.409
 Please review 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:08.899
 Here I will explain only roughly 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:13.740
 Mathematical induction shows that it holds first when a is 1 and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.270
 On the assumption that if n in the following are true at the time of the system 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:22.970
 Assuming that it holds 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:29.810
 n that is that it is true also in the system was snow I mean the next section is to say this next saw you 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:34.730
 If I could show it, I could say that it holds for all natural numbers 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.750
 And also n = 1 say was said to say whether this is what it is happen if say if 1 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.160
 Made up of 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.760
 In the second term that was assumed to hold at the time of the city comes out that the second term holds true 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.349
 Because 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.800
 Although established three years holds true with acid if holds out to also hold two if established in the city 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.860
 It means that it can be read even if it can be said that it is a domino downside, as a result it is all 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:57.560
 It will be called duel 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.260
 So I think that the solution of the second derivative of this convention is already almost mathematical induction 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.610
 Please give me 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.700
 Certification number in the mathematical induction it to guess the concrete general 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.380
 Ne Seriously 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.250
 I guess this Ta spank is = do also have a fourth derivative of the good -2x field Kore 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.410
 It is to 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.670
 I'm writing the concrete procedure here if I differentiate on the first floor I think that I am used to this too 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:24.020
 I do not explain 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:27.160
 When I wish of 2 times the brother and third derivative by x to say the four-fold obtained by differentiating the second floor It is x 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:31.690
 If it looks like x to be 8 times better 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:36.670
 Ne This is no problem if you firmly talk about the last derivative 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:40.210
 I think I can see if I see here about 1 hour 2 o'clock 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:46.660
 I'm going to replace it so I'm having a rush behind me 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.180
 Nde say -x field is change of clothes here now But x Geo Tomamae of okay to Libor 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.500
 behind 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:56.630
 It is 2 times Tsukun is I 2x dash 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.850
 So this is a flow that is doubling twice every time, and it is four times the stage differentiation 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.080
 Contractor 8x Dog Joining the Knicks 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:10.100
 2x'm probably the fourth time is the x to say of 16 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:11.490
 Say what can be inferred from here and 29 -2-1 tablets 40 - 2 of Article firing Nino cubed root third floor 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.910
 Kai to the devastation of differentiating valley 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.840
 If differentiated n times obtained by differentiating the Nino square Ya because 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:24.200
 The second derivative if you add it is probably 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:31.070
 It may be referred to as Do not going to be on the x to say to apply Nino n-th power 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:35.009
 I can guess I guess I have not proved by mathematical induction which I guessed 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.219
 The procedure of mathematical induction was this 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.759
 Again First n Indicates that holds at the time of the 1 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:47.399
 It This is already investigating another and say Tsu or Jai's What happens when the 1 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:51.990
 The first floor Once the differential is = Nde pale legs will be x for nice double to 2 degrees position 

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:53.570
 It can be said that this is likely to happen even if there is a fund for the cat 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.500
 Ne 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:03.580
 I think you start become a dash to two times the position of the nuke adult stomach 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:10.389
 The next point is the next point It is assumed that this holds when a is a system 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:14.979
 n = k I do to make sure that say holds even +1 I the flow is important 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:20.560
 First of all , I write a formula that replaces it with management at the time of assumption 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:23.129
 This can at least be used from the perspective of the home but you can use it 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.059
 Among the answer 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:30.510
 Y 's table light automatic function shape of what 

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:37.140
 It can be expressed in the Eck place to be good 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:37.800
 The biggest point of the mathematical induction method is to draw this shape in your head from here 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.250
 Right 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:46.590
 If it says something in a form that aims to be good if this can be said 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:48.210
 We want to say that k + 1 holds, and what we want to say most is k +1 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:52.050
 No version 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:57.870
 The second k +1 Article of Tteyuu k +1 derivative of the Wye 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.310
 It holds this I if Iere even this form is on the x-even k +1 to say to apply 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:05.220
 I'm can be said that Tteyuu 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:08.230
 It is this of our aims was also do not know what Toka not from Mathematically of buckets from around here 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:12.510
 Oita better is good to review again the ne absolute mathematical person video 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.280
 Well, I'm prepared for math b 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.630
 ok 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:21.570
 Well then 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:23.200
 It 's not that it's exciting, so use this to bring it closer to this form, isn't it? 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:28.540
 Aimed form 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.380
 Say that there is no person and Well and what to do went close with this that this assumption 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:35.410
 this 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:40.930
 Currently, y is a warning differential warning light automatic function, so only warning is differentiated 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:43.720
 k +1 floor you want to differential I made attempts to differential one more time and try to differentiating the equation once more 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:49.009
 What does it mean to be 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:51.070
 Good -x field here as it burns also differentiated by as it is 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:52.689
 If you look at replacement 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.959
 Ne 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:07:01.139
 This key-out replacement is behind you 

00:06:55.959 --> 00:07:05.039
 So if here in x- get dash in and it by to this publisher ne 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:09.599
 After So along with this guy this brother is raised to mind 

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:13.229
 Do you brother is what in total is the Tteyuu To make the shape of everyone's future 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:16.949
 Let's go out to the coach with the fluorescence here and then it will be a total of +1 

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:19.160
 So I will k + 1 so on of the I Neii to x by 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:24.280
 Oh, but it makes me smile 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:25.230
 In other words, we could say the form we were aiming for 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:30.600
 this 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:35.460
 It is said that the target form can be said firmly so that it is k +1 here in the form that I guessed 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:41.040
 So we could say that also holds a total of + once when this is the assumption holds in the system of a 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:42.870
 So it can be said that this holds for all natural numbers from 12 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.220
 General section is this 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:49.780
 So say in smoking Children's Museum of the tournament of y 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:53.350
 It is a flow that can be expressed like this, so here is the nth 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:57.460
 Did you understand how we looked at the second derivative? 

00:07:53.350 --> 00:08:01.510
 Well here is a tough place if you don't dig into two functions 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:05.460
 Please be sure to review it or not , so that you can turn it into a no hint by yourself 

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.460
 Find a floating platform and practice well
