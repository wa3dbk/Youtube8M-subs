be<00:00:40.400> a<00:00:40.820> huge<00:00:41.480> need<00:00:41.870> for<00:00:42.940> artists<00:00:43.940> to<00:00:44.030> be<00:00:44.390> able<00:00:44.690> to

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
be a huge need for artists to be able to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.940 
be a huge need for artists to be able to
present<00:00:45.500> themselves<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.760> really

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
present themselves and really

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:55.799 
present themselves and really
communicate<00:00:48.950> to<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.400> public<00:00:49.809> what<00:00:50.809> they<00:00:51.019> do

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.869 

one<00:00:56.809> of<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.110> things<00:00:57.379> about<00:00:57.590> most<00:00:58.129> artists<00:00:58.760> is

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
one of the things about most artists is

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.860 
one of the things about most artists is
that<00:00:58.910> they<00:00:59.390> live<00:00:59.930> a<00:01:00.140> fairly<00:01:00.470> lonely<00:01:00.890> existence

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
that they live a fairly lonely existence

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.900 
that they live a fairly lonely existence
because<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.050> work<00:01:03.230> that<00:01:03.500> they<00:01:03.650> make<00:01:03.949> often<00:01:04.699> is

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
because the work that they make often is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.120 
because the work that they make often is
in<00:01:05.150> studios<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.350> they're<00:01:06.560> working<00:01:06.979> they're

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
in studios and they're working they're

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.630 
in studios and they're working they're
living<00:01:07.430> alone<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:09.440> they<00:01:10.040> hardly<00:01:10.520> ever

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
living alone and the they hardly ever

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.480 
living alone and the they hardly ever
meet<00:01:11.360> except<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:12.080> few<00:01:12.320> clients<00:01:12.649> they<00:01:13.160> hardly

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
meet except a few clients they hardly

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.420 
meet except a few clients they hardly
ever<00:01:13.580> meet<00:01:14.119> a<00:01:14.300> public<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.170> one<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.220> the

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
ever meet a public and one of the

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.999 
ever meet a public and one of the
effects<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.330> coming<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:18.050> an<00:01:18.320> event<00:01:18.740> like<00:01:18.950> this

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
effects of coming to an event like this

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.540 
effects of coming to an event like this
is<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:20.479> they<00:01:20.690> meet<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.170> lot<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.440> people<00:01:21.800> but

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
is that they meet a lot of people but

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.950 
is that they meet a lot of people but
not<00:01:22.759> only<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:23.060> they<00:01:23.450> meet<00:01:23.660> the<00:01:23.840> other

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
not only that they meet the other

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.889 
not only that they meet the other
artists<00:01:24.680> I<00:01:24.830> really<00:01:25.369> really<00:01:25.640> enjoy<00:01:26.450> meeting

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
artists I really really enjoy meeting

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:28.630

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
all the other artists that are in action

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.639 
all the other artists that are in action

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
I think we all inspire each other and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.680 
I think we all inspire each other and
it's<00:01:30.920> wonderful<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.490> see<00:01:31.670> how<00:01:32.149> everyone's
