00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
guess is that they are some kind of

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.380 
guess is that they are some kind of
fortune<00:02:03.020> telling<00:02:03.679> cards<00:02:03.729> where<00:02:04.729> somebody

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
fortune telling cards where somebody

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
picks one of these out blindly and it

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.630
