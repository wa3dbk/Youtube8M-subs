00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.260
 same is everything 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.209
 as you are seeing and well just 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:13.320
 start with the nuclear bomb as 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:15.480
 you are seeing now that the gm and good 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.789
 make it say that it starts in which 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.130
 You see how it is from the other side to say 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.320
 that have a nuclear bomb or one that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.419
 you already know how to get what 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.279
 happens is that you have seen you kill 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.609
 all of your team and the game and the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.009
 map changes as I tell you this totally 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.980
 what it means will always be like this is 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.170
 say there's always going to be this this 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.740
 change in the maps or it goes from something that in 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.930
 a future will be different point of the 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.330
 theme of the maps is going to make 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.410
 change in another way you know that there 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.420
 a lot of control that can be 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.940
 interact on the map you can upload 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.530
 some buildings and so on and the truth 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 is that good in that sense is quite 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.970
 fun because it has nothing to do 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.130
 with the previous crosses above 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.010
 for as much as it shoots the bikes it is 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.870
 one thing or another they do not change, not how the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 thing the truth so good now 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.870
 you are watching here 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.280
 let's say the little ball is going 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.380
 saying to which protects them if you see 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.770
 the radar is kind of like sensor 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.570
 of movement mixed with let's say that 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.820
 a trophy system which protects 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.130
 grenades and explosive devices 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.450
 stunners and so on and how is the video 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.760
 he also has the other grace that 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.460
 I wanted to teach is not the bazooka which 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.140
 two missiles are divided and above all 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.600
 It also does not hurt much but 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.490
 yes more than anything on the clock when what 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.560
 we saw to make a kind of like 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.010
 destruction of the map and those elements 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.020
 that I told you that they could be destroyed in the 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.180
 map then right now you have a 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.890
 bazooka and if it was not much more 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.930
 simple I do not understand them four or 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.500
 anything without looking like serving 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.910
 here the defendant was using is the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.040
 vector vector that is the submachine gun that 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.990
 is the vector and the metal were the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.190
 that they were what we were seeing and 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.290
 Well the truth is that the streak is 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.660
 quite pretty good especially if 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.860
 see above there again the sensor from 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.080
 Keep showing where the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.120
 enemies that are protecting a little 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.860
 and the bad thing is that going behind is like 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.630
 the dog does not march the dog 'sure 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.790
 practically the same 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.590
 you go around and the dog goes behind you 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.540
 then it can only protect the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.880
 people who come from behind because he 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.450
 always behind you all the time is 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.280
 quite absurd is not to say how are you doing 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.260
 to defend protect enemies coming 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.700
 in front but good you have also 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.090
 fixed the stitches of points what it does 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:35.020
 is that when you do the whole root 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.330
 then you can still have, let's say 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.520
 the rest of the streak is going in cycle 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.560
 a late we our others like that 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.150
 good here I leave you with other climates 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.420
 with the slide parate is divided 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.270
 measure does og is the same weapon the ll-11 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.790
 and how silvino around here the truth is that 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.590
 it's pretty pretty good and that the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.360
 yellow is what has changed the most 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.040
 respected you know them before but 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.080
 well, you liked the video vote it and 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.440
 see you next one single all and 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.440
 goodbye
