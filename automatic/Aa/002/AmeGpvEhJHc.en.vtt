00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.350
 Jalloh and welcome to mine 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.670
 Nelly youtube video Levy Jung 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.770
 I want to climb the SGP today because 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:13.809
 Antje fingerprint or to the fingerprint percent 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.959
 imagine the protective film for the iPhone 3g s or the 3g, of course 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.860
 I have ordered this slide from MÃ¼nster percent the whole for 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.099
 11 euros on now 1 including shipping 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.149
 South Korea percent was with me within five days 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.670
 all the more sent 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.460
 I have already opened the packaging and were in there 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.240
 This is a basic substance Rockel with which one 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.620
 Air bubbles between display and foil removed 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.960
 Percent then Nico Walser Touch was still around 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.299
 so that one will let it stay before you hang up the slide 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.269
 you should really do it thoroughly because no dust grain he may 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.900
 no dust percent 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.020
 for Usingen 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.820
 Voodoo or fingerprint on it that really must ficoba Loser Basel leaves 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.739
 it stays 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.459
 Furthermore, there are two slides do not quit running from one race 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.270
 that is not synonymous 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.540
 wrong delivery on the back of the package also insists that it 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.650
 two are 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.330
 Percent find it super bonus from Steinhagel 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.370
 around 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.410
 so 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.390
 the great performances of the respect 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.560
 Percentage of different length story animals that they are on 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.340
 See back 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.870
 as are four or five different Wesseler 4 percent lay this slide 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.020
 includes 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.280
 Of course, one percent goes to FINA ProCurve 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.770
 Hundreds of protection centners hamburger underneath a layer percent in front 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.800
 mmer 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.550
 reinforcing 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.870
 the slides so the view adjusted or slides of the center the icons percent 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.870
 can be shown clearly under a mats foil 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.640
 Lord, as I said 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 different layers of slides here and have to be a small 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.080
 Instruction or small instructions on how to bring the whole 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.080
 I'll show you how I did it 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:11.699
 around 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:14.369
 yes then come to the phone 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:17.479
 Percent or to the display of the mobile phone 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:22.149
 I have half removed the foil and the novels of the mosque 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.249
 aligned there we were at least three pages where we 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.899
 around 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.199
 can customize that in the 5 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:33.529
 I've got it adjusted to it, although not exactly exactly the same as I had 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:34.219
 a few 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:38.149
 Millimeter two to three were twelve games in between respectively 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.469
 not aligned properly 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.469
 I just let go of the foil, "she said 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:46.649
 statically attracted 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.799
 and yes, as I said that had me right off the bat was a few 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:50.959
 Millimeters wrong 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.430
 Then I went to this slide through Bruck and and jump 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.269
 push 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.739
 Per cent hawk who almost finished the frames massaged 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.129
 there is more 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:02.940
 Dr 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.900
 and the central one the best feature noticed on the slide for 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.409
 me her toughness 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.249
 namely the feel of the film 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.469
 Percent the slide is almost resistant you can really 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:17.659
 rubbing with each other without any hanging or or 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.489
 to get stuck fingers or whatever you do not do much there 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.739
 better of Rome 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.729
 but you really have no percent resistance 

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.629
 you will not really feel it underneath 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.019
 so around 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.269
 Here we see the refraction of the film and lo and behold 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.029
 left side I have a pretty strong 

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.510
 Neon percent still fabric tube 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.839
 on the right side comes the whole daylight ghost 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.680
 We also see that the fingerprints are not really visible 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.429
 the teams are not 

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:49.359
 around 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.569
 on the one hand, of course, is the coating on the other for me 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.569
 of this in the second part of 3g s 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.329
 the camera quality is also not excellent but I can tell you 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.689
 to confirm 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:02.919
 on the fingers 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:06.089
 Percent impression coating works as well as 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:09.089
 the refraction and percent coating 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.609
 there is almost no fingerprint to see and if then you can use these 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.400
 Nico Forster Top-topics over it then wipe the whole thing again eaten 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.529
 I had the fear as the film has unpacked by the fact that the 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:27.419
 Matt is the one who creates and manages the display 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:32.039
 the concern was taken after has cleared up 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:33.969
 I believe that you just show 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.900
 around 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.900
 the whole thing is still just like sheep without slides 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.460
 I already have 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.710
 found that the 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.860
 the quote sensitivity is blowing it 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.069
 absolute 

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:49.629
 unchanged 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:53.589
 Before I had the visitor, I had not just one that covers me until now 

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:56.409
 had been so at the percent that i did 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.800
 had to move up to the display a bit harder 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.960
 that the OFC realizes that there 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.270
 what happens 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.059
 is not in this slide 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:08.409
 So the properties of the print itself are not 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.729
 really great 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.469
 to JAL will probably already notice that I really from this slide 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:16.849
 I'm very excited 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.849
 a from my side never clear buy recommendation 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.680
 I think it's a pity that this slide possible me percent 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.139
 from near 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.129
 available is percent but also as I said the five days delivery 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.240
 around 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.360
 he is also extremely good 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.360
 for such a long trip for the slide 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.939
 in the already mentioned clear purchase recommendation 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.879
 I have to say that of course I do not work for Steinheim 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:48.110
 Unfortunately I'm not paid to make this video I do 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.370
 of one's free will 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.349
 around 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.240
 i would like to help use on 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.080
 who have hesitated at the source or still hesitate and 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.080
 I know if they should get this slide 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.750
 it is fermented we will definitely 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.750
 Satisfied you will not regret it 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:10.740
 I will check the next days again if I am in Hard Case of 

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:11.990
 the SGD 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.099
 half stone per stone 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.799
 around Hamm very chic this 1 percent 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:21.520
 for the iPhone 3g and 3gs 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.740
 probably synonymous for anrennt models but then because of this 2 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.650
 al of three put the first seats 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.460
 comes that are for me in question 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.309
 and around 

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:35.509
 as soon as they are there, I'll also surround you like the OVB 

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:39.029
 Percent I drove there before my video 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:42.629
 but now decide 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:43.560
 around 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.839
 let me come sda 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:49.240
 and yes I'll just say the days 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.680
 and 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.340
 much fun yet
