for<00:03:01.980> this<00:03:02.040> exercise<00:03:02.280> there<00:03:02.879> are<00:03:03.000> some<00:03:03.150> factors

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
for this exercise there are some factors

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.240 
for this exercise there are some factors
to<00:03:03.569> consider<00:03:03.780> when<00:03:04.290> you're<00:03:04.500> comparing<00:03:04.890> your

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
to consider when you're comparing your

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.220 
to consider when you're comparing your
stroke<00:03:05.459> systems<00:03:05.939> first<00:03:06.629> we'll<00:03:06.989> talk<00:03:07.170> about

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
stroke systems first we'll talk about

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.280 
stroke systems first we'll talk about
contact<00:03:08.189> on<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.819> ball<00:03:08.870> contact<00:03:09.870> on<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.110> ball

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
contact on the ball contact on the ball

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.839 
contact on the ball contact on the ball
for<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.560> hit<00:03:10.739> is<00:03:10.950> going<00:03:11.159> to<00:03:11.220> be<00:03:11.340> directly

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
for the hit is going to be directly

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.509 
for the hit is going to be directly
behind<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.239> ball<00:03:15.920> contact<00:03:16.920> for<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.159> loop<00:03:17.310> is

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
behind the ball contact for the loop is

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:26.080 
behind the ball contact for the loop is
going<00:03:17.640> to<00:03:17.819> be<00:03:17.970> just<00:03:18.299> above<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:19.049> equator<00:03:19.319> line

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.149 

for<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.150> hit<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:28.109> type<00:03:28.349> of<00:03:28.530> contact<00:03:28.859> is<00:03:29.040> going

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
for the hit the type of contact is going

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:39.649 
for the hit the type of contact is going
to<00:03:29.280> be<00:03:29.340> force<00:03:29.700> over<00:03:30.060> friction<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:38.569> for<00:03:39.569> the

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
to be force over friction and for the

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.390 
to be force over friction and for the
loop<00:03:39.840> type<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.680> contact<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.159> gonna<00:03:41.310> be

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
loop type of contact is gonna be

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:51.050 
loop type of contact is gonna be
friction<00:03:41.909> over<00:03:42.030> force

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.580 

so<00:03:52.060> make<00:03:52.240> sure<00:03:52.270> you<00:03:52.810> keep<00:03:53.050> this<00:03:53.200> in<00:03:53.380> mind

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
so make sure you keep this in mind

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.170 
so make sure you keep this in mind
because<00:03:53.980> you're<00:03:54.100> going<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.340> be<00:03:54.460> constantly

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
because you're going to be constantly

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:46.410 
because you're going to be constantly
turning<00:03:55.900> over<00:03:56.200> both<00:03:56.800> of<00:03:56.980> these<00:03:57.070> shots

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.480
