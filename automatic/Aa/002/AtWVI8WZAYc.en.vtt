the same one that I had for the ruler

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.780 
the same one that I had for the ruler
sword<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.649> that's<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.130> simple<00:01:56.430> fact<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.670> I

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
sword and that's the simple fact that I

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.060 
sword and that's the simple fact that I
don't<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> two-handed<00:01:57.960> move<00:01:58.110> set<00:01:58.350> I'm

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
don't like the two-handed move set I'm

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.590 
don't like the two-handed move set I'm
not<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> big<00:01:59.430> fan<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.820> horizontal<00:02:00.390> or<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
not a big fan of the horizontal or the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.020 
not a big fan of the horizontal or the
vertical<00:02:00.840> attacks<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.619> mean<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
vertical attacks I mean and the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.179 
vertical attacks I mean and the
two-handed<00:02:03.540> Artoo's<00:02:03.960> are<00:02:04.290> just<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.979> slower

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
two-handed Artoo's are just a slower

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.219 
two-handed Artoo's are just a slower
version<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.759> my<00:02:05.850> opinion<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.689> one-handed

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
version in my opinion of the one-handed

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.400 
version in my opinion of the one-handed
Artoo's<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.399> said<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> big<00:02:09.390> fan<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:10.140> as

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
Artoo's like I said not a big fan but as

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.350 
Artoo's like I said not a big fan but as
far<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.679> using<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:11.700> hand<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.030> move<00:02:12.120> set

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
far as using the one hand and move set

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.430 
far as using the one hand and move set
it's<00:02:12.540> good<00:02:12.780> enough<00:02:13.050> from

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
it's good enough from

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.740 
it's good enough from
to<00:02:13.620> use<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.220> PvP<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.000> still<00:02:15.420> have<00:02:15.570> some

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
to use it in PvP and still have some

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.900 
to use it in PvP and still have some
pretty<00:02:15.870> good<00:02:15.960> results<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.430> pros<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.640> this

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
pretty good results the pros of this

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.390 
pretty good results the pros of this
weapon<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:19.140> dex<00:02:19.530> build<00:02:19.680> weapon

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
weapon is that it is a dex build weapon

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.280 
weapon is that it is a dex build weapon
now<00:02:20.970> if<00:02:21.390> you're<00:02:21.600> a<00:02:21.630> shrink<00:02:21.870> build<00:02:22.110> that's

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
now if you're a shrink build that's

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.200 
now if you're a shrink build that's
obviously<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.770> con<00:02:23.040> but<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.550> are<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.790> dex

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
obviously a con but if you are a dex

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.420 
obviously a con but if you are a dex
build<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.290> great<00:02:25.860> sword<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.370> you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
build and this is a great sword that you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.070 
build and this is a great sword that you
can<00:02:26.640> actually<00:02:26.820> use<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.690> does<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> decent

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
can actually use that does a decent

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.470 
can actually use that does a decent
amount<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.470> poise<00:02:28.620> damage<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.280> use<00:02:29.940> this<00:02:30.180> sword

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
amount of poise damage I use this sword

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.020 
amount of poise damage I use this sword
pretty<00:02:30.810> much<00:02:30.990> for<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.500> better<00:02:32.250> part<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.790> my

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
pretty much for the better part of my

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.720 
pretty much for the better part of my
New<00:02:33.210> Game+<00:02:33.540> playthrough<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.410> in<00:02:35.160> all<00:02:35.280> honesty

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
New Game+ playthrough and in all honesty

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.060 
New Game+ playthrough and in all honesty
making<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.390> switch<00:02:36.750> from<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.260> katana<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.920> this

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
making a switch from a katana to this

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.630 
making a switch from a katana to this
was<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> pretty<00:02:39.150> good<00:02:39.300> change<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:40.470> katana<00:02:40.920> does

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
was a pretty good change the katana does

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.950 
was a pretty good change the katana does
not<00:02:41.820> do<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> lot<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.240> poise<00:02:42.360> damage<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.840> these

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
not do a lot of poise damage to these

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.260 
not do a lot of poise damage to these
enemies<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.040> when<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.250> was<00:02:44.340> finally<00:02:44.670> using<00:02:45.180> this

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
enemies so when I was finally using this

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.290 
enemies so when I was finally using this
weapon<00:02:45.560> in<00:02:46.560> my<00:02:47.040> New<00:02:47.190> Game+<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.850> actually

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
weapon in my New Game+ and actually

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.690 
weapon in my New Game+ and actually
being<00:02:48.480> able<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.920> stun<00:02:49.920> lock<00:02:50.100> these<00:02:50.340> enemies

being able to stun lock these enemies

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.190 
being able to stun lock these enemies
was<00:02:51.090> actually<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.420> pretty<00:02:51.600> good<00:02:51.900> and

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
was actually a pretty good and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.050 
was actually a pretty good and
refreshing<00:02:52.920> thing<00:02:53.160> especially<00:02:53.430> since<00:02:53.730> I<00:02:54.000> just

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
refreshing thing especially since I just

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.210 
refreshing thing especially since I just
wanted<00:02:54.570> to<00:02:54.720> get<00:02:54.990> through<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.530> areas<00:02:55.920> as<00:02:56.070> much

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
wanted to get through the areas as much

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.850 
wanted to get through the areas as much
as<00:02:56.370> possible<00:02:56.550> when<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.420> use<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.690> katana<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.290> tend

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
as possible when I use the katana I tend

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.710 
as possible when I use the katana I tend
to<00:02:58.920> have<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.190> dodge<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.670> lot<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.150> what<00:03:00.600> this

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
to have to dodge a lot and what this

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.200 
to have to dodge a lot and what this
weapon<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.170> pretty<00:03:01.500> much<00:03:01.590> can<00:03:01.890> only<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.760> pretty

this weapon stand alone is pretty good I
guess<00:03:22.800> if<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.100> are<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.370> faith<00:03:23.820> build<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.300> can

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
guess if you are a faith build you can

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.270 
guess if you are a faith build you can
infuse<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.650> with<00:03:25.739> lightning<00:03:26.130> or<00:03:26.250> something

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
infuse it with lightning or something

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.910 
infuse it with lightning or something
like<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.670> maybe<00:03:27.300> even<00:03:27.480> fire<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.260> obviously

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
like that maybe even fire and obviously

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.830 
like that maybe even fire and obviously
if<00:03:29.220> you're<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.400> hex<00:03:29.760> build<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.209> can<00:03:30.239> infuse<00:03:30.690> it

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
if you're a hex build you can infuse it

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.410 
if you're a hex build you can infuse it
with<00:03:30.989> different<00:03:31.860> type<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.760> know<00:03:32.880> maybe<00:03:33.090> dark

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
with different type you know maybe dark

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.930 
with different type you know maybe dark
or<00:03:33.570> something<00:03:33.840> like<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.170> but<00:03:34.800> for<00:03:35.489> me<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.880> just

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
or something like that but for me I just

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.780 
or something like that but for me I just
use<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.420> standard<00:03:37.080> as<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.860> don't<00:03:38.580> really

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
use it standard as it is I don't really

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.310 
use it standard as it is I don't really
feel<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.000> need<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.360> infuse<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.930> because

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
feel the need to infuse it because

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.229 
feel the need to infuse it because
there's<00:03:41.010> really<00:03:41.220> not<00:03:41.430> anything<00:03:41.790> that<00:03:42.090> would

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
there's really not anything that would

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.390 
there's really not anything that would
benefit<00:03:42.600> me<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.810> whole<00:03:43.110> lot<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.920> kind<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.190> keep

not<00:03:46.920> much<00:03:47.130> tactics<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:47.850> just<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.120> standard
