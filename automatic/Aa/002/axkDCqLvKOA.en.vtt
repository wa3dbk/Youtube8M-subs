in my summoner video there was also a
stump<00:04:50.050> writer<00:04:50.289> machine<00:04:50.740> so<00:04:50.979> those<00:04:51.190> can<00:04:51.490> be

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
stump writer machine so those can be

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.249 
stump writer machine so those can be
very<00:04:51.849> annoying<00:04:52.180> especially<00:04:52.449> when<00:04:52.990> you're<00:04:53.110> not
