101 8 11 manifold now most people will
typically<00:00:14.790> want<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.030> replace<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.360> regulator

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
typically want to replace a regulator

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.420 
typically want to replace a regulator
this<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.320> regulator<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.710> goes<00:00:16.949> bad<00:00:17.250> on

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this is the regulator that goes bad on

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.570 
this is the regulator that goes bad on
this<00:00:18.529> usually<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.650> manifold<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.189> pretty<00:00:20.400> good

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
this usually the manifold is pretty good

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.029 
this usually the manifold is pretty good
metaphors<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.570> good<00:00:21.720> shape<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
metaphors in good shape but the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.519 
metaphors in good shape but the
regulator<00:00:23.400> seems<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.699> go<00:00:23.820> bad<00:00:24.260> what<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.380> have

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
regulator seems to go bad what we have

regulator seems to go bad what we have
we<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:25.830> these<00:00:26.070> kits<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:27.050> as<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.320> see

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
we have these kits and as you can see

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.380 
we have these kits and as you can see
here<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> kit<00:00:29.010> comes<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.400> knob<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:30.150> upper

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
here the kit comes with a knob the upper

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020 
here the kit comes with a knob the upper
assembly<00:00:31.099> both<00:00:32.099> springs<00:00:32.520> there's<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> spring

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
assembly both springs there's a spring

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.840 
assembly both springs there's a spring
inside<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:34.500> diaphragms<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> inside<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
inside the diaphragms in the inside and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.540 
inside the diaphragms in the inside and
the<00:00:36.719> o-rings<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.620> we<00:00:37.800> have<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.980> four<00:00:38.160> bolt<00:00:38.399> of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the o-rings and we have the four bolt of

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
the o-rings and we have the four bolt of
the<00:00:38.579> plate<00:00:38.850> together<00:00:39.030> here<00:00:39.620> so<00:00:40.620> what<00:00:40.770> I've

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the plate together here so what I've

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.410 
the plate together here so what I've
done<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.190> I've<00:00:41.370> taken<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.820> apart<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
done here is I've taken one apart you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.610 
done here is I've taken one apart you
can<00:00:42.540> see<00:00:42.570> I've<00:00:42.750> loosened<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> bolts<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.440> this

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
can see I've loosened the bolts on this

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.880 
can see I've loosened the bolts on this
one<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:46.050> you'll<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.440> be<00:00:46.680> very

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
one and what you'll do is be very

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.080 
one and what you'll do is be very
careful<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.460> take<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.670> apart<00:00:47.940> because

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
careful when you take it apart because

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
careful when you take it apart because
you<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.360> spring<00:00:48.660> at<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.809> bottom<00:00:49.129> here

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
you have a spring at the bottom here

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.080 
you have a spring at the bottom here
that<00:00:50.399> comes<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> plate<00:00:52.219> and<00:00:53.219> then<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that comes with the plate and then you

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
that comes with the plate and then you
have<00:00:54.239> an<00:00:54.329> o-ring<00:00:54.449> there<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.219> reuse

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
have an o-ring there that you can reuse

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.910 
have an o-ring there that you can reuse
where<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.000> replace<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:58.649> pry

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
where you can just replace it I just pry

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
where you can just replace it I just pry
it<00:00:58.949> out<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.960> pull<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.170> apart<00:01:01.289> here<00:01:02.899> and

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it out and if you pull it apart here and

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.030 
it out and if you pull it apart here and
be<00:01:04.019> careful<00:01:04.379> if<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> spring<00:01:04.920> inside

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
be careful if you have a spring inside

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.469 
be careful if you have a spring inside
here<00:01:05.489> too<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.909> diaphragm<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:09.299> there's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
here too with the diaphragm and there's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.410 
here too with the diaphragm and there's
another<00:01:09.689> oring<00:01:10.939> if<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.210> replace

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
another oring if you want to replace

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.840 
another oring if you want to replace
that<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> don't<00:01:13.140> that's<00:01:13.409> fine<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that if you don't that's fine but you

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.550 
that if you don't that's fine but you
know<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.000> get<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> kits<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.140> either

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
know you get one with the kits so either

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.320 
know you get one with the kits so either
pry<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.400> replace<00:01:17.700> where<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.180> reuse

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
pry that out replace where you can reuse

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.570 
pry that out replace where you can reuse
it<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:20.400> here<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.299> diaphragm<00:01:22.580> and

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it and here you have the diaphragm and

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.340 
it and here you have the diaphragm and
if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.030> usually<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.600> keep<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.930> together

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
if you usually if you keep this together

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.100 
if you usually if you keep this together
it'll<00:01:25.619> come<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:26.070> come<00:01:26.250> together<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.990> can

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
it'll come all come together you can

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.530 
it'll come all come together you can
just<00:01:28.140> pull<00:01:28.799> yours<00:01:29.040> out<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> old<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.759> put<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
just pull yours out the old one put the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.580 
just pull yours out the old one put the
new<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.869> you're<00:01:31.140> good<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.409> go

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
new one in you're good to go

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.999 
new one in you're good to go
but<00:01:32.520> that'll<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:32.880> come<00:01:32.909> together<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.920> just<00:01:34.920> be

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
but that'll all come together so just be

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.050 
but that'll all come together so just be
careful<00:01:35.159> when<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.430> take<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.640> apart<00:01:35.880> because

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
careful when you take it apart because

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.880 
careful when you take it apart because
it<00:01:36.240> will<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:38.610> will<00:01:38.850> kick<00:01:39.720> back<00:01:39.750> when<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.710> first

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
it will it will kick back when you first

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.300 
it will it will kick back when you first
take<00:01:41.100> off<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> bolts<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.950> careful<00:01:44.220> when

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
take off the bolts so be careful when

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.190 
take off the bolts so be careful when
you<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.750> simply<00:01:45.899> take

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you do that so if you just simply take

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.679 
you do that so if you just simply take
it<00:01:46.229> out<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.530> bag<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:48.030> reassemble<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it out of the bag just reassemble it the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.109 
it out of the bag just reassemble it the
same<00:01:48.869> way<00:01:49.340> put<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.729> top<00:01:53.119> there's

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
same way put all this on top there's

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.249 
same way put all this on top there's
your<00:01:54.270> o-ring<00:01:54.600> put<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.350> ring<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:57.049> and<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.170> you

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
your o-ring put the ring in and if you
