00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
you know the crowd is appreciative but

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.640 
you know the crowd is appreciative but
they've<00:02:43.880> they've<00:02:44.690> seen<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.019> all<00:02:45.110> before

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
they've they've seen it all before

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.440 
they've they've seen it all before
but<00:02:46.370> most<00:02:46.610> of<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.790> people<00:02:46.910> here<00:02:47.180> have<00:02:47.300> never

think this is something that's going to
be<00:02:52.580> talked<00:02:52.790> about<00:02:52.910> for<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.299> really<00:02:53.630> long<00:02:53.810> time
