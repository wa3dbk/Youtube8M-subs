00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
weaker really game clear speeds and he

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.020 
weaker really game clear speeds and he
is<00:01:22.229> also<00:01:22.650> pretty<00:01:23.009> weak<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.490> he<00:01:23.580> falls<00:01:23.850> behind

probably two of the easiest junglers on

probably two of the easiest junglers on
my<00:05:37.909> list<00:05:38.150> so<00:05:38.330> if<00:05:38.479> you're<00:05:38.629> new<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.080> jungle

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
my list so if you're new to the jungle

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.079 
my list so if you're new to the jungle
then<00:05:39.650> I<00:05:39.680> definitely<00:05:40.039> recommend<00:05:40.370> picking<00:05:40.819> up

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:41.089 
then I definitely recommend picking up

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.779 
then I definitely recommend picking up
one<00:05:41.330> of<00:05:41.360> those<00:05:41.569> to<00:05:42.129> shockoe<00:05:43.129> definitely

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
one of those to shockoe definitely

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.029 
one of those to shockoe definitely
relies<00:05:44.180> on<00:05:44.210> having<00:05:44.719> a<00:05:44.960> strong<00:05:45.199> early<00:05:45.589> game<00:05:45.800> and

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
relies on having a strong early game and

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.490 
relies on having a strong early game and
he<00:05:46.669> he<00:05:47.120> snowballs<00:05:47.509> pretty<00:05:47.779> hard<00:05:48.050> but<00:05:48.259> if<00:05:48.409> you

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
he he snowballs pretty hard but if you

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.379 
he he snowballs pretty hard but if you
do<00:05:48.740> fall<00:05:49.039> behind<00:05:49.190> with<00:05:49.520> him<00:05:49.699> then<00:05:49.909> he<00:05:50.029> becomes

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
do fall behind with him then he becomes

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:52.719 
do fall behind with him then he becomes
pretty<00:05:50.719> useless<00:05:51.110> because<00:05:51.379> he's<00:05:52.039> very<00:05:52.370> squishy

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
pretty useless because he's very squishy

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:53.950 
pretty useless because he's very squishy
and<00:05:52.909> he's<00:05:53.150> just<00:05:53.270> going<00:05:53.449> to<00:05:53.539> get<00:05:53.629> blown<00:05:53.930> up

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
and he's just going to get blown up

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.679 
and he's just going to get blown up
pretty<00:05:54.469> quickly<00:05:54.710> in<00:05:54.949> teamfights<00:05:55.219> and<00:05:55.819> he

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:56.689 
pretty quickly in teamfights and he

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:59.140 
pretty quickly in teamfights and he
really<00:05:57.500> doesn't<00:05:57.800> have<00:05:57.919> any<00:05:58.189> good<00:05:58.400> CC<00:05:58.909> either

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
really doesn't have any good CC either

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.579 
really doesn't have any good CC either
so<00:05:59.569> you<00:05:59.629> want<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.050> make<00:06:00.080> sure<00:06:00.169> that<00:06:00.469> you're

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:00.589 
so you want to make sure that you're

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.290 
so you want to make sure that you're
getting<00:06:00.740> gang<00:06:01.099> stop<00:06:01.370> in<00:06:01.550> the<00:06:01.669> early<00:06:01.969> game<00:06:02.150> with

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
getting gang stop in the early game with

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.300 
getting gang stop in the early game with
shaco<00:06:02.659> and<00:06:02.870> picking<00:06:03.469> up<00:06:03.529> some<00:06:03.740> kills<00:06:04.039> because

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
shaco and picking up some kills because

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.629 
shaco and picking up some kills because
if<00:06:04.580> you<00:06:04.669> don't<00:06:04.879> then<00:06:05.120> he<00:06:05.330> is<00:06:05.509> fairly<00:06:05.900> useless

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
if you don't then he is fairly useless

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.450 
if you don't then he is fairly useless
leeson<00:06:07.639> is<00:06:07.819> more<00:06:08.120> of<00:06:08.330> a<00:06:08.479> skilled<00:06:08.990> champion<00:06:09.710> if

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
leeson is more of a skilled champion if

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.730 
leeson is more of a skilled champion if
you<00:06:10.639> can<00:06:10.939> lend<00:06:11.089> his<00:06:11.270> Q<00:06:11.569> you<00:06:11.839> can<00:06:12.020> insect<00:06:12.529> kick

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
you can lend his Q you can insect kick

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.320 
you can lend his Q you can insect kick
and<00:06:12.919> you<00:06:13.039> can<00:06:13.189> war<00:06:13.400> jump<00:06:13.699> then<00:06:13.849> he's<00:06:13.969> a<00:06:14.000> pretty

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
and you can war jump then he's a pretty

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.050 
and you can war jump then he's a pretty
good<00:06:14.569> pic<00:06:14.779> but<00:06:14.960> if<00:06:15.110> you<00:06:15.199> can't<00:06:15.560> do<00:06:15.889> any<00:06:16.849> of

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
good pic but if you can't do any of

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.670 
good pic but if you can't do any of
those<00:06:17.210> three<00:06:17.539> then<00:06:17.870> I<00:06:17.900> wouldn't<00:06:18.349> recommend

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
those three then I wouldn't recommend

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.260 
those three then I wouldn't recommend
picking<00:06:18.919> him<00:06:19.189> up<00:06:19.310> because<00:06:19.550> you're<00:06:19.939> missing

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
picking him up because you're missing

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.629 
picking him up because you're missing

out on a lot of his kit amumu is

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.369 
out on a lot of his kit amumu is
probably<00:06:23.029> the<00:06:23.180> best<00:06:23.360> team<00:06:23.659> fighting<00:06:23.900> jungler
