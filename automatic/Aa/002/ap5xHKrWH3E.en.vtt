00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.140
 another video of it is my second 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.949
 Video out with an outfit is just a 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.509
 a little more so much more 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.429
 complicated can be said to be complicated 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.669
 first as the first was rather 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.669
 simple 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.150
 I wore precisely wore a polo shirt is 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.060
 a pair of jeans 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.380
 it was something very simple in this 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.440
 outfit I limited myself to putting one 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.410
 shirt and a little more particular 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.420
 a little bit more fancy earrings 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.890
 also because it is still beautiful 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.180
 color and then just the days you ok it is 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.580
 also true that system may unfortunately 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.090
 these days are users in each 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.220
 seems almost to be in March it is 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.449
 changing is not changing all and 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.020
 end of the world 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.539
 then precisely for this outfit that me 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.140
 I thought of it as an outfit from the first 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.969
 afternoon cocktail cocktail in short 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.920

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.880
 turn it into an evening outfit because 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.670
 because anyway I like this one a 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.170
 me but yes but I like to wear 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.630
 this type 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.350
 clothing this type of this 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.969
 fashion I like to use it even in the evening 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.689
 to an outlet that I like to wear too 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:45.250

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.979

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.319

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.229

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.340
 but I will also show you with 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.920
 with heel 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.530
 how the look changes because of 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.259
 heel now did not die does his figure 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.599
 so if you put the boss if a 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.679
 tradition with a little more feminine 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:08.229
 a whole other thing 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:11.440
 fig ac entrusted with the cap that makes you good 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.630
 then let's start with accessories like 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.239
 accessory before showing the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.730
 accessories tell you what I used to 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:21.819
 the look with regards to the look 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.810
 decided to apply a black eye shadow 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.910
 which is actually an eyeliner but is in 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.739
 there is no powder laimer powder 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.769
 never found as good as heiner and so i have 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:38.530
 decided to use it as an eye shadow is 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:40.450
 this one of essence so I have it 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.989
 applied this aside it will then have it 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.810
 simply shaded with a small brush 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.060
 and I applied the mascara after 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:56.760
 made all the base and finally I have 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:03:00.489
 applied this lip gloss nothing like 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.870
 as a polish I chose to wear 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.319
 this one even if I haven't yet 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.319
 put I chose to wear this here 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.280
 this you see here 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:21.799
 and is the number 88 of me soudant can 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.510
 be the enamel and still recalls 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.000
 called the earrings calls you the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.260
 cold and emerge hicks that I find up 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.150
 this shirt 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.829
 too too pretty that now we go to 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.190
 seeing together is a mesh that speaks from 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:38.190
 that is, only describes you describes me for 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.909
 as I am I love shopping as well 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.829
 describes a little and here are the seven 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.379
 vices 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:50.000
 here this is the shirt worn goes 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:54.810
 just put on the white weapon 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.769
 behind this is the money order with and precisely 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.099
 the sets 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.150
 the seven vices included then becomes 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:05.959
 lot where they are shopping so maybe 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.120
 a cabin shirt that speaks for itself and 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:13.560
 wide the hill is very wide so I have 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.829
 decided to make her put it one wrong 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.109
 because anyway I like the effect myself 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.450
 I think it's a little Trentino 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.090
 pretty sexy seen since 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.250
 I like this effect here so I like it 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.330
 I like how I changed it 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:34.650
 curtain washing has turned red 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.419
 you will not see very little you will see 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.430
 very little however feed 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.430
 no no you can't see it like this you can't see but 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.979
 you can't see I was just reds but reds 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.919
 they do not wind but cannot be seen then 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.660
 these are too cute 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.610
 I found her at 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:59.310
 missed at the price of 6 euros then at 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.720
 great and I know that maybe it's difficult 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.850
 find a shirt like that maybe 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.040
 go to the market of yours in the 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.360
 your city might even be that is 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.470
 managed to find in this shirt 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.860
 at the same price then as jeans I have 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:17.580
 chosen these here that are precisely 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:22.320
 always very close-fitting jeans is a lot 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:27.210
 very clear just below we see that 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:29.100
 they are very tight they are clothes and nothing 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:32.460
 they are covered behind for example with 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.770
 this questionnaire has it anyway 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.990
 quite long so it should be worn 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.550
 milk another and it is very very cute 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.820
 because forward and is short but behind more 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.000
 long so the effect is very much 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.370
 cute dancers now let's see 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.360
 The dancers 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.860
 these are the dancers I chose 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.770
 for this I am a very blush color 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:03.270
 very clear very nice they are 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:06.429
 very nice with studs 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.389
 of the studs applied the point on 

00:06:06.429 --> 00:06:09.389
 all the valley 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.270
 second alternative for this outing of 

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:22.140
 they promised everything I would have done 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:26.580
 see a print with contact 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:30.330
 I chose these beautiful shoes you have 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.780
 quite others however very simple e 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.220
 at the same time this 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:39.840
 these are practically instead 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:43.560
 suede just ticked forward and 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:46.800
 they are very very nice they are in my opinion 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.890
 do it when always almost always his 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.890
 figure
