00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.650
 hello friends with you karabash 74 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.570
 today we look at the next 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.409
 modification for the game euro truck 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.800
 simulator 2 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:26.039
 is it mercedes actros online something 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.980
 stretched here is naturally he in 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.839
 car show mersedes 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.259
 So go directly to the configuration because 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.109
 what 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:42.379
 cars in the long run there is no way 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:45.530
 the whole thing does not change here in London 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.780
 here it is 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.929
 we get a monster I don't know who 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.929
 in the head it came to create a second 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:05.489
 just in a row rented a voice sits down here 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.610
 who came to mind but somebody is 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.190
 created and we will now test it as 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.100
 it generally works I think so in 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.710
 Basically, that's all 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.340
 all update ends except elongated 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.770
 cabins 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.800
 but I could not show it to you because 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.770
 that you know that I love all kinds of nonsense 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:34.860
 consider that is people show 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:39.450
 what moda is actually capable of doing here 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.520
 so let the metallic be on 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.770
 to a large draw you know even 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.780
 I do not want anything because well what 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.480
 sense all this here to cling if all this 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:54.780
 meaningless ie we need this very 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:59.450
 main wheels let it put 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:03.120
 What beautiful and on this we finish 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.490
 This will be and you know a short review 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.320
 very short 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.290
 because it's really only looking here 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.440
 only here on this one 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:17.100
 Mers elongated wagon type that is 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.200
 how much is the king more here by and large 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:25.070
 account and see then there is nothing like that 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.450
 here I will not put anything more 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.920
 let's take a picture on the thumbnail 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.920
 this car 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.780
 as here so here probably yes and let's go 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.019
 we will test it we will try to get it 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.930
 any and truck 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.260
 wagon and let's see I'm a bit bitchy guys 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:58.639
 Sorry of course if someone gets it but 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:10.470
 i am just sick until now trade-in and 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:14.010
 forward forward forward forward so it seems 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.430
 it all worked I was terrified if 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.430
 fair 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.189
 great but i'm telling he doesn’t 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.569
 exchanged i.e. it is the same 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:32.579
 mercedes actros 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:34.700
 and yes yes to include us we go to us 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:42.090
 principle right away 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:44.970
 opposite practically a warehouse where he x 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.079
 closer and have to go around damn 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.079
 stared at the radar 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.600
 Now we ’ll go round and try 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.020
 stock up on anything 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.540
 him put before after Maza then of course 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.880
 difficult day to drive in turn 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.880
 stop as a stop 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.820
 maz even with odds comes in without problems 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.430
 turns 504 which on the review we had 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:28.490
 Today 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:30.900
 and give him some big wagon take 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:36.990
 in principle, they are all the same here 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.169
 We went to pick up our odds in the Diana 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.169
 the end 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:05.920
 so hooked 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:08.800
 Well, kolis is interesting to interfere with the topic 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.410
 nothing will be okay everything is gone 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.630
 conflicts do not interfere with him I do not understand for 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:20.320
 Why create such a crap long 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:24.240
 if the collision doesn't work anyway 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.240
 it does not interfere with it booth 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:36.009
 in general here is such a nonsense that is the game 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:38.919
 also not without sense of humor and delirium on 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:41.529
 floor wagon we have a cabin basically everything 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:44.229
 great everything is great and so on 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:47.379
 large slag course full with 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:50.499
