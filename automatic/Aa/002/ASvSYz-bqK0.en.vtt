00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.630
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.950
 new edition of germany's today 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.349
 the smart fortwo in the third 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.259
 generation a car what with his 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.210
 Introduction in 1998 for a small one 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.239
 revolution on the European 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.489
 has taken care of the automotive sector completely new 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.980
 designed at the smart fortwo in the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.140
 third generation daimler has that and 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.580
 design particularly like the in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.360
 based on the previous model 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.379
 designed character as well as the novel 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.379
 spotlight design 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.500
 the side view smart presents itself 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.280
 also smart in the third generation 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.930
 fish that is due to the tridion 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.460
 safety cell in the house at that time 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.500
 been in the smart for three generations 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.590
 So used since the first smart 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.520
 what is easy for one 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.590
 characteristic appearance and 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.450
 a high level of safety 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.490
 in the case of himself as black 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.670
 painted with my opinion has in 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.920
 combination with the orange 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.479
 Exterior color very good from another old 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.770
 proven concept that also in the 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.460
 third generation of further smarts 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.220
 is pursued 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.050
 open the two-part tailgate 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.119
 something happens in the third generation 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.970
 was different with the previous models 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.470
 the handle has to open the disc has 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.369
 arranged here below fold 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.530
 Mark 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.289
 It was now by a button on the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.679
 glass pane then quite simply 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:58.259
 open and another lever 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.259
 to then lower the main group 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.360
 come here next year 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.200
 interior and has you now 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.420
 tell a lot 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.830
 So we come to the interior checked 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.730
 90 x fortwo with a cockpit what me 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.010
 now clearly open presents too 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:43.220
 this time we have between design with 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.990
 the speedometer of the patch 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.920
 tachometer and the clock which itself 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.520
 now presented on the left side and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.910
 no longer in the center console like 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:00.120
 formerly located in the previous model 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.920
 Now it was with a pinch and the button 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.090
 for the central locking which 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.310
 can be controlled accordingly 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.220
 you keep it so that the nikon 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.350
 automatically after the sound signal at 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.510
 approach automatically closed 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.260
 the same can be done through longer 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.700
 Press again to deactivate 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.510
 located in the center console 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.610
 Central as a navigation system with all 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.470
 possible elements which have not yet 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.450
 in operation there is the light 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.740
 switched on 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.560
 Now you can see the time in the 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.180
 upper right corner the current one 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.490
 Outside temperature in the case 18 degrees 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.930
 probably the central one down below 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:48.000
 Control element for the automatic climate control 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.810
 which with an important detail 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.230
 Although the direction is the switch as with 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.420
 a lupe issued that one if you want 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.850
 such a whole shifts accordingly 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.980
 directly big sees which number of degrees yes 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.660
 now, before violence, that's noticed 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.660
 Automatic climate control 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:35.520
 So the vehicle is the vehicle 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.070
 noticed that simply stretch better 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:53.980
 by handyman the vehicle tends 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:57.600
 less to beat and high waves 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.600
 we would now by the new 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:48.630
 much more comfortable due to it 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:48.630
 that through 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:22.680
 the bigger one in my opinion that the 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:22.680
 engines currently want
