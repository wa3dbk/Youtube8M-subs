00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.740
 in Cologne there is a huge people's November weather of the raging descent 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.510
 unhappy 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.810
 and the RZB can 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.819
 so far know white jerseys 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.699
 catching up for the moment 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.699
 the remaining defendants bet the fraudsters 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.320
 as planned 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 In the first leg in Budapest, Stephan Engels was not the only change 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.260
 So four and the children the attacker Petric would have in the same cast 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.260
 compete similarly 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.100
 just newcomers 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.480
 commit serious violent crime 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.110
 both ship will take over 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.110
 the first half is good 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.060
 over 100 meters 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.920
 the suitcase and handlebar of the crew 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.330
 the break of the grand coalition in Kiel we want to wait 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.120
 but the balance sheet is still recovering today 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.030
 for the Balkan state 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.030
 the forecasts seek and find their way 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.090
 while Matthias Hönerbach 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.370
 the dialogue just for coming election 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.159
 Monitor the twice successfully was the point 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.200
 for the Cologne authority goal shooting that this at the earliest to the 1 2 3 Dip 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.900
 do 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.680
 Paul Steiner 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 Street 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.880
 more Durban 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.369
 This is 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:25.959
 more with 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.959
 we can become 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.829
 Martin Kloth dpa 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.579
 the administration 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.949
 unreachable for Schumacher deflected into his own goal we will him 

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.949
 certainly go again 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.679
 and again you can give a happy ending 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.679
 more 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.519
 during dusk 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.419
 3,000 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.319
 here again the advertising drum 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:10.139
 the raising of salaries 

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:17.219
 and then with your knee 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.769
 Blancs Strack makes the ball unreachable for Schumacher into his own net 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.349
 everything is still in this game 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.349
 but now the lead of Carol 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.889
 and the rest have been sold before 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.899
 good pass on Klaus Fischer 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:48.549
 two years 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.549
 but also different meaning 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.489
 in a 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.619
 forgive 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:03.499
 then Corner 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:06.499
 more detailed remains 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.139
 The Bavarians wanted to loud Büscher 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.309
 this is ready 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:15.599
 from Charlotte 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.599
 the delegate get a yellow card 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.150
 more 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.680
 3 4 2 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.680
 consistently lacking money 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.539
 and how they look forward to the players or we drop this we see 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.529
 Flugkopfball the once again 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.029
 It sure will look great on tips 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:00.029
 against Schumacher just can not hold 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.469
 After 68 minutes it is called 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:07.469
 3 2 2 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:12.749
 and now the Cologne Paris he must be converted from and where is the 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.749
 Stork load looks at the clock 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:20.089
 Forster is Klaus Allofs 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.900
 a successful Fricke 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.740
 choirmaster 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.289
 in the 89th 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.349
 Minute established Lutz Weidler Klaus Allofs 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.930
 another chance for Cologne 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.710
 scored two goals, according to Allofs one of the best in Cologne jersey today 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.710
 Eve 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:55.650
 deflected by goalkeeper unreachable for commuters 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.650
 the 4 2 2 1 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:02.900
 The Cologne defenders have done well despite the two 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.479
 Goals against that one is allowed 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.449
 calmly say Stegner threw 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.369
 a safe guard of fish 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:13.719
 Steiner as he is mostly in control Prestin retreated this picture 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:14.639
 set 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.270
 good from the affair although the chain is 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.270
 scored the important second goal for the Hungarians 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.800
 but what good is that? 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.099
 if the goals concede 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.249
 you have to be so closed occur the page 5 would have to be 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.509
 Here I would only have plenty of training 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:43.050
 the Hungarian player her electoral cattle here she just tries the ball 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.360
 chip away at 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.360
 because now we can only be seconds 

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:50.869
 further tee of Schumacher 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:05.589
 every team had 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:08.779
 Zumtobel the Hungarians concluded because 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:11.779
 Often this load is Darfeld

 download-links Blackberry toyota-pilot according to Fischer 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.419
 in this game there everything on the foot on 6 off 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:27.689
 we will go over this topic again 

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:36.939
 Klaus Fischer the Cologne attackers harmonized well 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.909
 Brigitte second the referee's final whistle as goal from Norway 

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:45.909
 Boy lights the class 

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:51.199
 at the tv-show the first quarter is the team you have to say 

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:52.539
 well played 

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:55.539
