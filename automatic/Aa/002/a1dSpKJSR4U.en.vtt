and<00:03:30.880> then<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.090> can<00:03:31.209> come<00:03:31.269> up<00:03:31.420> here<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.660> I<00:03:31.840> can

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
and then I can come up here and I can

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.900 
and then I can come up here and I can
tap<00:03:32.830> on<00:03:33.040> things<00:03:33.340> go<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.030> window<00:03:34.680> tap<00:03:35.910> finder

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
tap on things go to window tap finder

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.420 
tap on things go to window tap finder
tap<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:38.230> may<00:03:38.320> find<00:03:38.530> that's<00:03:38.680> more<00:03:38.890> useful<00:03:39.250> and

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
tap you may find that's more useful and

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.220 
tap you may find that's more useful and
it's<00:03:39.820> pretty<00:03:40.090> much<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.239> one-to-one<00:03:40.720> ratio<00:03:40.900> as

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
it's pretty much a one-to-one ratio as

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.350 
it's pretty much a one-to-one ratio as
you<00:03:41.320> move<00:03:41.470> your<00:03:41.620> finger<00:03:41.890> across<00:03:42.239> except<00:03:43.239> when

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
you move your finger across except when

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.670 
you move your finger across except when
you<00:03:43.450> have<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.630> zoom<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.200> will<00:03:44.290> have<00:03:44.530> to

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
you have to zoom in and you will have to

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.720 
you have to zoom in and you will have to
zoom<00:03:44.829> in<00:03:45.040> because<00:03:45.280> when<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.430> want<00:03:45.579> to<00:03:45.640> get

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
zoom in because when you want to get

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.990 
zoom in because when you want to get
into<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.030> dock<00:03:46.650> zoom<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:47.799> there<00:03:48.010> we<00:03:48.070> go<00:03:48.160> to

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
into the dock zoom in there we go to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.670 
into the dock zoom in there we go to
launch<00:03:49.209> that<00:03:49.450> application<00:03:50.140> that<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:50.380> want<00:03:50.560> to

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
launch that application that you want to

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.670 
launch that application that you want to
get<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:51.299> then<00:03:54.750> then<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.900> takes<00:03:56.350> a<00:03:56.440> little<00:03:56.590> more

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
get to then then it takes a little more

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.890 
get to then then it takes a little more
moving<00:03:57.519> across<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:58.090> get<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.360> what<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:58.600> want

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.390

and I able to go in here and launch
programs<00:04:10.500> do<00:04:11.500> stuff<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:11.890> can<00:04:12.040> check<00:04:12.160> on<00:04:12.280> the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
programs do stuff I can check on the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.610 
programs do stuff I can check on the
status<00:04:12.579> of<00:04:13.110> projects<00:04:14.110> that<00:04:14.140> are<00:04:14.290> going<00:04:14.440> on

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
status of projects that are going on

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.469 
status of projects that are going on
this<00:04:15.160> is<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.370> big<00:04:15.579> plus<00:04:15.730> for<00:04:15.790> me<00:04:16.000> because<00:04:16.359> I

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
this is a big plus for me because I

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.909 
this is a big plus for me because I
often<00:04:16.600> have<00:04:16.780> to<00:04:16.870> render<00:04:17.079> files<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.650> it's<00:04:17.739> nice

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
often have to render files and it's nice

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.560 
often have to render files and it's nice
to<00:04:18.040> be<00:04:18.070> able<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.310> access<00:04:18.430> another<00:04:18.910> computer<00:04:19.450> to

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
to be able to access another computer to

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.449 
to be able to access another computer to
see<00:04:19.690> if<00:04:19.720> it's<00:04:19.900> done<00:04:20.190> compressing<00:04:21.190> the<00:04:21.280> file

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
see if it's done compressing the file

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.219 
see if it's done compressing the file
and<00:04:21.640> compressor<00:04:22.060> so<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.450> i<00:04:22.479> can<00:04:22.599> upload<00:04:23.110> it

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
and compressor so that i can upload it

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:24.870 
and compressor so that i can upload it
to<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.500> internet<00:04:23.890> so<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.460> gives<00:04:24.580> me<00:04:24.700> a<00:04:24.760> way

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
to the internet so this gives me a way

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.280 
to the internet so this gives me a way
to<00:04:24.940> remotely<00:04:25.270> check<00:04:25.690> on<00:04:25.900> compute

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
to remotely check on compute

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.720 
to remotely check on compute
while<00:04:26.950> I'm<00:04:27.280> away<00:04:28.440> mmm<00:04:29.440> you<00:04:30.160> do<00:04:30.280> have<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.460> two

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
while I'm away mmm you do have the two

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.400 
while I'm away mmm you do have the two

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
finger kind of scroll where you can take

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.540 
finger kind of scroll where you can take
do<00:04:32.560> fingers<00:04:32.890> just<00:04:33.010> like<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:33.280> have<00:04:33.370> on<00:04:33.460> the

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
do fingers just like you have on the

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.880 
do fingers just like you have on the
track<00:04:33.820> pads<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.360> macbooks<00:04:34.780> you<00:04:35.620> can<00:04:35.740> just

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
track pads and the macbooks you can just

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.250 
track pads and the macbooks you can just
tap<00:04:36.280> slide<00:04:36.670> down<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.510> see<00:04:37.690> my<00:04:37.810> fingers<00:04:38.110> with

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
tap slide down you see my fingers with

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.160 
tap slide down you see my fingers with
what's<00:04:38.680> happening<00:04:39.010> over<00:04:39.220> here<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.960> just<00:04:40.960> go

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
what's happening over here and just go

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.490 
what's happening over here and just go
up<00:04:41.520> up<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:43.450> Scrolls<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:44.200> other<00:04:44.320> direction

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
up up and it Scrolls the other direction

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.620 
up up and it Scrolls the other direction
so<00:04:45.190> you<00:04:45.250> do<00:04:45.370> it<00:04:45.460> this<00:04:45.550> way<00:04:45.700> to<00:04:45.760> go<00:04:45.940> up<00:04:46.120> this<00:04:46.450> way

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
so you do it this way to go up this way

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.570 
so you do it this way to go up this way
to<00:04:46.690> go<00:04:46.870> down<00:04:47.050> and<00:04:47.380> if<00:04:48.010> you<00:04:48.100> want<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.280> do<00:04:48.370> a<00:04:48.400> right

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
to go down and if you want to do a right

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.390 
to go down and if you want to do a right
click<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:49.840> typically<00:04:50.200> do<00:04:50.680> two<00:04:50.860> fingers<00:04:51.190> and

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
click you typically do two fingers and

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.800 
click you typically do two fingers and
you<00:04:52.000> see<00:04:52.150> what<00:04:52.300> you<00:04:52.390> get<00:04:52.450> in<00:04:52.540> first<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:52.720> have

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
you see what you get in first you have

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.940 
you see what you get in first you have
to<00:04:52.900> get<00:04:52.990> your<00:04:53.080> pointer<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.470> where<00:04:53.560> you<00:04:53.650> want<00:04:53.860> it

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
to get your pointer to where you want it

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.340 
to get your pointer to where you want it
and<00:04:54.130> then<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.060> can<00:04:55.180> do<00:04:55.300> two<00:04:55.780> fingers<00:04:56.110> and<00:04:56.140> it

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
and then you can do two fingers and it

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.300 
and then you can do two fingers and it
gives<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.680> same<00:04:56.800> as<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:56.980> right<00:04:57.130> click

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
gives you the same as the right click

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.980 
gives you the same as the right click
just<00:04:57.670> like<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:57.910> trackpad<00:04:58.270> on<00:04:58.390> the<00:04:58.480> macbook<00:04:58.630> so

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
just like the trackpad on the macbook so

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.720 
just like the trackpad on the macbook so
it's<00:04:59.110> very<00:04:59.350> intuitive<00:04:59.710> now<00:05:00.370> if<00:05:00.430> you<00:05:00.520> want<00:05:00.670> to

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
it's very intuitive now if you want to

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.240 
it's very intuitive now if you want to
move<00:05:00.850> something<00:05:01.230> click<00:05:02.230> the<00:05:02.380> undo<00:05:02.500> let's<00:05:03.160> say

move something click the undo let's say

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.980 
move something click the undo let's say
I<00:05:03.280> want<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.490> move<00:05:03.610> this<00:05:03.760> window<00:05:04.150> first<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:04.780> tap

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
I want to move this window first I tap

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
it to select it and then what you do is

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.720 
it to select it and then what you do is

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
you do a tap and then another tap and

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.640 
you do a tap and then another tap and

you leave your finger on the screen let

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.270 
you leave your finger on the screen let
me<00:05:11.710> show<00:05:11.890> you<00:05:13.380> and<00:05:14.380> then<00:05:14.680> I<00:05:14.710> can<00:05:14.920> move<00:05:14.950> the

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
window and it's very slow to respond

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.150 
window and it's very slow to respond
this<00:05:19.960> is<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.230> biggest<00:05:20.410> minus<00:05:20.860> is<00:05:20.980> that<00:05:21.070> it

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
this is the biggest minus is that it

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.530 
this is the biggest minus is that it
takes<00:05:21.280> a<00:05:21.430> while<00:05:21.580> for<00:05:21.640> it<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:21.910> respond<00:05:22.330> to<00:05:22.450> the

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
takes a while for it to respond to the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.330 
takes a while for it to respond to the
movements<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.350> you<00:05:23.440> have<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.710> be<00:05:23.860> patient<00:05:24.040> if

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
movements so you have to be patient if

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.470 
movements so you have to be patient if
you're<00:05:24.430> going<00:05:24.520> to<00:05:24.610> move<00:05:24.700> windows<00:05:24.910> around<00:05:25.210> and

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
you're going to move windows around and

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.480 
you're going to move windows around and
move<00:05:25.570> icons<00:05:26.020> around<00:05:26.200> on<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.500> desktop<00:05:26.830> you'll

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
move icons around on the desktop you'll

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.570 
move icons around on the desktop you'll
want<00:05:27.670> to<00:05:27.730> make<00:05:27.790> sure<00:05:27.940> that<00:05:28.390> you<00:05:29.310> give<00:05:30.310> it<00:05:30.430> some
