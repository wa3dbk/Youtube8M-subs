today<00:00:00.810> we're<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.260> take<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.500> look<00:00:01.740> at

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
today we're going to take a look at

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.970 
today we're going to take a look at
doing<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.340> mini<00:00:02.580> mash<00:00:02.850> or<00:00:03.330> partial<00:00:04.020> mash<00:00:04.230> and

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
doing a mini mash or partial mash and

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.179 
doing a mini mash or partial mash and
this<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.089> an<00:00:06.210> essence<00:00:06.690> an<00:00:06.870> extra<00:00:07.319> step<00:00:07.560> added

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
this is an essence an extra step added

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.120 
this is an essence an extra step added
to<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.760> extract<00:00:09.330> brewers<00:00:09.719> process<00:00:10.290> where<00:00:11.010> you

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
to the extract brewers process where you

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.980 
to the extract brewers process where you
actually<00:00:11.309> take<00:00:11.730> some<00:00:12.120> grain<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.809> goes

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
actually take some grain and goes

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.039 
actually take some grain and goes
through<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.259> mashing<00:00:13.710> process<00:00:14.240> much<00:00:15.240> as<00:00:15.570> you

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
through a mashing process much as you

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.260 
through a mashing process much as you
would<00:00:16.199> do<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.650> an<00:00:16.710> all<00:00:16.890> brain<00:00:17.250> brewery<00:00:17.820> set<00:00:18.090> up

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
would do in an all brain brewery set up

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.390 
would do in an all brain brewery set up
what<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:19.170> going<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.410> show<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.980> talk<00:00:20.160> about

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
what I'm going to show and talk about

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.340 
what I'm going to show and talk about
today<00:00:20.640> though<00:00:20.880> are<00:00:21.240> some<00:00:21.510> slight<00:00:21.869> lift

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
today though are some slight lift

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.519 
today though are some slight lift

process that will allow you to make a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.890 
process that will allow you to make a
much<00:00:28.470> better<00:00:28.859> beer<00:00:29.359> so<00:00:30.359> let's<00:00:30.510> go<00:00:30.630> ahead<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
much better beer so let's go ahead and

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.139 
much better beer so let's go ahead and
get<00:00:30.990> started<00:00:31.410> here's<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> kit<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.550> got<00:00:33.000> this

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
get started here's the kit I got this

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.360 
get started here's the kit I got this
from<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.480> good<00:00:33.660> friend<00:00:33.899> down<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.530> Austin<00:00:35.130> Texas

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
from a good friend down in Austin Texas

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.910 
from a good friend down in Austin Texas
and<00:00:36.800> it's<00:00:37.800> very<00:00:38.100> typical<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.790> your<00:00:39.649> mini<00:00:40.649> mash

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
and it's very typical of your mini mash

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.520 
and it's very typical of your mini mash
type<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.430> setup<00:00:41.629> we<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> couple<00:00:43.110> pounds<00:00:43.350> of

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
type of setup we have a couple pounds of

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.520 
type of setup we have a couple pounds of
grain<00:00:44.000> with<00:00:45.000> some<00:00:45.239> dried<00:00:46.050> malt<00:00:46.530> extract<00:00:47.360> hops

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
grain with some dried malt extract hops

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.619 
grain with some dried malt extract hops
some<00:00:49.530> sugar<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.489> we're<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.449> go<00:00:51.570> ahead

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
some sugar and we're going to go ahead

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.810 
some sugar and we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:51.809> use<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.079> cattle<00:00:52.410> behind<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.460> do<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
and use the cattle behind it to do the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.869 
and use the cattle behind it to do the
initial<00:00:54.239> process<00:00:55.340> but<00:00:56.340> then<00:00:56.460> I'm<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.760> go

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
initial process but then I'm going to go

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.490 
initial process but then I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.210> move<00:00:57.300> us<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.629> over<00:00:58.820> to<00:00:59.820> my<00:00:59.910> standard

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
ahead and move us on over to my standard

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.920 
ahead and move us on over to my standard
brewing<00:01:01.500> setup<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:02.129> we'll<00:01:02.850> actually<00:01:03.210> do<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
brewing setup here we'll actually do the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
brewing setup here we'll actually do the
boil<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.729> cool<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.799> transfer<00:01:07.799> into

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
boil and the cool down and transfer into

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.050 
boil and the cool down and transfer into
the<00:01:08.939> fermenter<00:01:10.340> so<00:01:11.340> let's<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.640> ahead<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.850> get

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the fermenter so let's go ahead and get

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.530 
the fermenter so let's go ahead and get
started

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
started

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.910 
started
and<00:01:12.659> again<00:01:13.170> I'm<00:01:13.350> not<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.680> go<00:01:13.740> through

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and again I'm not going to go through

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.090 
and again I'm not going to go through
each<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.310> every<00:01:14.400> step<00:01:14.760> because<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.390> see

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
each and every step because you can see

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.830 
each and every step because you can see
that<00:01:17.100> countless<00:01:17.580> times<00:01:17.880> on<00:01:18.060> other<00:01:18.180> videos<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that countless times on other videos I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.050 
that countless times on other videos I
want<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.560> emphasize<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.430> key<00:01:20.610> points

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
want to really emphasize the key points

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.590 
want to really emphasize the key points
as<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.570> go<00:01:21.689> through<00:01:21.930> my<00:01:21.960> process<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.479> go

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
as I go through my process so here we go

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.770 
as I go through my process so here we go
with<00:01:24.750> first<00:01:24.990> step<00:01:25.369> prepare<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> water<00:01:26.780> let's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
with first step prepare the water let's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
with first step prepare the water let's
talk<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.500> second<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> single

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
talk about that for a second the single

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.690 
talk about that for a second the single
largest<00:01:30.240> ingredient<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.290> our<00:01:31.530> beer<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.250> water

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
largest ingredient in our beer is water

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.880 
largest ingredient in our beer is water
so<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.420> makes<00:01:33.630> sense<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.409> want<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> start

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
so it makes sense that we want to start

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.910 
so it makes sense that we want to start
with<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> best<00:01:35.400> possible<00:01:35.700> water<00:01:36.890> what<00:01:37.890> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
with the best possible water what I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.120 
with the best possible water what I
suggest<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.700> looking<00:01:39.090> into<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:40.130> putting

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
suggest you looking into is putting

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.310 
suggest you looking into is putting
together<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.549> simple<00:01:41.970> water<00:01:42.119> filter<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
together a simple water filter out of

you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.360> strongly<00:02:06.870> encourage<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.800> use<00:02:07.980> of

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
you can I strongly encourage the use of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.460 
you can I strongly encourage the use of
a<00:02:08.190> water<00:02:08.429> filter<00:02:11.180> okay<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.540> are<00:02:12.660> almost<00:02:12.960> done

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
a water filter okay we are almost done

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.580 
a water filter okay we are almost done
with<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.980> mashing<00:02:14.490> process<00:02:14.730> here<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.410> did

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
with the mashing process here and I did

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.550 
with the mashing process here and I did
want<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.890> make<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.280> extra<00:02:17.610> point<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:19.260> final

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
want to make one extra point the final

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.340 
want to make one extra point the final
stage<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.280> going<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.520> be<00:02:20.640> to

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
stage of this is going to be to

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.800 
stage of this is going to be to
essentially<00:02:22.350> rinse<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.460> grains<00:02:23.790> with<00:02:24.570> hot

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
essentially rinse the grains with hot

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.170 
essentially rinse the grains with hot
water<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.310> can<00:02:26.430> think<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.790> sort<00:02:27.120> of

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
water and you can think of this sort of

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.840 
water and you can think of this sort of
like<00:02:27.300> making<00:02:27.780> tea<00:02:28.020> if<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.230> will<00:02:28.670> we're<00:02:29.670> going

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
like making tea if you will we're going

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.400 
like making tea if you will we're going
to<00:02:29.910> go<00:02:30.030> ahead<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.890> remove<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.160> grain<00:02:32.370> bag<00:02:32.640> and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
to go ahead and remove the grain bag and

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.630 
to go ahead and remove the grain bag and
then<00:02:34.490> pour<00:02:35.490> over<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.290> water<00:02:37.290> that's<00:02:37.640> 170

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
then pour over it water that's 170

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.770 
then pour over it water that's 170
degrees<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:40.140> point<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.620> want<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.860> make<00:02:40.980> here<00:02:41.400> is

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
degrees the point I want to make here is

spent grain into your boil kettle so

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.199 
spent grain into your boil kettle so
again<00:03:10.560> when<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.190> comes<00:03:11.250> time<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.700> rinse<00:03:12.030> your

again when it comes time to rinse your
grain<00:03:12.470> go<00:03:13.470> ahead<00:03:13.860> use<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.580> hundred<00:03:14.970> seventy

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330

sort of a loose guideline but again

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.740 
sort of a loose guideline but again

out the tannins and other undesirable
attributes<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.549> spent<00:03:32.790> grain<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:34.170> be<00:03:34.590> a

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
attributes of the spent grain so be a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.000

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
going to do is a final rinse and we'll

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.729 
going to do is a final rinse and we'll
be<00:03:43.320> ready<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.709> boil<00:03:44.720> okay<00:03:45.720> let's<00:03:45.989> review<00:03:46.260> where

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
be ready to boil okay let's review where

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.580 
be ready to boil okay let's review where
we<00:03:46.799> are<00:03:47.070> now<00:03:47.780> we<00:03:48.780> went<00:03:48.989> ahead<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.230> compared

we are now we went ahead and compared

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.100 
we are now we went ahead and compared
the<00:03:49.739> water<00:03:49.950> we<00:03:50.880> went<00:03:51.060> ahead<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.480> added<00:03:51.660> rain

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
the water we went ahead and added rain

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.949 
the water we went ahead and added rain
for<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.470> partial<00:03:52.890> match<00:03:53.540> we're<00:03:54.540> at<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.780> point

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
for the partial match we're at the point

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.720 
for the partial match we're at the point
here<00:03:55.170> we're<00:03:55.350> going<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.560> add<00:03:55.739> our<00:03:55.769> extract<00:03:56.489> and

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
here we're going to add our extract and

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.509 
here we're going to add our extract and
begin<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.150> boil<00:03:57.560> now<00:03:58.560> here's<00:03:58.799> another<00:03:59.160> area

begin the boil now here's another area

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.699 
begin the boil now here's another area
where<00:03:59.940> I'm<00:04:00.000> going<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.239> suggest<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.989> different

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
step that's going to make a big

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.340 
step that's going to make a big
improvement<00:04:04.440> to<00:04:04.739> your<00:04:04.860> beer<00:04:05.150> see<00:04:06.150> normally<00:04:06.600> is

the<00:04:17.880> desired<00:04:18.239> level<00:04:18.530> well<00:04:19.530> think<00:04:19.739> about<00:04:19.859> this

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
the desired level well think about this

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.159 
the desired level well think about this
we've<00:04:20.730> gone<00:04:20.910> through<00:04:20.970> all<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.570> trouble<00:04:21.989> to

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
we've gone through all the trouble to

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.830 
we've gone through all the trouble to
prepare<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.800> beautiful<00:04:23.520> word<00:04:23.730> that<00:04:24.630> we're

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
prepare a beautiful word that we're

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.409 
prepare a beautiful word that we're
going<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.110> boil<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:25.770> hop<00:04:25.950> in<00:04:26.340> then<00:04:27.240> at<00:04:27.330> the

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
going to boil and hop in then at the

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.920 
going to boil and hop in then at the
last<00:04:27.660> step<00:04:28.050> we're<00:04:28.680> going<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.860> add<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.930> tap

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
last step we're going to add in tap

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.650 
last step we're going to add in tap
water<00:04:31.370> this<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.730> kind<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.090> thing<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.360> can

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
water this is the kind of thing that can

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.909 
water this is the kind of thing that can
really<00:04:33.810> make<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.110> big<00:04:34.230> difference

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
really make a big difference

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.890 
really make a big difference
think<00:04:35.340> about<00:04:35.550> your<00:04:35.730> tap<00:04:35.940> water<00:04:35.970> that's<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.780> lot

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
think about your tap water that's a lot

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.350 
think about your tap water that's a lot
of<00:04:37.020> chlorine<00:04:37.260> in<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:37.770> a<00:04:37.980> lot<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.520> flavors

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
of chlorine in it a lot of flavors

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.960 
of chlorine in it a lot of flavors
chances<00:04:39.990> are<00:04:40.139> and<00:04:40.490> if<00:04:41.490> you're<00:04:41.640> going<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:41.790> do

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
chances are and if you're going to do

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.820 
chances are and if you're going to do
that<00:04:42.120> as<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.330> final<00:04:42.600> step<00:04:42.780> you're<00:04:43.650> going<00:04:43.770> to

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
that as a final step you're going to

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.500 
that as a final step you're going to
take<00:04:43.980> this<00:04:44.100> beautiful<00:04:44.750> word<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:48.300> lack<00:04:48.480> of

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
take this beautiful word and the lack of

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.090 
take this beautiful word and the lack of
better<00:04:48.750> word<00:04:48.990> pollute<00:04:49.380> it<00:04:49.530> with<00:04:49.770> your<00:04:49.919> tap

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
better word pollute it with your tap

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.000 
better word pollute it with your tap
water<00:04:50.300> so<00:04:51.300> I'm<00:04:51.570> suggesting<00:04:51.870> and<00:04:52.530> what<00:04:52.560> I'm

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
water so I'm suggesting and what I'm

going to do here is add the water right
now<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:56.430> bring<00:04:56.760> my<00:04:56.970> full<00:04:57.360> volume<00:04:57.930> up<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.770> where

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
now to bring my full volume up to where

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.980 
now to bring my full volume up to where
I<00:04:59.010> want<00:04:59.310> it<00:04:59.370> to<00:04:59.430> be<00:04:59.700> I'm<00:05:00.450> going<00:05:00.660> to<00:05:00.720> shoot<00:05:00.870> for

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
I want it to be I'm going to shoot for

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.409 
I want it to be I'm going to shoot for
about<00:05:01.050> five<00:05:01.380> and<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.620> half<00:05:01.680> gallons<00:05:02.210> I'm<00:05:03.210> going

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
about five and a half gallons I'm going

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.360 
about five and a half gallons I'm going
to<00:05:03.479> force<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.870> boil<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.620> evaporation<00:05:05.070> will

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
to force the boil the evaporation will

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.969 
to force the boil the evaporation will
bring<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.669> down<00:05:05.820> to<00:05:06.000> by<00:05:06.150> gallon<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:07.620> here<00:05:07.800> we

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
bring that down to by gallon so here we

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.000 
bring that down to by gallon so here we
are<00:05:08.010> with<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.310> boil<00:05:09.110> well<00:05:10.110> in<00:05:10.290> our<00:05:10.410> way<00:05:10.530> I've

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
are with the boil well in our way I've

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.250 
are with the boil well in our way I've
already<00:05:11.400> added<00:05:11.729> the<00:05:11.940> hop<00:05:12.150> to<00:05:12.360> this<00:05:12.510> it's<00:05:13.169> a

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
already added the hop to this it's a

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.860 
already added the hop to this it's a
single<00:05:13.680> bitter<00:05:14.100> hoppin<00:05:14.610> dition<00:05:15.000> that's<00:05:15.750> all

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
single bitter hoppin dition that's all

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.710 
single bitter hoppin dition that's all
the<00:05:16.020> recipe<00:05:16.500> requires<00:05:17.030> so<00:05:18.030> just<00:05:18.210> a<00:05:18.300> matter<00:05:18.510> now

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
the recipe requires so just a matter now

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.310 
the recipe requires so just a matter now
of<00:05:18.750> letting<00:05:19.260> it<00:05:19.669> do<00:05:20.669> its<00:05:20.850> work<00:05:21.240> over<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:21.990> 60

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
of letting it do its work over the 60

of letting it do its work over the 60
minute<00:05:22.560> time<00:05:22.740> frame<00:05:22.800> that<00:05:23.370> we'll<00:05:23.729> be<00:05:23.820> having

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
minute time frame that we'll be having

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.070 
minute time frame that we'll be having
this<00:05:24.150> boil<00:05:24.390> take<00:05:24.630> place<00:05:26.780> again<00:05:27.780> this<00:05:27.930> is<00:05:28.050> a

this boil take place again this is a

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.700 
this boil take place again this is a
full<00:05:28.470> five<00:05:29.370> point<00:05:29.820> five<00:05:30.060> gallons<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:31.470> yield

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
full five point five gallons to yield

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.529 
full five point five gallons to yield
five<00:05:32.070> gallons<00:05:32.550> after<00:05:32.910> we're<00:05:33.060> all<00:05:33.120> done<00:05:35.539> okay

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
five gallons after we're all done okay

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.330 
five gallons after we're all done okay
here<00:05:37.020> we<00:05:37.140> are<00:05:37.169> the<00:05:37.410> final<00:05:37.710> process<00:05:37.890> I'm

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
here we are the final process I'm

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.240 
here we are the final process I'm
cooling<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:39.330> beer<00:05:39.539> down<00:05:39.780> a<00:05:40.080> little<00:05:41.070> whirlpool

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
going on in the kettle you see that up

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.080 
going on in the kettle you see that up

kettle while I'm doing that I'm

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.180 
kettle while I'm doing that I'm
monitoring<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.550> temperature<00:06:01.830> and<00:06:02.830> once<00:06:03.100> I

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
monitoring the temperature and once I

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.610 
monitoring the temperature and once I
see<00:06:03.340> it<00:06:03.430> down<00:06:03.580> around<00:06:03.970> 70<00:06:04.540> degrees<00:06:04.570> maybe<00:06:05.530> a

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
see it down around 70 degrees maybe a

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.060 
see it down around 70 degrees maybe a
little<00:06:05.740> lower<00:06:06.030> I'll<00:06:07.030> go<00:06:07.240> ahead<00:06:07.389> and<00:06:07.900> pull<00:06:08.800> the

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
little lower I'll go ahead and pull the

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.159 
little lower I'll go ahead and pull the
conical<00:06:09.639> fermenters<00:06:09.820> over<00:06:10.330> and<00:06:10.900> start

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
conical fermenters over and start

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.490 
conical fermenters over and start
transferring<00:06:11.470> into<00:06:12.040> it<00:06:12.990> I've<00:06:13.990> taken<00:06:14.230> all<00:06:14.470> my

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
transferring into it I've taken all my

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.890 
transferring into it I've taken all my
samples<00:06:14.850> so<00:06:15.850> I<00:06:15.910> can<00:06:16.090> measure<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.419> gravities

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
samples so I can measure the gravities

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.820 
samples so I can measure the gravities
and<00:06:17.139> we'll<00:06:17.889> see<00:06:18.040> what<00:06:18.130> we<00:06:18.220> get<00:06:19.139> well<00:06:20.139> Rudy's

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
and we'll see what we get well Rudy's

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.450 
and we'll see what we get well Rudy's
over<00:06:21.750> have<00:06:22.750> everything<00:06:23.169> cleaned<00:06:23.440> up<00:06:23.680> and<00:06:23.919> I

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
over have everything cleaned up and I

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.550 
over have everything cleaned up and I
thought<00:06:24.610> I'd<00:06:24.760> just<00:06:24.820> wrap<00:06:25.150> up<00:06:25.180> with<00:06:25.930> the<00:06:26.380> key

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
thought I'd just wrap up with the key

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.290 
thought I'd just wrap up with the key
points<00:06:26.979> of<00:06:27.070> what<00:06:27.460> I<00:06:27.490> wanted<00:06:27.760> to<00:06:27.880> make<00:06:28.000> on<00:06:28.120> this

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
points of what I wanted to make on this

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.350 
points of what I wanted to make on this
video<00:06:28.660> it's<00:06:29.620> interesting<00:06:30.070> where<00:06:30.639> really<00:06:31.240> all

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
video it's interesting where really all

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.870 
video it's interesting where really all
the<00:06:31.690> topics<00:06:32.169> are<00:06:32.410> centered<00:06:33.070> around<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.580> water

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
the topics are centered around the water

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.420 
the topics are centered around the water
and<00:06:34.750> I<00:06:34.900> guess<00:06:35.080> my<00:06:35.260> point<00:06:35.290> around<00:06:36.070> this<00:06:36.250> would

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
and I guess my point around this would

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.460 
and I guess my point around this would
be<00:06:36.639> that<00:06:36.970> there's<00:06:37.479> a<00:06:37.600> lot<00:06:37.900> that<00:06:38.169> can<00:06:38.290> go<00:06:38.350> wrong

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
be that there's a lot that can go wrong

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.909 
be that there's a lot that can go wrong
when<00:06:39.100> you<00:06:39.250> prove<00:06:39.490> but<00:06:40.270> if<00:06:40.389> you<00:06:40.479> do<00:06:40.720> steps<00:06:41.470> to

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
when you prove but if you do steps to

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.850 
when you prove but if you do steps to
take<00:06:42.340> care<00:06:42.639> of<00:06:42.669> the<00:06:42.790> easy<00:06:43.060> things<00:06:43.650> you'll<00:06:44.650> be

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
take care of the easy things you'll be

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.460 
take care of the easy things you'll be
on<00:06:45.310> the<00:06:45.550> path<00:06:45.820> for<00:06:46.180> improving<00:06:46.660> your<00:06:46.990> brewing

carefully<00:06:58.060> Marge<00:06:58.510> don't<00:06:59.200> overdo<00:06:59.860> it<00:07:02.370> when<00:07:03.370> you

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:03.490 
carefully Marge don't overdo it when you

carefully Marge don't overdo it when you

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
boil it if at all possible boil the full

boil it if at all possible boil the full
5<00:07:06.669> gallons<00:07:07.300> if<00:07:07.960> you<00:07:08.080> have<00:07:08.200> a<00:07:08.289> bottle<00:07:08.680> kettle

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.010 
5 gallons if you have a bottle kettle

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.130 
5 gallons if you have a bottle kettle
yet<00:07:09.190> this<00:07:10.030> suggests<00:07:10.240> that<00:07:10.600> you<00:07:10.690> may<00:07:10.810> want<00:07:11.050> to

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.140 
yet this suggests that you may want to

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.760 
yet this suggests that you may want to
buy<00:07:11.229> one<00:07:11.440> large<00:07:11.740> enough<00:07:11.830> to<00:07:12.039> support<00:07:12.460> that<00:07:13.770> and

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
buy one large enough to support that and

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.870 
buy one large enough to support that and
if<00:07:15.190> you<00:07:15.280> do<00:07:15.430> need<00:07:15.669> to<00:07:15.729> boil<00:07:16.360> at<00:07:16.720> a<00:07:16.780> smaller<00:07:17.110> size

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 
if you do need to boil at a smaller size

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.640 
if you do need to boil at a smaller size
likely<00:07:18.880> because<00:07:19.210> your<00:07:19.389> your<00:07:19.780> kettle<00:07:20.440> is<00:07:20.500> too

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
likely because your your kettle is too

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.450 
likely because your your kettle is too
small<00:07:21.010> go<00:07:21.940> ahead<00:07:22.270> and<00:07:22.450> take<00:07:22.630> the<00:07:22.810> steps<00:07:23.080> to

small go ahead and take the steps to

small go ahead and take the steps to
pre-boil<00:07:24.460> the<00:07:24.940> water<00:07:25.240> that<00:07:25.690> you're<00:07:25.840> going

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
pre-boil the water that you're going

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.960 
pre-boil the water that you're going
to<00:07:26.180> add<00:07:26.360> to<00:07:27.320> help<00:07:27.500> justify<00:07:27.979> in<00:07:28.430> your<00:07:28.610> own<00:07:28.669> mind

to add to help justify in your own mind

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.570 
to add to help justify in your own mind
why<00:07:29.210> this<00:07:29.270> is<00:07:29.540> beneficial<00:07:30.010> go<00:07:31.010> ahead<00:07:31.280> and<00:07:31.430> take

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
why this is beneficial go ahead and take

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.610 
why this is beneficial go ahead and take
a<00:07:31.610> little<00:07:31.910> sample<00:07:32.120> water<00:07:32.600> directly<00:07:33.260> out<00:07:33.530> of

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
a little sample water directly out of

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.610 
a little sample water directly out of
your<00:07:33.740> tap<00:07:33.949> and<00:07:34.430> taste<00:07:34.669> it<00:07:34.960> versus<00:07:35.960> water<00:07:36.290> that

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:36.620 
your tap and taste it versus water that

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.439 
your tap and taste it versus water that
you've<00:07:36.740> already<00:07:36.919> pre<00:07:37.310> boiled<00:07:37.850> is<00:07:37.970> see<00:07:38.360> what

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:38.449 
you've already pre boiled is see what

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:40.810 
you've already pre boiled is see what
that<00:07:38.660> tastes<00:07:38.960> like<00:07:38.990> and<00:07:39.410> I<00:07:40.100> think<00:07:40.160> you'll<00:07:40.580> see

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:40.820 
that tastes like and I think you'll see

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.110 
that tastes like and I think you'll see
why<00:07:41.780> it's<00:07:42.199> important<00:07:42.800> to<00:07:43.190> go<00:07:43.340> ahead<00:07:43.669> and<00:07:43.940> do

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 
why it's important to go ahead and do

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.350 
why it's important to go ahead and do
this<00:07:44.300> pre<00:07:44.570> boiling<00:07:45.050> of<00:07:45.260> the<00:07:45.470> water<00:07:45.710> addition

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 
this pre boiling of the water addition

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.969 
this pre boiling of the water addition
so<00:07:47.360> that's<00:07:47.570> it<00:07:47.750> for<00:07:47.870> this<00:07:47.990> one<00:07:48.199> I'll<00:07:48.530> talk

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:48.979 
so that's it for this one I'll talk

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.710 
so that's it for this one I'll talk
about<00:07:49.040> some<00:07:49.460> other<00:07:49.610> things<00:07:49.699> as<00:07:50.240> time<00:07:50.479> goes<00:07:50.690> by

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 
about some other things as time goes by

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.650 
about some other things as time goes by
but<00:07:51.680> again<00:07:51.949> I<00:07:51.979> just<00:07:52.100> want<00:07:52.250> to<00:07:52.460> do<00:07:52.660> highlight

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:53.660 
but again I just want to do highlight

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.480 
but again I just want to do highlight
some<00:07:53.960> of<00:07:53.990> the<00:07:54.199> little<00:07:54.440> things<00:07:54.740> you<00:07:54.889> can<00:07:55.040> do<00:07:55.220> in

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:55.490 
some of the little things you can do in

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.150 
some of the little things you can do in
the<00:07:55.880> basic<00:07:56.240> process<00:07:56.780> to<00:07:57.560> improve<00:07:57.979> your

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.160 
the basic process to improve your

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.789 
the basic process to improve your
brewing<00:07:58.520> experience
