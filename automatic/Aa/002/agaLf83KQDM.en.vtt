 hello everybody, my name is fernando boss 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.860
 drummer of santa catarina and vineyard 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.689
 answering requests to show the sound of my 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.279
 new battery pack 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.820
 after going through various brands 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:27.289
 gringas as piu both the first and even 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.840
 dw made the third rmv drum kit 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.780
 of the model with seven 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.970
 the battery I currently use 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.680
 I recently became a drummer 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.120
 supported by the brand 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.430
 to hear the sound of the battery is to live with 7 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.010
 incomparable above all for wood 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.710
 used to beat live we stopped 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.449
 can offer the best of the medium and the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.250
 the beach is the two 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.890
 main ways used in the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.720
 construction and batteries 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.089
 in my design is more similar to 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.930
 ticket because it offers a very 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.510
 controlled with less resonance although 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.450
 rather highlight the high frequencies 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.700
 What is fantastic for me? 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.810
 the following chart shows how much each 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.460
 the penalty stands out in relation to the other 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.390
 used in the construction of 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.450
 batteries 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.320
 the main ones are mainly then 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.170
 hardness and density that are the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.600
 main issues that influence the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.600
 sound of drums 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:46.240
 the battery skins are the original rmv 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.380
 clear on the tones and performer of the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.940
 deaf 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.940
 we went there to hear her sound
