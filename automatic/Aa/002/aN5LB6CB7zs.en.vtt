around<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.860> and<00:02:07.010> think<00:02:07.190> about<00:02:07.430> how<00:02:07.640> we<00:02:07.700> can

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
around it and think about how we can

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.449 
around it and think about how we can
help<00:02:08.149> use<00:02:08.750> this<00:02:09.050> learning<00:02:09.590> as<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> way<00:02:10.069> to<00:02:10.129> grow

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
help use this learning as a way to grow

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.949 
help use this learning as a way to grow
and<00:02:10.640> expand<00:02:10.970> our<00:02:11.090> business<00:02:11.209> which<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:11.690> what<00:02:11.810> we

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
and expand our business which is what we

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.000 
and expand our business which is what we
did

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
did

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.170 
did
one<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.159> things<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.430> invested<00:02:15.879> in<00:02:15.939> was

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
one of the things we invested in was

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.390 
one of the things we invested in was
inventing<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:16.989> developing<00:02:17.379> a<00:02:17.439> machine<00:02:17.560> that

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
inventing and developing a machine that

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.059 
inventing and developing a machine that
could<00:02:18.579> fold<00:02:18.939> and<00:02:19.480> put<00:02:19.689> our<00:02:19.780> boxes<00:02:20.170> together<00:02:20.349> so

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
could fold and put our boxes together so

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.349 
could fold and put our boxes together so
that<00:02:21.219> we<00:02:21.310> could<00:02:21.459> reduce<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:22.090> amount<00:02:22.299> of

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.359 
that we could reduce the amount of

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.640 
that we could reduce the amount of
cardboard<00:02:22.870> that<00:02:22.930> we<00:02:23.109> were<00:02:23.200> using<00:02:23.379> in<00:02:23.590> our

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
cardboard that we were using in our

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.559 
cardboard that we were using in our
boxes<00:02:24.069> that<00:02:24.250> saved<00:02:24.489> us<00:02:24.609> a<00:02:24.730> lot<00:02:24.879> of<00:02:24.909> money<00:02:25.090> but

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
boxes that saved us a lot of money but

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.190 
boxes that saved us a lot of money but
it<00:02:25.689> also<00:02:25.750> saved<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.500> environment<00:02:28.049> we<00:02:29.049> also

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
it also saved the environment we also

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.899 
it also saved the environment we also
use<00:02:29.469> technology<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:30.159> help<00:02:30.189> make<00:02:30.489> our<00:02:30.579> business

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:30.909 
use technology to help make our business

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.399 
use technology to help make our business
efficient<00:02:31.329> so<00:02:31.540> one<00:02:31.810> of<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.959> things<00:02:32.109> that<00:02:32.319> we

00:02:32.399 --> 00:02:32.409 
efficient so one of the things that we

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.849 
efficient so one of the things that we
do<00:02:32.590> is<00:02:32.709> we<00:02:32.799> use<00:02:32.920> Google<00:02:33.370> Maps<00:02:33.579> for<00:02:33.819> all<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.359> our

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
do is we use Google Maps for all of our

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.339 
do is we use Google Maps for all of our
truck<00:02:35.859> routing<00:02:36.189> so<00:02:36.579> we<00:02:37.150> plot<00:02:37.629> that<00:02:37.810> on<00:02:37.870> Google

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
truck routing so we plot that on Google

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.229 
truck routing so we plot that on Google
Maps<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.739> Google<00:02:38.890> Earth<00:02:39.189> actually<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.000> we

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
Maps and Google Earth actually and we

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.910 
Maps and Google Earth actually and we
can<00:02:40.389> actually<00:02:40.540> see<00:02:40.989> where<00:02:41.260> buildings<00:02:41.709> are

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
can actually see where buildings are

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.890 
can actually see where buildings are
specifically<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.849> then<00:02:43.299> be<00:02:43.450> able<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.659> plot

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
specifically and then be able to plot

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.750 
specifically and then be able to plot
most<00:02:44.170> efficient<00:02:44.620> routes<00:02:44.859> using<00:02:45.280> some<00:02:45.489> of<00:02:45.609> that

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
most efficient routes using some of that

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.879 
most efficient routes using some of that
technology<00:02:46.209> as<00:02:46.629> well<00:02:49.049> 2009<00:02:50.049> was<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.290> tough<00:02:50.560> year

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
technology as well 2009 was a tough year

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.300 
technology as well 2009 was a tough year
I<00:02:51.359> think<00:02:52.359> we<00:02:52.629> do<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.900> very<00:02:53.019> good<00:02:53.650> job<00:02:53.889> at<00:02:54.250> being

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
I think we do a very good job at being

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.970 
I think we do a very good job at being
honest<00:02:55.000> with<00:02:55.150> ourselves<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.980> responding

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
honest with ourselves and responding

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.129 
honest with ourselves and responding
quickly<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:58.389> environment<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.019> we

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
quickly to the environment that we

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.099 
quickly to the environment that we
happen<00:02:59.439> to<00:02:59.470> be<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.680> I<00:03:00.120> definitely<00:03:01.120> sort<00:03:02.019> of

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
happen to be in I definitely sort of

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.619 
happen to be in I definitely sort of
take<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.290> mash<00:03:02.739> unit<00:03:03.159> kind<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:03.790> approach<00:03:04.599> to

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
take that mash unit kind of approach to

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.089 
take that mash unit kind of approach to
the<00:03:04.900> way<00:03:05.079> we<00:03:05.230> run<00:03:05.379> our<00:03:05.500> business<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:06.010> that

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
the way we run our business and that

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.619 
the way we run our business and that
were<00:03:06.220> mobile<00:03:06.639> and<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:06.849> we're<00:03:07.060> able<00:03:07.510> to

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
were mobile and that we're able to

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.390 
were mobile and that we're able to
respond<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.290> change<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.889> what<00:03:09.040> we<00:03:09.159> need<00:03:09.280> to

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
respond and change to what we need to

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.899 
respond and change to what we need to
I<00:03:12.319> think<00:03:13.319> 2010<00:03:13.980> will<00:03:14.159> be<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.310> good<00:03:14.459> year<00:03:14.610> for<00:03:14.670> us

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
I think 2010 will be a good year for us

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.690 
I think 2010 will be a good year for us
we're<00:03:15.720> investing<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.409> new<00:03:16.769> employees<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.310> help

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
we're investing in new employees to help

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.890 
we're investing in new employees to help
us<00:03:17.849> grow<00:03:18.090> we're<00:03:19.049> investing<00:03:19.530> in<00:03:19.709> new<00:03:20.189> locations

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
us grow we're investing in new locations

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.119 
us grow we're investing in new locations
so<00:03:21.900> we're<00:03:22.110> continuing<00:03:22.590> forward<00:03:22.860> with<00:03:22.980> our

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
so we're continuing forward with our

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:29.660 
so we're continuing forward with our
