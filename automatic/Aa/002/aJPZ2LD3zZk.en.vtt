00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.840
 stage

 There is nothing more tender and beautiful than a 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.270
 Panda Bear both for its beauty and for 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.670
 his fascinating personality these bears 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.030
 they are the most popular ambassadors of 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.030
 China 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.500
 the only thing more irresistible than a panda 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.010
 adult is definitely a green 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.010
 standard 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.340
 for his clumsy and tender movements a 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.590
 baby panda would look like a kitten with a 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.080
 disguise of the supposed or maybe a 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.750
 Stuffed toy that came to life are 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.420
 the rarest bears in the world and their 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.850
 reproduction is very difficult but despite 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.820
 of their beauty the pandas are in 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.229
 danger of extinction today there are 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.149
 only 2500 pandas released so 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.369
 that every time a panda baby is born in 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.190
 captivity is a great reason to 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.679
 celebrate wang wang center in china 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.140
 has the largest population of pandas 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.600
 in captivity throughout the world and in their 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.179
 facilities have been born more than 100 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.130
 bands but his desire is also power 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.220
 free the pandas in their habitat 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.220
 natural 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.100
 the main reasons for the extinction 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.710
 of the pandas are the deforestation of 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.320
 bamboo forests and hunting for 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.050
 fun or to get your skin and do 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.570
 coats that are sold in thousands of 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.370
 dollars although it is prohibited by 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.650
 laws of china hunt and kill or you 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.570
 expand there is a demanding market 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.570
 black for his flesh and his skin 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.080
 another problem is that the pandas like 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.600
 that humans only reproduce one 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.340
 once a year, slowing down its rate of 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.750
 birth 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.700
