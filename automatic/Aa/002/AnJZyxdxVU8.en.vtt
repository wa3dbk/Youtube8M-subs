00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.879
 hello how about friends and me from the channel 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.110
 I bring you a new video on this occasion 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:18.060
 I'm going to show you how to configure our 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.380
 computer your laptop your 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.930
 laptop or notebook I do not know how I'll call it 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.490
 jce to capture your 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.349
 gameplays but on computer it's worth no 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.960
 we are talking about console right now 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.960
 neither capturing nor anything 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.040
 you can record anything you are 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.620
 seeing in your pc a lot of computer 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.720
 portable or not I've said it before and 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.239
 you can record it easily with 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.059
 any good program there are several 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.920
 there is one that is called very well known flaps 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.340
 with which almost everyone who goes up 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.920
 computer gameplays 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.320
 they use it but I on this occasion 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.180
 I will teach the act of catching pray 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.940
 Cher is a suite that has a lot of 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.729
 interior programs and each one is for 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.440
 do one thing is worth it and also has the 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.500
 option to capture the screen 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.910
 well here we have the program once 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.890
 open we go to screen capture vale 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.390
 and that's the little eyelash we have to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.860
 use but first we have to prepare 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.800
 the computer to record the sound of 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.960
 computer 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.020
 for this we are going to start in windows 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.420
 seven we go to control panel 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.179
 and we have to look for devices 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.800
 hardware and sound here in sound 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.570
 device administrator 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.380
 and in this window while we are opened 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.350
 four tabs playback recording and 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.320
 I do not know what else it's worth we do not go to the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.770
 record tab 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.020
 and we have to have selected this 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.070
 option I have here the microphone and the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.350
 sound card 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.070
 when I want to record with the microphone 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.659
 I activate the microphone and when I have to 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.720
 I want the audio of the 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.320
 computer because I have to have active 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.140
 this option is like a little box with 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.360
 a card drawn to a card 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.750
 sound ok we opened the program I had 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.750
 captcha 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.230
 well I forget to say that it has us 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.560
 to leave a thing the name has to 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.650
 be stereo mix or something similar 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.750
 Depends on the brand of sound card 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.370
 have very good we go to the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.530
 eyelash of screen capture here we have 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.440
 several options we have to tell the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.340
 program that window we want us to 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.250
 record or we draw a small part 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.260
 or we give a window and select the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.150
 larger window main 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.299
 ok here we have to have mark the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.939
 stereo mix option I've already told you 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.340
 depends on the brand you will leave a thing u 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.610
 another here this is the format in which 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.829
 record wmv can not be changed and here 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.950
 we have to choose the folder in which 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.610
 is going to record it 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.200
 what we are seeing on the computer myself 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.200
 I have here in videos on the hard drive of 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.819
 and this we are going to accept, I'm going to 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.580
 cancel because I already have it configured 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.099
 here we have several options so that in 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.650
 the your process video see the 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.260
 cursor as you are seeing that in mine 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.140
 it looks and here if we want the program 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.880
 serious after giving it to record then 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.910
 five seconds later to give us 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:48.030
 time close all the windows and not 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.030
 do not leave things that we do not have to be 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.850
 good we give you to start here we 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.150
 the video that we are recording will appear 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.290
 the duration and a minute counter and 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.460
 seconds all this is what I have 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.030
 set to record right now 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.030
 I'm recording 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.810
 this video so you can see it good 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.730
 I will give an example I will open the 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.610
 emulator of mame 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.100
 let's put an arcade game of these 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.690
 old to do the test of 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.470
 recording 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.470
 let's find 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.030
 let's look at the we're going to put the 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.140
 pop table 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.140
 I like it a lot 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:40.580
 and I'm going to give it to record and then I'm going to 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:42.830
 teach the result achieved here what 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.409
 we also have what I am 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.459
 recording 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.459
 for now 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.770
 we are the currency and we are going to play a 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.770
 screen so that you see it 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.340
 we can 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:08.689
 and we get 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.350
 your money 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.420
 well we have this screen 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.030
 check 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.800
 and nothing I'm going to pause and now I'm going to 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.630
 show where the video is recorded and 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.630
 how it looks when playing 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.530
 ok we have to go to the folder 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.840
 where we told him we were going to 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.840
 Save the recorded video 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:45.620
 we stop the recording 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:47.540
 and here we have the result 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.699
 two videos one I just recorded 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.930
 of the gameplay and another one that I'm 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.930
 recording the tutorial 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.220
 ok we go to videos and we have to 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:05.720
 look for this is the last one I've recorded 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.720
 we have two 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.770
 the format that I have told you I am going to give you 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.500
 to play so you can see how 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.110
 it would be the result then you can already 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.980
 avoid with any the 2 video 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.980
 and it is already 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:38.359
 this is what I have done previously 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.770
 and it's there we have your video edits it and 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.290
 you play the music that you want 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.740
 you put your intro the title of the channel 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:55.070
 or whatever I want, I hope that 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:57.680
