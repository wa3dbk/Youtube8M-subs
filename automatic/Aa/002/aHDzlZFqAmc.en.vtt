just like what happened in um out of his

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.860 
just like what happened in um out of his
mind<00:02:21.440> Megatron<00:02:22.440> took<00:02:22.709> over<00:02:22.920> Bobby's<00:02:23.370> mind

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
mind Megatron took over Bobby's mind

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.229 
mind Megatron took over Bobby's mind
bobby<00:02:24.870> was<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.500> Megatron<00:02:26.489> was<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:26.849> Bobby's

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
bobby was in Megatron was in Bobby's

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.660 
bobby was in Megatron was in Bobby's
body<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.709> wasn't<00:02:29.099> boma<00:02:29.280> you'll<00:02:29.519> be

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
body but it wasn't boma you'll be

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.370 
body but it wasn't boma you'll be
talking<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.090> if<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.420> would<00:02:30.569> talk<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.750> him<00:02:31.019> when

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
talking to if you would talk to him when

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.199 
talking to if you would talk to him when
I<00:02:31.440> looked<00:02:31.739> at<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:31.920> Megatron<00:02:32.640> looks<00:02:32.819> different

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
I looked at it Megatron looks different

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.449 
I looked at it Megatron looks different
so<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.420> think<00:02:33.660> many<00:02:34.049> trans<00:02:34.410> body<00:02:34.709> is<00:02:37.459> updated

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
so I think many trans body is updated

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.289 
so I think many trans body is updated
and<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.540> has<00:02:39.920> unicron's<00:02:40.920> features<00:02:41.549> from

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
and it has unicron's features from

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.160 
and it has unicron's features from
unicron's<00:02:42.930> body<00:02:43.290> like<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:45.150> physical<00:02:45.660> body<00:02:45.690> of

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
unicron's body like the physical body of

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.559 
unicron's body like the physical body of
Unicron<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.340> physical<00:02:47.760> body<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.090> Megatron

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
Unicron and a physical body of Megatron

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.750 
Unicron and a physical body of Megatron
merge<00:02:49.260> together<00:02:49.579> so<00:02:50.579> now<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.420> looks<00:02:51.630> like

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
merge together so now it looks like

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.099 
merge together so now it looks like
unitron<00:02:54.170> or<00:02:55.170> something<00:02:55.530> like<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.980> like

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
unitron or something like that so like

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:04.420 
unitron or something like that so like
your<00:02:58.109> Tron<00:02:58.560> is<00:02:59.630> like<00:03:01.910> bigger<00:03:02.910> than<00:03:03.319> Megatron

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
your Tron is like bigger than Megatron

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.979 
your Tron is like bigger than Megatron
because<00:03:05.430> unicron's<00:03:06.000> peace<00:03:06.480> has<00:03:06.630> been<00:03:06.660> added

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
because unicron's peace has been added

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.559 
because unicron's peace has been added
onto<00:03:07.230> him<00:03:07.500> kind<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.190> like<00:03:08.370> Optimus<00:03:08.880> Prime<00:03:09.209> in

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
onto him kind of like Optimus Prime in

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.720 
onto him kind of like Optimus Prime in
revenge<00:03:09.870> of<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.019> Fallen<00:03:10.380> when<00:03:10.980> he<00:03:11.340> was<00:03:11.489> weak

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
