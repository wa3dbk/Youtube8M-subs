00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.920
 hi this is a game hunt you do 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.490
 part of a discovery is very 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.940
 frightening 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.849
 that's when I went 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.929
 that's my shopping I wanted to buy some 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.730
 kinder bueno that's it and the question what 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.800
 really troubled me sending in this 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:27.210
 package so firstly there are three 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.849
 packets three packets of both 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.610
 three packets of 2 so three times of his 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.040
 figure 1 6 so as by chance yesterday 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.280
 this one is there as by chance it's 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.079
 not a coincidence for me it's they 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.289
 had to do it on purpose then here 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:52.550
 you see the two synths 6 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:56.219
 the more time 3 here twice 3 it's 6 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:00.329
 we already have several 6 May we have 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.030
 several 6 1 so that about 4 5 6 not 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.229
 already we really was very scared and ah 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.010
 yes here is in the bar code there is as well 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.210
 if so voice binds it to my finger and 1.6 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.640
 that was really very disturbing 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.549
 all this I ask again if he makes it on purpose 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.650
 or so here is short we will not 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.920
 deciphering tourist from the package 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.409
 because there really a bunch if you 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.009
 buy a package of 2,3 kinder bueno 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.530
 you will see because a lot 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:36.360
 so here I am going to open it I have heavy 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.420
 for you i open the package one kinder 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.040
 bueno 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.630
 you will see he really discovers 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.990
 scary that I did what I 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.040
 made 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:58.210
 so then there are four small ones 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:02:03.100
 it's 4 waiting space 4 here I have 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:06.550
 missed them +48 even more 4 on the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.459
 two more even more 4 that makes you 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:15.930
 mother you can count here are twelve of 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:20.410
 sixteen is still +18 so its 18 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.920
 he has as multiples 6 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.900
 so it's equal to three times 6 good enough 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.070
 that I'm reviewing but now it's done 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.209
 three times already so it's been a sort 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.209
 plus 6 now we're going to open it 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.090
 we will open it the kinder bueno to see 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.180
 what is inside 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:44.050
 I do not like to open it they had to do 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.220
 expressly to make us tired so here 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.220
 already hilarious it is a little fade 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.989
 however, it is not not 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.790
