00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.799
 because women are colder than 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.470
 men is a question that 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.599
 we constantly do not do it myself 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.460
 long life with my partner because I've 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.040
 been constantly leaving you 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.920
 jackets in winter because despite 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.160
 bring your own coat needed a 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.740
 layer one more layer to be able to be well 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.360
 and not catch a cold and I do not 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.490
 But many times I've gone with a 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.920
 simple t-shirt in the middle of winter and no 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.810
 I've taken absolutely nothing 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.900
 we men resist much better in 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.480
 cold because apart from body fat that 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.690
 have women we have a system 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.180
 muscle much more developed not 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.610
 forget that the muscular system generates 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.190
 a lot of heat when 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.710
 we are using the muscles themselves 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.690
 muscles at the time of when the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.480
 blood is generated a lot of 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.610
 heat that together with the fat protects the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.730
 man much more than women 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.040
 to tell the truth against more grips against 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.100
 more muscle have one more man 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.200
 immunity will have the cold so that 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.530
 if a person is a bodybuilder 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.079
 It has a lot of muscle 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.899
 it will not be practically cold in any 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.149
 environment even if it's always below zero 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.509
 when it moves clear it is always and 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.060
 When you use your muscles, women already 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.829
 in themselves they are much more frivolous 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.289
 let's say that the blood that the 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.289
 women is mainly distributed to 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.750
 warm the most important organs by 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.020
 that women's feet almost always 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.240
 they are cold in bed like the 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.909
 hands men on the contrary 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.670
 we can maintain the body heat of 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.470
 hands more easily the heat 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.149
 body of the feet and hands 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.209
 you can usually say it in a way 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.000
 general of the whole body and of 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.979
 tips men we are better 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.239
 prepared to fight against the cold 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.239
 that women
