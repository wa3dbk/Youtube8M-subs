00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.610
 hello I am vacondio daniele director of the gulliverlandia park of 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.020
 lignano sabbiadoro 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.449
 2005 is the sixth edition 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:11.819
 of the opening of our park 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:18.119
 where we initially developed an aquarium that is the only one with the tunnel 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.529
 submerged in Italy 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.369
 then we continued the canyon river with other attractions 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.720
 or the novelty 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.820
 this year ok the medieval tournament a passion that we have created 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.240
 inspired by the signature the first knight with richard gere 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.580
 puppy of love built a medieval carousel where the boys pass 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.870
 inside swords 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.950
 the slips 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.390
 and many other things to have fun 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.820
 a new attraction also that of the Viking wheel a carousel 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.220
 that 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.140
 one with a centrifugal force projected you children outward 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.320
 this year we have the dinosaur exhibition where we have 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.910
 and the built 15 linosa oretta natural size 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.740
 for the restoration speech we have scenographer clod our tavern as 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.409
 dragon pan name 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.990
 inspired by the Octoberfest 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.450
 we have also installed a free-fall tower and we have themed it 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:24.659
 inserting 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.870
 within a structure 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.960
 it's made like a jail 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.210
 another very interesting thing about the park is a series of shows that 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.560
 are two different shows at the circus 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.250
 of the show or sea lions 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.520
 a show that was always presented from ever good morning to channel 5 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.040
 with the same instructor 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.800
 and the animals themselves 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.200
 my name is paolona musona n8 can the interior of the univerlandia park me and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.469
 of the scenography 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.950
 we started this path in 1998 and we didn't have any 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.990
 experience in this regard for the realization of the scenery anyway 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.820
 however we are quoted recently narcissus 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.620
 we are here right at the entrance I know of the reason assured valley and from here it is 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.669
 can however note from a certain type of definition that 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:18.659
 added up today 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.249
 however, we boast of having been able to reach them in a fairly short time 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:28.510
 considering the new that there was not a puncture in merit however there were some 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.939
 experiences made before this of this beginning the materials used re 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:38.779
 even here after several attempts we have solved the problem in a very way 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.269
 simple that is to say we make metallic structures 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.449
 and then we put a structural cement so called and that then 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.079
 is worked 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.259
 cement cost based on work times this allows us to work 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.790
 because we have problem that all the accomplishments we make the winter and 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.769
 outdoors 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.529
 and for cluj this is a material that still performs well despite the 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:01.349
 the temperature change 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.569
 in this way all our pieces are unique pieces indeed on the spot and from 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.280
 can no longer mo
