about how the noctilucent clouds were

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
behaving strangely beyond what we even

behaving strangely beyond what we even
know<00:03:36.430> about<00:03:36.730> them<00:03:37.150> since<00:03:37.540> they<00:03:37.720> are<00:03:37.810> our<00:03:37.930> brand

new<00:03:38.350> phenomena<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.820> I<00:03:40.030> definitely<00:03:40.330> think<00:03:40.600> we

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
new phenomena so I definitely think we

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.140 
new phenomena so I definitely think we
should<00:03:40.750> be<00:03:40.930> keeping<00:03:41.170> our<00:03:41.410> eye<00:03:41.530> on<00:03:41.950> the
