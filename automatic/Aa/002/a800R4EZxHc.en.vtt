00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:18.598
 In order to move this lot, a certain amount of energy is needed to move here. 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.374
 And it should be equal on both sides to move the solder. 

00:00:24.058 --> 00:00:29.050
 At school, I liked good physics, it was one of my favorite subjects. 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.113
 I like the subject very well, that was what I was best at. 

00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:43.344
 So in the future I would like to work in the field of mechanics on cars. 

00:00:45.314 --> 00:00:46.769
 Let me try this one. 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.289
 Eh, the robot occasionally gets it too! 

00:01:12.484 --> 00:01:17.075
 I always want to see him, but I can't now. 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:22.359
 I went earlier but it didn't go then. 

00:01:23.866 --> 00:01:29.539
 I always feel a desire to see him, so I use Skype and call home with it. 

00:01:39.731 --> 00:01:47.207
 I don't know how to describe it, but it's totally different from everything else. 

00:01:48.318 --> 00:01:54.301
 Just the tone of it is enough to know that this is a strange language! 

00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:05.081
 - Good to see you. - Good to see you too. 

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:08.529
 - Is it good in Trondheim? - Yeah. 

00:02:08.947 --> 00:02:11.016
 And you do well, I can see. 

00:02:11.572 --> 00:02:16.985
 Now it will be colder you know. And snow. So then you will learn to ski. 

00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:26.935
 Everyone scares me about the weather, that it's going to be very difficult. 

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:31.743
 They say it's going to snow and that it gets minus twenty degrees. 

00:02:31.743 --> 00:02:36.942
 But I'm just looking forward to it, I'm looking forward to the winter. 

00:02:36.942 --> 00:02:41.738
 I've played in snow earlier, but not in minus twenty.
