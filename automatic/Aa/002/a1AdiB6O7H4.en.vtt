00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.290 

ironically<00:00:50.620> it's<00:00:50.950> not<00:00:51.310> really<00:00:51.640> magic<00:00:51.850> at<00:00:52.180> all

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
ironically it's not really magic at all

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.560 
ironically it's not really magic at all
but<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.230> modes<00:00:53.560> are<00:00:53.800> so<00:00:54.070> mysterious<00:00:54.730> so<00:00:55.000> many

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
but the modes are so mysterious so many

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.620 
but the modes are so mysterious so many
players<00:00:55.840> much<00:00:56.590> like<00:00:56.860> myself<00:00:57.130> get<00:00:58.090> confused

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
players much like myself get confused

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.960 
players much like myself get confused
man<00:00:58.960> what<00:00:59.470> are<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.620> modes<00:00:59.950> why<00:01:00.430> do<00:01:00.489> we<00:01:00.700> need<00:01:00.850> to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
man what are the modes why do we need to

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.210 
man what are the modes why do we need to
learn<00:01:01.120> them<00:01:01.360> how<00:01:01.809> do<00:01:01.870> we<00:01:02.110> apply<00:01:02.380> them<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.830> every

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
learn them how do we apply them to every

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.700 
learn them how do we apply them to every
day<00:01:03.400> playing<00:01:03.760> situations<00:01:04.540> I'm<00:01:05.140> gonna<00:01:05.379> answer

gonna show you a few simple steps that

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.370 
gonna show you a few simple steps that
once<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.100> internalize<00:01:12.550> you<00:01:13.479> can<00:01:13.690> master<00:01:14.229> the

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
once you internalize you can master the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.130 
once you internalize you can master the
modes<00:01:14.650> in<00:01:14.950> any<00:01:15.460> setting<00:01:16.030> we<00:01:16.600> start<00:01:16.960> this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
modes in any setting we start this

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.710 
modes in any setting we start this
series<00:01:17.530> with<00:01:17.710> some<00:01:17.860> basic<00:01:18.490> fundamentals<00:01:19.210> it's

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
series with some basic fundamentals it's

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.590 
series with some basic fundamentals it's
important<00:01:20.440> that<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:21.130> know<00:01:21.399> these<00:01:21.700> principles

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
important that you know these principles

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.190 
important that you know these principles
before<00:01:22.840> we<00:01:23.320> move<00:01:23.500> on<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:24.280> tackling<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.790> modes

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
before we move on to tackling the modes

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.050 
before we move on to tackling the modes
one<00:01:26.200> of<00:01:26.350> which<00:01:26.530> is<00:01:26.710> knowing<00:01:26.979> all<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.640> notes<00:01:27.850> on

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
one of which is knowing all the notes on

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.389 
one of which is knowing all the notes on
the<00:01:28.090> fretboard<00:01:28.360> it's<00:01:29.080> really<00:01:29.470> important<00:01:29.950> that

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
the fretboard it's really important that

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:33.240 
the fretboard it's really important that
we<00:01:30.580> can<00:01:30.759> identify<00:01:30.880> every<00:01:31.540> single<00:01:32.290> note<00:01:32.500> up<00:01:32.710> and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
we can identify every single note up and

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.389 
we can identify every single note up and
down<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.550> neck<00:01:33.580> on<00:01:33.940> all<00:01:34.360> six<00:01:34.750> strings<00:01:35.160> we<00:01:36.160> also

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
down the neck on all six strings we also

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.510 
down the neck on all six strings we also
cover<00:01:36.789> the<00:01:36.880> basics<00:01:37.390> of<00:01:37.539> major<00:01:37.899> scales<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:39.340> we

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
cover the basics of major scales and we

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.460 
cover the basics of major scales and we
do<00:01:39.700> major<00:01:40.060> scales<00:01:40.570> within<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.140> Caged

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
do major scales within the Caged

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.580 
do major scales within the Caged
position<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:43.119> we<00:01:43.300> can<00:01:43.509> learn<00:01:43.720> how<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:44.050> play<00:01:44.259> all

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
position so we can learn how to play all

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.010 
position so we can learn how to play all
of<00:01:44.619> the<00:01:44.950> major<00:01:45.160> scales<00:01:45.580> in<00:01:46.180> all<00:01:46.450> of<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.720> Caged

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
of the major scales in all of the Caged

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.490 
of the major scales in all of the Caged
positions<00:01:47.710> up<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.460> down<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.759> neck<00:01:49.350> once<00:01:50.350> we

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
positions up and down the neck once we

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.710 
positions up and down the neck once we
accomplish<00:01:51.009> those<00:01:51.250> two<00:01:51.490> things<00:01:51.729> we<00:01:52.330> move<00:01:52.539> on

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
accomplish those two things we move on

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.330 
accomplish those two things we move on
to<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:52.990> couple<00:01:53.200> cool<00:01:53.530> little<00:01:53.830> warm-up

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
to a couple cool little warm-up

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.140 
to a couple cool little warm-up
exercises<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.860> we<00:02:00.119> graduate<00:02:01.119> from

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
exercises and then we graduate from

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.960 
exercises and then we graduate from
there<00:02:01.600> going<00:02:02.350> into<00:02:02.680> the<00:02:02.799> modes<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.400> getting

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
there going into the modes and getting

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:24.040 
there going into the modes and getting
the<00:02:04.090> modal<00:02:04.509> patterns<00:02:05.049> under<00:02:05.619> our<00:02:05.650> fingers

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.720 

in<00:02:25.050> addition<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.590> learning<00:02:25.770> all<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.550> mode

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
in addition to learning all of the mode

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.600 
in addition to learning all of the mode
patterns<00:02:27.270> we<00:02:28.020> also<00:02:28.200> learn<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.890> bunch<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.370> cool

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
patterns we also learn a bunch of cool

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.960 
patterns we also learn a bunch of cool
little<00:02:29.940> musical<00:02:30.540> ideas<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.470> components<00:02:32.130> that

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
little musical ideas and components that

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.140 
little musical ideas and components that
we<00:02:33.240> can<00:02:33.450> implement<00:02:34.070> into<00:02:35.070> each<00:02:35.400> mode<00:02:35.850> in

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
we can implement into each mode in

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.020 
we can implement into each mode in
connecting<00:02:36.990> them<00:02:37.140> together<00:02:37.670> for<00:02:38.670> instance

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
connecting them together for instance

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:49.790 
connecting them together for instance
two<00:02:39.540> string<00:02:39.840> runs<00:02:47.870> in<00:02:48.870> different<00:02:49.380> intervals

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
two string runs in different intervals

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.700 
two string runs in different intervals
thirds<00:02:50.190> fourths<00:02:50.670> fifths<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.630> sixths<00:02:51.720> all<00:02:52.410> the

thirds fourths fifths and sixths all the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:03.920 
thirds fourths fifths and sixths all the
way<00:02:52.770> up<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.070> sevenths<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.610> octaves

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.559 

or<00:03:04.930> arpeggio

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.470 

when<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.319> take<00:03:12.620> all<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:12.980> these<00:03:13.310> different

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
little ideas and connect them you can

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.259 
little ideas and connect them you can
create<00:03:17.540> some<00:03:17.930> really<00:03:18.439> cool<00:03:18.680> musical<00:03:19.579> ideas<00:03:19.969> in

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
create some really cool musical ideas in

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:33.210 
create some really cool musical ideas in
your<00:03:20.629> soul

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.890 

but<00:03:34.220> let's<00:03:34.430> be<00:03:34.550> honest<00:03:34.940> all<00:03:35.360> of<00:03:35.750> that

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
but let's be honest all of that

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.860 
but let's be honest all of that
information<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.860> useless<00:03:37.640> unless<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:38.660> know

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
information is useless unless you know

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.890 
information is useless unless you know
how<00:03:39.050> to<00:03:39.080> apply<00:03:39.530> it<00:03:39.650> in<00:03:39.950> real<00:03:40.670> life<00:03:40.900> musical

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
how to apply it in real life musical

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.140 
how to apply it in real life musical
situations<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:42.800> that's<00:03:43.220> exactly<00:03:43.910> what<00:03:44.060> I'm

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
situations and that's exactly what I'm

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.270 
situations and that's exactly what I'm
going<00:03:44.300> to<00:03:44.330> teach<00:03:44.480> you<00:03:44.540> how<00:03:44.780> to<00:03:44.840> do<00:03:45.050> so<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.190> the
