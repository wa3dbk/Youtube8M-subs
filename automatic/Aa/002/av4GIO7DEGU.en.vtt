 I never made 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.900
 with this record is by the way the only thing that allowed me to get out of the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.900
 deep depression in which I love you 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:33.379

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.669
 after 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.689
 it's a fact I really felt like I'll never do it again 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.989
 of music that I was going to focus all my efforts on the cinema or the 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.829
 painting believe that I had reached a point where I did not know how 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.419
 being myself for this new record reminded me that I was really on 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.680
 this album that could not hear me rediscovering that's why the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.049
 are also hard 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.579
 at first listen to the album graffiti and a layer 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.650
 kind of self analysis musical 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.850
 risk to surprise the fans with his lot of low the turmoil and yet the 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.850
 singer has never been so moving 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.049
 ccas 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.849

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.489
 wall street 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.819

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.410
 of music that was the right time to regain power the listener is 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.409
 the witness of this machine transformation 

00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:02.579
 how each of the albums was the occasion of a transformation but 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.579
 this time you will hear 3 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.780

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.310
 finished to surprise us they are holding back from 2007 belfort for the rest 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.930

 thomas get out your best vampire costume because we're living the second 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.690
 part of our encounter with the superstar antichrist 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.220
 human tide about the nature of words so exclusively in the city of the 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.220
 music with the excited sand to go see a match
