hole<00:01:08.760> down<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.570> flattened<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.260> over

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
hole down here it flattened out over

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.270 
hole down here it flattened out over
time<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> same<00:01:12.150> spot<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.920> why<00:01:14.100> it's

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
time and in the same spot it's why it's

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:25.429 
time and in the same spot it's why it's
a<00:01:14.340> good<00:01:14.460> idea<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:18.229> release<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:23.689> rollers<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
a good idea to release the rollers so it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.760 
a good idea to release the rollers so it
doesn't<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.520> don't<00:01:26.759> hit<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> clicking<00:01:27.479> sound

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
doesn't you don't hit a clicking sound

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
doesn't you don't hit a clicking sound
so<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.840> we<00:01:30.840> won't<00:01:31.110> create<00:01:31.470> flat<00:01:31.979> spots<00:01:38.810> we

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so that we won't create flat spots we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.499 
so that we won't create flat spots we
typed<00:01:40.140> out<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.740> these<00:01:40.950> typed<00:01:41.880> out<00:01:42.030> my<00:01:42.270> name

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.080 
not sure what that's all about but they
had<00:03:57.890> taped<00:03:58.130> it<00:03:58.490> up<00:04:00.070> but<00:04:01.070> the<00:04:01.250> tape<00:04:01.520> doesn't<00:04:01.820> go

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
had taped it up but the tape doesn't go

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.050 
had taped it up but the tape doesn't go
on<00:04:02.300> the<00:04:02.420> sides<00:04:02.690> at<00:04:03.050> all<00:04:03.170> I<00:04:03.500> mean<00:04:04.490> at<00:04:04.640> first<00:04:04.670> I

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
on the sides at all I mean at first I

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.940 
on the sides at all I mean at first I
thought<00:04:05.210> well<00:04:05.270> maybe<00:04:05.630> they<00:04:05.780> take<00:04:06.080> it<00:04:06.380> to<00:04:06.590> keep

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
thought well maybe they take it to keep

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:15.400 
thought well maybe they take it to keep
it<00:04:07.100> closed<00:04:08.709> but<00:04:09.709> latch<00:04:10.550> works<00:04:10.940> fine<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:14.060> so<00:04:15.050> I

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
it closed but latch works fine and so I

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.500 
it closed but latch works fine and so I
think<00:04:15.680> that's<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.489> thank<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:17.239> for<00:04:17.330> watching
