00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
of the the mesh I think there's some

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.240 
of the the mesh I think there's some
arugula<00:02:15.490> for<00:02:16.270> some<00:02:16.480> greens<00:02:17.250> generally

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
birds get the mesh whatever happens to

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.200 
birds get the mesh whatever happens to
be<00:02:22.870> in<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.380> mesh<00:02:23.560> sometimes<00:02:24.010> I'll<00:02:24.160> use

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
be in the mesh sometimes I'll use

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.740 
be in the mesh sometimes I'll use
garbanzo<00:02:25.210> beans

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
are naturally higher in iron so I try

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.040 
are naturally higher in iron so I try
not<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.960> put<00:02:32.830> too<00:02:32.860> much<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.820> them<00:02:34.090> in<00:02:34.270> any<00:02:34.420> one

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
antifungal and antibacterial so I

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.090

figured<00:03:00.030> with<00:03:01.030> Huy<00:03:01.770> recently<00:03:02.770> being<00:03:02.950> out<00:03:03.070> of

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
figured with Huy recently being out of

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.560 
figured with Huy recently being out of
quarantine<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.820> was<00:03:03.970> probably<00:03:04.210> good<00:03:04.540> for

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
quarantine that was probably good for

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.980 
quarantine that was probably good for
everybody<00:03:04.870> but<00:03:05.200> also<00:03:05.610> I've<00:03:06.610> been<00:03:06.970> starting<00:03:07.720> to

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.710 
everybody but also I've been starting to
use<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.500> avian<00:03:09.010> trio<00:03:09.280> which<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:10.210> supplement

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
use the avian trio which is a supplement

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.530

of<00:03:10.990> bee<00:03:11.470> pollen<00:03:11.500> bee<00:03:12.160> propolis<00:03:12.400> and<00:03:12.850> royal

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
of bee pollen bee propolis and royal

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.930 
of bee pollen bee propolis and royal
jelly<00:03:13.570> that's<00:03:14.430> very<00:03:15.430> good<00:03:15.670> for<00:03:15.940> all<00:03:16.320> matter<00:03:17.320> of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
jelly that's very good for all matter of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.290 
jelly that's very good for all matter of
at<00:03:18.940> least<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.570> parrots<00:03:20.160> maybe<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.850> guess

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
at least the the parrots maybe I guess

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.240 
at least the the parrots maybe I guess
like<00:03:22.480> finches<00:03:22.810> and<00:03:22.840> Canaries<00:03:23.320> too<00:03:23.560> can<00:03:24.100> have

like finches and Canaries too can have

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.860 
like finches and Canaries too can have
it<00:03:24.460> but<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:25.180> helps<00:03:25.420> build<00:03:25.570> their<00:03:25.750> immune

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
it but it helps build their immune

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.460 
it but it helps build their immune
systems<00:03:26.500> up<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:26.860> I've<00:03:27.010> just<00:03:27.190> been<00:03:27.340> trying<00:03:27.610> to
