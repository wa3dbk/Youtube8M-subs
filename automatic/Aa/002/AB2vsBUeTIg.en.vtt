00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.000
 we show a powerful dodge challenger 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.730
 he received special care from the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.360
 preparer renice what left the car 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.360

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.489
 srt8 is a retelling of the dodge challenger 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.769
 rt the great classic of the 70's and 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.320
 which is still valuable today 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.399
 well-known classics such as 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.399
 ford mustang dressing room 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.190
 four decades after growing a 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.080
 icon of the automotive industry to dodge 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.299

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:14.679
 story the very peculiar model 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:17.560
 the srt8 was the wires as soon as you see that 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:20.319
 description is not the forte of this challenge 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.110
 The color is a mix of Russian and pink 

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:25.450
 draws far attention to detail 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.880
 in black as the two tracks in the field 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.220
 for example they contrast in a unique way 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.979
 with the traditional design in the model and 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:42.879
 srt signature can not miss this 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:45.369

 pace and appeals to banks in color 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.310
 white with details in the same color as the 

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:51.280
 bodywork 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.619
 however, simplicity remains 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.170
 panel display with somewhat 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.420
 conservative characteristics 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.929
 well known in the challenge since the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.929
 times of adolescence 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.440
 another surprise of this renewed 40's 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.500
 is the final touch that rennes is a 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.580
 North American trainer did on srt8 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.160

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.220
 increase the power to 650 horses strong 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.390
 now that bad face he has for 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.530
