00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.570
 today we are going to make noodles with tuna and 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:08.800
 egg and the ingredients that we're going to 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.900
 use are 250 grams of noodles 3 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.990
 eggs 2 small cans of tuna 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.230
 drained 570 grams of tomato sauce 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.089
 home-style half chopped onion 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.450
 parmesan cheese powder olive oil 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.280
 extra virgin and salt 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.560
 we boil water in a saucepan 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.700
 large and we throw a handful of salt and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.650
 a stream of virgin olive oil 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.630
 extra 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.160
 in another small pot we take it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.900
 water and salt 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.700
 when it starts to boil, we throw the 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.960
 noodles in the large saucepan and the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.630
 we cook the time indicated by the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.500
 manufacturer and in the other case we cook the 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.500
 eggs for 10 minutes 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.440
 once the pasta is al dente and the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.440
 We dump in a drainer 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.500
 while draining the noodles 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.150
 aside eggs fire them 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.980
 we remove the water and submerge it 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.980
 Quickly in cold water for a while 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.270
 once cold we give them a few taps 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.790
 so that it breaks the shell and we go 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.450
 removing carefully as you see it is removed 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.450
 easily 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.640
 when they are all peeled we cut them 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.640
 in medium pieces and we reserve 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.790
 Now in a casserole pan more or less 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.380
 big we squirt oil from 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.380
 olive and to call it chopped onion 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.100
 when poached, we incorporate the 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.090
 tomato fried home style 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.200
 the tuna 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.200
 and boiled egg 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.390
 we mix everything well while heating 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.390
 on medium heat for about 3 or 4 minutes 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.680
 we arrange the noodles on a plate and 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.680
 we toss the sauce over 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.410
 to top it off you can have a little 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.930
 of parmesan cheese powder as we have 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.690
 made us or also add a 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.240
 little oregano to give them more flavor and 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.000
 the recipe would be ready, we hope that 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.910
