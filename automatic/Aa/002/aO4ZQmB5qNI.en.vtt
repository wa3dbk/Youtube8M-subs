okay<00:00:02.129> so<00:00:02.190> I<00:00:02.370> did<00:00:02.550> a<00:00:02.580> little<00:00:02.669> bit<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:02.939> checking

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
okay so I did a little bit of checking

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.390 
okay so I did a little bit of checking
just<00:00:03.990> answering<00:00:04.740> my<00:00:04.859> question<00:00:05.250> from

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
just answering my question from

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.970 
just answering my question from
yesterday<00:00:05.940> which<00:00:06.180> was<00:00:06.710> whether<00:00:07.710> or<00:00:07.799> not<00:00:07.859> to

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
yesterday which was whether or not to

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.950 
yesterday which was whether or not to
pack<00:00:08.309> Rhys<00:00:08.610> into<00:00:08.970> these<00:00:09.120> bearings<00:00:09.510> or<00:00:09.690> not<00:00:09.809> or

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
pack Rhys into these bearings or not or

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.419 
pack Rhys into these bearings or not or
just<00:00:09.990> soak<00:00:10.500> them<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.710> oil<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:13.429> consensus

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
just soak them in oil and the consensus

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.560 
just soak them in oil and the consensus
of<00:00:14.580> opinions<00:00:15.650> was<00:00:16.789> even<00:00:17.789> though<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.090> oiled

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
of opinions was even though it's oiled

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.769 
of opinions was even though it's oiled
from<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> diff<00:00:20.210> pack<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.510> grease

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
from the diff pack it with grease

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.140 
from the diff pack it with grease
anyways<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.650> oil<00:00:22.980> will<00:00:23.220> wash<00:00:23.460> out<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.760> grease

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
anyways the oil will wash out the grease

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
anyways the oil will wash out the grease
its<00:00:25.080> regardless<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.630> it'll<00:00:27.630> provide<00:00:27.900> some

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
its regardless so it'll provide some

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.349 
its regardless so it'll provide some
good<00:00:28.320> lubrication<00:00:28.800> until<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.429> oil<00:00:29.460> gets<00:00:29.910> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
good lubrication until the oil gets to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.749 
good lubrication until the oil gets to
these<00:00:31.080> bearings<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.830> at<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.130> point<00:00:32.399> you

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
these bearings and at that point you

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.430 
these bearings and at that point you
know<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> oil<00:00:33.149> will<00:00:33.300> take<00:00:33.510> over<00:00:33.719> essentially

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
know the oil will take over essentially

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.700 
know the oil will take over essentially
I<00:00:34.649> will<00:00:35.309> change<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.149> dip<00:00:36.719> fluid<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.590> know

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
I will change the dip fluid you know

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.440 
I will change the dip fluid you know
probably<00:00:37.980> very<00:00:38.340> shortly<00:00:38.670> after<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:39.059> run<00:00:39.239> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
probably very shortly after I run this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.840 
probably very shortly after I run this
truck<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.739> any<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.129> their<00:00:41.309> remaining

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
truck in so any of their remaining

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.000 
truck in so any of their remaining
grease<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.110> system<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.890> to

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
grease that in the system is going to

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.410 
grease that in the system is going to
more<00:00:44.430> or<00:00:44.520> less<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.789> drained<00:00:45.090> out<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
more or less get drained out of the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.740 
more or less get drained out of the
bottle<00:00:45.829> okay<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.940> repack<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
bottle okay so I'm going to repack the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.310 
bottle okay so I'm going to repack the
bearings<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.860> put<00:00:50.399> them<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.989> think<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
bearings and put them on and I think the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.840 
bearings and put them on and I think the
next<00:00:52.530> shot<00:00:52.710> you'll<00:00:52.920> seal<00:00:53.160> everything<00:00:53.579> will<00:00:53.760> be

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
next shot you'll seal everything will be

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.260 
next shot you'll seal everything will be
all<00:00:53.969> ready<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.360> go<00:00:55.219> okay<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.550> thought<00:00:56.850> I'd<00:00:57.000> do

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
all ready to go okay so I thought I'd do

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.430 
all ready to go okay so I thought I'd do
a<00:00:57.300> quick<00:00:57.390> blurb<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.859> reinstalling<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.440> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a quick blurb on on reinstalling the the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.549 
a quick blurb on on reinstalling the the
hubs<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.730> axle<00:01:03.449> obviously<00:01:04.260> I've<00:01:04.350> got<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
hubs on the axle obviously I've got the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.590 
hubs on the axle obviously I've got the
seals<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> rear<00:01:05.309> wheel<00:01:05.519> bearing<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:06.060> are

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
seals and the rear wheel bearing in are

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.359 
seals and the rear wheel bearing in are
they<00:01:06.810> inner<00:01:07.080> bearing<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.740> as<00:01:07.950> well<00:01:08.130> I've<00:01:08.220> got

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they inner bearing in as well I've got

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.859 
they inner bearing in as well I've got
the<00:01:08.490> inner<00:01:08.640> bearing<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.119> as<00:01:09.299> well<00:01:09.540> as<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the inner bearing in as well as the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.590 
the inner bearing in as well as the
adjustment<00:01:10.470> nut<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:11.030> know<00:01:12.030> my<00:01:12.299> setup

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
adjustment nut I know my setup

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.820 
adjustment nut I know my setup
apparently<00:01:13.080> there's<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.290> couple<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.590> different

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
apparently there's a couple of different

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.800 
apparently there's a couple of different
setups<00:01:14.820> one<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.140> there's<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.439> key<00:01:16.740> way<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
setups one is that there's a key way to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.249 
setups one is that there's a key way to
retain<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.110> nut<00:01:20.000> mind<00:01:21.000> has<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
retain the nut mind has to be one with a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:28.100 
retain the nut mind has to be one with a
lock<00:01:23.130> washer<00:01:24.229> between<00:01:26.060> two<00:01:27.060> nuts<00:01:27.330> now

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
lock washer between two nuts now

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.390 
lock washer between two nuts now
basically<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.680> basic<00:01:29.009> procedure<00:01:29.430> for<00:01:30.110> for

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
basically the basic procedure for for

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.899 
basically the basic procedure for for
installing<00:01:32.400> these<00:01:32.869> or<00:01:34.159> setting<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.460> rear

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
installing these or setting up the rear

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.359 
installing these or setting up the rear
axle<00:01:36.329> correctly<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.490> pretty<00:01:38.490> simple<00:01:38.759> you

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
axle correctly here is pretty simple you

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.170 
axle correctly here is pretty simple you
know<00:01:41.400> tighten<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.180> adjustment<00:01:42.600> nut<00:01:43.290> until

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
know tighten the adjustment nut until

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.880 
know tighten the adjustment nut until
two<00:01:45.180> 50<00:01:45.840> foot-pounds<00:01:46.049> while<00:01:46.560> you're<00:01:46.680> rotating

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
two 50 foot-pounds while you're rotating

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.760 
two 50 foot-pounds while you're rotating
so<00:01:47.759> I'll<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.210> I'll<00:01:48.990> pause<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.680> do

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
so I'll do that I'll pause this and do

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.580 
so I'll do that I'll pause this and do
that<00:01:50.299> now<00:01:51.299> once<00:01:51.720> you've<00:01:51.960> got<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:54.200> nut<00:01:55.200> tighten

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that now once you've got the nut tighten

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.230 
that now once you've got the nut tighten
to<00:01:55.680> 50<00:01:56.310> foot-pounds<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.969> you've<00:01:57.090> been

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
to 50 foot-pounds and you've been

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.080 
to 50 foot-pounds and you've been
rotating<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.219> it's<00:01:59.219> actually<00:01:59.610> pretty<00:01:59.790> tight

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
rotating it it's actually pretty tight

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.840 
rotating it it's actually pretty tight
there<00:02:00.119> now<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.770> next<00:02:01.979> step<00:02:02.100> explains

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
there now this the next step explains

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.959 
there now this the next step explains
why<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.270> found<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.740> once<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.460> removed<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> lock

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
why I found the once we removed the lock

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.609 
why I found the once we removed the lock
nut<00:02:06.210> why<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.810> inner<00:02:07.399> not<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.879> adjustment<00:02:09.390> nut

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
nut why the inner not the adjustment nut

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.110 
nut why the inner not the adjustment nut
felt<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.920> loose<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> was<00:02:11.489> actually<00:02:11.819> finger

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
felt so loose it was actually finger

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.970 
felt so loose it was actually finger
tight<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.540> there's<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.110> reason<00:02:13.410> for<00:02:13.620> that

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
tight and there's a reason for that

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.770 
tight and there's a reason for that
it<00:02:14.099> actually<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.670> supposed<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.300> be<00:02:15.480> finger

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
it actually is supposed to be finger

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.420 
it actually is supposed to be finger
tight<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:16.860> do<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.129> once<00:02:17.280> you've

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
tight so what you do is once you've

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.460 
tight so what you do is once you've
torqued<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.819> to<00:02:17.909> 50<00:02:18.180> foot-pounds<00:02:18.470> you're

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
torqued it to 50 foot-pounds you're

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.890 
torqued it to 50 foot-pounds you're
setting<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.890> bearing<00:02:20.159> preload<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:20.900> you

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
setting the bearing preload and you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.839 
setting the bearing preload and you
basically<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.500> back<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.950> off<00:02:24.950> until<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
basically you back it off until it's the

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:34.940 
basically you back it off until it's the
nut<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.540> loose<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:30.019> from<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.170> point<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:33.950> you

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
nut is loose and from that point you you

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.850 
nut is loose and from that point you you
retighten<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.540> finger<00:02:36.870> tightness<00:02:39.860> to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
retighten it just a finger tightness to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.380 
retighten it just a finger tightness to
the<00:02:40.950> point<00:02:41.190> where<00:02:41.340> yeah<00:02:41.700> basically<00:02:42.030> with<00:02:42.360> your

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the point where yeah basically with your

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.819 
the point where yeah basically with your
fingers<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.810> can't<00:02:43.079> tighten<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.470> any<00:02:43.650> more

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
fingers you can't tighten it any more

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.479 
fingers you can't tighten it any more
and<00:02:44.010> at<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.730> point<00:02:45.860> I'm<00:02:46.860> just<00:02:46.920> looking<00:02:47.310> for

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
and at that point I'm just looking for

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.710 
and at that point I'm just looking for
the<00:02:47.549> key<00:02:47.730> way<00:02:47.879> there's<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.180> key<00:02:48.390> way<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:48.629> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the key way there's a key way on the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.020 
the key way there's a key way on the
front<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.140> axle<00:02:49.290> right<00:02:49.620> there

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
front of the axle right there

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:59.289 
front of the axle right there

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
lock nut and that one there a little bit

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.140 
lock nut and that one there a little bit
more<00:03:32.970> vague<00:03:33.630> on<00:03:34.069> they<00:03:35.069> just<00:03:35.340> basically<00:03:35.760> say

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
more vague on they just basically say

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.479 
more vague on they just basically say
tighten<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.230> till<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:37.620> secure<00:03:37.980> then<00:03:38.250> whoever

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
tighten it till it's secure then whoever

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.390 
tighten it till it's secure then whoever
actually<00:03:38.940> was<00:03:39.150> an<00:03:39.329> absolute<00:03:39.959> torque<00:03:40.829> value<00:03:41.190> so

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
actually was an absolute torque value so

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.830 
actually was an absolute torque value so
you<00:03:41.459> kind<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.760> have<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.030> interpret<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.690> one

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
you kind of have to interpret that one

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.949 
you kind of have to interpret that one
as<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.139> wish<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:44.790> can't<00:03:45.389> give<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.540> any<00:03:45.780> advice

as you wish I can't give you any advice
on<00:03:46.200> this<00:03:46.349> this<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.739> first<00:03:46.980> one<00:03:47.099> I've<00:03:47.280> done

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
on this this is the first one I've done

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.210 
on this this is the first one I've done
all<00:03:48.599> I<00:03:48.690> can<00:03:48.810> say<00:03:49.079> is<00:03:49.290> just<00:03:49.560> before<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:50.099> do

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
all I can say is just before you do

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.770 
all I can say is just before you do
tighten<00:03:50.730> anything<00:03:50.940> up<00:03:51.180> make<00:03:51.329> sure<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.569> the

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
tighten anything up make sure that the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.039 
tighten anything up make sure that the
hub<00:03:52.290> rotates<00:03:52.709> freely<00:03:53.010> and<00:03:53.510> you<00:03:54.510> don't<00:03:54.690> feel

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
hub rotates freely and you don't feel

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.890 
hub rotates freely and you don't feel
any<00:03:55.290> real<00:03:56.040> significant<00:03:56.549> end<00:03:56.730> play<00:03:56.940> on<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.299> you

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
any real significant end play on it you

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.110 
any real significant end play on it you
know<00:03:58.340> personally<00:03:59.340> I<00:03:59.400> can't<00:03:59.639> feel<00:03:59.849> anything

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
know personally I can't feel anything

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.430 
know personally I can't feel anything
there<00:04:00.419> so<00:04:00.599> I'm<00:04:00.690> going<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:00.930> say<00:04:01.079> that<00:04:01.260> I<00:04:01.290> think

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
there so I'm going to say that I think

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.069 
there so I'm going to say that I think
it's<00:04:01.739> pretty<00:04:01.919> good<00:04:02.510> and<00:04:03.510> that's<00:04:04.169> it<00:04:06.019> okay<00:04:07.019> so

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
it's pretty good and that's it okay so

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.300 
it's pretty good and that's it okay so
the<00:04:07.400> hubs<00:04:08.400> are<00:04:08.609> all<00:04:08.730> back<00:04:08.940> on<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.949> I've<00:04:10.949> got<00:04:11.129> my

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
the hubs are all back on and I've got my

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.890 
the hubs are all back on and I've got my
tires<00:04:11.579> back<00:04:11.879> on<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.389> one<00:04:12.510> needs<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.780> little

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
tires back on that one needs a little

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.729 
tires back on that one needs a little
air<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:16.430> I'm<00:04:17.430> glad<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.910> see<00:04:18.150> any<00:04:18.780> astute

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
air so I'm glad to see any astute

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.529 
air so I'm glad to see any astute
looking<00:04:20.310> people<00:04:20.519> might<00:04:20.789> notice<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.359> lug

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
looking people might notice that the lug

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.020 
looking people might notice that the lug
nuts<00:04:21.780> are<00:04:21.959> on<00:04:22.019> backwards<00:04:22.760> that's<00:04:23.760> just

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
nuts are on backwards that's just

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.730 
nuts are on backwards that's just
because<00:04:24.210> without<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.409> brake<00:04:25.650> drum

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
because without the brake drum

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.640 
because without the brake drum
ah<00:04:26.770> yet<00:04:27.099> there's<00:04:27.370> just<00:04:27.430> that<00:04:27.789> little<00:04:28.150> bit<00:04:28.650> of

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
ah yet there's just that little bit of

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.020 
ah yet there's just that little bit of
additional<00:04:29.919> space<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.669> nuts<00:04:30.880> are

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
additional space and the nuts are

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
additional space and the nuts are
bottoming<00:04:31.479> out<00:04:31.740> before<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:34.000> rim<00:04:34.870> was

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
bottoming out before the the rim was

now I'll install the axle shafts next
nothing<00:04:47.650> special<00:04:47.949> about<00:04:48.190> those<00:04:49.020> there's<00:04:50.020> just

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
this metal you know gasket I guess you

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.650 
this metal you know gasket I guess you
could<00:04:56.860> call<00:04:56.889> it<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.430> goes<00:04:58.030> between<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.630> and

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
could call it that goes between it and

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.870 
could call it that goes between it and
the<00:04:58.840> axle<00:04:59.229> shafts<00:04:59.470> exercise<00:05:00.039> just<00:05:00.580> slide

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
the axle shafts exercise just slide

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.210 
the axle shafts exercise just slide
right<00:05:00.909> in<00:05:01.409> torque<00:05:02.409> the<00:05:02.530> bolts<00:05:02.620> down<00:05:02.860> to

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
right in torque the bolts down to

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.920 
right in torque the bolts down to

grease<00:05:12.159> off<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.430> these<00:05:12.729> and<00:05:13.060> I'm<00:05:14.050> gonna<00:05:14.259> use<00:05:14.680> a

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
grease off of these and I'm gonna use a

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.420 
grease off of these and I'm gonna use a
little<00:05:15.039> bit<00:05:15.130> of<00:05:15.720> sealer<00:05:16.720> on<00:05:16.780> them<00:05:17.250> it<00:05:18.250> doesn't

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
little bit of sealer on them it doesn't

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.120 
little bit of sealer on them it doesn't
say<00:05:18.699> to<00:05:18.729> but<00:05:19.270> quite<00:05:20.080> frankly<00:05:20.409> it's<00:05:20.590> in<00:05:20.740> contact

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
say to but quite frankly it's in contact

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.589 
say to but quite frankly it's in contact
with<00:05:21.340> oil<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.759> they<00:05:21.849> don't<00:05:22.000> have<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.419> much

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
with oil and they don't have that much

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.480 
with oil and they don't have that much
confidence<00:05:23.169> in<00:05:23.349> the<00:05:23.470> sealing<00:05:23.800> ability<00:05:24.220> of<00:05:24.370> a

confidence in the sealing ability of a

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.149 
confidence in the sealing ability of a
thin<00:05:25.210> hunk<00:05:25.419> of<00:05:25.949> metal

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
thin hunk of metal

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.249 
thin hunk of metal
I'm<00:05:27.280> assuming<00:05:27.490> it's<00:05:27.759> aluminum<00:05:28.270> but<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.020> thin

I'm assuming it's aluminum but a thin
hunk<00:05:29.470> of<00:05:29.590> metal<00:05:29.740> in<00:05:29.949> any<00:05:30.130> case<00:05:31.440> okay<00:05:32.820> okay<00:05:33.820> the

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
hunk of metal in any case okay okay the

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.510 
hunk of metal in any case okay okay the
axle<00:05:34.330> shafts<00:05:34.599> are<00:05:34.870> in<00:05:35.080> but<00:05:35.530> I<00:05:35.889> have<00:05:36.159> a<00:05:36.190> little

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
axle shafts are in but I have a little

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.180 
axle shafts are in but I have a little
tale<00:05:37.150> to<00:05:37.479> tell<00:05:37.509> that<00:05:38.050> shows<00:05:38.800> you<00:05:38.979> that<00:05:39.070> you

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
tale to tell that shows you that you

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.879 
tale to tell that shows you that you
really<00:05:39.490> should<00:05:39.699> trust<00:05:40.000> your<00:05:40.240> own<00:05:40.330> judgment

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
really should trust your own judgment

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.790 
really should trust your own judgment
these<00:05:42.460> were<00:05:42.669> rated<00:05:43.090> for<00:05:43.330> 115<00:05:44.050> foot<00:05:44.349> pounds

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
these were rated for 115 foot pounds

these were rated for 115 foot pounds
which<00:05:44.979> is<00:05:45.250> what<00:05:46.710> didn't<00:05:47.710> sound<00:05:47.949> unreasonable

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
which is what didn't sound unreasonable

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.350 
which is what didn't sound unreasonable
it<00:05:49.090> sounded<00:05:49.419> high<00:05:49.599> but<00:05:49.870> not<00:05:49.990> unreasonable<00:05:51.360> so

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
it sounded high but not unreasonable so

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.820 
it sounded high but not unreasonable so
I<00:05:52.389> went<00:05:52.599> and<00:05:52.659> I<00:05:52.719> just<00:05:52.750> did<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.050> mistake<00:05:53.229> I<00:05:53.620> went

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
to 80 foot pounds first and everything

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.770 
to 80 foot pounds first and everything
seemed<00:05:55.780> okay<00:05:55.930> but<00:05:57.030> that's<00:05:58.030> stupid<00:05:58.569> cheap

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
seemed okay but that's stupid cheap

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.870 
seemed okay but that's stupid cheap
torque<00:05:59.110> wrench<00:05:59.380> I've<00:05:59.560> got<00:05:59.770> second<00:06:00.610> I<00:06:00.639> went<00:06:00.819> to

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
torque wrench I've got second I went to

torque wrench I've got second I went to
115<00:06:01.419> I<00:06:01.449> just<00:06:01.750> snapped<00:06:02.080> the<00:06:02.229> bolt<00:06:02.440> off<00:06:02.650> because

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
115 I just snapped the bolt off because

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.260 
115 I just snapped the bolt off because
I<00:06:03.009> I<00:06:03.219> knew<00:06:04.030> I<00:06:04.060> was<00:06:04.389> exerting<00:06:05.020> way<00:06:05.409> more<00:06:05.800> than

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
I I knew I was exerting way more than

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.089 
I I knew I was exerting way more than
then<00:06:07.270> then<00:06:08.259> you<00:06:08.740> know<00:06:08.969> 115<00:06:09.969> on<00:06:10.150> there<00:06:10.330> but<00:06:10.449> I

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:12.959 
then then you know 115 on there but I
trusted<00:06:12.099> the<00:06:12.219> instrument<00:06:12.759> in<00:06:12.849> the<00:06:12.909> history

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
trusted the instrument in the history

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.570 
trusted the instrument in the history
and<00:06:13.240> I'm<00:06:13.389> sure<00:06:13.719> is<00:06:13.930> wrong<00:06:14.199> then<00:06:15.159> in<00:06:15.250> case<00:06:15.400> I

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
and I'm sure is wrong then in case I

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.120 
and I'm sure is wrong then in case I
snapped<00:06:15.909> off<00:06:16.150> one<00:06:16.389> bolt<00:06:16.690> this<00:06:17.349> one<00:06:17.530> right<00:06:17.680> here

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130
