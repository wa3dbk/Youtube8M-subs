00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
okay we left off with the last face done

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.540 
okay we left off with the last face done
the<00:00:08.670> edges<00:00:09.090> done<00:00:09.590> but<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> corners<00:00:11.070> not<00:00:11.490> in

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
the edges done but the corners not in

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.839 
the edges done but the corners not in
the<00:00:11.610> right<00:00:11.700> place<00:00:13.219> well<00:00:14.219> technically<00:00:14.700> they're

on the right place if you put them
together<00:00:17.690> now<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.750> edges<00:00:19.080> are<00:00:19.170> done<00:00:19.380> using

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
together now the edges are done using

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.519 
together now the edges are done using
order<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.310> switch<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.789> edges<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.240> you

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
order to do this switch the edges in you

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.620 
order to do this switch the edges in you
you<00:00:22.529> got<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.180> but<00:00:25.880> we're<00:00:26.880> doing<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> starway

you got it but we're doing the starway

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.120 
you got it but we're doing the starway
just<00:00:28.560> teach<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:30.590> other<00:00:31.590> scenarios

okay all the edges are matching yeah now
you<00:00:37.590> got<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.860> find<00:00:38.040> corners<00:00:38.520> ok<00:00:39.379> but<00:00:40.379> not

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
you got to find corners ok but not

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.410 
you got to find corners ok but not
another<00:00:40.890> corner<00:00:41.250> ok<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> green
