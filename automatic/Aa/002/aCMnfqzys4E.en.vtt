else<00:01:51.439> in<00:01:51.709> here<00:01:52.179> to<00:01:53.179> do<00:01:53.329> our<00:01:53.539> work<00:01:55.359> here<00:01:56.359> we<00:01:56.479> have

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
else in here to do our work here we have

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.039 
else in here to do our work here we have
our<00:01:56.840> Manero<00:01:57.229> 298<00:01:58.149> this<00:01:59.149> is<00:01:59.359> a<00:01:59.389> stretched

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
our Manero 298 this is a stretched

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.929 
our Manero 298 this is a stretched
version<00:02:00.229> of

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
version of

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.020 
version of
this<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.060> what<00:02:03.240> we're<00:02:03.420> gonna<00:02:03.600> turn<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:05.030> 27

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this is what we're gonna turn the 27

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.100 
this is what we're gonna turn the 27
into<00:02:08.269> so<00:02:09.269> what<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.569> have<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.050> is

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
into so what you have this is

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.640 
into so what you have this is
approximately<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.120> cut<00:02:12.120> line<00:02:12.330> or<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.080> 27

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
approximately the cut line or the 27

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.520 
approximately the cut line or the 27
ends<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.819> this<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.180> where<00:02:15.360> we're<00:02:15.569> adding<00:02:15.780> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
ends so this is where we're adding to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.869 
ends so this is where we're adding to
the<00:02:16.620> hollow<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:18.660> will<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.140> new<00:02:19.319> deck

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
the hollow and this will be the new deck

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.970 
the hollow and this will be the new deck
so<00:02:20.879> we<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.330> rule<00:02:21.840> for<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.860> we're

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
so we have a rule for this and we're

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.020 
so we have a rule for this and we're
gonna<00:02:23.040> lay<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.489> up<00:02:23.810> from<00:02:24.810> about<00:02:24.989> here<00:02:25.620> half<00:02:26.430> and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
gonna lay it up from about here half and

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.869 
gonna lay it up from about here half and
then<00:02:27.930> we're<00:02:28.080> gonna<00:02:28.170> fuse<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.890> two<00:02:28.920> pieces

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
then we're gonna fuse the two pieces

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.500 
then we're gonna fuse the two pieces
together<00:02:30.590> this<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.830> cockpit<00:02:32.430> area<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.030> 29

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
together this is the cockpit area the 29

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.500 
together this is the cockpit area the 29
so<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:33.989> is<00:02:34.340> what<00:02:35.340> its<00:02:35.519> gonna<00:02:35.640> look<00:02:35.760> like<00:02:35.970> when

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
so this is what its gonna look like when

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.610 
so this is what its gonna look like when
finished<00:02:37.579> in<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.849> most<00:02:39.030> part<00:02:40.069> here's<00:02:41.069> a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
finished in the most part here's a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.199 
finished in the most part here's a
fish-cleaning<00:02:43.620> station<00:02:44.690> that<00:02:45.690> will<00:02:45.840> be<00:02:46.049> there

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
fish-cleaning station that will be there

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.900 
fish-cleaning station that will be there
the<00:02:48.209> swim<00:02:48.510> grade<00:02:48.750> is<00:02:48.900> integrated<00:02:49.790> into<00:02:50.790> this

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
the swim grade is integrated into this

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:58.539 
the swim grade is integrated into this
boat<00:02:52.099> that<00:02:53.099> will<00:02:53.310> be<00:02:53.459> there<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:56.870> over<00:02:57.870> here

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
boat that will be there and over here

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.670 
boat that will be there and over here
over<00:02:59.549> here

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
over here

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.530 
over here
this<00:03:01.980> floor<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.579> to<00:03:02.670> be<00:03:02.790> extended<00:03:03.390> at

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
this floor is going to be extended at

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.920 
this floor is going to be extended at
this<00:03:03.750> level<00:03:04.379> well<00:03:05.099> three<00:03:05.760> feet<00:03:06.030> forward<00:03:06.389> so<00:03:06.810> we

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
this level well three feet forward so we

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.430 
this level well three feet forward so we
have<00:03:07.049> to<00:03:07.170> put<00:03:07.350> an<00:03:07.440> insert<00:03:07.769> into<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.030> mold<00:03:09.440> to

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
have to put an insert into the mold to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.199 
have to put an insert into the mold to
flatten<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:10.859> piece<00:03:11.190> out<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:16.609> this<00:03:17.609> will<00:03:17.970> be

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
flatten that piece out and this will be

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:25.039 
flatten that piece out and this will be
also<00:03:18.510> included<00:03:19.730> this<00:03:20.730> hatch<00:03:20.940> here<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:24.049> the

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
also included this hatch here and the

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.520 
also included this hatch here and the
floor<00:03:25.319> will<00:03:25.500> go<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.680> about<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.870> point<00:03:27.870> so

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
floor will go to about this point so

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.650 
floor will go to about this point so
we're<00:03:28.829> gonna<00:03:28.950> join<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.459> at<00:03:30.000> approximately

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
we're gonna join it at approximately

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.990 
we're gonna join it at approximately
this<00:03:30.750> point<00:03:31.109> so<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.160> again<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.609> bubble

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
this point so that again this bubble

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.360 
this point so that again this bubble
will<00:03:33.150> not<00:03:33.329> be<00:03:34.169> here<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.590> will<00:03:34.620> go<00:03:34.889> flat<00:03:35.160> right

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
will not be here it will go flat right

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.190 
will not be here it will go flat right
through

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.500
