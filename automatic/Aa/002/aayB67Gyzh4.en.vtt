00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.319
 human anatomy dot net presents 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.910
 anatomical positions nomenclature 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:13.309
 anatomical was in 1895 in basel switzerland 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.860
 when an international commission 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.680
 he formulated the anatomical payroll this payroll 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.360
 eliminated many eponyms by understanding 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.300
 as the name of the person who had 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.110
 first described a structure was 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.790
 until 1928 when a committee was appointed 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.820
 the anatomy society of britain 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:35.460
 and Ireland whose goal was the review 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.620
 of the existing anatomical payroll the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.600
 new adaptation was accepted by the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.190
 Review of Birmingham without acceptance 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.530
 of the German anatomists in 1960 in 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.200
 the city â€‹â€‹of new york was agreed the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.930
 first international nomenclature the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.930
 which is the current one to date 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.390
 anatomical position all 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.580
 anatomical descriptions are found 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.970
 in relation to what is known as 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.320
 anatomical position and this is defined as 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.060
 one that is adopted while standing 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.979
 direct with the head eyes and feet together 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.020
 directed forward and members 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.900
 superiors with their directed palms 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.690
 forward with this we can 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.600
 describe four anatomical planes that 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.330
 they are median sagittal coronal and horizontal 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.250
 medium is a vertical plane 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.479
 longitudinal to the body that goes from the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.119
 face anterior to the posterior sagittal 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.670
 vertical plane parallel to the median 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.630
 divides the body into two halves right 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.930
 and left coronal or frontal flat 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.420
 vertical that passes perpendicular to the plane 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.020
 median divides the body into anterior and 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.689
 later 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.299
 horizontal or transverse is a plane 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.369
 perpendicular to both the median plane and 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.549
 to the coronal that divides the body into 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.069
 upper and lower once defined 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.109
 the different anatomical planes we 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:09.009
 we will focus on the terms of relationship 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.569
 which are previous is used 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.760
 when the structure is located by 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.470
 front in the body or that is 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.620
 approximate the ventral side of the body 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.540
 for your better understanding 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.940
 we will mention some examples the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.579
 crural quadriceps is in the face 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.410
 anterior of the thigh or the umbilicus 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.069
 found on the front of the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.019
 posterior abdomen is used when the 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.510
 structure is located behind in the 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.380
 body or it approaches the face 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.480
 dorsal upper body term 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.390
 used when a structure is 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.599
 near the head for example the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.849
 heart is superior to the diaphragm 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.829
 lower this term is used when 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.709
 we refer to a structure that 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:56.109
 near the feet for example the 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.150
 kidneys are located lower than 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.480
 diaphragm 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.750
 internal or medial is used when a 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.180
 structure approaches the middle line 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.920
 external or lateral is used when a 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.680
 structure moves away from the middle line 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.280
 for example the first finger of the hand is 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.709
 external to the median plane of the body 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.090
 combined terms are often combined 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.280
 the terms to indicate a 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.170
 certain orientation now 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.349
 we will define the following terms 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.310
 used in comparative anatomy in relation 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:32.430
 to two proximal structures whose origin 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.440
 Latin means next term 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.109
 used to assign something that is 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.049
 approximate the trunk or a place of 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:43.920
 origin for example the shoulder is next 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.019
 to the distal elbow term used to 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.129
 describe objects that move away from 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.709
 trunk 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.320
 for example the elbow is distal 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.450
 on the shoulder 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.180
 superficial means next to the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.200
 surface here we have that the skin is 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.720
 superficial to the subcutaneous cellular tissue 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.550
 deep term designed to describe 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.930
 something that is far from the 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.840
 surface 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.780
 for example the subcutaneous cellular tissue 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.090
 is deep to the skin 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.510
 ipsilateral means the same side of the 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.650
 contralateral body means side 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.960
 contrary to the body 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.340
