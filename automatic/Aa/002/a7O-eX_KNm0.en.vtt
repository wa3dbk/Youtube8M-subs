one of the first lines of defense for
safety<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:38.280> we're<00:00:38.430> riding<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.390> is

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
safety when we're riding and this is

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.479 
safety when we're riding and this is
observation<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> most<00:00:41.280> dangerous

observation one of the most dangerous

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.729 
observation one of the most dangerous
situations<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.420> scooters<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.590> have

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
situations for a scooters is to have

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.440 
situations for a scooters is to have
something<00:00:44.070> unexpected<00:00:44.789> happen<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.329> it's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
something unexpected happen when it's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.600 
something unexpected happen when it's
right<00:00:45.719> near<00:00:46.020> our<00:00:46.230> front<00:00:46.559> wheel<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.550> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
right near our front wheel the way to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.400 
right near our front wheel the way to
overcome<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.320> good

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
overcome that is to have a very good

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.500 
overcome that is to have a very good
active<00:00:50.280> observation<00:00:50.910> technique

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
active observation technique

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.930 
active observation technique
this<00:00:51.870> means<00:00:52.170> scanning<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.219> potential

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this means scanning for potential

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.209 
this means scanning for potential
hazards<00:00:54.390> will<00:00:54.960> before<00:00:55.469> they<00:00:55.620> become<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.980> rich

we're designed to walk jog run if we
really<00:01:03.059> have<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.289> means<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> we

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
really have to and this means that we

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.919 
really have to and this means that we
don't<00:01:05.100> need<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> look<00:01:05.580> very<00:01:05.640> far<00:01:06.090> ahead<00:01:06.240> to

out<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.390> front<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.660> us<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.530> when<00:01:10.710> we're<00:01:10.860> riding

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
out in front of us but when we're riding

out in front of us but when we're riding
our<00:01:11.280> scooters

our scooters

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.609 
our scooters
we're<00:01:12.240> often<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.690> much<00:01:13.020> faster<00:01:13.229> than<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
we're often going much faster than a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.620 
we're often going much faster than a
human<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:13.920> run<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.759> we<00:01:14.880> need<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.420> able<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
human can run so we need to be able to

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.240 
human can run so we need to be able to
look<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.960> lot<00:01:16.140> further<00:01:16.409> ahead<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.950> be<00:01:17.040> able<00:01:17.100> to

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
look a lot further ahead to be able to

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.630 
look a lot further ahead to be able to
respond<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.939> any<00:01:18.330> particular<00:01:18.840> hazard<00:01:19.640> let's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
respond to any particular hazard let's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.100 
respond to any particular hazard let's
think<00:01:20.790> about<00:01:21.030> biology<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.750> moment

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
think about biology for a moment

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.649 
think about biology for a moment
research<00:01:23.100> tells<00:01:23.460> us<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.390> average

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
research tells us that the average

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
research tells us that the average
reaction<00:01:25.079> time<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.860> healthy<00:01:26.250> human<00:01:26.549> being

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
reaction time for a healthy human being

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.660 
reaction time for a healthy human being
is<00:01:26.970> around<00:01:27.720> about<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.990> second<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> half<00:01:28.670> now

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
is around about a second and a half now

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.010 
is around about a second and a half now
if<00:01:29.790> you're<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> jet<00:01:30.180> fighter<00:01:30.360> pilot<00:01:30.509> your

if you're a jet fighter pilot your

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.480 
if you're a jet fighter pilot your
reaction<00:01:31.409> time<00:01:31.560> might<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.920> bit<00:01:32.100> better<00:01:32.280> than

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
reaction time might be a bit better than

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.819 
reaction time might be a bit better than
that<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.090> you're<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:34.020> me<00:01:34.229> it's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that but if you're not like me it's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.039 
that but if you're not like me it's
probably<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.220> little<00:01:35.340> bit<00:01:35.460> longer<00:01:35.759> now<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.900> we

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
probably a little bit longer now if we

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.469 
probably a little bit longer now if we
need<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> second<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> half<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.520> react<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> a

need a second and a half to react to a
potential<00:01:40.049> threat<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:41.340> means<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.820> need<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
potential threat that means we need to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.240 
potential threat that means we need to
have<00:01:42.149> a<00:01:42.270> certain<00:01:42.600> amount<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.840> time<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.470> react

problem<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.790> second<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> half<00:01:48.360> of

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
problem so a second and a half of

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.020 
problem so a second and a half of
reaction<00:01:49.229> time<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.790> approximately<00:01:50.790> two<00:01:51.000> and

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
reaction time and approximately two and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.480 
reaction time and approximately two and
a<00:01:51.149> half<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.479> three<00:01:51.509> seconds<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.799> break<00:01:53.250> our

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
a half to three seconds to break our

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.459 
a half to three seconds to break our
scooter<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.060> stop<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.689> means<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.200> we

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
scooter to a stop so this means that we

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.649 
scooter to a stop so this means that we
need<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.890> be<00:01:59.009> looking<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.369> least<00:01:59.640> five<00:02:00.180> seconds

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
need to be looking at least five seconds

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.749 
need to be looking at least five seconds
ahead<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.930> us<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.320> depending<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.310> how<00:02:02.520> fast

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
ahead of us so depending on how fast

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.639 
ahead of us so depending on how fast
we're<00:02:03.090> going<00:02:03.270> wherever<00:02:03.899> we're<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.530> be

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
we're going wherever we're going to be

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.830 
we're going wherever we're going to be
in<00:02:04.799> five<00:02:05.009> seconds<00:02:05.430> time<00:02:05.670> that's<00:02:06.329> where<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.600> need

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
in five seconds time that's where I need

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.139 
in five seconds time that's where I need
to<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:07.079> putting<00:02:07.469> my<00:02:07.619> focus<00:02:08.039> then<00:02:08.700> I'm<00:02:08.850> going<00:02:09.090> to

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
to be putting my focus then I'm going to

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.789 
to be putting my focus then I'm going to
scan<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.570> the<00:02:09.869> way<00:02:09.959> back<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> my<00:02:10.380> bike<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.769> I

scan all the way back to my bike so I

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.650 
scan all the way back to my bike so I
know<00:02:11.130> what's<00:02:11.370> going<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.790> from<00:02:12.090> five<00:02:12.269> seconds

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660
