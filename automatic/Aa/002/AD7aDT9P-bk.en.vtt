00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.290
 hi this video is about ink i am you 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.099
 I'll tell you about the ink which is worth taking 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.089
 which is not worth and spend 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:19.859
 so it means there are two kinds of ink 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:24.960
 acrylic and alcohol based show 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.430
 on the example of grog it is a spirit base 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.840
 it is acrylic 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.940
 that is, if you look closely this ink is not 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:39.360
 so transparent cover and these are matte 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.809
 they are dumb they are runners but if here i am 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.329
 patriot 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.450
 mixed it became opaque a 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:55.320
 the surface of this jar began to prepare 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:01:00.260
 transparent that is the difference is that these 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:05.040
 the ink is transparent these are no i prefer 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:09.000
 alcohol based ink because 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.159
 they are better suited fall almost 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.670
 under any surface unlike on 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.590
 acrylic so that 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.049
 acrylic well they can write 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.530
 glass by very very smooth 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.840
 surfaces and if they are completely dry 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.320
 clean and if the surface and a lot of dirty 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.960
 and wet then they will all write fast 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.960
 then here are these grog ink of some kind 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.630
 component it settles all the time and there 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.070
 there seems to be cans it's all ok 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.890
 stir and will be ok but squeezer 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:52.200
 and go well as a regular marker and 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:57.329
 vandals are better not to flood 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.420
 March ink brok ink is produced in 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.420
 Italy 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.580
 when compared to all ink 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.190
 which you can buy at all 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.090
 this is not the best ink he basically they 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:16.470
 are cheap enough and 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.650
 suitable for ikking as you can check 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.220
 quality ink well here to take a jar 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:34.100
 shook waited until a little bit drained 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:37.200
 all and look like a gap here 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.010
 Well, in general, you see such a residue on 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.300
 walls 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.280
 it says they are ink quality from me 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.360
 there is even more poor-quality genie lot 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.340
 What generally three six young to do 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.920
 become too in italy but they are not very 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.340
 quality such a girl is drawn 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.020
 how incomprehensible is the lid too 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.640
 opens up there open and so 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:09.890
 little hole it all flows by see then 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:13.769
 there is all the treatment that is there is also very 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:19.050
 many here are some specks on 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.790
 the surface remains it is very 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.440
 qualitatively chernenko if in squeezer 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.890
 there let's say he zassal type pour it 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.900
 run around, that is, with drips to the floor 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.690
 will go since they are very liquid namely 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.750
 vanda is better not to fill 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:43.140
 there are also black and they, in principle, also 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:53.310
 decent ink is more suitable 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:55.950
 for squeezy raw they are super indelible but 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.380
 I will not say that they are what they are 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.250
 transparent that is also having such 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.780
 bluish tint not super bloody if 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.730
 this is especially to light some 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.110
 surface 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.240
 the only negative they have is this cover 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.460
 maybe it's just me dried up 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.820
 I can't open it beamed too crumpled 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:19.040
 a jar and a long time I can not open already 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:24.380
 Passatizhi I tried nothing helps 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:29.190
 also grog still produces black ink 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:34.500
 But this is probably better than ink 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.590
 from grog they can and vandals in squeezer 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.840
 flood 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.600
 but they don't have this white bloom 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.770
 but they are not transparent ie they are 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.440
 Here on alcohol-based is called as 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:54.510
 here is some acrylic 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:57.840
 full metal paint what else to say 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:02.880
 I'll tell you about the ink that I give 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:06.720
 Preference there is a transfer that is here 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:11.310
 look at the walls does not remain at all 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:15.240
 nothing i have this ink 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:19.650
 here but this skin you see namely here 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:26.130
 there is nothing on the walls and such ink 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:29.370
 thoughts nist her very well go well on 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.919
 any surface matter 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.810
 dirty but if it is dirty of course is it 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:38.310
 do you put something much worse 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:45.930
 it's only better flop better 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:48.930
 than let the thunder and color have a pleasant smell 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.550
 pleasant too that is not so 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:55.560
 super alcoholic apostle 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:59.430
 even berry could say something 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:02.220
 there is if you choose because of this ink 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:07.560
 I can tell you that itâ€™s better to be fat 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:09.750
 the ink lets companies hammer it 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.930
 there is well as paint and marker 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.630
 but minus this ink is that they are very 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.950
 Expensive, that is, if these banks are worth 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:23.930
 300 350 rubles for 200 or 250 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:27.810
 milliliters then those already cost coming 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:31.710
 more than 500 that is , 700 for the same 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:39.270
 the volume but it is molotov ink very 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:43.140
 indelible strongly indelible and of course 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:47.210
 the quality of them is also very good and he 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.210
 Acrylic ink is also available early. 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:55.530
 minetti like there is an ink stroke 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:07:00.890
 chocolate hot chocolate in general, they still 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:06.030
 brown any art buff calls with 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:07.590
 But if you have a choice to take 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.560
 between all 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:14.960
 ink which I called take it for 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.960
