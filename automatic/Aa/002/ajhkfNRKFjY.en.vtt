00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
okay we're going to look at ward off

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.890 
okay we're going to look at ward off
application<00:00:15.469> of<00:00:15.559> ward<00:00:15.770> off<00:00:15.980> striking<00:00:16.970> force

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
application of ward off striking force

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.560 
application of ward off striking force
where<00:00:18.140> the<00:00:18.230> energy<00:00:18.529> comes<00:00:18.740> from<00:00:19.210> and<00:00:20.210> all<00:00:20.420> the

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
where the energy comes from and all the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.929 
where the energy comes from and all the
elements<00:00:20.840> that<00:00:21.410> are<00:00:21.470> needed<00:00:21.770> when<00:00:22.310> we're

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
elements that are needed when we're

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.810 
elements that are needed when we're
applying<00:00:23.180> this<00:00:23.509> this<00:00:23.840> move<00:00:24.279> would<00:00:25.279> dispel<00:00:25.790> a

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
applying this this move would dispel a

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.069 
applying this this move would dispel a
few<00:00:25.910> myths<00:00:26.300> also<00:00:28.630> we're<00:00:29.630> going<00:00:29.779> to<00:00:29.840> keep<00:00:29.930> it

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
few myths also we're going to keep it

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.409 
few myths also we're going to keep it

ward off with my my assistant Kelly here
basically<00:00:37.370> we're<00:00:37.760> going<00:00:37.880> to<00:00:37.940> be<00:00:38.000> striking<00:00:38.809> the

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
basically we're going to be striking the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.220 
basically we're going to be striking the
idea<00:00:40.190> is<00:00:40.250> to<00:00:40.489> always<00:00:40.700> remain<00:00:41.390> relaxed<00:00:41.809> you

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
idea is to always remain relaxed you

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.830 
idea is to always remain relaxed you
have<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.530> stay<00:00:42.740> relaxed<00:00:43.310> just<00:00:43.940> think<00:00:44.180> of<00:00:44.330> of

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
have to stay relaxed just think of of

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.320 
have to stay relaxed just think of of
your<00:00:45.080> body<00:00:45.650> as<00:00:45.980> being<00:00:46.310> just<00:00:46.580> your<00:00:46.790> arm<00:00:47.000> thing
