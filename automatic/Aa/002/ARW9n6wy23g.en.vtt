from David can with the co-founder and
CEO<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.420> double<00:00:15.750> robotics<00:00:31.040> welcome<00:00:32.040> Dave

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.760 

thanks<00:00:36.649> this<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.829> double<00:00:38.360> it's<00:00:39.360> an<00:00:39.660> iPad<00:00:40.379> based

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
thanks this is double it's an iPad based

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.369 
thanks this is double it's an iPad based
telepresence<00:00:41.489> robot<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.840> essentially<00:00:43.290> an

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
telepresence robot it's essentially an

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.430 
telepresence robot it's essentially an
iPad<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.770> top<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.280> Segway<00:00:44.870> as<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.200> see

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
iPad on top of a Segway as you can see

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.380 
iPad on top of a Segway as you can see
we're<00:00:46.649> using<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.010> iPad<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> brain<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
we're using the iPad as the brain is the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.959 
we're using the iPad as the brain is the
communication<00:00:48.719> system<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.250> base<00:00:50.730> has

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
communication system and the base has

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.340 
communication system and the base has
some<00:00:51.120> very<00:00:51.239> sophisticated<00:00:51.449> balancing

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
some very sophisticated balancing

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.939 
some very sophisticated balancing
technology<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.379> balances<00:00:55.620> on

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
technology in it and so it balances on

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.049 
technology in it and so it balances on
two<00:00:56.129> wheels<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.579> I'll<00:00:56.640> show<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.820> how<00:00:56.969> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
two wheels and I'll show you how it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.609 
two wheels and I'll show you how it
works<00:00:57.180> right<00:00:57.420> here<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.350> has<00:01:04.439> two

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
works right here so it has two

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.200 
works right here so it has two
kickstands<00:01:05.100> when<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.519> not<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.909> when<00:01:06.060> it's

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
kickstands when it's not you when it's

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.690 
kickstands when it's not you when it's
not<00:01:06.330> balancing<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:08.159> only<00:01:08.340> not

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
not balancing and it's a it's only not

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.100 
not balancing and it's a it's only not
using<00:01:08.939> any<00:01:09.030> power<00:01:09.210> when<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.659> on<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> kick

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
using any power when it's on the kick

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.780 
using any power when it's on the kick
stands<00:01:10.380> there<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.580> simple

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
stands there and this is a very simple

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.670 
stands there and this is a very simple
driving<00:01:12.210> interface<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.990> we've<00:01:13.200> we've

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
driving interface that we've we've

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.560 
driving interface that we've we've
created<00:01:14.000> what's<00:01:15.000> great<00:01:15.150> about<00:01:15.210> using<00:01:15.509> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
created what's great about using the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.670 
created what's great about using the
iPad<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.380> create<00:01:16.590> multiple

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
iPad is that we can create multiple

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.789 
iPad is that we can create multiple
driving<00:01:17.520> interfaces<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> we<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.409> experiment

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
driving interfaces so we can experiment

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
driving interfaces so we can experiment
with<00:01:20.070> different<00:01:20.280> different<00:01:20.939> kinds<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.270> user

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
with different different kinds of user

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.190 
with different different kinds of user
interfaces<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.130> one<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:24.200> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
interfaces this is just one of them it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.039 
interfaces this is just one of them it
also<00:01:25.350> has<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> pole<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.130> goes<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.610> down<00:01:30.049> so

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
also has a pole that goes up and down so

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.840 
also has a pole that goes up and down so
you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.380> at<00:01:31.470> standing<00:01:32.009> height<00:01:32.189> talking<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
you can be at standing height talking to

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.270 
you can be at standing height talking to
somebody<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.329> sitting<00:01:33.869> at<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> table<00:01:34.130> having<00:01:35.130> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the store just like an apple store but

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.830 
the store just like an apple store but
you<00:02:12.510> don't<00:02:12.660> even<00:02:12.690> need<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.900> human<00:02:13.170> involved

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
you don't even need a human involved

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.940 
you don't even need a human involved
so<00:02:18.170> what's<00:02:19.170> very<00:02:19.260> exciting<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.740> that<00:02:19.770> we've

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
so what's very exciting is that we've

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.260 
so what's very exciting is that we've
we've<00:02:20.550> been<00:02:20.670> working<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.000> for<00:02:21.060> about<00:02:21.180> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
we've been working on this for about a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.050 
we've been working on this for about a
year<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.600> half<00:02:21.780> now<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.430> with<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> very<00:02:23.820> very

small team we've been able to accomplish
quite<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.820> lot<00:02:27.060> we've<00:02:27.240> just<00:02:27.600> recently<00:02:27.870> doubled

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
quite a lot we've just recently doubled
