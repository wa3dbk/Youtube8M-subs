00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 making crochet is a gift and also an art 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.269
 the marcelo knows well of this a passion that 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.599
 made him leave the profession of chef de 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.790
 cooking and living only the wires did not know 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.440
 What was the crochet? I want a needle. 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.300
 Nothing crochet, right? 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.050
 It was through a play even though I saw 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.609
 I think it looks fantastic, thinks a rug 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.650
 simple crochet with 11 basic points 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.349
 and when I went to buy they told me was 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.910
 done by hand then if someone made the hand 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.529
 I can do as much as I can 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.899
 do you can do 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.000
 It was where I started to inspired me to 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.170
 want to learn how to crochet 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.260
 get the points 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 there was where it all started I did nec 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.030
 I really fell in love with 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.610
 see the piece 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.610
 but that's where I fell in love even in 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.579
 make the points looks like an irony 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.699
 but marcelo has never taken any 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.760
 crochet and today 13 years after the first 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.879
 contact with a needle he teaches the art of 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.369
 crochet workshops throughout the country 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.310
 there are people who have crochet as a 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.650
 source of income even sell the pieces 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.740
 or sell the flowers 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.299
 I have students who sell carpets. 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.880
 that is for the person to buy 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.610
 to finish is that you can not start a 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.640
 part is there are people who have it as a 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.700
 therapy is either great or excellent 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.759
 therapy and there are people who do project 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.740
 Also by hobby, by distraction 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.810
 to meet friends there 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.210

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.150
 he crochet, then the crochet he is 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.909
 fantastic looks at the amount of de 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.119
 benefits it brings is there for people to 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.880
 in the crochet is dona renata the crochet was the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.189
 that saved her from a possible depression 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.130
 after having undergone two surgeries to 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.970
 the removal of two malignant tumors 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.700
 on the wires 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.049
 the hope of a new life I have 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.009
 a lot of love to life 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.110
 we have to take every day the air we 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.280
 We breathe to thank God for 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.899
 because I had a health problem and the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.080
 crochet that saved me 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.800
 the psychologist claims the craft can be 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.620
 a therapy 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.940
 is very efficient specifically for 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.430
 Who does crochet? 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.800
 the benefits are even greater 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.500
 work crochet manual activity 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.390
 Crochet clicks on causing the brain a 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.610
 level of operation much more 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.860
 higher than it would be 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.440
 provoked on a daily basis so for example 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.500
 crochet explains mathematical domain 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.200
 complex abstraction for you to anticipate 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.200
 a final job as you will arrive 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.780
 in this final work process and this 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.970
 ends up having a mirroring function 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.070
 therapy in which the person 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.650
 example there is a health problem and it 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.300
 have a practice like crochet and you have 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.600
 a way to approach therapeutically 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.790
 we have a future project 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.250
 every time he does not need to relax her 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.860
 pick up needle and threads 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.510
 learned that the school or college 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.330
 learn to do crochet work 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.580
 knitting with these things with 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.430
 now continue now continue 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.680
 the joke then learning a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.130
 manual work happens regularly 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.310
 when the person is still very young and 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.780
 When she has a bit older 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.330
 she recovers this learning she recovers 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.489
 all these good experiences that this 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.470
 early life would bring if this was 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.760
 mediated by a medical professional for 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.510
 a professional psychologist therapist 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:40.340
 can have an effect on 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.340
 very positive mental health
