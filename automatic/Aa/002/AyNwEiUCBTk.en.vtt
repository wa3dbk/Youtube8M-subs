00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
about that the plasma cells won't be

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.940

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.990 
don't know that for sure certain by that
yeah<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.159> powerful<00:01:50.399> ability

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000

energy<00:03:23.419> attached<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.840> this<00:03:23.959> Pokemon<00:03:24.440> and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
energy attached to this Pokemon and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.069 
energy attached to this Pokemon and
during<00:03:24.889> your<00:03:25.010> opponent's<00:03:25.220> next<00:03:25.639> turn<00:03:26.079> the

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
during your opponent's next turn the

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.719 
during your opponent's next turn the
defending<00:03:27.440> pokemon<00:03:27.590> cannot<00:03:28.159> attack<00:03:28.519> so

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:28.729 
defending pokemon cannot attack so

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:30.369 
defending pokemon cannot attack so
they're<00:03:29.000> stuck<00:03:29.359> they're<00:03:29.780> actually<00:03:30.169> basically

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
they're stuck they're actually basically

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.199 
they're stuck they're actually basically
if<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.769> use<00:03:30.919> the<00:03:30.949> attack<00:03:31.340> your<00:03:31.729> opponent<00:03:31.760> is

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
if you use the attack your opponent is

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.149 
if you use the attack your opponent is
talking<00:03:32.540> has<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.930> switch<00:03:33.139> out<00:03:33.349> or<00:03:33.590> maybe<00:03:33.949> use

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 
talking has to switch out or maybe use

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.640 
talking has to switch out or maybe use
Keldeo<00:03:34.609> Russian<00:03:35.419> ability<00:03:35.840> and<00:03:36.049> then<00:03:36.470> it

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
Keldeo Russian ability and then it

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.979 
Keldeo Russian ability and then it
overcomes<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.449> downside<00:03:38.449> of<00:03:38.629> the<00:03:38.750> attack

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
overcomes this downside of the attack

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.469 
overcomes this downside of the attack
because<00:03:39.290> it's<00:03:39.440> really<00:03:39.590> powerful<00:03:40.010> if<00:03:40.129> used

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479 
because it's really powerful if used

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.610 
because it's really powerful if used
