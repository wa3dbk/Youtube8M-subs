00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.030
 Hello everyone, today we are a bit 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.590
 playing around with the lights in short 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.089
 for one thing you see in another 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.949
 video and I want you to see how 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.500
 to dismantle puts that we are the stop 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.180
 let's say the third stop is this one that doesn't 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.529
 I still showed it with the excuse 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.660
 in short, they show it is so 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.699
 very simple a very fast thing there 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.720
 they are simply two cross-shaped screws here 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:35.270
 then a simple screwdriver we go to 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:39.350
 avoid it if you want to disconnect the battery 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.899
 to work safely 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.559
 ok speeded up the screws we pull away 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:51.300
 this is simply our third 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.129
 stop splitting the plug helping us 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.660
 always with a screwdriver we do not unlock 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.280
 from here and if it comes 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.440
 Here we are at the third stop in hand 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.370
 ok now then if we want to disassemble 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.260
 the whole piece 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.170
 we have to go and unscrew these two 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.960
 cross vine one fair and the other from the other 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.680
 part of course 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.780
 otherwise if we want to check 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.460
 only the bulbs are enough to release 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.650
 this this piece of plastic here 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.900
 all this guide here practically where 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.920
 all the bulbs are inserted 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.140
 so let's pressure and ask 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.880
 see if it comes away then you have to 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.520
 also unblock it here from the side and if it is 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.930
 it comes off with all the bulbs 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.240
 so we can go and change them 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.090
 bulbs individually bulbs 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.950
 are the classic w 5 we then like 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.560
 see there is another line passing by 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.759
 then hurry 18 for that 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.950
 speech we made about how 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.390
 restore the tracks here too 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.670
 could be to be restored 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.890
 for example, while we are there I tell you 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.810
 yet another thing but curiosity from here to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.130
 this point is present here and there 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.750
 spray for 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.140
 expelled water on the rear window 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.789
 in short to clean it from here to me ad 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.430
 some other users and success that 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.380
 water entered during the rain 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.330
 so obviously if you see it dripping 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.950
 water from the third stop 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.110
 know that most likely the water 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.180
 enter from this point then 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.930
 a round of silicone you are good and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.540
 that 's it 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.980
 to reassemble naturally, follow all 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.810
 the procedure we have otherwise 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.739
 practically finished if I forgot it 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.390
 something or you just want 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.980
 add something 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.230
 let me know below in the comments 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.000
 for the rest, sign up for the channel 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.830
 I like the video and I remember that 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.230
 you can also find me on facebook on the forum 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.360
 on the site I put all the links below 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.349
 obviously the thank you of a 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.349
 vision of the next
