00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
going to be taking a push pull switch

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.900 
going to be taking a push pull switch
and<00:00:11.870> taking<00:00:12.590> two<00:00:12.800> caps<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:13.460> putting<00:00:13.700> it<00:00:13.790> on

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
and taking two caps and putting it on

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.730 
and taking two caps and putting it on
there<00:00:14.150> so<00:00:14.179> what<00:00:14.960> you're<00:00:15.110> able<00:00:15.200> to<00:00:15.349> do<00:00:15.469> is<00:00:15.590> when

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
there so what you're able to do is when

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.400 
there so what you're able to do is when
you<00:00:15.940> have<00:00:16.940> the<00:00:17.119> switch<00:00:17.390> disengaged<00:00:18.199> you're

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
you have the switch disengaged you're

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.439 
you have the switch disengaged you're
gonna<00:00:18.500> have<00:00:18.710> one<00:00:18.949> value<00:00:19.279> cap<00:00:19.640> when<00:00:20.060> you<00:00:20.180> engage

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
gonna have one value cap when you engage

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:21.490 
gonna have one value cap when you engage
it<00:00:20.600> you're<00:00:20.720> gonna<00:00:20.810> have<00:00:20.990> a<00:00:21.020> different<00:00:21.380> value

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
it you're gonna have a different value

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.830 
it you're gonna have a different value
cap<00:00:21.890> some<00:00:22.730> guys<00:00:22.880> are<00:00:23.029> looking<00:00:23.270> to<00:00:23.359> do<00:00:23.480> this<00:00:23.660> get

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
cap some guys are looking to do this get

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.090 
cap some guys are looking to do this get
a<00:00:23.869> little<00:00:23.990> bit<00:00:24.199> of<00:00:24.289> difference<00:00:24.590> with<00:00:24.770> the<00:00:24.859> tone

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100 
a little bit of difference with the tone

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.980 
a little bit of difference with the tone
what<00:00:25.310> they're<00:00:25.460> trying<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.760> do<00:00:25.939> depending<00:00:26.720> on

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
what they're trying to do depending on

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.900 
what they're trying to do depending on
the<00:00:27.050> pickup<00:00:27.320> combinations<00:00:27.949> or<00:00:28.100> what<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:28.789> this

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
the pickup combinations or what so this

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.570 
the pickup combinations or what so this
is<00:00:29.000> a<00:00:29.060> very<00:00:29.240> quick<00:00:29.510> short<00:00:29.990> easy<00:00:30.289> mod<00:00:30.619> let's<00:00:31.400> get

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
is a very quick short easy mod let's get

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.279 
is a very quick short easy mod let's get
started<00:00:31.970> okay<00:00:32.599> first<00:00:32.839> of<00:00:32.960> all<00:00:32.989> what<00:00:33.170> we<00:00:33.260> need

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
started okay first of all what we need

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.709 
started okay first of all what we need
is<00:00:33.530> we<00:00:33.649> need<00:00:33.679> a<00:00:34.010> pot<00:00:34.460> this<00:00:35.179> is<00:00:35.269> gonna<00:00:35.449> be<00:00:35.539> on<00:00:35.629> one

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
is we need a pot this is gonna be on one

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.719 
is we need a pot this is gonna be on one
of<00:00:35.780> your<00:00:35.899> tone<00:00:36.109> pot<00:00:36.350> so<00:00:36.499> you<00:00:36.620> might<00:00:36.889> use<00:00:37.100> a<00:00:37.129> 500

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:37.729 
of your tone pot so you might use a 500

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:39.399 
of your tone pot so you might use a 500
250k<00:00:38.389> depending<00:00:38.809> on<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:38.989> type<00:00:39.139> of<00:00:39.170> pickup

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:39.409 
250k depending on the type of pickup

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.590 
250k depending on the type of pickup
you're<00:00:39.679> using<00:00:39.859> you<00:00:40.429> need<00:00:40.609> a<00:00:40.639> push-pull<00:00:41.239> switch

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
you're using you need a push-pull switch

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.529 
you're using you need a push-pull switch
on<00:00:41.809> top<00:00:42.049> of<00:00:42.229> it<00:00:42.350> see<00:00:42.979> that<00:00:43.129> here<00:00:43.399> as<00:00:43.519> always<00:00:44.329> I

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
on top of it see that here as always I

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.119 
on top of it see that here as always I
kind<00:00:44.780> of<00:00:44.839> go<00:00:44.929> through<00:00:44.959> my<00:00:45.260> naming<00:00:45.679> convention

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
kind of go through my naming convention

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.699 
kind of go through my naming convention
makes<00:00:46.309> the<00:00:46.459> demo<00:00:47.089> a<00:00:47.209> little<00:00:47.389> bit<00:00:47.600> easier<00:00:47.959> left

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:48.709 
makes the demo a little bit easier left

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:50.680 
makes the demo a little bit easier left
side<00:00:48.920> of<00:00:49.069> the<00:00:49.159> switch<00:00:49.429> is<00:00:49.579> going<00:00:49.609> to<00:00:49.760> be<00:00:49.879> a<00:00:50.059> 1<00:00:50.389> 2

start<00:00:59.989> out<00:01:00.079> with<00:01:00.109> grounding<00:01:00.679> we're<00:01:00.979> going<00:01:01.100> to

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159 
start out with grounding we're going to

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:04.149 
start out with grounding we're going to
ground<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.489> center<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.299> the<00:01:02.420> a2<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:03.079> 8th<00:01:03.260> b2

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
ground the center so the a2 and 8th b2

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.910 
ground the center so the a2 and 8th b2
together<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.299> then<00:01:05.479> to<00:01:05.719> the<00:01:05.869> top<00:01:06.079> of<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.710> pot

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
together and then to the top of the pot

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.039 
together and then to the top of the pot
itself<00:01:07.280> in<00:01:07.490> order<00:01:07.609> to<00:01:07.729> ground<00:01:08.149> that<00:01:08.630> switch

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
itself in order to ground that switch

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.920 
itself in order to ground that switch
now<00:01:10.039> for<00:01:10.250> capacitor<00:01:10.789> number<00:01:11.030> one<00:01:11.240> we're<00:01:11.840> gonna

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
now for capacitor number one we're gonna

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.039 
now for capacitor number one we're gonna
take<00:01:12.200> one<00:01:12.829> end<00:01:13.009> of<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.159> capacitor<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:13.789> go<00:01:13.939> to

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
take one end of the capacitor and go to

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.520 
take one end of the capacitor and go to
b3<00:01:15.049> on<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.679> switch<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:17.030> lug<00:01:17.359> l3<00:01:18.079> on<00:01:18.259> the

tone pot for capacitor number two we're

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.399 
tone pot for capacitor number two we're
gonna<00:01:21.079> go<00:01:21.259> from<00:01:21.500> a1<00:01:21.829> on<00:01:22.399> the<00:01:22.640> switch<00:01:22.909> to<00:01:23.479> lug<00:01:23.719> l3

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
gonna go from a1 on the switch to lug l3

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.679 
gonna go from a1 on the switch to lug l3
on<00:01:24.619> the<00:01:24.979> tone<00:01:25.189> pot<00:01:25.460> then<00:01:26.119> we're<00:01:26.329> done<00:01:26.479> now

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
on the tone pot then we're done now

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.660 
on the tone pot then we're done now
you've<00:01:27.380> got<00:01:27.560> an<00:01:27.679> ability<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.189> have<00:01:28.369> 2
