00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230
 and we're all in minecraft 1.7 point 2 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.030
 and let's see a good mod first let's go 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.490
 to see the village is protected to 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.230
 start that I do not know where it came from because 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.719
 this good map I do not know where it came from 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.220
 really but well now we will see it or 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.280
 be first here has carrots 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:28.610
 without carrot it 's all worth it and here's 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:31.860
 if by chance good iron sword 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.450
 it's pretty cool, it does not look like me 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.010
 that is very well very well done 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.370
 He returned to see you out of charge 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.090
 little things loaded everything is worth it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.300
 pretty good 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.670
 the question is the seeds are and the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.400
 coordinates are these let's stay 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.530
 still in one place at least 366 diet 71 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.550
 253 but well let's see let's see 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.050
 this gives it quite the same as I like it 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.710
 when I can see little things there for the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.690
 good background the question let's see this 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.380
 so he adds a machine that we 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.300
 lets buy and sell is a bit weird 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.180
 but you have found me in the ways 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.890
 most useful I 've seen in a long time 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.500
 You'll see the question we need to do 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.500
 first this book the sales catalog 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.570
 it would be something like that not that it is with leather one 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.770
 of gold one sell pearl and three of leaves 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.399
 of paper 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.770
 and then to be able to make the machine is 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.920
 to buy and sell that is with the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.590
 book this one of gold and all of iron and 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.569
 we make this machine also where where 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.250
 we look at the little things on top of the 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.630
 reality for example 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.700
 here over 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.400
 the question is that here good here as 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.370
 you see here I have money of all kinds of 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.260
 these from there 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.210
 it's weird because this for example is not a 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.110
 round number is that is the maximum of 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.760
 money actually are 729 coins this 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.610
 it could be a round number at least 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.230
 but the question is we get money 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.420
 selling things we are going to sell a 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.310
 pond ground for example good we 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.250
 they give very little twice we will see 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.220
 like this in when we how much do you give us 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.510
 three coins or it gives us very little 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.510
 but three moles for each 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.090
 clear gives us three coins for each 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.420
 well then it's not bad if we give it to 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.250
 sell we put it here so that 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.739
 collect the coins or we can not 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.340
 put here directly if we give it here 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.080
 AutomÃ³veis from here this tour 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.150
 if we give here this is saved 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.560
 we can automatically give the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.720
 beast 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.730
 piquet drake and tree there could already be a 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.250
 button to sell it all at once 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.560
 crown and if we want to buy things 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.540
 we have to have money here or like 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.690
 you see now more came out the more out what 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.130
 should buy better said and we can 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.630
 do anything for example if you already 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.720
 we have the money here we can put it 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.980
 here and that is accumulating 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.780
 to put everything 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.659
 and then we want to buy a diamond 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.840
 for example we can do if they give us 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.069
 4800 coins and well now I do not have 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.540
 enough as you see here there's no 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.970
 enough to be able to buy it so 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.640
 I'm going to sell it I have six thousand coins in 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.500
 total and now I have to be able to 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.970
 buy it then we are activated this 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.549
 option to buy and buy a 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.830
 diamond and commas is pretty cool 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.599
 man you need to have a first 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.239
 diamond for example if you want to buy 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:35.140
 diamond and not use it or anything to have it 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.790
 here only to be able to buy but this 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.280
 I found it super useful this is typical 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.920
 torrÃ³ uncle for example rest that always 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.319
 we end up full of remains give us 45 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.240
 each one 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.260
 if we were not to sell to teach crazy 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.490
 cali stop I say it is a super useful mod 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.310
 because it's not about diamond 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.810
 diamond you can find it and such but 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.320
 let's say for example that you're 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.630
 building something whatever it is a 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.870
 room so all quartz and you've 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.660
 gone without a body for example you have 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.930
 remained without quartz after being left without 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.000
 fourth and you can buy it the cost 128 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.880
 you can buy a few 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.310
 I'm really cool because if you stay 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.500
 without materials for example you can 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.090
 I did not like it. 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.190
 after the mod and the most useful thing that I have 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.420
 seen in a long time for example with the 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.300
 coal also that we always finish 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.340
 full of coal because they give us ten 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.870
 Moneditas for each one is very cool in 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.220
 the moment we do not want to have it 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.590
 here for whatever it is although I would leave it 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.680
 that saved if we give it here we do not 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.680
 They are giving us what they are creating 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.780
 well and the 3 magnetic ones that are left here 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.850
 although as I say, I prefer that 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.710
 I'm in there and the truth is cool 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.710
 quite more this and sell 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.080
 yes, it seems super ethical to me, above all 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.940
 when you've been around for a long time 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.130
 minecraft that you already have everything right and 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.830
 The rest is that I've seen that 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.740
 sells pretty well 45 for each one is 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.300
 cool but typical of when you play 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.030
 much in a world that you end up full of 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.889
 everything and then if you want to make a 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.380
 decoration or something like that you always lack 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.000
 something this way seems to me of most useful 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.040
 and we are going to buy 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.140
 before diamonds always cool 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.890
 have them but good as you see a way 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.060
 very simple but as I say the most 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.460
 subtle that I've seen 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.850
 super epic but good you have him and that 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.520
 the description is for 1.7 point 2 it 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.740
 install with forge etcetera the typical and 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.200
 I'm liza many sizes heap 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.200
 this is another chau 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.199
 ah
