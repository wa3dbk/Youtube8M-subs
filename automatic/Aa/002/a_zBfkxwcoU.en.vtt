 professional at all that's 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.720
 actually it's when I ask 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.230
 my son to school what that leads to 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.180

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.730
 but farmers are starting 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.440
 indeed it is rather we do 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.590
 rather the mouth of the agritourism of 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.800

 capon they were seen at the farm this is 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:18.739

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.630
 the difference between a farmer 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.250
 and a classic farmer restorer 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.160
 innkeepers it's not a restaurateur 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.260
