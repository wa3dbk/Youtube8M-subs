00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.379
 they are not here to have arrived 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.450
 commenting on it is a guide to achievement 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.549
 trophy awakens the white gazebo 2 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.469
 for the map of poor people could the 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.150
 instruction says in return use a 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.740
 Dora power in the first round without 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.259
 no one use the bank or locker 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.180
 weapons very well guys this achievement is very 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.980
 simple but at the same time very tedious 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.960
 intercede a lot of patience and five hundred 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.880
 as you know we are getting many 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.610
 points to be able to improve a weapon in the 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.500
 round 1 we can not give neither the bank nor the 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.680
 wardrobe very well how are you going to get 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.630
 these points of this and this good these 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.930
 points we will get thanks to billy 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.280
 that our friend is already the weapons of 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.410
 chalk that are on the walls 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.450
 very good with billy what we have to 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.490
 to do is like you know when you read bus or 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.680
 be the liquor goes crazy and can 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.420
 run and destroy barricades here the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.060
 trick is to get as far away as possible 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.040
 of the barricade and destroy by doing this 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.450
 The further away you are, the more points you 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.390
 they are going to give in the video they can see 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.430
 while I was getting very far away I put myself 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.340
 far from the barricade to win 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.650
 many ways this is advice you 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.810
 I recommend that you destroy first the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.090
 barricade from the gun shop where 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.860
 weapons are removed as 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.690
 they were going to be able to put the chalk weapons and 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.790
 you know that with each pizza gun that 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.400
 put in the question marks you 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.860
 they will give a thousand points and that is another trick 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.620
 to achieve this as well because as 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.460
 I said fast is that there are this I think that 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.930
 six chalk weapons and obviously six and 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.430
 two question marks right now no 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.619
 matter where you put them what matters 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.420
 is that you put them all because for each 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.280
 Weapon that you put will give you a thousand points 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.780
 and for the last face give two thousand 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.760
 points 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.770
 they were like this will be the trick is if on 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.140
 is to get as far as possible from 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.050
 the barricades to be able to press 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.410
 bilic and bilic or raid in this thousand points 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.900
 or more since as they will know here the bus does not 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.150
 the first bus is usually free good 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.490
 which is inside the cell 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.130
 weak and they give it to you 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.950
 is lucky the next point to be in 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.000
 the same room I recommend that 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.549
 prescribe in the game until the second 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.990
 bus get them inside the cell because 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.700
 if you are not going to have to kill zombies and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.550
 spend points and it's going to be a little bit more 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.290
 tedious and good I do not recommend that 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.750
 kill zombies in the video they will see that 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.519
 he killed zombies but it's because they were 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.769
 waiting and apart in each of the 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.660
 points at the end they will see that I was like this 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.180
 exact points to be able to improve for 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.590
 to be able to get the achievement but good another 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.030
 thing here in the video because they can be 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.489
 seeing right now that I'm building the 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.680
 team works and to which we need them 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.989
 to jump from one building to another to 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.970
 not having to open doors we're going to 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.580
 jump out of the building where then 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.319
 build the trampoline to the building where 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.870
 is the speed queue since there is 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.340
 find one of the chalk weapons or 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.459
 any of the interrogation symbols 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.560
 else there are I think there are seven 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.540
 u eight barricades in the video I think that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.650
 only destroyed seven the last barricade 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.370
 is 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.280
 the 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.080
 iphone is the water source that is 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.769
 located between the church and the mansion 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.569
 very well here this in achievement when 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.760
 go to enter the mansion I recommend 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.799
 which comprises a good weapon either a 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.690
 shotgun or an assault rifle what 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.360
 enough a good one since 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.150
 when you enter the ghosts you are going to 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.769
 begin to get to arrive arrive and by 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.769
 every touch that the ghost gives you is going to 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.659
 remove two thousand points since this one goes 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.400
 to remove 2000 points in the video how 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.829
 are going to see my top points right now but 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.510
 logo is that I had the necessary points 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.980
 to kill a zombie and recover what 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.440
 enough at the end I was left with a 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.890
 zombie but good if you want to take a chance 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.900
 will kill zombies that is your decision 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.329
 I get there once, if he fucked me all over 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.099
 It will end but good 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.260
 kids that went too fast for 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.180
 be an explanation well a summary very 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.829
 fast what they have to do the only thing 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.690
 what they need are the bus with Billy and 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.670
 the barricades and the weapons of chillÃ¡n 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.110
 and good to have a little bit of luck and 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.510
 coordination with control since 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.010
 while if you send bad billing this goes 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.500
 crash and you're going to lose those 1000 points 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.150
 that you used for the bus but good I hope 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.270
 that you have liked and served this is the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.770
 I use a like it would serve me a lot and inside 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.480
 from very little I will be going up more and more 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.740
 Porres videos since it's a lot of 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.210
 videos but good I hope you have 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.390
 liked take care 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.390
 bye
