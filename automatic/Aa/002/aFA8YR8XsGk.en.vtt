short impact map spondylus I thought was

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.710 
short impact map spondylus I thought was
really<00:00:20.609> really<00:00:20.820> fun<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> thought<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.420> was<00:00:21.510> good

yes and then we finally see them go at

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.939 
yes and then we finally see them go at
it<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> pay-per-view<00:00:26.580> main<00:00:26.880> event<00:00:27.240> on

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
it in the pay-per-view main event on

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.370 
it in the pay-per-view main event on
sacrifice<00:00:28.949> pay-per-view<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.960> yeah<00:00:30.960> like<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
sacrifice pay-per-view and yeah like I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.780 
sacrifice pay-per-view and yeah like I
said<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.650> has<00:00:31.800> been<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.980> dream<00:00:32.219> match<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.610> mind

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
said this has been a dream match in mind

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.049 
said this has been a dream match in mind
for<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> long<00:00:33.059> time<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.750> know<00:00:33.780> uh<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:35.040> think<00:00:35.790> if

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
for a long time you know uh I think if

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.389 
for a long time you know uh I think if
you<00:00:36.149> ask<00:00:36.329> anyone<00:00:36.750> over<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> last<00:00:37.620> year<00:00:37.890> last

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you ask anyone over the last year last

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.340 
you ask anyone over the last year last
decade<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.910> mean<00:00:39.180> what<00:00:39.750> what's<00:00:40.110> one<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.260> your

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
decade I mean what what's one of your

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.440 
decade I mean what what's one of your
top<00:00:40.590> three<00:00:40.890> matches<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.399> mean<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.670> think<00:00:41.700> RVD<00:00:42.420> and

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
top three matches I mean I think RVD and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.180 
top three matches I mean I think RVD and
AJ<00:00:42.809> Styles<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.290> probably<00:00:43.559> at<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> top<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:43.980> that

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
AJ Styles is probably at the top of that

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.350 
AJ Styles is probably at the top of that
list<00:00:44.370> without<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.239> doubt<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:47.090> you<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
list without a doubt and you know that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.610 
list without a doubt and you know that
they<00:00:48.480> finally<00:00:48.780> got<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> go<00:00:49.140> at<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
they finally got to go at it in a

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.369 
they finally got to go at it in a
pay-per-view<00:00:50.039> main<00:00:50.309> event<00:00:50.610> they<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.879> time

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
pay-per-view main event they got time

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.420 
pay-per-view main event they got time
you<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> mass<00:00:52.739> start<00:00:53.010> off<00:00:53.129> kind<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you know the mass start off kind of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.729 
you know the mass start off kind of
weird<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.820> phantom<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.600> doing<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> you

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
weird you know phantom was doing the you

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.810 
weird you know phantom was doing the you
know<00:00:55.860> back<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.340> Jerry<00:00:56.640> Lynn

know back there in the Jerry Lynn
matches<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.420> took<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.690> while<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:57.930> this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
matches you know I took a while for this

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.900 
matches you know I took a while for this
matches<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.680> kind<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.039> underway<00:00:59.399> Van<00:00:59.699> Dam

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
matches to kind of get underway Van Dam

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.849 
matches to kind of get underway Van Dam
did<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> lot<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> taunting<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.020> he<00:01:01.530> kept<00:01:01.739> on

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
did a lot of taunting and he kept on

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
did a lot of taunting and he kept on
doing<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.190> rpt<00:01:02.609> finger<00:01:03.030> thing<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.870> his

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
doing the rpt finger thing with his

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.320 
doing the rpt finger thing with his
thumbs<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.670> Flair<00:01:05.939> was<00:01:06.090> getting

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
thumbs and you know Flair was getting

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.060 
thumbs and you know Flair was getting
frustrated<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.080> Claire<00:01:07.290> actually<00:01:07.650> was<00:01:07.770> kicked

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
frustrated so Claire actually was kicked

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.920 
frustrated so Claire actually was kicked
out<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.520> match<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> flare<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.570> actually

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
out of the match and flare was actually

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.060 
out of the match and flare was actually
doing<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.320> commentary<00:01:12.500> for<00:01:13.500> most<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.920> match

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
doing a commentary for most of the match

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.510 
doing a commentary for most of the match
so<00:01:15.020> you<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.110> Van<00:01:16.320> Dam<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.590> AJ<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.100> know<00:01:17.340> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
so you know Van Dam and AJ you know that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.120 
so you know Van Dam and AJ you know that
the<00:01:17.820> chemistry<00:01:18.240> wasn't<00:01:18.450> amazing<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.229> probably

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the chemistry wasn't amazing I probably

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.649 
the chemistry wasn't amazing I probably
say<00:01:20.250> AJ<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.759> Daniel's<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.270> much<00:01:21.450> better

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
say AJ and Daniel's have much better

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.120 
say AJ and Daniel's have much better
chemistry<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.290> know<00:01:22.320> AJ<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.740> dangerous

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
chemistry you know AJ and dangerous

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.340 
chemistry you know AJ and dangerous
probably<00:01:23.340> work<00:01:23.490> much<00:01:23.820> more<00:01:24.030> fluid<00:01:24.299> type<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
probably work much more fluid type of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.260 
probably work much more fluid type of
mass<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.740> RVD<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.130> AJ<00:01:26.369> worked<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.000> know

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
mass and RVD and AJ worked here you know

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.609 
mass and RVD and AJ worked here you know
this<00:01:27.479> too<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.900> guess<00:01:28.110> they're<00:01:28.290> still<00:01:28.439> getting

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this too I guess they're still getting

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.410 
this too I guess they're still getting
used<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> each<00:01:28.979> other<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:29.909> Van<00:01:30.180> Dam

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
used to each other and you know Van Dam

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.899 
used to each other and you know Van Dam

type of dream match that I think you

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.850 
type of dream match that I think you
know<00:02:06.450> some<00:02:06.689> people<00:02:06.930> were<00:02:07.049> hoping<00:02:07.469> for<00:02:07.530> but<00:02:07.740> uh

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.839 
know some people were hoping for but uh
you<00:02:10.860> know<00:02:10.890> someone<00:02:11.220> made<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> good<00:02:11.550> play<00:02:11.670> I

you know someone made a good play I
think<00:02:12.569> maybe<00:02:12.810> if<00:02:12.989> aging<00:02:13.410> RVD

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
think maybe if aging RVD

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.740 
think maybe if aging RVD
worked<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.190> face-first<00:02:14.670> facematch<00:02:15.420> without

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
worked a face-first facematch without

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.839 
worked a face-first facematch without
any<00:02:15.930> store<00:02:16.260> lines<00:02:16.470> maybe<00:02:17.220> what<00:02:17.490> it<00:02:17.580> came<00:02:17.670> off<00:02:17.819> a

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
any store lines maybe what it came off a

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.000 
any store lines maybe what it came off a
little<00:02:18.030> bit<00:02:18.209> better<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:19.380> know<00:02:19.500> RVD

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
didn't have a problem with that but like

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.760 
didn't have a problem with that but like
I<00:06:43.550> said<00:06:43.610> RVD<00:06:44.150> and<00:06:44.180> AJ<00:06:44.600> was<00:06:44.900> fun<00:06:45.169> it's<00:06:45.470> a<00:06:45.560> solid

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
I said RVD and AJ was fun it's a solid

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.290 
I said RVD and AJ was fun it's a solid
four<00:06:46.100> star<00:06:46.340> match<00:06:46.520> I'm<00:06:46.820> not<00:06:46.910> going<00:06:47.090> to<00:06:47.180> say

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
four star match I'm not going to say

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.180 
four star match I'm not going to say
it's<00:06:47.690> one<00:06:47.900> of<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:48.080> top<00:06:48.320> ten<00:06:48.530> matches<00:06:48.680> of<00:06:48.979> year

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
it's one of the top ten matches of year

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.550 
it's one of the top ten matches of year
so<00:06:49.400> far<00:06:49.639> I<00:06:49.850> mean<00:06:50.389> I<00:06:50.419> was<00:06:50.570> expecting<00:06:50.900> that<00:06:51.169> to<00:06:51.440> be

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:51.560 
so far I mean I was expecting that to be

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.860 
so far I mean I was expecting that to be
the<00:06:51.710> case<00:06:51.800> but<00:06:52.310> uh<00:06:52.370> you<00:06:52.850> know<00:06:52.880> it's<00:06:53.479> still<00:06:53.630> but

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:53.870 
the case but uh you know it's still but

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.870 
the case but uh you know it's still but
it<00:06:53.960> was<00:06:54.050> still<00:06:54.259> worth<00:06:54.440> a<00:06:54.560> DVD<00:06:54.949> purchase<00:06:55.639> but

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
it was still worth a DVD purchase but

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.700 
it was still worth a DVD purchase but
it's<00:06:56.000> just<00:06:56.180> not<00:06:56.210> something<00:06:56.570> I<00:06:56.990> wouldn't

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
it's just not something I wouldn't

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.980 
it's just not something I wouldn't
really<00:06:57.830> order<00:06:58.190> the<00:06:58.310> replay<00:06:58.699> if<00:06:58.759> you<00:06:59.030> didn't

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
really order the replay if you didn't

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.090 
really order the replay if you didn't
have<00:07:00.110> the<00:07:00.169> chance<00:07:00.289> to<00:07:00.590> see<00:07:00.770> this<00:07:00.889> pay-per-view

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100 
have the chance to see this pay-per-view

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.249 
have the chance to see this pay-per-view
life<00:07:01.550> so<00:07:01.910> it's<00:07:02.449> pretty<00:07:02.570> much<00:07:02.750> my<00:07:02.900> thoughts<00:07:03.110> on

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.259
