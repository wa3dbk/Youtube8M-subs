works<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.560> guess<00:01:11.240> it's<00:01:12.240> different<00:01:12.420> from<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
works I guess it's different from a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.240 
works I guess it's different from a
normal<00:01:13.400> just<00:01:14.400> grassy<00:01:14.970> route<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.770> that<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
normal just grassy route and that the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070 
normal just grassy route and that the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
path is totally clear and you can just

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.020 
path is totally clear and you can just
go<00:01:19.470> past<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:20.130> into<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> grass<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:20.909> you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
go past when I go into the grass if you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.420

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
them to be honest but they were a nice

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.410 
them to be honest but they were a nice
diversion<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.810> think<00:02:21.350> from<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:22.180> standard<00:02:23.180> to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
diversion I think from the standard to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
diversion I think from the standard to
kill<00:02:23.720> things<00:02:23.959> a<00:02:24.170> lot<00:02:24.350> fair<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.430> game<00:02:25.700> and

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
kill things a lot fair of this game and

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.680 
kill things a lot fair of this game and
a<00:02:27.440> nice<00:02:28.370> opportunity<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.970> do<00:02:29.120> something<00:02:29.360> other

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
a nice opportunity to do something other

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260

there's<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.060> reason<00:03:51.450> for<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> grass<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.110> look

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
there's a reason for the grass to look

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.710 
there's a reason for the grass to look
like<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.709> pokeball<00:03:53.190> but<00:03:54.090> it's<00:03:54.209> still<00:03:54.330> grassy

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
like a pokeball but it's still grassy

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.479 
like a pokeball but it's still grassy
and<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.900> looks<00:03:55.050> nice<00:03:56.150> if<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.300> were<00:03:57.420> not<00:03:57.600> aware

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
and it looks nice if you were not aware

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.120 
and it looks nice if you were not aware
somehow<00:03:59.510> the<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.870> grass<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.709> base<00:04:01.860> of<00:04:02.010> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
somehow the the grass the base of the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.620 
somehow the the grass the base of the
overall<00:04:02.400> arrangement<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.030> national<00:04:03.420> park

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
overall arrangement of the national park

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.150 
overall arrangement of the national park
looks<00:04:03.870> like<00:04:04.019> a<00:04:04.050> pokeball<00:04:04.530> when<00:04:04.800> looked<00:04:05.010> at

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
looks like a pokeball when looked at

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.030 
looks like a pokeball when looked at
from<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.760> bird's<00:04:06.600> eye<00:04:06.780> view<00:04:06.890> which<00:04:07.890> is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
from the bird's eye view which is

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.070 
from the bird's eye view which is
thematically<00:04:08.550> fitting<00:04:09.000> because<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.959> know

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
thematically fitting because you know

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.600 
thematically fitting because you know
Whitney<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.410> Jim<00:04:10.709> looks<00:04:10.950> like<00:04:11.100> a<00:04:11.130> clefairy

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
Whitney is Jim looks like a clefairy

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.259 
Whitney is Jim looks like a clefairy
from<00:04:11.970> bird's<00:04:12.180> eye<00:04:12.360> view<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.550> they're<00:04:14.550> like

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
from bird's eye view and so they're like

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.140 
from bird's eye view and so they're like
probably<00:04:15.510> had<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.750> same<00:04:15.959> architect<00:04:16.530> or

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
probably had the same architect or

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.289 
probably had the same architect or
something<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.299> don't<00:04:18.359> know<00:04:19.519> but<00:04:20.519> he<00:04:20.970> has<00:04:21.090> some

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
something I don't know but he has some

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.740 
something I don't know but he has some
trainers<00:04:21.510> are<00:04:21.930> not<00:04:22.109> too<00:04:22.229> difficult<00:04:22.490> I<00:04:23.750> think

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
trainers are not too difficult I think

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.420 
trainers are not too difficult I think
they<00:04:25.050> might<00:04:25.260> have<00:04:25.290> had<00:04:25.470> their<00:04:25.650> levels<00:04:26.190> raised

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
they might have had their levels raised

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.870 
they might have had their levels raised
a<00:04:26.580> little<00:04:26.789> bit<00:04:26.940> in<00:04:27.150> our<00:04:27.660> gold<00:04:27.900> silver<00:04:28.760> but<00:04:29.760> not

a little bit in our gold silver but not

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.900 
a little bit in our gold silver but not
that<00:04:30.030> much<00:04:30.350> soul<00:04:31.350> silver<00:04:31.530> those<00:04:32.340> guys<00:04:32.580> really

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
that much soul silver those guys really

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.380 
that much soul silver those guys really
did<00:04:33.060> not<00:04:33.270> fix<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.260> whole<00:04:34.410> level<00:04:34.650> curve

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
did not fix the whole level curve

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.440 
did not fix the whole level curve
problem<00:04:36.390> in<00:04:36.600> this<00:04:36.720> game<00:04:36.990> i<00:04:37.289> would<00:04:37.410> say<00:04:38.450> anyway

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
problem in this game i would say anyway

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.270 
problem in this game i would say anyway
something<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.020> strikes<00:04:40.860> missile

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
something that strikes missile

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.550 
something that strikes missile
interesting<00:04:41.940> is<00:04:42.479> that<00:04:42.539> there<00:04:43.020> are<00:04:43.080> graphics

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
interesting is that there are graphics

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.080 
interesting is that there are graphics
in<00:04:43.770> the<00:04:43.890> national<00:04:44.250> park<00:04:44.460> but<00:04:44.640> really<00:04:44.970> are<00:04:45.060> just

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
in the national park but really are just

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.020 
in the national park but really are just
not<00:04:45.300> used<00:04:45.770> anywhere<00:04:46.770> else<00:04:47.100> in<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.370> game<00:04:47.580> those

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
not used anywhere else in the game those

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.110 
not used anywhere else in the game those
trees<00:04:48.360> off<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.810> side<00:04:49.050> and<00:04:49.500> see<00:04:49.740> those<00:04:50.120> the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
trees off to the side and see those the

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.510 
trees off to the side and see those the
likes<00:04:51.360> trees<00:04:51.840> you'd<00:04:52.050> find<00:04:52.289> in<00:04:52.440> africa<00:04:53.370> or

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
likes trees you'd find in africa or

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.219 
likes trees you'd find in africa or
something<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.060> don't<00:04:54.120> know<00:04:54.270> very<00:04:54.870> different

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
something I don't know very different

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.700 
something I don't know very different
from<00:04:55.410> like<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.890> evergreens<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:56.520> see<00:04:56.669> here

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
from like the evergreens you see here

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.140 
from like the evergreens you see here
and<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:59.130> strange<00:04:59.400> to<00:04:59.460> have<00:04:59.640> them<00:04:59.820> right<00:04:59.970> next

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
and it's strange to have them right next

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.450 
and it's strange to have them right next
to<00:05:00.330> each<00:05:00.450> other<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:00.950> I'm<00:05:01.950> not<00:05:02.130> sure<00:05:02.160> how<00:05:02.430> I

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
to each other and I'm not sure how I

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.040 
to each other and I'm not sure how I
feel<00:05:02.700> about<00:05:02.760> that<00:05:03.120> and<00:05:03.270> then<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:03.840> thick

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
feel about that and then that thick

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.990 
feel about that and then that thick
grass<00:05:04.350> is<00:05:04.710> also<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.160> believe<00:05:05.370> not<00:05:05.700> used

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
grass is also I believe not used

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.050 
grass is also I believe not used
anywhere<00:05:06.479> else<00:05:06.810> in<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.200> game<00:05:07.940> so<00:05:08.940> it's

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
anywhere else in the game so it's

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.870 
anywhere else in the game so it's
interesting<00:05:09.620> and<00:05:10.620> then<00:05:10.770> the<00:05:10.979> secondary

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
interesting and then the secondary

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.090 
interesting and then the secondary
purpose<00:05:12.330> of<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:12.630> National<00:05:13.020> Park<00:05:13.289> is<00:05:13.500> for<00:05:13.860> bug

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
purpose of the National Park is for bug

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.680 
purpose of the National Park is for bug

overall level I think its Ivy's might
come<00:05:30.070> into<00:05:30.190> play<00:05:31.230> but<00:05:32.230> it's<00:05:32.650> cool<00:05:32.890> it's<00:05:33.180> it

was having with BP problems at this

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.650 
was having with BP problems at this
point<00:05:58.890> up<00:05:59.890> until<00:06:00.190> we<00:06:00.460> get<00:06:00.580> to<00:06:00.730> the<00:06:00.760> junction

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660

which<00:06:06.130> I<00:06:06.220> like<00:06:06.430> you<00:06:06.820> know<00:06:06.910> you<00:06:06.970> go<00:06:07.210> off<00:06:07.360> on<00:06:07.390> a

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
which I like you know you go off on a

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.140 
which I like you know you go off on a
little<00:06:07.750> loop<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:09.490> first<00:06:09.730> section<00:06:09.880> of<00:06:10.030> the

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
little loop the first section of the

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.400 
little loop the first section of the
game<00:06:10.300> and<00:06:10.510> then<00:06:10.600> you<00:06:10.750> clear<00:06:11.200> out<00:06:11.230> that

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
game and then you clear out that

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.100 
game and then you clear out that
roadblock<00:06:11.770> and<00:06:12.280> makes<00:06:13.000> navigation<00:06:13.450> for<00:06:14.020> the

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
roadblock and makes navigation for the

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.590 
roadblock and makes navigation for the
rest<00:06:14.290> of<00:06:14.380> the<00:06:14.470> game<00:06:14.590> a<00:06:14.620> lot<00:06:14.770> easier<00:06:15.180> they<00:06:16.180> reuse

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
rest of the game a lot easier they reuse

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.570 
rest of the game a lot easier they reuse
that<00:06:16.780> idea<00:06:17.110> and<00:06:17.200> fourth<00:06:17.500> generation<00:06:18.070> with<00:06:18.400> the

that idea and fourth generation with the

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.930 
that idea and fourth generation with the
route<00:06:19.000> just<00:06:19.300> north<00:06:19.480> or<00:06:19.750> berg<00:06:20.550> but<00:06:21.550> anyway

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
route just north or berg but anyway

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.690 
route just north or berg but anyway
that's<00:06:22.420> it'll<00:06:22.750> blow<00:06:22.870> up<00:06:23.020> there<00:06:23.380> and<00:06:23.560> i<00:06:24.370> will
