is<00:01:20.149> not<00:01:20.240> very<00:01:20.300> deep<00:01:20.570> here<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:21.229> I'm<00:01:22.100> guessing

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
is not very deep here and I'm guessing

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.980 
is not very deep here and I'm guessing
them<00:01:22.610> throwing<00:01:22.850> into<00:01:23.149> about<00:01:23.300> six<00:01:23.360> feet<00:01:23.810> of

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
them throwing into about six feet of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.529 
them throwing into about six feet of
water<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.560> as<00:01:25.310> you<00:01:25.460> can<00:01:25.550> see<00:01:25.789> it's<00:01:25.970> very<00:01:26.000> calm

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
water and as you can see it's very calm

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.870 
water and as you can see it's very calm
so<00:01:27.050> you<00:01:27.860> know<00:01:27.979> these<00:01:28.100> can<00:01:28.310> be<00:01:28.399> challenging

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
so you know these can be challenging

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.570 
so you know these can be challenging

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.969 
relatively shallow and income I'm going
with<00:01:37.250> a<00:01:37.280> three-quarter<00:01:37.940> ounce<00:01:37.970> bottle<00:01:38.630> and

with a three-quarter ounce bottle and

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.590 
with a three-quarter ounce bottle and
it's<00:01:39.979> actually<00:01:40.459> one<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.640> my<00:01:40.729> home<00:01:41.030> aids<00:01:41.300> which

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
it's actually one of my home aids which

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.040 
it's actually one of my home aids which
I<00:01:41.840> put<00:01:42.170> hackle<00:01:43.069> feathers<00:01:43.399> on<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.600> hook<00:01:44.780> shank

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
I put hackle feathers on the hook shank

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.020 
I put hackle feathers on the hook shank
and<00:01:45.350> that<00:01:45.619> bulks<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.250> out<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.399> little<00:01:46.580> bit<00:01:46.819> so

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
and that bulks it out a little bit so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.870 
and that bulks it out a little bit so
it's<00:01:47.179> even<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.780> little<00:01:48.410> bit<00:01:48.679> more<00:01:49.220> of<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.399> bulky

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
it's even a little bit more of a bulky

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.090 
it's even a little bit more of a bulky
3/4<00:01:50.630> ounce<00:01:50.780> bottle<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:51.619> would<00:01:51.740> normally

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
3/4 ounce bottle and you would normally

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.279 
3/4 ounce bottle and you would normally
get<00:01:52.220> in<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:52.399> store<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.929> is<00:01:54.080> pretty

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
get in the store and this is pretty

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.529 
get in the store and this is pretty
important<00:01:54.740> because<00:01:54.800> that<00:01:55.250> bulk<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:56.090> cuts<00:01:56.390> down

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
important because that bulk it cuts down

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.900 
important because that bulk it cuts down
on<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.780> casting<00:01:57.259> distance<00:01:57.709> but<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.429> enables

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
on the casting distance but it enables

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.120 
on the casting distance but it enables
the<00:01:59.119> bucktail<00:01:59.630> to<00:02:00.020> ride<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.500> little<00:02:00.709> bit<00:02:00.860> higher

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
the bucktail to ride a little bit higher

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.800 
the bucktail to ride a little bit higher
in<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.310> water<00:02:01.550> column<00:02:01.910> on<00:02:02.300> the<00:02:02.509> slow<00:02:02.750> to

pork rind and that's a strip that I use
quite<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.540> bit<00:02:40.629> but<00:02:41.500> if<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.680> went<00:02:41.829> up<00:02:41.889> to<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:42.069> number

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
quite a bit but if I went up to a number

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.459 
quite a bit but if I went up to a number
70<00:02:42.819> which<00:02:42.969> is<00:02:43.120> just<00:02:43.689> a<00:02:43.810> little<00:02:44.049> bit<00:02:44.200> bigger

just want to get everything back in
order<00:03:19.900> before<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.409> make<00:03:20.560> another<00:03:20.769> cast<00:03:22.049> this<00:03:23.049> is

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
order before I make another cast this is

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.839 
order before I make another cast this is

the<00:03:25.060> tsunami<00:03:25.449> Sandile<00:03:26.079> video<00:03:26.379> on<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:26.889> a

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
the tsunami Sandile video on and a

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.860 
the tsunami Sandile video on and a
couple<00:03:27.370> people<00:03:27.609> had<00:03:27.819> asked<00:03:28.090> me<00:03:28.209> how<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.540> would

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
couple people had asked me how I would

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.930 
couple people had asked me how I would
work<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.409> buck<00:03:29.590> tail<00:03:29.829> in<00:03:29.979> this<00:03:30.099> area<00:03:30.489> so<00:03:30.699> I

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
work a buck tail in this area so I

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.009 
work a buck tail in this area so I
figured<00:03:31.419> I'd<00:03:31.510> put<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:32.109> video<00:03:32.290> together<00:03:32.709> and

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
figured I'd put this video together and

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.839 
figured I'd put this video together and
you<00:03:35.019> can<00:03:35.169> see<00:03:35.379> I've<00:03:35.650> actually<00:03:36.220> quite<00:03:36.549> similar

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
you can see I've actually quite similar

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.119 
you can see I've actually quite similar
conditions<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.199> video<00:03:38.409> if<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:38.769> happen

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
conditions to that video if you happen

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.979 
conditions to that video if you happen
to<00:03:39.159> see<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.549> except<00:03:39.909> that<00:03:40.060> day<00:03:40.299> was<00:03:40.479> overcast

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
to see it except that day was overcast

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
think if I'd had more time I correctable

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:52.119

pretty<00:05:23.280> good<00:05:23.430> score
