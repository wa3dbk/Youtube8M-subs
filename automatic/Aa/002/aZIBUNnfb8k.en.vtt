00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hey guys welcome back to part two on how

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.340 
hey guys welcome back to part two on how
to<00:00:02.639> build<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.970> layout<00:00:03.270> from<00:00:03.870> start<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.319> finish

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
to build a layout from start to finish

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.099 
to build a layout from start to finish
now<00:00:05.069> we<00:00:05.130> went<00:00:05.400> over<00:00:05.580> bench<00:00:05.850> work<00:00:06.120> we<00:00:06.690> went<00:00:06.839> over

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
now we went over bench work we went over

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.780 
now we went over bench work we went over
getting<00:00:07.350> your<00:00:07.500> foam<00:00:07.740> board<00:00:07.770> if<00:00:08.220> you<00:00:08.340> decide<00:00:08.670> to

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
getting your foam board if you decide to

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.120 
getting your foam board if you decide to
go<00:00:08.910> with<00:00:09.090> that<00:00:09.240> now<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.320> simplest<00:00:10.710> part<00:00:11.010> of

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
go with that now the simplest part of

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.070 
go with that now the simplest part of
this<00:00:11.219> whole<00:00:11.400> process<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:12.150> hearing<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.900> foam

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
this whole process is hearing the foam

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.289 
this whole process is hearing the foam
board<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:13.920> layout<00:00:14.130> now<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.150> that

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
board to your layout now to do that

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.670 
board to your layout now to do that
there's<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.630> few<00:00:15.839> different<00:00:16.170> ways

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
there's a few different ways

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.830 
there's a few different ways
I<00:00:16.710> recommend<00:00:17.640> liquid<00:00:17.970> nails<00:00:18.210> if<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.570> want<00:00:18.779> to

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
I recommend liquid nails if you want to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.450 
I recommend liquid nails if you want to
real<00:00:19.020> firm<00:00:19.500> something<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.220> can't

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
real firm something that you can't

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.130 
real firm something that you can't
really<00:00:20.670> ever<00:00:20.910> get<00:00:21.150> up<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.779> make<00:00:22.020> sure

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
really ever get up just make sure

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.220 
really ever get up just make sure
whatever<00:00:22.350> you<00:00:22.619> buy<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.160> absolutely<00:00:24.029> foam<00:00:24.900> safe

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
whatever you buy is absolutely foam safe

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.779 
whatever you buy is absolutely foam safe
because<00:00:25.590> if<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.859> get<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> wrong<00:00:26.220> stuff<00:00:26.580> it

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
because if you get the wrong stuff it

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.130 
because if you get the wrong stuff it
will<00:00:26.880> melt<00:00:27.119> right<00:00:27.300> through<00:00:27.359> your<00:00:27.570> foam<00:00:27.840> and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
will melt right through your foam and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.279 
will melt right through your foam and
destroy<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.970> amount<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.660> money<00:00:30.869> you've<00:00:31.050> put

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
destroy the amount of money you've put

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.470 
destroy the amount of money you've put
into<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.740> foam<00:00:31.980> like<00:00:32.489> I've<00:00:32.669> already<00:00:32.969> learned

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
into the foam like I've already learned

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.600 
into the foam like I've already learned
by<00:00:33.840> buying<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.649> wrong<00:00:34.829> type<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.100> foam<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.579> can

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
by buying the wrong type of foam you can

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.850 
by buying the wrong type of foam you can
start<00:00:36.000> losing<00:00:36.180> money<00:00:36.450> quickly<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.590> with<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
start losing money quickly so with that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.619 
start losing money quickly so with that
said<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.340> got<00:00:38.489> our<00:00:38.610> foam<00:00:38.790> already<00:00:39.090> cut<00:00:39.300> out<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
said we got our foam already cut out to

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.930 
said we got our foam already cut out to
this<00:00:39.750> module<00:00:39.989> here<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.460> we're<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
this module here so we're just going to

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.060 
this module here so we're just going to
lift<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.420> I've<00:00:42.899> got<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.379> stuff<00:00:43.739> called

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
lift it up I've got this stuff called

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.880 
lift it up I've got this stuff called
Loctite<00:00:44.670> spray<00:00:45.270> adhesive<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.530> general

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
Loctite spray adhesive it's general

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.529 
Loctite spray adhesive it's general
performance<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.610> lightweight<00:00:47.879> bonding

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
performance it's lightweight bonding

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.810 
performance it's lightweight bonding
because<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> do<00:00:49.500> want<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> possibly<00:00:50.340> take<00:00:50.640> this

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
because I do want to possibly take this

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.549 
because I do want to possibly take this
apart<00:00:51.180> without<00:00:51.360> ripping<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.960> foam<00:00:52.140> apart

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
apart without ripping the foam apart

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.040 
apart without ripping the foam apart
later<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.699> picked<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.690> did<00:00:54.870> make

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
later so I picked this up and I did make

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.510 
later so I picked this up and I did make
sure<00:00:55.079> when<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> pick<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.829> up<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:56.219> local

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
sure when I pick this up with my local

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.049 
sure when I pick this up with my local
home<00:00:57.329> depot<00:00:57.360> lowes<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.129> was<00:00:59.280> paper<00:00:59.489> and

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
home depot lowes that it was paper and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.349 
home depot lowes that it was paper and
foam<00:01:00.629> safe<00:01:01.550> basically<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.730> foam<00:01:02.940> safe<00:01:03.180> will

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
foam safe basically that foam safe will

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
foam safe basically that foam safe will
keep<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.660> from<00:01:03.809> melting<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.680> all<00:01:04.799> we're<00:01:04.949> doing

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
keep it from melting but all we're doing

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.770 
keep it from melting but all we're doing
here<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:06.000> simply<00:01:06.210> spraying<00:01:07.460> this<00:01:08.840> down<00:01:09.840> here

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
here is simply spraying this down here

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.930 
here is simply spraying this down here
concentrating<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> corners

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.590 

and<00:01:19.940> then<00:01:20.450> we're<00:01:20.630> going<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.840> place<00:01:21.080> it<00:01:21.290> down

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
and then we're going to place it down

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.060 
and then we're going to place it down
here<00:01:23.600> make<00:01:24.320> sure<00:01:24.500> it's<00:01:24.650> lined<00:01:24.920> up<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:26.600> then

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
here make sure it's lined up and then

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.460 
here make sure it's lined up and then
kinda<00:01:28.070> press<00:01:28.370> you<00:01:29.120> put<00:01:29.330> something<00:01:29.750> somewhat

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
kinda press you put something somewhat

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.620 
kinda press you put something somewhat
heavy<00:01:30.680> on<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.550> four<00:01:31.730> corners<00:01:32.180> you<00:01:32.420> want<00:01:32.510> to

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
heavy on the four corners you want to

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.240 
heavy on the four corners you want to
focus<00:01:32.810> on<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.260> corners<00:01:33.680> because<00:01:33.860> those<00:01:34.100> are

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
focus on the corners because those are

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.710 
focus on the corners because those are
kind<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:34.490> like<00:01:34.760> you're<00:01:34.910> bonding<00:01:35.090> points

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
kind of like you're bonding points

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.720 
kind of like you're bonding points
especially<00:01:36.560> for<00:01:37.010> something<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.430> don't<00:01:37.580> want

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
especially for something you don't want

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.820 
especially for something you don't want
bonding<00:01:38.180> super<00:01:38.570> well<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.020> know<00:01:39.200> something

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
bonding super well you know something

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.170 
bonding super well you know something
you<00:01:40.040> could<00:01:40.190> pull<00:01:40.340> up<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.640> could<00:01:40.760> pull<00:01:40.940> up<00:01:40.970> from

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
you could pull up you could pull up from

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.240 
you could pull up you could pull up from
the<00:01:41.300> center<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.140> that's<00:01:42.260> it<00:01:42.530> that's<00:01:42.740> how<00:01:42.950> we<00:01:43.010> do

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
the center so that's it that's how we do

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.700 
the center so that's it that's how we do
that<00:01:43.400> it's<00:01:43.700> simplest<00:01:44.180> part<00:01:44.450> look<00:01:45.320> for<00:01:45.530> more

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
that it's simplest part look for more

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.500 
that it's simplest part look for more
complex<00:01:46.190> things<00:01:46.520> in<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.790> future<00:01:46.970> such<00:01:47.480> as

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
complex things in the future such as

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.170 
complex things in the future such as
we're<00:01:48.410> going<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.560> be<00:01:48.650> doing<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:49.130> core<00:01:49.940> board

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
we're going to be doing the core board

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.320
