00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello and welcome to the video channel 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.500
 of the blog my child draws today 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.870
 I would like to introduce the 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.090
 realization of another piñata bar babel 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.349
 you know maybe I'm trying 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.890
 to organize a party 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.630
 birthday for a little around the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.180
 cotton candy theme since he loves 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.820
 the barbapapa with my great who in 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.400
 six years we secretly manufactured 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.800
 a worthy to art babel tarbes I would like 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.410
 show you how we realized 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.590
 our piñata using flour 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.989
 of water that cut newspaper into 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.989
 strip of white acrylic paint 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.559
 and black red gouache paint 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.090
 or blue and white inflated balloons 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.750
 a measuring cap of liquid laundry 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.510
 of the strong adhesive tape a pair of 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.270
 scissors of the string a simple string 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.100
 of several kitchen brush to their 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.760
 offshore spending and brake brushes 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.739
 and Nicole iron for finishing for 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.369
 build bar babel we used 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.100
 a measuring cap of laundry for the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.490
 chinon a hot balloon inflate me for 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.340
 the head and a big inflated balloon for 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.340
 the body a ray note that the body of 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.799
 ben barka beautiful safin down so 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.100
 we left the opening of the balloon 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.869
 at the bottom since the balloons have a shape 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.060
 which is refined slightly towards the opening 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.220
 to attach all the elements we 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.350
 used strong tape 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.430
 found in the stores of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.189
 DIY for buildings we have a fact 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.040
 mixture of two parts of flour and one 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.049
 from at we cut strips 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.579
 of newsprint and we have them 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.970
 dipped in flour 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.759
 then we sank the bands on 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.390
 our construction by superimposing them 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.210
 several thousands 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.280
 we waited 24 hours to dry 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.740
 the paper mache figurine 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.870
 once the figurine dries well we 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.530
 laid a second layer of paper 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.600
 chewed up 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.600
 crossing the bands so if the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.759
 first layer was done with 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.230
 vertical stripes and must for the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.580
 second race we made some 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.680
 horizontal stripes 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.190
 then we waited again 24 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.740
 hours and we laid the last 3rd 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.209
 crossed layers of paper strips 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.580
 chewed up 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.910
 once the figure is well dried we 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.510
 have cut out the need like those we 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.780
 filled the confectionery figurine 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.030
 then the adult pierced the lid at 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:44.320
 two places to spend a string of 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:48.080
 cook in and do a tight 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.110
 then the child to reposition the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.330
 cover and hold it up when 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.720
 the adult to use tape 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.810
 to reattach the lid in its place 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.060
 we have also set other 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.980
 extra strings on our daughter 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.959
 of the world who will go more easily 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.760
 they will not pass 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.950
 the figurine of bach babel it is necessary to pass 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.380
 a string in the upper part of the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.840
 piñata to be able to the task and on a 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.360
 tree or another we did a 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.370
 hole on each side of the barcap head 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.400
 she with a pair of scissors pia point 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.799
 of view we have set an official on 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.760
 a loved one like this with a little 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.220
 piece of the band at desire 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.650
 then we spent the pin with 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.560
 the string through the holes and we could 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.049
 tie a knot on it and do so a 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.930
 loop to be able to tie our 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.060
 piñata once the piñata built 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.459
 we have it suspended on a 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.920
 hook we made a mixture of 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.920
 red paint to blue and white for 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.680
 get a color to death which is the 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.950
 color of bach babel the child reaches 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.019
 by babel with a wide brush in 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.859
 being careful to cover all 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:08.799
 the sides once the paint dries 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:12.639
 the child can draw the face have 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.859
 sure enough otherwise it's the adult who will 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.280
 do this work so we make two eyes 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:21.370
 in a circle shape that are divided into 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.760
 two and a very simple mouth two 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.289
 small dots for the child 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.210
 the adult applies paint 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:32.830
 white acrylic on half 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:36.340
 lower eyes then half 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:40.030
 upper eye will be open with 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.490
 pink orange beige paint 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.389
 we can also paint the necklace 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:49.349
 pearls in white mouth and centers 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.090
 flowers around chinon barbarism 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:54.220
 when the paint dries it is the 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.110
 all the flower petals we will have 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.789
 use yellow white but you 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.940
 can use another color well 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:03.910
 it is then it's enough work 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.910
 difficult to outline in 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.410
 black with a ps or very fine so he 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.479
 must outline around 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.539
 flowers around the petals around the 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.849
 eyes to redraw the mouth the 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:19.570
 necklace must of course not bhl and the 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.230
 eyelashes and also draw the arms of 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.110
 marble 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.780
 she and here is our pinata and done 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.390
 we had a coat of varnish 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.240
 glues from above when the paint has 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:34.060
 been dry for a more 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.490
 brilliant and to give improve the 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.500
 resistance of painting on paper 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.840
 chewed up 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.490
