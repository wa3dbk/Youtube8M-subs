00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 For some reason I can stop with 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.770
 any series from this channel - easter eggs 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.110
 I feel really good doing this guy. 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.000
 and it was even better when I 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.769
 I see your feedback is 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.839

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.270

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.070

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.949

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.359

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.609
 from master face 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.219

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.430

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.200

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.430

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.820

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.019
 and beginning with just released the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.260
 witcher 3 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.720
 two good references so let's go 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.149
 the first in a game graveyard you 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.920
 you find two statues and if you 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.220
 distract the province seconds them 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.140
 They start to move out of nowhere. 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.049
 attack you stay calm 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.299
 need not be afraid but for those who have 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:22.490
 fear of sharjah and some heat and latex 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:42.380
 fucking my london this is going to scare 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:44.240
 A lot of people almost forgot to mention that 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.700
 these state-owned enterprises are 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.700
 universe of doctor series some 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.600
 in the game you also find a 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.760
 reference to the paguim sou frony and it is 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.260
 of a body thrown to the ground in a place 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.260
 that looks like a prison 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.040
 Now tell me the comments there if this 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:25.650
 does not refer to it there and gas in 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.650
 few turns 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.810
 Fuck not and now we go with Donkey Kong. 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.690
 tropical freeze that game has an easter 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.920
 eggs are pretty cool and nostalgic too 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.920
 so come on 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.379
 at that time the game when you 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.719
 break the plane and go back inside 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.299
 there you will have a surprise televisions 

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.200
 with former donkey kong titles go 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.010
 appear 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.010
 look what the fuck 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.930
 at the end of one of the phases of the game you 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.349
 find the donkey kong side version 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.299
 1981 arcade 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.319
 Look who out he'll be there in the 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.319
 giant fund 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.280
 now the arm of nostalgia goes until 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.959
 shaking hand binds at a game site 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.790
 secret of course you find a box 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.599
 sound a radiola just like my grandmother 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.110
 say 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.599
 and there you hear old nostalgic songs 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.510
 from previous series games and 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.650
 I could listen to this for hours. 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.650
 hand binds 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.809
 If you 're from this season, surely you 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.519
 You're going to spend a lot of time listening there. 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:37.519
 Because the shit is so fucking good. 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.509
 I always say that they are interested show 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.539
 part in any game of rockstar pro 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.759
 she then telex games and does with 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.610
 that the players stick together in the game 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.229
 even after you have 100% done it 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.819
 you never know what she can have 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.460
 hidden there, right? 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:03.759
 and this developer years bf radilla 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.129
 to get on this wave and not only 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:08.319
 for putting in easter egg in this game until 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.059
 even because they already did it in the 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.999
 previous series games 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:14.770
 but for innovating in the concept easter egg 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:16.930

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.740

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.740

 The old man, this sucks. 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.490

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.920

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.220
 easter eggs to see you have 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:41.030

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.460

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.830
