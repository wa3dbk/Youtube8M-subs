male bodybuilders do not use it female

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.169 
male bodybuilders do not use it female
bodybuilders<00:02:09.190> would<00:02:09.310> probably<00:02:09.729> cut<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.060> out

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179

now<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.650> think<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.160> meant<00:02:12.400> 19<00:02:13.180> noir<00:02:13.480> compounds

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
now I think you meant 19 noir compounds

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.030 
now I think you meant 19 noir compounds

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
that's the only anabolic steroid proven

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.690 
that's the only anabolic steroid proven

and it is classified as an androgen and
then<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.959> mentioned<00:02:32.080> DHT<00:02:32.890> well<00:02:33.310> DHT<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:33.910> all

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
then you mentioned DHT well DHT and all

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
then you mentioned DHT well DHT and all
of<00:02:34.209> its<00:02:34.360> derivatives<00:02:34.630> or<00:02:35.200> androgens<00:02:35.650> also<00:02:37.110> so

Boston<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.800> need<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:38.980> quit<00:02:39.130> using<00:02:39.459> gear<00:02:39.640> if

Boston you need to quit using gear if
that<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.120> honestly<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:41.230> way<00:02:41.380> you're

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
that is honestly the way you're

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.470 
that is honestly the way you're
classifying<00:02:42.220> gear<00:02:42.520> you<00:02:42.730> use<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:43.150> words<00:02:43.360> that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
classifying gear you use the words that

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.910 
classifying gear you use the words that
you<00:02:43.690> use<00:02:43.720> there<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.349> know<00:02:44.470> fuck-all<00:02:44.860> about

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
you use there you know fuck-all about

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.620 
you use there you know fuck-all about

that's<00:02:47.590> probably<00:02:47.860> why<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.040> fuck<00:02:48.340> your<00:02:48.490> arm<00:02:48.670> up

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.809 

then<00:02:52.510> we<00:02:52.780> get<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.230> issue<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.130> blatant

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
then we get to the issue of the blatant

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.320 
then we get to the issue of the blatant
racism<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.920> which<00:03:00.069> he<00:03:00.250> went<00:03:00.459> on<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.849> say<00:03:01.090> as<00:03:01.300> a
