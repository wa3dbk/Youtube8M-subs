what I call the X peace hi grid schedule
now<00:00:12.480> what's<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.750> hybrid<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.230> hybrid<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.740> when<00:00:13.920> you

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
now what's a hybrid a hybrid is when you

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.770 
now what's a hybrid a hybrid is when you
take<00:00:14.190> two<00:00:14.429> different<00:00:14.820> programs<00:00:15.000> usually<00:00:15.509> you

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
take two different programs usually you

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.939 
take two different programs usually you
mix<00:00:15.929> them<00:00:16.020> together<00:00:16.139> within<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.680> same

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
mix them together within the same

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.769 
mix them together within the same
workout<00:00:17.340> week<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:18.000> create<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> program<00:00:18.630> that

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
workout week to create a program that

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.300 
workout week to create a program that
works<00:00:19.140> with<00:00:19.320> them<00:00:19.439> better<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.070> for<00:00:20.279> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
works with them better for you for a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.340 
works with them better for you for a
particular<00:00:20.460> reason<00:00:20.970> now<00:00:21.930> unlike<00:00:22.289> a

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
particular reason now unlike a

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.439 
particular reason now unlike a
traditional<00:00:22.740> hybrid<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.640> more<00:00:23.820> like<00:00:24.000> moving

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
traditional hybrid it's more like moving

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.490 
traditional hybrid it's more like moving
in<00:00:24.600> two<00:00:24.750> phases

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
in two phases

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
in two phases
we'll<00:00:26.070> be<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> body<00:00:26.519> B<00:00:26.670> space<00:00:26.880> for<00:00:27.180> a

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
we'll be in the body B space for a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.759 
we'll be in the body B space for a
couple<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.630> then<00:00:27.750> we'll<00:00:27.869> ship<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> p90x

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
couple and then we'll ship to the p90x

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.859 
couple and then we'll ship to the p90x
and<00:00:29.250> splitting<00:00:29.939> line<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.449> we'll<00:00:30.539> go<00:00:30.689> right

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
and splitting line and we'll go right

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.780 
and splitting line and we'll go right
back<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.260> body<00:00:31.470> B's<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:31.980> what<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.700> the

back to the body B's but what is the
reason<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.530> p90x<00:00:34.530> body<00:00:34.800> B's<00:00:35.010> hybrid

gain<00:00:38.070> okay<00:00:38.579> body<00:00:39.000> beast<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> best<00:00:39.960> program

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
gain okay body beast is the best program

gain okay body beast is the best program
possible<00:00:40.460> for<00:00:41.460> gaining<00:00:41.640> muscle<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.210> know<00:00:42.300> for

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
possible for gaining muscle you know for

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.350 
possible for gaining muscle you know for
getting<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.840> hypertrophy<00:00:43.590> because<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:45.239> a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
getting that hypertrophy because it's a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.150 
getting that hypertrophy because it's a
lot<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.570> lifting<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.350> really<00:00:46.620> smart<00:00:47.010> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
lot of lifting and it's really smart and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.010 
lot of lifting and it's really smart and
works<00:00:47.340> great<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.270> not<00:00:48.450> perfect<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
works great but it's not perfect and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.330 
works great but it's not perfect and
there<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.500> some<00:00:49.710> things<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.190> great

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
there are some things that are great

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.689 
there are some things that are great
about<00:00:50.430> p90x<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.390> p90x<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.770> good<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.129> just

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
about p90x but p90x is not good for just

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.790 
about p90x but p90x is not good for just
gaining<00:00:54.210> muscle<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> probably<00:00:55.649> one<00:00:55.739> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
gaining muscle but it is probably one of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
gaining muscle but it is probably one of
the<00:00:55.890> best<00:00:56.100> programs<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:57.390> doing<00:00:57.600> just<00:00:57.840> about

you can get bored you could you can
plateau<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.640> know<00:01:29.790> maybe<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.270> strength<00:01:30.600> is

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
plateau you know maybe your strength is

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.630 
plateau you know maybe your strength is
out<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.799> there's<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.250> reasons<00:01:32.460> why<00:01:32.520> you

another<00:02:59.630> great<00:02:59.870> way<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.110> mix<00:03:00.680> things<00:03:00.920> up<00:03:01.190> get<00:03:01.700> a

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
another great way to mix things up get a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.309 
another great way to mix things up get a
little<00:03:01.970> muscle<00:03:02.120> confusion<00:03:02.360> in<00:03:02.780> there<00:03:02.959> I'll

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
little muscle confusion in there I'll

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.960 
little muscle confusion in there I'll
get<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.620> ready<00:03:03.769> for<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.190> next<00:03:04.400> space<00:03:04.700> so

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
get you ready for the next space so

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.729 
get you ready for the next space so
recovery<00:03:05.600> weeks<00:03:05.780> are<00:03:06.049> going<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.410> be<00:03:06.500> really

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
recovery weeks are going to be really

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.180 
recovery weeks are going to be really
important<00:03:07.130> so<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:08.329> body<00:03:08.660> my<00:03:09.140> xB<00:03:09.590> schedule<00:03:10.070> is

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
important so the body my xB schedule is

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.910 
important so the body my xB schedule is
a<00:03:10.220> 90<00:03:10.640> day<00:03:10.760> schedule<00:03:11.030> with<00:03:12.019> two<00:03:12.320> floater<00:03:12.650> days

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
a 90 day schedule with two floater days

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.590 
a 90 day schedule with two floater days
flutter<00:03:13.609> days<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:13.910> can<00:03:14.030> use<00:03:14.150> whatever<00:03:14.359> you

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
flutter days you can use whatever you

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.960 
flutter days you can use whatever you
want<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:15.680> could<00:03:15.799> be<00:03:15.920> because<00:03:16.130> you're<00:03:16.370> sick<00:03:16.730> or

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
want it could be because you're sick or

want it could be because you're sick or
you're<00:03:17.060> on<00:03:17.120> vacation<00:03:17.239> or<00:03:17.870> just<00:03:17.930> rest<00:03:18.829> again

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
you're on vacation or just rest again

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.390 
you're on vacation or just rest again
rest<00:03:19.640> is<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.090> underrated<00:03:20.680> people<00:03:21.680> like<00:03:22.040> like

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
rest is so underrated people like like

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.130 
rest is so underrated people like like
to<00:03:22.579> you<00:03:22.940> know<00:03:23.030> skip<00:03:23.420> it<00:03:23.570> and<00:03:23.690> stuff<00:03:23.840> like<00:03:23.930> that

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
to you know skip it and stuff like that

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.330 
to you know skip it and stuff like that
but<00:03:24.350> know<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:24.709> important<00:03:25.160> because<00:03:25.220> you

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
but know it's important because you

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.819 
but know it's important because you
actually<00:03:25.760> grow<00:03:26.329> your<00:03:26.359> muscles<00:03:26.959> by<00:03:27.200> resting

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
actually grow your muscles by resting

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.380 
actually grow your muscles by resting
because<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.609> got<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.850> give<00:03:28.940> your<00:03:29.060> body<00:03:29.180> enough

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
because you got to give your body enough

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.509 
because you got to give your body enough
time<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:30.079> to<00:03:30.500> repair<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:31.010> muscle<00:03:31.100> tissue

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
time to to repair the muscle tissue

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.280 
time to to repair the muscle tissue
that's<00:03:31.790> broken<00:03:32.090> down<00:03:32.359> that's<00:03:32.870> essentially

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
that's broken down that's essentially

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.920 
that's broken down that's essentially
how<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.620> can<00:03:33.829> you<00:03:33.920> get<00:03:34.100> muscles<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:34.780> use<00:03:35.780> those

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
how you can you get muscles so use those

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.210 
how you can you get muscles so use those
two<00:03:36.109> floater<00:03:36.380> days<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.709> your<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:37.190> your

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
two floater days to your to your

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.460 
two floater days to your to your
advantage<00:03:37.609> now<00:03:38.299> we're<00:03:38.510> gonna<00:03:38.600> go<00:03:38.810> in<00:03:39.079> phases

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
advantage now we're gonna go in phases

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.059 
advantage now we're gonna go in phases
there's<00:03:40.280> four<00:03:40.730> phases<00:03:41.239> right<00:03:41.690> okay<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.799> first

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
there's four phases right okay the first

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.009 
there's four phases right okay the first
phase<00:03:43.340> is<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.730> body's<00:03:44.239> build<00:03:44.510> phase<00:03:44.780> is

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
phase is the body's build phase is

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.410 
phase is the body's build phase is
pretty<00:03:45.350> pretty<00:03:45.709> standard<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.340> then<00:03:47.060> you're

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
pretty pretty standard and then you're

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.670 
pretty pretty standard and then you're
gonna<00:03:47.510> have<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> little<00:03:48.019> recovery<00:03:48.410> week<00:03:48.560> in

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
gonna have a little recovery week in

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.129 
gonna have a little recovery week in
between<00:03:48.850> because<00:03:49.850> that'll<00:03:50.540> help<00:03:50.569> build<00:03:51.049> you

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
between because that'll help build you

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.539 
between because that'll help build you
up<00:03:51.230> to<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.470> next<00:03:51.680> space<00:03:51.859> that's<00:03:52.370> another

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
up to the next space that's another

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:53.800 
up to the next space that's another
thing<00:03:52.730> I<00:03:52.819> want<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.030> say<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.269> recovery<00:03:53.630> weeks

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
thing I want to say that recovery weeks

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.319 
thing I want to say that recovery weeks
great<00:03:54.590> for<00:03:54.859> boosting<00:03:55.220> strength<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.000> really

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
great for boosting strength I really

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.569 
great for boosting strength I really
focused<00:03:56.810> it<00:03:56.959> on<00:03:56.989> boosting<00:03:57.500> strength<00:03:57.859> it's<00:03:58.519> a

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
focused it on boosting strength it's a

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.220 
focused it on boosting strength it's a
great<00:03:58.760> way<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:58.970> avoid<00:03:59.540> hitting<00:03:59.780> workout

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
great way to avoid hitting workout

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.110 
great way to avoid hitting workout
plateaus<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:00.980> also<00:04:01.250> gives<00:04:01.430> you<00:04:01.519> a<00:04:01.579> good<00:04:01.940> boost

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
plateaus and also gives you a good boost

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.180 
plateaus and also gives you a good boost
going<00:04:02.600> into<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.840> next<00:04:03.049> phase<00:04:03.230> so<00:04:03.980> you<00:04:04.040> can

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
going into the next phase so you can

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.949 
going into the next phase so you can
attack<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.670> like<00:04:04.790> an<00:04:04.910> animal<00:04:05.239> so<00:04:05.600> after<00:04:05.870> that

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
attack it like an animal so after that

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.360 
attack it like an animal so after that
little<00:04:06.139> recovery<00:04:06.590> phase<00:04:06.799> you<00:04:06.950> go<00:04:07.100> into<00:04:07.280> the

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
little recovery phase you go into the

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.460 
little recovery phase you go into the
bulk<00:04:07.579> phase<00:04:07.819> again<00:04:08.780> pretty<00:04:09.019> standard<00:04:09.380> for

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
bulk phase again pretty standard for

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.650 
bulk phase again pretty standard for
body<00:04:09.680> beats<00:04:09.889> but<00:04:10.100> we're<00:04:10.190> gonna<00:04:10.280> show

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
body beats but we're gonna show

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.090 
body beats but we're gonna show
a<00:04:10.690> little<00:04:11.080> bit<00:04:11.200> followed<00:04:11.890> by<00:04:11.980> another

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
a little bit followed by another

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.860 
a little bit followed by another
recovery<00:04:12.580> pace<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.000> then<00:04:13.150> we<00:04:13.270> go<00:04:13.420> into<00:04:13.630> the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
recovery pace and then we go into the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.840 
recovery pace and then we go into the
power<00:04:14.170> phase<00:04:14.650> this<00:04:15.040> is<00:04:15.100> where<00:04:15.400> we<00:04:15.520> start<00:04:15.760> to

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
power phase this is where we start to

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.449 
power phase this is where we start to
use<00:04:15.970> p90x<00:04:16.630> now<00:04:17.019> one<00:04:17.769> of<00:04:17.800> the<00:04:17.950> great<00:04:18.130> things<00:04:18.370> I

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
use p90x now one of the great things I

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.150 
use p90x now one of the great things I
like<00:04:18.610> about<00:04:18.640> p90x<00:04:19.209> is<00:04:19.540> pull-ups<00:04:20.530> pull-ups

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
like about p90x is pull-ups pull-ups

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.460 
like about p90x is pull-ups pull-ups
push-ups<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.450> lot<00:04:22.870> of<00:04:22.960> those<00:04:23.050> moves<00:04:23.350> have

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
push-ups a lot of those moves have

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.690 
push-ups a lot of those moves have
unlimited<00:04:24.100> reps<00:04:24.580> okay<00:04:24.970> there<00:04:25.540> is<00:04:25.630> no<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.230> know

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
unlimited reps okay there is no you know

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.960 
unlimited reps okay there is no you know
1215<00:04:27.700> 8<00:04:28.000> no<00:04:28.570> it's<00:04:29.320> go<00:04:29.770> as<00:04:30.010> much<00:04:30.190> as<00:04:30.340> you<00:04:30.430> can<00:04:30.700> and

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
1215 8 no it's go as much as you can and

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.340 
1215 8 no it's go as much as you can and
this<00:04:31.420> is<00:04:31.570> where<00:04:31.750> it's<00:04:31.900> really<00:04:31.960> going<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.260> come

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
this is where it's really going to come

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.870 
this is where it's really going to come
into<00:04:32.590> play<00:04:32.680> because<00:04:33.100> after<00:04:33.580> you've<00:04:33.700> been

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
into play because after you've been

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.090

longer<00:06:00.100> so<00:06:00.430> they're<00:06:00.640> gonna<00:06:00.730> burn<00:06:00.940> a<00:06:00.970> little

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
longer so they're gonna burn a little

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.580 
longer so they're gonna burn a little
bit<00:06:01.210> more<00:06:01.360> calories<00:06:01.840> so<00:06:02.020> you<00:06:02.050> won't<00:06:02.380> have<00:06:02.530> to

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
bit more calories so you won't have to

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.190 
bit more calories so you won't have to
drop<00:06:02.980> the<00:06:03.220> calorie<00:06:03.610> goal<00:06:03.910> as<00:06:04.150> much<00:06:04.900> which<00:06:05.169> is

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:05.200 
drop the calorie goal as much which is

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.200 
drop the calorie goal as much which is
nice<00:06:05.530> so<00:06:05.770> you<00:06:05.830> can<00:06:05.950> kind<00:06:06.250> of<00:06:06.310> transition<00:06:06.940> a

nice so you can kind of transition a
little<00:06:07.690> bit<00:06:07.780> better<00:06:08.140> because<00:06:08.530> you're<00:06:08.650> burning

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
little bit better because you're burning

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.680 
little bit better because you're burning
more<00:06:09.010> calories<00:06:09.250> and<00:06:09.640> then<00:06:10.060> after<00:06:10.360> the<00:06:10.450> power

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
phase you roll right into the beast

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.760 
phase you roll right into the beast
phase<00:06:12.610> which<00:06:13.390> is<00:06:13.419> alternating<00:06:14.140> building

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770
