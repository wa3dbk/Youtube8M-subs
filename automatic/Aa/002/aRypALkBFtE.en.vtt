00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
black car to get on and then it's still

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
kind of a little loose so I would put

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.080

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
like a black belt around it I think what

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.660 
like a black belt around it I think what
might<00:01:06.420> look<00:01:06.600> even<00:01:06.960> better<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.220> took<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
might look even better is if I took a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.140 
might look even better is if I took a
long-sleeve<00:01:09.510> v-neck<00:01:10.040> Navy<00:01:11.040> shirt<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.760> put<00:01:12.030> it

long-sleeve v-neck Navy shirt and put it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.230 
long-sleeve v-neck Navy shirt and put it
over<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.890> could<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.729> would

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
over this then you could see I would

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.969

fold<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> cuffs<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.950> think

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
fold the cuffs up a little and I think

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.580 
fold the cuffs up a little and I think
it<00:01:17.250> would<00:01:17.369> look<00:01:17.400> great<00:01:17.640> okay<00:01:18.600> moving<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.350> to
