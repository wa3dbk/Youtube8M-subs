firepower the air is practically
dominated<00:01:28.920> by<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.070> attackers<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:30.119> are

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
dominated by the attackers there are

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.700 
dominated by the attackers there are
three<00:01:30.420> attack<00:01:30.659> helicopters<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.560> little

was<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.040> disappointed<00:01:35.549> by<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
was a little bit disappointed by the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.940 
was a little bit disappointed by the
lack<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.939> boats<00:01:36.360> for<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.689> attackers<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.650> seems

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
lack of boats for the attackers it seems

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.649 
lack of boats for the attackers it seems
like<00:01:38.009> there<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.250> only<00:01:38.400> about<00:01:38.579> two<00:01:38.939> this

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
like there are only about two this

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.359 
like there are only about two this
piddly<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.170> problem<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.710> too<00:01:40.890> many<00:01:41.009> people

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
piddly to problem as too many people

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.639 
piddly to problem as too many people
rush<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:41.790> helicopters<00:01:42.360> some<00:01:42.899> pilots<00:01:43.320> leaving

rush for helicopters some pilots leaving

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.590 
rush for helicopters some pilots leaving
teammates<00:01:44.009> behind<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:45.119> know<00:01:45.240> pretty

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
teammates behind and you know pretty

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.940 
teammates behind and you know pretty
much<00:01:45.750> everybody<00:01:46.290> has<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.439> get<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.770> boats

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
much everybody has to get on boats

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.859 
much everybody has to get on boats
afterwards<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> problem<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.540> even

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
afterwards but the problem is even

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.330 
afterwards but the problem is even
people<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.229> both<00:01:49.439> they<00:01:49.680> hop<00:01:49.829> onto<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.189> boat

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
people on both they hop onto the boat

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.039 
people on both they hop onto the boat
then<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.820> start<00:01:50.970> going<00:01:51.149> right<00:01:51.479> then

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
then you just start going right then

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.359 
then you just start going right then
that<00:01:52.259> means<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.680> if<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.950> have<00:01:53.070> five

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
that means that if you have five

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.580 
that means that if you have five
helicopters<00:01:53.630> they're<00:01:54.630> already<00:01:54.780> gone<00:01:55.049> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
helicopters they're already gone you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.990 
helicopters they're already gone you
only<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.860> two<00:01:56.009> boats<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:56.610> seven

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
only have two boats that's seven

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.880 
only have two boats that's seven
vehicles<00:01:57.180> what<00:01:58.110> about<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.350> other<00:01:58.500> people<00:01:58.860> you

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
vehicles what about the other people you

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.800 
vehicles what about the other people you
know<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.909> problem<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.570> that

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
know so the problem I see is that

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.819 
know so the problem I see is that
there's<00:02:01.020> going<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.380> lot<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.710> people

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
there's going to be a lot of people

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.679 
there's going to be a lot of people
stuck<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.399> carrier<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.479> some

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
stuck on the carrier and you know some

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.600 
stuck on the carrier and you know some
people<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:04.170> faster<00:02:04.619> pc<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.250> loads<00:02:05.430> them

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
people have faster pc so it loads them

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.280 
people have faster pc so it loads them
out<00:02:05.729> faster<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.299> they<00:02:06.329> get<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.170> get

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
out faster so they get you know to get

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.839 
out faster so they get you know to get
on<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.469> vehicle<00:02:07.680> faster<00:02:08.160> than<00:02:08.340> other<00:02:08.489> people

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
on the vehicle faster than other people

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.969 
on the vehicle faster than other people
so<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.270> could<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> little<00:02:10.200> bit<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.379> an<00:02:10.830> issue

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
so I could see a little bit of an issue

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.210 
so I could see a little bit of an issue
going<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.459> around<00:02:11.640> there<00:02:11.849> maybe

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
going on around there maybe

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.710 
going on around there maybe
add<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.340> couple<00:02:12.580> of<00:02:12.670> more<00:02:12.850> boats<00:02:13.090> just<00:02:13.420> in<00:02:13.540> case

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
add a couple of more boats just in case

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.200 
add a couple of more boats just in case
that<00:02:14.200> people<00:02:14.440> get<00:02:14.590> left<00:02:14.800> behind<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:15.460> can't

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
that people get left behind I can't

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.760 
that people get left behind I can't
really<00:02:16.330> justify<00:02:16.750> this<00:02:16.960> improve<00:02:17.410> this<00:02:17.590> yet

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
really justify this improve this yet

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.140 
really justify this improve this yet
because<00:02:18.070> of<00:02:18.460> course<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.760> haven't<00:02:18.910> played<00:02:19.060> a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
because of course I haven't played a

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.820 
because of course I haven't played a
floor<00:02:19.420> round<00:02:19.630> with<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.870> lot<00:02:20.020> of<00:02:20.110> people<00:02:20.260> I've

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
floor round with a lot of people I've

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.770 
floor round with a lot of people I've
only<00:02:21.040> played<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.370> little<00:02:21.640> rounds<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.660> I've

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
only played this little rounds that I've

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.360 
only played this little rounds that I've
used<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.350> test<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.770> record<00:02:24.100> them<00:02:24.220> out

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
used to just test and record them out

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.400 
used to just test and record them out
now<00:02:24.850> as<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.360> defenders<00:02:25.870> their<00:02:26.080> spawns

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
now as for the defenders their spawns

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.530 
now as for the defenders their spawns
have<00:02:26.650> tanks<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.160> APCs<00:02:27.250> meaning<00:02:28.240> that<00:02:28.360> they

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
have tanks and APCs meaning that they

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.450 
have tanks and APCs meaning that they
dominate<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.140> ground<00:02:29.410> game<00:02:29.680> but<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.190> course

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
dominate the ground game but of course

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.310 
dominate the ground game but of course
everybody<00:02:30.790> loves<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.240> bunch<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.540> air<00:02:31.750> vs<00:02:32.080> ground

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
everybody loves a bunch of air vs ground

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.380 
everybody loves a bunch of air vs ground
combat<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.280> feel<00:02:33.520> like<00:02:33.550> this<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:33.910> what<00:02:34.060> oman

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
combat and I feel like this is what oman

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.120 
combat and I feel like this is what oman
Russia<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:34.750> going<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.960> focus<00:02:35.080> on<00:02:35.350> as<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:36.100> the

Russia is going to focus on as for the

Russia is going to focus on as for the
ground<00:02:36.430> versus<00:02:36.790> ground<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.300> can<00:02:37.480> see<00:02:37.630> working

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
ground versus ground I can see working

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.780 
ground versus ground I can see working
as<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.410> first<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.830> second<00:02:39.130> em<00:02:39.220> comms<00:02:39.490> are

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
as the first and second em comms are

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.580 
as the first and second em comms are
really<00:02:40.390> around<00:02:40.660> small<00:02:40.960> buildings<00:02:41.380> that<00:02:41.530> you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
really around small buildings that you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.190 
really around small buildings that you
can<00:02:41.770> climb<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.670> looks<00:02:42.820> very<00:02:43.060> CQC<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
can climb on and it looks very CQC the

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.840 
can climb on and it looks very CQC the
last<00:02:44.410> set<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.590> em<00:02:44.800> comes<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.160> more<00:02:45.340> open<00:02:45.370> and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
last set of em comes is more open and

tell<00:04:08.140> you<00:04:08.230> much<00:04:08.320> about<00:04:08.380> how<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.709> map<00:04:08.920> please

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040

tell you much about how the map please
like<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.370> said<00:04:09.610> I<00:04:09.640> haven't<00:04:09.970> experienced<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.480> yet

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
like I said I haven't experienced it yet

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.090 
like I said I haven't experienced it yet
but<00:04:11.080> I'm<00:04:11.200> looking<00:04:11.230> forward<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.739> trying<00:04:11.890> it

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
but I'm looking forward to trying it

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.830 
but I'm looking forward to trying it
with<00:04:12.250> multiple<00:04:12.700> people<00:04:12.820> have<00:04:13.299> a<00:04:13.330> full<00:04:13.570> server

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
with multiple people have a full server

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.890 
with multiple people have a full server
and<00:04:14.110> see<00:04:14.530> what<00:04:14.709> people<00:04:14.860> play<00:04:15.419> also<00:04:16.419> I<00:04:16.450> haven't

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
and see what people play also I haven't

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.659 
and see what people play also I haven't
noticed<00:04:17.049> any<00:04:17.410> performance<00:04:17.979> glitches<00:04:18.100> or<00:04:18.430> bugs

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
noticed any performance glitches or bugs

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.370 
noticed any performance glitches or bugs
which<00:04:19.000> is<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.150> good<00:04:19.330> thing<00:04:19.390> by<00:04:19.780> frame<00:04:20.049> rate<00:04:20.200> was

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
which is a good thing by frame rate was

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.830 
which is a good thing by frame rate was
constant<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:21.039> pretty<00:04:21.190> high<00:04:21.340> compared<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.240> you

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
constant and pretty high compared to you

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.839 
constant and pretty high compared to you
know<00:04:22.870> car<00:04:23.169> can<00:04:23.349> rush<00:04:23.560> or<00:04:23.919> dalian<00:04:24.370> rush<00:04:24.580> or<00:04:24.669> even

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
know car can rush or dalian rush or even

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:25.710 
know car can rush or dalian rush or even
boss<00:04:25.000> rush

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
boss rush

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.790 
boss rush
I<00:04:25.750> think<00:04:25.960> it's<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.140> lighting<00:04:26.440> of<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.560> map

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
I think it's the lighting of the map

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.650 
I think it's the lighting of the map
that<00:04:27.280> is<00:04:27.400> pretty<00:04:27.640> you<00:04:27.850> know<00:04:27.880> straightforward

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
that is pretty you know straightforward

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.540 
that is pretty you know straightforward
and<00:04:28.810> allows<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.290> I<00:04:29.590> don't<00:04:30.250> think<00:04:30.370> they<00:04:30.430> went

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
and allows that I don't think they went

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.950 
and allows that I don't think they went
for<00:04:30.670> anything<00:04:30.880> complicated<00:04:31.300> they<00:04:31.630> just<00:04:31.810> went

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
for anything complicated they just went

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.300 
for anything complicated they just went
straight<00:04:32.200> up<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:32.620> know<00:04:32.710> what<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.920> point<00:04:33.070> I

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
straight up you know what the point I

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.860 
straight up you know what the point I
think<00:04:33.970> for<00:04:34.090> both<00:04:34.240> sides<00:04:34.450> you're<00:04:34.660> going<00:04:34.810> to

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
think for both sides you're going to

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.150 
think for both sides you're going to
need<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:34.990> little<00:04:35.200> bit<00:04:35.320> of<00:04:35.380> good<00:04:35.470> cooperation

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
need a little bit of good cooperation

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.980 
need a little bit of good cooperation
with<00:04:36.490> your<00:04:36.670> team<00:04:36.880> first<00:04:37.390> of<00:04:37.540> all<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:37.690> got<00:04:37.900> to

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
with your team first of all you got to

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.540 
with your team first of all you got to
take<00:04:38.110> down<00:04:38.290> that<00:04:38.320> air<00:04:38.620> support<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:38.980> defend<00:04:39.370> and

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
take down that air support to defend and

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.430 
take down that air support to defend and
on<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.090> other<00:04:40.210> way<00:04:40.420> around<00:04:40.450> you've<00:04:41.230> got<00:04:41.350> to

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
on the other way around you've got to

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.960 
on the other way around you've got to
take<00:04:41.590> out<00:04:41.740> those<00:04:41.860> tanks<00:04:42.190> an<00:04:42.280> APC<00:04:42.670> there<00:04:42.910> are

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
take out those tanks an APC there are

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.910 
take out those tanks an APC there are
very<00:04:43.180> dangerous<00:04:43.330> in<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.720> infantry<00:04:44.110> no<00:04:44.710> lines

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
very dangerous in the infantry no lines

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.620 
very dangerous in the infantry no lines
of<00:04:45.070> sight<00:04:45.280> you've<00:04:45.730> got<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:45.970> take<00:04:46.090> those<00:04:46.210> out<00:04:46.420> if

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
of sight you've got to take those out if

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.810 
of sight you've got to take those out if
you<00:04:46.720> really<00:04:46.750> want<00:04:47.140> to<00:04:47.230> attack<00:04:47.440> properly<00:04:47.950> the

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
you really want to attack properly the

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.430 
you really want to attack properly the
way<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.000> see<00:04:49.120> it<00:04:49.330> it's<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.630> vehicle<00:04:50.020> dependence

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
way I see it it's a vehicle dependence

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.140 
way I see it it's a vehicle dependence
map<00:04:50.620> you<00:04:51.160> want<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.400> succeed<00:04:51.670> against<00:04:51.970> good

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
map you want to succeed against good

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.090 
map you want to succeed against good
players<00:04:52.270> you<00:04:52.840> know<00:04:52.960> trace<00:04:53.320> enemy<00:04:53.680> vehicles

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
players you know trace enemy vehicles

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.250 
players you know trace enemy vehicles
have<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.700> pilots<00:04:54.880> take<00:04:55.150> them<00:04:55.330> out<00:04:55.450> you<00:04:55.900> go<00:04:56.050> in

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
have the pilots take them out you go in

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
players and arm diem come I don't really

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.440 
players and arm diem come I don't really
think<00:05:00.250> many<00:05:00.460> defenders<00:05:00.850> will<00:05:01.030> cap<00:05:01.270> the

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
think many defenders will cap the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.970 
think many defenders will cap the
incomes<00:05:01.780> because<00:05:02.050> it<00:05:02.380> takes<00:05:02.530> time<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.770> get

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
incomes because it takes time to get

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.530 
incomes because it takes time to get
there<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.370> also<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:03.940> have<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.180> worry<00:05:04.420> about

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
there and also you have to worry about

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.050 
there and also you have to worry about
those<00:05:04.810> helis<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.650> map<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:05.980> open<00:05:06.370> rockets<00:05:06.910> can

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
those helis the map is open rockets can

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.090 
those helis the map is open rockets can
hit<00:05:07.210> anywhere<00:05:07.510> if<00:05:07.840> you<00:05:08.140> ever<00:05:08.290> get<00:05:08.500> traced<00:05:08.830> you

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
hit anywhere if you ever get traced you

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.650 
hit anywhere if you ever get traced you
know<00:05:09.220> watch<00:05:09.400> out<00:05:09.670> there<00:05:10.150> are<00:05:10.240> three<00:05:10.420> attack

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
know watch out there are three attack

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.320 
know watch out there are three attack
helicopters<00:05:11.200> I<00:05:11.290> could<00:05:11.440> kill<00:05:11.680> you<00:05:12.180> speaking<00:05:13.180> of

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
helicopters I could kill you speaking of

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.600 
helicopters I could kill you speaking of

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
helicopters the russian and US apache

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.790 
helicopters the russian and US apache
are<00:05:15.970> both<00:05:16.180> in<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.360> same<00:05:16.600> team<00:05:16.870> and<00:05:17.050> i<00:05:17.590> just

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
are both in the same team and i just

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.770 
are both in the same team and i just
found<00:05:17.950> that<00:05:18.130> a<00:05:18.190> bit<00:05:18.340> messed<00:05:18.580> up<00:05:18.790> do<00:05:19.450> I<00:05:19.480> think

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
found that a bit messed up do I think

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.810 
found that a bit messed up do I think
that<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:19.960> map<00:05:20.140> will<00:05:20.290> become<00:05:20.650> popular<00:05:20.890> at<00:05:21.340> this

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
that the map will become popular at this

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.460 
that the map will become popular at this
point<00:05:22.090> not<00:05:22.419> really<00:05:22.750> i<00:05:22.780> thought<00:05:23.020> baaja<00:05:23.230> was

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
point not really i thought baaja was

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.600 
point not really i thought baaja was
going<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.650> be<00:05:23.740> popular<00:05:24.160> because<00:05:24.280> it's<00:05:24.520> an

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
going to be popular because it's an

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.730 
going to be popular because it's an

infantry only map and guess what nobody

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.740 
infantry only map and guess what nobody
