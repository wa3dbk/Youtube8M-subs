00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
played an important role in the design

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.580 
played an important role in the design
and<00:01:48.159> calibration<00:01:48.969> process<00:01:49.229> we<00:01:50.229> found<00:01:50.469> that

measurements we could repeat within a
few<00:01:56.079> horsepower<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:57.159> could<00:01:57.280> do<00:01:57.399> loaded<00:01:57.819> and

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
few horsepower it could do loaded and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.450 
few horsepower it could do loaded and
unloaded<00:01:58.179> testing<00:01:59.049> we<00:01:59.740> do<00:01:59.859> steady<00:02:00.130> state

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460

testing<00:02:00.909> all<00:02:01.179> of<00:02:01.210> these<00:02:01.420> were<00:02:01.569> very<00:02:01.719> important

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
testing all of these were very important

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.099 
testing all of these were very important
in<00:02:02.289> developing<00:02:02.439> a<00:02:03.009> solid<00:02:03.369> engine<00:02:03.850> calibration

in developing a solid engine calibration

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.440 
in developing a solid engine calibration
so<00:02:05.109> really<00:02:05.289> it<00:02:05.499> allows<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.069> prove<00:02:06.369> to<00:02:07.329> the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
so really it allows you to prove to the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.669 
so really it allows you to prove to the
client<00:02:07.810> what<00:02:07.960> you're<00:02:08.110> doing<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.350> their<00:02:08.470> cars
