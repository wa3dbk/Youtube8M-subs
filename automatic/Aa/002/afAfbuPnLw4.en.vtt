it's and it's a way of them kind of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.870 
it's and it's a way of them kind of
getting<00:01:27.090> getting<00:01:27.509> out<00:01:27.860> beyond<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.040> kind<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
getting getting out beyond the kind of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.719

obviously<00:01:35.040> Phil<00:01:35.780> does<00:01:36.780> i<00:01:36.810> think<00:01:37.110> does<00:01:37.470> have<00:01:37.619> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
obviously Phil does i think does have a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.380 
obviously Phil does i think does have a
direct<00:01:37.979> connection<00:01:38.189> with<00:01:38.759> opera<00:01:39.119> because

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
direct connection with opera because

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.219 
direct connection with opera because

before film existed opera was kind of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.550 
before film existed opera was kind of
the<00:01:43.320> predecessor<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.189> of

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
the predecessor because of

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.340 
the predecessor because of
marriage<00:01:44.829> of<00:01:44.979> music<00:01:45.430> and<00:01:46.110> drama<00:01:47.110> and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
marriage of music and drama and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.999

make<00:02:04.149> classical<00:02:04.899> music<00:02:05.140> that<00:02:05.229> I<00:02:05.289> rights<00:02:05.590> and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
make classical music that I rights and

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.100 
make classical music that I rights and
Fred's<00:02:06.250> Minds<00:02:06.490> write<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.030> perform<00:02:07.090> fit<00:02:07.960> into

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
Fred's Minds write and perform fit into

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.630 
Fred's Minds write and perform fit into
people<00:02:08.560> into<00:02:08.800> young<00:02:08.950> people's<00:02:09.160> lifestyle<00:02:09.550> and

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
people into young people's lifestyle and

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.520 
people into young people's lifestyle and
one<00:02:09.759> of<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:09.910> main<00:02:10.780> ways<00:02:10.959> I've<00:02:11.110> done<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.380> is

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
one of the main ways I've done that is

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.800 
one of the main ways I've done that is
to<00:02:11.680> do<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:12.250> classical<00:02:12.819> club<00:02:13.060> night<00:02:13.239> once<00:02:13.660> a

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
to do a classical club night once a

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.839 
to do a classical club night once a
month<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.290> so<00:02:14.500> therefore<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:15.519> present

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
month and so therefore you present

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.820 
month and so therefore you present
massive<00:02:16.450> lightning<00:02:16.690> presenter<00:02:17.380> back<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> rock

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
massive lightning presenter back a rock

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.130 
massive lightning presenter back a rock
band<00:02:18.180> alongside<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.450> club<00:02:19.630> I've<00:02:19.750> set<00:02:19.959> up<00:02:19.989> a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
band alongside the club I've set up a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.750 
band alongside the club I've set up a
record<00:02:20.440> label<00:02:20.590> nur<00:02:20.860> which<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.519> like<00:02:21.640> an

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
record label nur which is like an

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.130 
record label nur which is like an
alternative<00:02:22.269> classical<00:02:22.780> label<00:02:23.049> called

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
alternative classical label called

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.930 
alternative classical label called
non-classical<00:02:23.980> which<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.400> also<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.760> name<00:02:24.880> of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
non-classical which is also the name of

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.150 
non-classical which is also the name of
the<00:02:25.239> night<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.470> idea<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.739> that<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:26.950> kind

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
the night and the idea of that is kind

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.530 
the night and the idea of that is kind
of<00:02:27.220> pushing<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.580> boundaries<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.030> what<00:02:28.510> is

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
of pushing the boundaries of what is

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.600 
of pushing the boundaries of what is
classical<00:02:29.080> music<00:02:29.380> will<00:02:30.190> release<00:02:30.580> a

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
classical music will release a

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.580 
classical music will release a
contemporary<00:02:31.390> classical<00:02:31.810> piece<00:02:32.019> say<00:02:32.560> a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
a string piece some friends of mine

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.330 
a string piece some friends of mine
written<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:37.930> then<00:02:38.650> we'll<00:02:38.920> get<00:02:39.069> other

written and then we'll get other

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.580 
written and then we'll get other
producers<00:02:40.060> from<00:02:40.239> other<00:02:40.450> musical<00:02:41.019> backgrounds

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
producers from other musical backgrounds

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.520 
producers from other musical backgrounds
to<00:02:41.709> do<00:02:41.830> remixes<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.489> me<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:43.180> five<00:02:43.420> films<00:02:43.989> are

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
to do remixes on me the five films are

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.940 
to do remixes on me the five films are
quite<00:02:45.010> contrasting<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.950> challenge

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
quite contrasting and so the challenge

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.340 
quite contrasting and so the challenge
was<00:02:48.069> was<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.400> find<00:02:48.609> five<00:02:48.850> composers<00:02:49.630> who<00:02:50.140> would

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
was was to find five composers who would

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.340 
was was to find five composers who would
suit<00:02:50.620> each<00:02:50.799> film<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:51.630> also<00:02:52.630> personally<00:02:53.320> I

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
suit each film and also personally I

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.120 
suit each film and also personally I
wanted<00:02:53.829> to<00:02:54.010> show<00:02:54.760> a<00:02:54.790> kind<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:56.100> have<00:02:57.100> a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
wanted to show a kind of have a

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.430 
wanted to show a kind of have a
contrasting<00:02:57.700> program<00:02:58.120> musically<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.260> that

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
contrasting program musically so that

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.440 
contrasting program musically so that
you'd<00:02:59.560> have<00:02:59.880> maybe<00:03:00.880> quite<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:03.450> more

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
you'd have maybe quite a more

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.509 
you'd have maybe quite a more
traditional<00:03:04.690> contemporary<00:03:05.680> classical

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
traditional contemporary classical

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.970 
traditional contemporary classical
composer<00:03:07.170> maybe<00:03:08.170> someone<00:03:08.620> who<00:03:08.769> had<00:03:08.950> a

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
composer maybe someone who had a

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.099 
composer maybe someone who had a
slightly<00:03:09.310> more<00:03:09.489> popular<00:03:09.940> style<00:03:10.329> someone<00:03:11.019> who

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
slightly more popular style someone who

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.190 
slightly more popular style someone who
is<00:03:11.260> more<00:03:11.290> from<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.769> electronica<00:03:12.400> backgrounds

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
is more from the electronica backgrounds

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.979 
is more from the electronica backgrounds
myself<00:03:14.200> who<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:15.250> influenced<00:03:15.910> by<00:03:15.970> some<00:03:16.480> kind<00:03:16.840> of

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
myself who is influenced by some kind of

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.949 
myself who is influenced by some kind of
an<00:03:17.340> urban<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.880> dance<00:03:19.090> music<00:03:19.569> as<00:03:19.690> well<00:03:19.840> as

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
an urban and dance music as well as

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.800 
an urban and dance music as well as
classical<00:03:20.139> music<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.209> it's<00:03:22.209> worked<00:03:22.540> really

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
classical music and it's worked really

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.599 
classical music and it's worked really
well<00:03:22.900> each<00:03:23.200> film<00:03:23.590> has<00:03:24.130> got<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.310> very<00:03:24.459> strong

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
well each film has got a very strong

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.129 
well each film has got a very strong
identity<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.359> that's<00:03:25.480> partly<00:03:25.810> because<00:03:25.870> of

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
identity and that's partly because of

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.039 
identity and that's partly because of
the<00:03:26.680> composer<00:03:27.069> chosen<00:03:27.670> cinemas<00:03:28.510> so

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
the composer chosen cinemas so

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.309 
the composer chosen cinemas so
sophisticated<00:03:29.290> now

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
sophisticated now

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.720 
sophisticated now
you<00:03:30.560> know<00:03:30.620> if<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.799> think<00:03:30.950> about<00:03:31.040> new<00:03:31.340> Galactus

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
you know if you think about new Galactus

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.690 
you know if you think about new Galactus
of<00:03:31.790> 1913<00:03:32.719> or<00:03:32.989> 1907<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.129> then<00:03:34.400> we're<00:03:34.519> really

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
of 1913 or 1907 and then we're really

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.220 
of 1913 or 1907 and then we're really
just<00:03:34.819> learning<00:03:35.269> working<00:03:35.629> on<00:03:35.719> how<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.870> do<00:03:36.109> it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
just learning working on how to do it

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.080 
just learning working on how to do it
and<00:03:36.379> even<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.980> editing<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.340> style<00:03:37.670> often

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
and even the editing of style often

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.720 
and even the editing of style often
feels<00:03:38.359> a<00:03:38.540> little<00:03:38.689> bit<00:03:38.950> hand<00:03:39.950> up<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.430> little<00:03:40.609> bit

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
feels a little bit hand up a little bit

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.940 
feels a little bit hand up a little bit
exaggerated<00:03:41.299> so<00:03:42.049> for<00:03:42.230> example<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.650> film<00:03:42.859> I

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
exaggerated so for example the film I

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.830 
exaggerated so for example the film I
did<00:03:42.980> the<00:03:43.280> musketeers<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.879> pigalle<00:03:44.209> when<00:03:44.810> I

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
did the musketeers of pigalle when I

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.110 
did the musketeers of pigalle when I
first<00:03:45.170> watched<00:03:45.530> out<00:03:45.709> for<00:03:45.739> what<00:03:46.040> god<00:03:46.249> this<00:03:46.819> film

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
first watched out for what god this film

bit bit of a caricature a little bit too

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.030
