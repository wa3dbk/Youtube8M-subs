a<00:00:24.119> chain<00:00:24.449> drop<00:00:24.920> this<00:00:25.920> year<00:00:26.160> I've<00:00:26.580> never<00:00:27.029> ever

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
a chain drop this year I've never ever

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.900 
a chain drop this year I've never ever
dropped<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.380> chain<00:00:28.529> anyway<00:00:29.480> however<00:00:30.480> long

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
dropped the chain anyway however long

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.870 
dropped the chain anyway however long
climbs<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.390> feel<00:00:34.200> like<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.530> could<00:00:34.860> need<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.640> could

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
climbs I feel like I could need I could

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.200 
climbs I feel like I could need I could
use<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.149> lower<00:00:36.600> gear<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.760> before<00:00:38.760> shifting

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
use a lower gear and before shifting

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.780 
use a lower gear and before shifting
this<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.500> 30<00:00:40.739> teeth<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.370> kind<00:00:41.670> of

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
this to the 30 teeth and I was kind of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.729 
this to the 30 teeth and I was kind of
set<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> kind<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.440> liked<00:00:43.649> the

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
set to do that but I kind of liked the

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.080 
set to do that but I kind of liked the
top<00:00:44.010> end<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.430> well<00:00:44.719> I<00:00:45.719> thought<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.739> would<00:00:47.090> see

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
top end as well I thought I would see

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
top end as well I thought I would see
what<00:00:48.300> else<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.629> available

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
what else is available

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.020 
what else is available
ok<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.190> how<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.579> got<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.430> what

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
ok and that's how I got to this and what

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.500 
ok and that's how I got to this and what
you<00:00:54.210> see<00:00:54.420> here<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:56.010> absolute<00:00:56.550> black<00:00:56.789> oval

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
you see here is the absolute black oval

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.560 
you see here is the absolute black oval
chain<00:00:58.010> rings<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> 32<00:01:00.180> tooth<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:03.680> this

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
chain rings this is a 32 tooth and this

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.609 
chain rings this is a 32 tooth and this
looks<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:07.850> okay<00:01:08.930> these<00:01:09.930> are<00:01:10.200> supposed

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
looks like okay these are supposed

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.039 
looks like okay these are supposed
supposed<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.760> budget<00:01:11.939> chain<00:01:12.810> rings

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
supposed to be the budget chain rings

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.969 
supposed to be the budget chain rings
from<00:01:13.770> chain<00:01:13.979> reaction<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.409> like<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.799> I

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
from chain reaction and like as I

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.010 
from chain reaction and like as I
mentioned<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> 32

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
mentioned as you can see here is a 32

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.219 
mentioned as you can see here is a 32
teeth<00:01:19.430> you<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> texture<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.869> these

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
teeth you can see a texture on these

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.870 
teeth you can see a texture on these
because<00:01:22.770> these<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.040> machined

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
because these are machined

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.990 
because these are machined
they<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.150> not<00:01:24.390> stamped<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.729> because<00:01:26.729> these

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
they are not stamped and because these

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.840 
they are not stamped and because these
this<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.740> equivalent<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.310> 30<00:01:29.549> teeth

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
this is a the equivalent of a 30 teeth

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.960 
this is a the equivalent of a 30 teeth
on<00:01:30.060> one<00:01:30.320> dimension<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.890> 34<00:01:32.460> teeth<00:01:32.700> on<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
on one dimension and 34 teeth on the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.670 
on one dimension and 34 teeth on the
other<00:01:33.090> dimension<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.110> actually<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.890> these

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
other dimension you actually have these

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.060 
other dimension you actually have these
spacers<00:01:37.680> built<00:01:38.189> in<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.610> can<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.360> so

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
spacers built in you can see it here so

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.499 
spacers built in you can see it here so
my<00:01:41.070> chain<00:01:41.400> ring<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.880> be<00:01:41.970> pushed<00:01:42.270> in

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
my chain ring is going to be pushed in

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.600 
my chain ring is going to be pushed in
about<00:01:43.200> two<00:01:43.470> millimeters<00:01:43.740> should<00:01:44.430> be<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
about two millimeters should be a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.170 
about two millimeters should be a
problem<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.430> here<00:01:47.909> there's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
problem and you can see here there's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.069 
problem and you can see here there's
these<00:01:48.630> threaded<00:01:49.140> holes<00:01:49.439> as<00:01:49.740> well<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:51.079> these

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
these threaded holes as well and these

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.980 
these threaded holes as well and these
are<00:01:52.140> narrow<00:01:52.590> wide<00:01:52.860> chain<00:01:53.490> chain<00:01:54.060> rings<00:01:54.299> you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
are narrow wide chain chain rings you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
are narrow wide chain chain rings you
can<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.799> profile<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.340> key<00:01:56.490> profile

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
can see the profile the key profile

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.660 
can see the profile the key profile
right<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.990> what<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.250> supposed<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
right here so what this is supposed to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.969 
right here so what this is supposed to
give<00:01:59.909> me<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.570> effect<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:01.079> these<00:02:01.259> oval<00:02:01.740> rings

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
give me the effect of these oval rings

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.340 
give me the effect of these oval rings
is<00:02:02.219> mostly<00:02:02.610> seen<00:02:02.939> on<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.719> clients<00:02:04.110> well

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
is mostly seen on the clients well

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.160 
is mostly seen on the clients well

talking about this little triangle
there's<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.450> machine<00:02:34.049> on<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.739> inside<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.280> the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
there's a machine on the inside of the

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.229 
there's a machine on the inside of the
chain<00:02:35.790> ring<00:02:35.939> this<00:02:36.540> will<00:02:36.780> go<00:02:37.069> under<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.459> crank

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
chain ring this will go under the crank

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.460 
chain ring this will go under the crank
arm<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:40.680> if<00:02:40.859> I<00:02:41.069> am<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.519> look<00:02:41.730> here<00:02:42.269> that's<00:02:43.170> my

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
arm so if I am to look here that's my

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.410 
arm so if I am to look here that's my
little<00:02:43.739> triangle<00:02:44.519> which<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.909> right<00:02:45.090> here

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
little triangle which is right here

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.270 
little triangle which is right here
that<00:02:46.319> one<00:02:46.560> will<00:02:47.519> go<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.450> crank<00:02:48.750> arm

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
that one will go on to the crank arm

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.640 
that one will go on to the crank arm
side<00:02:50.280> by<00:02:50.519> side<00:02:50.790> here<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.359> this<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.169> the<00:02:52.319> 32

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
side by side here so this is the 32

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.559 
side by side here so this is the 32
narrow<00:02:53.400> wide<00:02:53.669> this<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.840> 32<00:02:55.169> oval<00:02:56.389> from<00:02:57.389> out

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
narrow wide this is the 32 oval from out

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.500 
narrow wide this is the 32 oval from out
to<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.870> black<00:02:58.109> and<00:02:58.829> if<00:02:59.459> I'm<00:02:59.700> to<00:03:00.030> put<00:03:00.239> one<00:03:00.419> on

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
to the black and if I'm to put one on

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.280 
to the black and if I'm to put one on
top<00:03:00.689> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> other

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
top of the other

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.970 
top of the other
this<00:03:01.859> one<00:03:02.040> has<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:03.319> spacers<00:03:04.319> here<00:03:06.799> go<00:03:07.799> they

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
this one has the spacers here go they

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.149 
this one has the spacers here go they
line<00:03:08.159> them<00:03:08.310> up<00:03:08.459> perfectly<00:03:09.799> this<00:03:10.799> is<00:03:10.980> an

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
line them up perfectly this is an

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.140 
line them up perfectly this is an
11-percent

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
11-percent

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.569 
11-percent
oval<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.260> it's<00:03:13.379> not<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.560> whole<00:03:13.799> lot<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.190> can<00:03:14.250> see

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
oval so it's not a whole lot you can see

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.309 
oval so it's not a whole lot you can see
here<00:03:15.049> slightly<00:03:16.049> wider<00:03:16.500> on<00:03:16.949> this<00:03:17.519> two<00:03:17.729> sides

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
here slightly wider on this two sides

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.949 
here slightly wider on this two sides
slightly<00:03:19.319> narrower<00:03:20.209> narrower<00:03:21.209> here<00:03:21.449> so<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
slightly narrower narrower here so the

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.439 
slightly narrower narrower here so the
equivalent<00:03:22.409> of<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.590> 30<00:03:22.829> here<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:24.000> equivalent

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:24.449 
equivalent of a 30 here the equivalent

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.520 
equivalent of a 30 here the equivalent
of<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.659> 34<00:03:25.400> over<00:03:26.400> there<00:03:26.870> five<00:03:27.870> millimeter<00:03:28.290> allen

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
of a 34 over there five millimeter allen

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.300 
of a 34 over there five millimeter allen
key<00:03:28.889> a<00:03:29.159> drop<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.150> Loctite<00:03:31.079> blue<00:03:31.349> on<00:03:31.709> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
key a drop of Loctite blue on the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.149 
key a drop of Loctite blue on the
threads<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.840> got<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:34.470> chain<00:03:34.709> installed

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
threads and I got the chain installed

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.309 
threads and I got the chain installed
the<00:03:35.849> two<00:03:36.060> millimeter<00:03:36.449> spacer<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.260> I

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
the two millimeter spacer that I

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.129 
the two millimeter spacer that I
mentioned<00:03:37.769> earlier<00:03:37.919> you<00:03:38.699> need<00:03:38.909> it<00:03:39.030> for<00:03:39.389> here

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
mentioned earlier you need it for here

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.569 
mentioned earlier you need it for here
you<00:03:40.859> see<00:03:41.099> here<00:03:41.489> or<00:03:42.199> the<00:03:43.199> chain<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.650> where<00:03:44.190> the

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
you see here or the chain is where the

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.240 
you see here or the chain is where the
chain<00:03:44.790> ring<00:03:44.940> is<00:03:45.150> at<00:03:45.389> its<00:03:45.690> narrowest<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.859> 30

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
chain ring is at its narrowest so the 30

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.080 
chain ring is at its narrowest so the 30
it<00:03:48.180> just<00:03:48.599> goes<00:03:49.040> kind<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.129> under<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.400> spider<00:03:50.790> so

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
it just goes kind of under the spider so

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.939 
it just goes kind of under the spider so
you<00:03:51.180> need<00:03:51.329> that<00:03:51.449> two<00:03:51.629> millimeter<00:03:52.049> no<00:03:52.620> problem

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
you need that two millimeter no problem

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.179 
you need that two millimeter no problem
here<00:03:53.159> where<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.400> have<00:03:53.430> 34<00:03:54.319> people<00:03:55.319> create<00:03:56.159> a

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
here where you have 34 people create a

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.449 
here where you have 34 people create a
scale

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
scale

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.910 
scale
anything<00:03:58.459> that<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.670> can<00:03:59.300> hear<00:03:59.690> is<00:04:00.020> disappearing

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
anything that I can hear is disappearing

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.420 
anything that I can hear is disappearing
and<00:04:01.130> you<00:04:01.220> can<00:04:01.520> buy<00:04:01.700> ten<00:04:02.000> system<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:03.160> time<00:04:04.160> to

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
and you can buy ten system and time to

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.710 
and you can buy ten system and time to
look<00:04:04.580> at<00:04:04.849> my<00:04:05.090> day<00:04:05.959> oh<00:04:07.599> hi<00:04:08.620> Megan

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
look at my day oh hi Megan

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.949 
look at my day oh hi Megan
okay<00:04:11.900> so<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:13.340> think<00:04:13.730> it's<00:04:14.030> just<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.510> couple<00:04:14.780> of

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
okay so I think it's just a couple of

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.680 
okay so I think it's just a couple of
millimeters<00:04:15.500> in<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.639> out<00:04:16.760> here<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:17.389> you<00:04:17.419> can

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
millimeters in and out here that you can

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.800 
millimeters in and out here that you can
see<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.200> don't<00:04:18.859> think<00:04:19.040> it's<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.310> lot<00:04:19.519> more<00:04:19.820> than

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
see I don't think it's a lot more than

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.710 
see I don't think it's a lot more than
what<00:04:21.109> this<00:04:21.769> sees<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.370> abuse<00:04:22.760> that<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.480> clutch

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
what this sees the abuse that the clutch

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.720 
what this sees the abuse that the clutch
would<00:04:23.990> see<00:04:24.260> on<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.590> normal<00:04:24.889> writing<00:04:25.310> condition

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
would see on a normal writing condition

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.629 
would see on a normal writing condition
so<00:04:25.940> anyway<00:04:26.630> have<00:04:27.530> a<00:04:27.590> race<00:04:27.889> coming<00:04:28.250> up<00:04:28.460> tomorrow

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
so anyway have a race coming up tomorrow

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.360 
so anyway have a race coming up tomorrow
I'll<00:04:29.389> make<00:04:29.720> sure<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.930> report<00:04:30.380> back<00:04:30.410> and<00:04:30.800> I'll

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
done with the race how did it perform

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.540 
done with the race how did it perform
well<00:04:41.830> no<00:04:42.830> drug<00:04:43.340> chains<00:04:43.610> start<00:04:44.450> with<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:45.550> I

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
well no drug chains start with and I

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.510 
well no drug chains start with and I
don't<00:04:47.480> know<00:04:47.690> about<00:04:47.840> clients<00:04:48.470> climbs<00:04:48.860> maybe<00:04:49.370> a

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
don't know about clients climbs maybe a

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.140 
don't know about clients climbs maybe a
bit<00:04:49.730> rounder<00:04:50.240> way<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.380> peddling<00:04:52.130> but<00:04:52.880> for<00:04:53.060> my

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
bit rounder way of peddling but for my

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.080 
bit rounder way of peddling but for my
pedaling<00:04:53.570> style<00:04:53.840> I<00:04:54.140> can<00:04:54.860> accelerate<00:04:55.580> like

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
pedaling style I can accelerate like

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.620 
pedaling style I can accelerate like
crazy

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
crazy

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.380 
crazy
so<00:04:59.630> exactly<00:05:01.600> if<00:05:02.600> anything<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.110> are<00:05:03.260> getting<00:05:03.590> a

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
so exactly if anything you are getting a

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.100 
so exactly if anything you are getting a
good<00:05:05.390> narrow<00:05:06.380> wide<00:05:06.620> chain<00:05:06.890> chain<00:05:07.520> ring<00:05:08.110> but

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
good narrow wide chain chain ring but

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.690 
good narrow wide chain chain ring but
for<00:05:09.290> me<00:05:09.410> this<00:05:09.980> is<00:05:10.040> here<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:10.550> stay<00:05:10.900> so<00:05:11.900> climbs<00:05:12.700> it

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
for me this is here to stay so climbs it

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.400 
for me this is here to stay so climbs it
definitely<00:05:14.120> felt<00:05:14.270> like<00:05:14.420> I<00:05:14.630> was<00:05:14.780> pushing<00:05:15.080> a

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
definitely felt like I was pushing a

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.620 
definitely felt like I was pushing a
lower<00:05:15.950> gear<00:05:16.250> which<00:05:16.670> was<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:16.910> good<00:05:17.180> thing<00:05:17.360> I

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
lower gear which was a good thing I

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.670 
lower gear which was a good thing I
noticed<00:05:18.290> that<00:05:18.500> I<00:05:18.740> know<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.250> helped<00:05:19.490> me<00:05:19.640> have<00:05:20.360> a

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
noticed that I know it helped me have a

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.920 
noticed that I know it helped me have a
smoother<00:05:21.680> around<00:05:22.040> pedaling<00:05:22.640> which<00:05:23.390> is<00:05:23.720> always

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
smoother around pedaling which is always

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.840 
smoother around pedaling which is always
great<00:05:24.200> but<00:05:24.950> what<00:05:25.280> I<00:05:25.310> noticed<00:05:25.790> for<00:05:25.970> sure<00:05:26.210> is<00:05:26.540> I

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
great but what I noticed for sure is I

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.750 
great but what I noticed for sure is I
could<00:05:28.850> accelerate<00:05:29.300> a<00:05:29.810> lot<00:05:30.200> faster<00:05:30.860> with<00:05:31.610> this

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
could accelerate a lot faster with this

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.640 
could accelerate a lot faster with this
chain<00:05:32.270> ring<00:05:32.450> I<00:05:32.660> don't<00:05:32.840> know<00:05:33.290> what<00:05:33.530> the

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
chain ring I don't know what the

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.790 
chain ring I don't know what the
mechanics<00:05:34.100> of<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:34.370> is<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:34.850> how<00:05:35.540> my<00:05:36.350> pedaling

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
mechanics of it is and how my pedaling

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.940 
mechanics of it is and how my pedaling
style<00:05:37.130> fits<00:05:37.760> this<00:05:38.570> type<00:05:38.630> of<00:05:39.140> chain<00:05:39.350> ring<00:05:39.530> but

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
style fits this type of chain ring but

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.000 
style fits this type of chain ring but
again<00:05:40.460> what<00:05:40.730> I<00:05:40.760> noticed<00:05:41.270> it<00:05:41.480> was<00:05:41.900> I<00:05:42.260> could

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
again what I noticed it was I could

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.680 
again what I noticed it was I could
accelerate<00:05:43.400> like<00:05:43.850> never<00:05:44.240> before

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
accelerate like never before

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.070 
accelerate like never before
so<00:05:44.990> all<00:05:45.620> in<00:05:45.890> all<00:05:46.040> I<00:05:46.430> think<00:05:46.700> is<00:05:47.030> it<00:05:47.180> there<00:05:47.870> is<00:05:48.050> a

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
so all in all I think is it there is a

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.410 
so all in all I think is it there is a
difference<00:05:48.500> I<00:05:48.770> don't<00:05:49.490> think<00:05:49.700> is<00:05:49.850> a<00:05:49.880> huge

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
difference I don't think is a huge

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.570 
difference I don't think is a huge
difference<00:05:50.660> but<00:05:51.020> definitely<00:05:51.650> something<00:05:52.550> that

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
difference but definitely something that

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.180 
difference but definitely something that
you<00:05:52.820> would<00:05:52.970> notice<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.590> like<00:05:54.590> I<00:05:54.710> mentioned

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
you would notice and like I mentioned

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.570 
you would notice and like I mentioned
earlier<00:05:55.280> for<00:05:56.270> me<00:05:56.840> this<00:05:57.320> was<00:05:57.590> worth<00:05:57.890> the<00:05:58.160> 50

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
earlier for me this was worth the 50

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.000 
earlier for me this was worth the 50
bucks<00:05:58.730> that<00:05:58.850> I<00:05:58.970> spent<00:05:59.270> for<00:05:59.510> it<00:05:59.600> so<00:05:59.930> I<00:06:00.290> hope<00:06:00.830> you

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
bucks that I spent for it so I hope you

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.950 
bucks that I spent for it so I hope you
guys<00:06:01.160> found<00:06:01.430> it<00:06:01.640> useful<00:06:02.060> have<00:06:02.360> any<00:06:02.510> comments

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
guys found it useful have any comments

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.370 
guys found it useful have any comments
let<00:06:03.080> me<00:06:03.110> know<00:06:03.230> and<00:06:03.950> the<00:06:04.730> section<00:06:05.090> below<00:06:05.380> until
