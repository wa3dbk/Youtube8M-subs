00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.460
 very good to everyone, how are you? 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.680
 mmm and well then here we are again 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.240
 with another new section of the corner of the 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.910
 little egg that on this occasion has 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.980
 played to stereo mix to this pokemon of 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.750
 type plant that the truth is that it is a 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.750
 good pokemon that I like very much 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.170
 and good the egg movement well now 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.720
 I'm just going to teach it's called an accurate fist 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.230
 this egg movement that now we 're going 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.050
 to see here 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 here we have it this egg movement is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.940
 of fight type and the truth is that it is 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.070
 pretty good 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.590
 I'm going to show you how we can get 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.480
 this web movement or I'm going to 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.649
 teach how we can get a is 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.409
 roaming apart from this movement with 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.149
 the egg movement that would be fist 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.219
 g string as you are watching here and 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.149
 also how can we get an ex 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.190
 roaming with spore attack at level 1 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.979
 later I will explain it to you but first of 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.710
 all let's start with the first one is 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.570
 roaming so you can learn fist 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.869
 accurate and the first thing we have to 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.320
 to do is have a female nouvelle da 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.990
 like nature does not matter any 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.130
 thing only has to be female and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:29.929
 well we are going to join this is nubul 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.539
 female with a male of vigorous this 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.869
 Pokemon has to have learned the 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.190
 accurate fist attack and what are we going to 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.440
 do as you are seeing here in the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.409
 image then let's put them together in the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.200
 kindergarten to this is female nubul with a 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.980
 vigor or macho who has learned this 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.010
 movement because the movement 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.530
 I found that I could learn snowball would be 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.080
 accurate fist and in this way then the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.300
 We will meet at the nursery and from there then 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.910
 there will be a snow bull with the movement 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.600
 egg that can learn accurate fist 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.460
 once we have a snow bull we have 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.830
 to get it from the nursery that 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.540
 come out macho male because because now 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.330
 let's do the following we are going to 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.370
 join the nursery to this is nubul that 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.680
 let us out of the nursery we have 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.710
 created with vigor or that does not come out male 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.710
 to put it together with this the female 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.440
 it can be a romis man man lum female 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.500
 and in this way then the breeding that comes out 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.470
 Well we will get a nice baby is romis 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.210
 with the right fist attack good here 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.820
 you are seeing that she just left me 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.950
 only to my and now we will see that 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.870
 here has hit the attack fist accurate 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.150
 now I will explain how we can 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.910
 get a slow mix with the movement 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.980
 egg that would be fist draw this is already 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.740
 more complicated because if you want it 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.310
 get you can only have a 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.060
 extremis with this attack then 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.980
 have a volume or economics 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.630
 if we have transferred it from the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.420
 black and white pokemon editions 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.489
 because there we could learn thanks to 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.590
 a movement tutor as this attack 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.019
 the attack fist draw 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.959
 this attack is an egg movement 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.709
 of zombies but of course in pokémon and that 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.330
 If it does not appear then we can not 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.580
 get it but we can only 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.640
 get it then we do have a lamp 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.010
 have learned the attack this and of 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.930
 this way so if we pass it to pokemon 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.049
 xy and we wanted it in the nursery 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.799
 we can get an economics with the 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.810
 attack that would be fist draw now you 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.090
 I'm going to show you how we can get a 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.239
 it's romy at level one that can learn 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.000
 spore and it's very easy because like all 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.700
 you know es romis evolves at level 23 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.290
 between what but April uma when climbing from 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.000
 level can not learn is because 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.170
 so then we will do the following 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.590
 we will have to go up to level 45 to 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.739
 2 is romis 1 male and one female 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.319
 up to level 45 when he learns sport to 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.840
 that he learns at level 45 we will join them 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.910
 to both of you at the nursery if you want 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.620
 also teach him germ bomb that what 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.349
 learn how we are seeing here at 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.049
 level 41 this way if we put them together 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.479
 in the nursery to both the pups that 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.699
 come out then we will leave with the attack 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.639
 spore and germ pump because also 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.560
 it would be a movement egg is roaming 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.260
 and well, this is the only method that 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.940
 we can still get romis at level 1 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.820
 with spore attack that the truth is 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.580
 that we would go much better you can train 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.400
 to a pokémon from level 1 and above all 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.470
 that you learn us by a because if 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.570
 we wait until you learn by 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.030
 level 45 and then we evolved it 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.310
 in briel um, it's always much better 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.130
 train the pokemon from more levels 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.590
 low and especially at level 1 and good 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.800
 here as we are seeing in force off 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.750
 we learn to fist at level 49 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.699
 and so you can put it together with snow 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.160
 world and good now I'm going to show you the 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.580
 Eggs movements that can learn 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.200
 it's roaming and these would be fake charm 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.080
 smack bounce booster and antofa 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.950
 Sparkling to blenders pump seed fist 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.010
 Accurate natural and fist 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.720
 drainage and well that's all I hope 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.430
 that you really liked this section 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.870
 this week from the corner of the poque 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.340
 egg that has been this pokemon's 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.560
