three<00:00:18.800> different<00:00:18.949> problems<00:00:19.580> that<00:00:19.730> I've

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
three different problems that I've

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.670 
three different problems that I've
noticed<00:00:20.420> when<00:00:20.900> you<00:00:21.020> can<00:00:21.140> do<00:00:21.259> this<00:00:21.470> type<00:00:21.619> of

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
noticed when you can do this type of

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.529 
noticed when you can do this type of
swap<00:00:22.450> number<00:00:23.450> one<00:00:23.689> problem<00:00:24.289> is<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.279> stud<00:00:26.150> that

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
swap number one problem is the stud that

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.359 
swap number one problem is the stud that
originally<00:00:27.410> would<00:00:27.529> have<00:00:27.650> held<00:00:27.829> the<00:00:27.980> draw<00:00:28.160> mine

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
originally would have held the draw mine

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.720 
originally would have held the draw mine
is<00:00:28.669> a<00:00:29.029> little<00:00:29.329> too<00:00:29.660> short<00:00:30.310> when<00:00:31.310> you<00:00:31.460> want<00:00:31.670> to

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
is a little too short when you want to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.460 
is a little too short when you want to
use<00:00:31.880> it<00:00:32.029> with<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.180> rotor<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.019> what<00:00:33.170> I<00:00:33.199> ought<00:00:33.440> to

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
use it with a rotor so what I ought to

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.650 
use it with a rotor so what I ought to
do<00:00:33.800> is<00:00:34.129> use<00:00:34.309> a<00:00:34.339> longer<00:00:34.640> stud<00:00:35.089> which<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.570> was

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
do is use a longer stud which it was

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.420 
do is use a longer stud which it was

there<00:00:54.519> now<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.580> other<00:00:55.790> two<00:00:56.030> problems<00:00:56.510> when

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
there now the other two problems when

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.990 
there now the other two problems when
you<00:00:56.930> mount<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.320> rotor<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.769> the<00:00:57.860> hub<00:00:58.040> can<00:00:58.280> be<00:00:58.430> is

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
you mount the rotor to the hub can be is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.539 
you mount the rotor to the hub can be is
that<00:00:59.299> this<00:00:59.570> Center<00:00:59.930> hole<00:01:00.170> has<00:01:00.710> a<00:01:00.739> little<00:01:01.369> bit

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
that this Center hole has a little bit

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.700 
that this Center hole has a little bit
larger<00:01:01.939> of<00:01:02.089> a<00:01:02.180> diameter<00:01:02.750> then<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.559> original

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
larger of a diameter then the original

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.289 
larger of a diameter then the original
drum<00:01:04.159> used<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.489> be<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:05.510> then<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:08.000> center

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
drum used to be and then the the center

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.590 
drum used to be and then the the center
hole<00:01:08.510> around<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:08.900> hub<00:01:09.430> focusing<00:01:10.430> on<00:01:10.549> that<00:01:10.729> is

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
hole around the hub focusing on that is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.830 
hole around the hub focusing on that is
a<00:01:12.350> little<00:01:12.500> larger<00:01:13.189> of<00:01:13.340> a<00:01:13.430> gap<00:01:13.610> here<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.659> was

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
a little larger of a gap here it was

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.719 
a little larger of a gap here it was
very<00:01:14.900> tight<00:01:15.409> originally<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.340> hub<00:01:16.520> and

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
very tight originally to the hub and

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.300 
very tight originally to the hub and
this<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.060> little<00:01:17.330> bit<00:01:17.450> wider<00:01:17.600> of<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:17.930> gap<00:01:18.110> here

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
this is a little bit wider of a gap here

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.860 
this is a little bit wider of a gap here
now<00:01:19.310> what<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.520> can<00:01:19.850> cause<00:01:20.060> is<00:01:20.330> is<00:01:20.570> when<00:01:20.750> you

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
now what that can cause is is when you

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.290 
now what that can cause is is when you
go<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.080> set<00:01:21.380> this<00:01:21.620> rotor<00:01:21.980> onto<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:22.520> hub<00:01:22.730> and

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
go to set this rotor onto the hub and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.350 
go to set this rotor onto the hub and
put<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.690> studs<00:01:23.930> through<00:01:24.230> it<00:01:24.770> can<00:01:24.950> sometimes

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
put the studs through it can sometimes

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.180 
put the studs through it can sometimes
have<00:01:26.360> movement<00:01:26.870> this<00:01:27.230> way<00:01:27.410> in<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:27.680> way<00:01:27.740> and

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
have movement this way in this way and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.530 
have movement this way in this way and
also<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.450> know<00:01:29.540> this<00:01:29.720> direction<00:01:30.290> as<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.710> spins

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
also you know this direction as it spins

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.750 
also you know this direction as it spins
so<00:01:32.540> what<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:32.840> opted<00:01:33.260> to<00:01:33.290> do<00:01:33.500> was<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:34.040> took<00:01:34.190> two

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
so what I opted to do was I took two

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.500 
so what I opted to do was I took two
studs<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:36.380> stud<00:01:36.650> here<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.250> then<00:01:37.550> going<00:01:38.330> to<00:01:38.360> be

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
studs the stud here and then going to be

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.030 
studs the stud here and then going to be
this<00:01:38.659> stud<00:01:38.900> here<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.470> I<00:01:39.620> put<00:01:39.830> them<00:01:39.920> in

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
this stud here and I put them in

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.580 
this stud here and I put them in
backwards<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.880> then<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:41.600> used<00:01:41.870> a<00:01:42.020> conical<00:01:42.440> seat

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
backwards and then I used a conical seat

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.890 
backwards and then I used a conical seat
lug<00:01:42.800> nut<00:01:44.110> just<00:01:45.110> like<00:01:45.260> this<00:01:45.470> one<00:01:45.650> here<00:01:46.010> and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
lug nut just like this one here and

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.180 
lug nut just like this one here and
tightened<00:01:47.900> it<00:01:47.990> down<00:01:48.020> as<00:01:48.350> tightly<00:01:48.560> as<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:48.950> could

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
tightened it down as tightly as I could

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.980 
tightened it down as tightly as I could
without<00:01:49.490> doing<00:01:49.970> any<00:01:50.090> damage<00:01:50.330> to<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.780> stud

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
without doing any damage to the stud

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.260 
without doing any damage to the stud
obviously<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.280> what<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.640> did<00:01:52.850> was<00:01:52.909> that

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
obviously and what that did was that

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.600 
obviously and what that did was that
cone<00:01:53.540> seat<00:01:53.990> on<00:01:54.170> that<00:01:54.350> lug<00:01:54.530> nut<00:01:54.770> helped<00:01:55.430> to

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
cone seat on that lug nut helped to

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.560 
cone seat on that lug nut helped to
perfectly<00:01:56.030> Center<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:57.080> rotor<00:01:57.320> onto<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.310> hub

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
perfectly Center the rotor onto the hub

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.050 
perfectly Center the rotor onto the hub
then<00:01:59.570> I<00:01:59.690> drove<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:01.040> rest<00:02:01.549> of<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:01.850> six

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
then I drove the rest of the six

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.690 
then I drove the rest of the six
openings<00:02:02.540> one<00:02:02.840> two<00:02:03.020> three<00:02:03.350> four<00:02:03.710> five<00:02:03.950> six<00:02:04.250> of

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
openings one two three four five six of
