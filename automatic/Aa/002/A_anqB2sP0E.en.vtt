00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
metal the roller that we have is capable

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.790 
metal the roller that we have is capable
of<00:01:02.710> bending<00:01:02.950> the<00:01:03.190> large<00:01:03.400> piece<00:01:03.640> of<00:01:03.809> plate<00:01:04.809> we

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
of bending the large piece of plate we

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.530 
of bending the large piece of plate we
usually<00:01:06.130> just<00:01:06.190> use<00:01:06.370> it<00:01:06.580> for<00:01:06.610> 10<00:01:07.000> in<00:01:07.210> and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
usually just use it for 10 in and

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.740 
usually just use it for 10 in and
lighter<00:01:08.229> metals<00:01:08.500> he<00:01:08.890> thinks<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.340> thickest<00:01:09.750> so

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
lighter metals he thinks the thickest so

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.660 
lighter metals he thinks the thickest so
it's<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:10.990> first<00:01:11.229> time<00:01:11.410> that<00:01:11.470> we've<00:01:11.740> ever<00:01:12.160> put

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.330 
and we could just rolled around like a
full<00:01:39.990> rotation<00:01:40.140> I'm<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.980> to<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.160> it<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
full rotation I'm just to get it a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.830 
full rotation I'm just to get it a
really<00:01:41.520> nice<00:01:41.640> circle<00:01:41.910> and<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.600> gonna<00:01:42.690> work

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
really nice circle and I'm gonna work

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.060 
really nice circle and I'm gonna work
out<00:01:43.020> great
