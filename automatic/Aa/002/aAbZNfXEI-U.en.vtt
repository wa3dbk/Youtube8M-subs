00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
gingerbread man shape which is just a

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.080 
gingerbread man shape which is just a
circular<00:00:19.170> head<00:00:19.820> and<00:00:20.820> then<00:00:21.890> two<00:00:22.890> arms<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.670> all

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
of this is just very curved not a whole

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:38.920 
of this is just very curved not a whole
lot<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.449> sharp<00:00:27.720> lines<00:00:31.850> and<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:33.120> two<00:00:33.420> legs

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:47.330 

again<00:00:39.930> very<00:00:40.260> curved<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:45.600> arm<00:00:45.960> parallel<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
again very curved the arm parallel to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.100 
again very curved the arm parallel to
the<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.850> just<00:00:48.059> did<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> looks<00:00:51.989> like

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the one you just did and it looks like

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.700 
the one you just did and it looks like
that<00:00:53.360> and<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.539> might<00:00:54.660> take<00:00:54.870> some<00:00:55.079> practice<00:00:55.289> at

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that and it might take some practice at

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.970 
that and it might take some practice at
first<00:00:56.539> but<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:58.109> should<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> general

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
first but that should be the general

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.479 
first but that should be the general
shape<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.440> then<00:01:01.440> from<00:01:01.739> there<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.219> like

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
shape of it and then from there I like

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.770 
shape of it and then from there I like
to<00:01:02.609> add<00:01:02.760> some<00:01:02.789> squiggly<00:01:03.480> lines<00:01:05.330> first<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.630> on

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
to add some squiggly lines first one on

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.600 
to add some squiggly lines first one on
top<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> head<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.000> then<00:01:09.380> on<00:01:10.380> each<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
top of the head and then on each of the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:21.500 
top of the head and then on each of the
limbs

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510
