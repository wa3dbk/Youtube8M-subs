seven times 1 is still 27 one won't just

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.200 
seven times 1 is still 27 one won't just
be<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> normal<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.920> example<00:00:50.579> would<00:00:50.700> be<00:00:50.760> one

be a normal one an example would be one

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.439 
be a normal one an example would be one
week<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.680> same<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.100> seven<00:00:53.399> days<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.239> if<00:00:54.329> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
week is the same as seven days so if I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.350 
week is the same as seven days so if I
put<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.960> week<00:00:55.199> over<00:00:55.800> seven<00:00:56.160> days<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:57.120> would

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
put one week over seven days that would

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.630 
put one week over seven days that would
be<00:00:57.570> equal<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.680> could<00:00:58.739> multiply<00:00:59.129> by

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
be equal to one and I could multiply by

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.000 
be equal to one and I could multiply by
this<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.629> able<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.989> change<00:01:01.320> units<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
this and be able to change units and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
this and be able to change units and
still<00:01:02.730> keep<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> value<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.690> same<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.199> our

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
still keep the value the same in our

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.950 
still keep the value the same in our
first<00:01:04.830> example<00:01:05.000> it's<00:01:06.000> estimated<00:01:06.630> that

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
first example it's estimated that

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.750 
first example it's estimated that
erosion<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.710> Horseshoe<00:01:08.220> Falls

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
erosion of the Horseshoe Falls

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.300 
erosion of the Horseshoe Falls
part<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> Niagara<00:01:09.570> Falls<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.080> less<00:01:10.740> than<00:01:11.010> 12

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
part of Niagara Falls is less than 12

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.030 
part of Niagara Falls is less than 12
inches<00:01:11.640> per<00:01:11.850> year<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:13.409> want<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> convert

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
inches per year and I want to convert

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.330 
inches per year and I want to convert
the<00:01:14.280> twelve<00:01:14.580> inches<00:01:15.000> into<00:01:15.270> centimeters<00:01:16.340> so

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the twelve inches into centimeters so

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.719 
the twelve inches into centimeters so
I'm<00:01:17.580> going<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> start<00:01:18.180> with<00:01:18.450> twelve<00:01:18.900> inches

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.810 

I'm<00:01:23.729> going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.240> multiply<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.810> by<00:01:25.350> two<00:01:26.310> point

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I'm going to multiply this by two point

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.520 
I'm going to multiply this by two point
five<00:01:27.180> four<00:01:30.140> centimeters<00:01:31.140> over<00:01:32.390> one<00:01:33.390> inch<00:01:34.020> I

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
five four centimeters over one inch I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.640 
five four centimeters over one inch I
can<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.790> because<00:01:36.409> 2.54<00:01:37.409> centimeters

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
can do this because 2.54 centimeters

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.359 
can do this because 2.54 centimeters
over<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.759> inch<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.270> equal<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
over one inch is equal to one and so I

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.940 
over one inch is equal to one and so I
won't<00:01:41.640> change<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.119> value<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:43.409> reason<00:01:43.799> why

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
won't change the value the reason why

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.920 
won't change the value the reason why
I'm<00:01:44.159> choosing<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.119> because<00:01:45.659> now<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
I'm choosing this is because now the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.889 
I'm choosing this is because now the
twelve<00:01:46.470> inches<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.920> started<00:01:47.369> with<00:01:47.520> if<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.390> want<00:01:48.689> I

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
twelve inches I started with if I want I

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.490 
twelve inches I started with if I want I
could<00:01:48.990> put<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:50.070> over<00:01:50.340> one<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.500> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
could put that that over one and the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.039 
could put that that over one and the
inches<00:01:52.979> in<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.369> numerator<00:01:53.909> would<00:01:54.720> cancel

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
inches in the numerator would cancel

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.219 
inches in the numerator would cancel
with<00:01:55.290> inches<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.189> denominator<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:57.200> now<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
with inches in the denominator and now I

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.709 
with inches in the denominator and now I
can<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.590> multiply<00:01:59.219> straight<00:01:59.280> across<00:01:59.790> 12

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
can just multiply straight across 12

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.950 
can just multiply straight across 12
times<00:02:01.170> two<00:02:01.469> point<00:02:01.740> five<00:02:02.070> four<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.719> equal<00:02:03.719> to

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
times two point five four is equal to

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.940 
times two point five four is equal to
thirty<00:02:04.430> point<00:02:05.430> four<00:02:05.820> eight<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:07.469> unit<00:02:07.829> I

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.510 
up I'm going to start with 330 meters
per<00:04:54.070> one<00:04:54.789> second<00:04:55.539> and<00:04:56.099> I'm<00:04:57.099> going<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.340> multiply

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
per one second and I'm going to multiply

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.480 
per one second and I'm going to multiply
by<00:04:58.120> one<00:04:58.450> and<00:04:58.660> one<00:04:59.289> is<00:04:59.440> going<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.740> take<00:05:00.039> the<00:05:00.220> form

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
by one and one is going to take the form

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:09.810 
by one and one is going to take the form
of<00:05:00.729> one<00:05:01.570> kilometer<00:05:01.990> over<00:05:05.849> 1,000<00:05:07.590> meters<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:09.070> do

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
of one kilometer over 1,000 meters I do

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.510 
of one kilometer over 1,000 meters I do
this<00:05:10.210> that's<00:05:10.570> going<00:05:10.810> to<00:05:10.900> allow<00:05:11.110> my<00:05:11.410> meters<00:05:12.070> to

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
this that's going to allow my meters to

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.400 
this that's going to allow my meters to
cancel<00:05:12.729> 1<00:05:13.270> in<00:05:13.389> the<00:05:13.510> numerator<00:05:13.660> 1<00:05:14.199> in<00:05:14.289> the

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
cancel 1 in the numerator 1 in the

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.390 
cancel 1 in the numerator 1 in the
denominator<00:05:14.590> I<00:05:15.720> then<00:05:16.720> multiply<00:05:16.900> this<00:05:17.260> by<00:05:17.800> one

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
denominator I then multiply this by one

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:26.089 
denominator I then multiply this by one
mile<00:05:19.120> over<00:05:21.060> one<00:05:22.060> point<00:05:22.560> six<00:05:23.560> one<00:05:23.979> kilometers

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
mile over one point six one kilometers

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:31.780 
mile over one point six one kilometers
again<00:05:27.099> this<00:05:27.280> allows<00:05:27.520> my<00:05:28.000> kilometers

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:38.360 

to<00:05:32.790> cancel<00:05:33.270> I<00:05:35.360> then<00:05:36.360> multiply<00:05:36.540> by<00:05:37.140> 60<00:05:37.860> seconds

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
to cancel I then multiply by 60 seconds

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:45.850 
to cancel I then multiply by 60 seconds
per<00:05:40.730> one<00:05:41.730> minute

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.380 

this<00:05:46.860> will<00:05:47.100> allow<00:05:47.250> my<00:05:47.520> seconds<00:05:48.090> in<00:05:48.270> the

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
this will allow my seconds in the

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.450 
this will allow my seconds in the
denominator<00:05:48.420> at<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.290> beginning<00:05:49.800> to<00:05:50.070> cancel

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
denominator at the beginning to cancel

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.230 
denominator at the beginning to cancel
with<00:05:50.550> my<00:05:50.790> seconds<00:05:51.300> in<00:05:51.480> the<00:05:51.660> numerator<00:05:51.810> and

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
with my seconds in the numerator and

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.510 
with my seconds in the numerator and
finally<00:05:54.240> I<00:05:54.390> multiply<00:05:54.990> by<00:05:55.290> 60<00:05:56.130> minutes<00:05:58.040> per<00:05:59.040> one

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
finally I multiply by 60 minutes per one

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.230 
finally I multiply by 60 minutes per one
hour<00:05:59.820> and<00:06:01.070> that<00:06:02.070> will<00:06:02.220> allow<00:06:02.460> my<00:06:02.700> minutes<00:06:03.060> to

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
hour and that will allow my minutes to

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.790 
hour and that will allow my minutes to
cancel<00:06:05.180> so<00:06:06.180> if<00:06:06.270> I<00:06:06.390> look<00:06:06.570> in<00:06:06.750> my<00:06:06.900> numerators<00:06:07.530> I

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
cancel so if I look in my numerators I

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.910 
cancel so if I look in my numerators I
only<00:06:08.010> have<00:06:08.310> miles<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.480> in<00:06:10.140> my<00:06:10.260> denominator<00:06:10.860> I

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
only have miles and in my denominator I

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.620 
only have miles and in my denominator I
only<00:06:11.160> have<00:06:11.340> hours<00:06:11.730> and<00:06:11.940> that's<00:06:12.090> what<00:06:12.300> we<00:06:12.390> want

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
only have hours and that's what we want

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
only have hours and that's what we want
miles<00:06:12.900> per<00:06:13.140> hour

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
miles per hour

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.480 
miles per hour
if<00:06:14.550> I<00:06:15.030> multiply<00:06:15.270> straight<00:06:15.870> across<00:06:16.010> 330<00:06:17.010> times

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
if I multiply straight across 330 times

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.910 
if I multiply straight across 330 times
one<00:06:17.760> times<00:06:18.090> one<00:06:18.300> times<00:06:18.510> 60<00:06:19.050> times<00:06:19.080> 60<00:06:19.410> I<00:06:20.660> get<00:06:21.920> 1

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
one times one times 60 times 60 I get 1

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.700 
one times one times 60 times 60 I get 1
million<00:06:24.350> 188,000<00:06:26.900> in<00:06:27.900> the<00:06:28.050> denominator<00:06:28.620> I<00:06:28.710> get

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
million 188,000 in the denominator I get

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.180 
million 188,000 in the denominator I get
1610<00:06:31.710> and<00:06:32.240> that's<00:06:33.240> miles<00:06:33.660> per<00:06:33.990> hour<00:06:34.170> and<00:06:34.560> this

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
1610 and that's miles per hour and this

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:43.540 
1610 and that's miles per hour and this
is<00:06:35.430> approximately<00:06:37.190> 738<00:06:38.600> miles<00:06:40.070> per<00:06:41.070> hour

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
is approximately 738 miles per hour

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.910 
is approximately 738 miles per hour
again<00:06:44.550> I<00:06:44.580> have<00:06:44.850> to<00:06:45.000> use<00:06:45.120> an<00:06:45.270> approximate<00:06:45.930> so

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920 
again I have to use an approximate so

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.030 
again I have to use an approximate so

the property of multiplicative identity

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.730 
the property of multiplicative identity
which<00:06:56.130> means<00:06:56.160> multiply<00:06:57.000> by<00:06:57.240> one<00:06:57.540> so<00:06:58.350> we
