00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
what I'm doing is I'm changing the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.789 
what I'm doing is I'm changing the
colors<00:01:51.450> here<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.750> dark<00:01:51.930> colors<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.409> change<00:01:52.680> I

colors here to dark colors I change I

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.789 
colors here to dark colors I change I
went<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> gradient<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:53.759> radial<00:01:54.590> can<00:01:55.590> put

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
went to gradient and then radial can put

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.990 
went to gradient and then radial can put
this<00:01:55.979> there<00:01:57.530> let's<00:01:58.530> go<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> darker<00:01:59.250> one<00:01:59.369> around

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
this there let's go a darker one around

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.819 
this there let's go a darker one around
there<00:02:01.430> now<00:02:02.430> that's<00:02:02.640> two<00:02:03.619> colors<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.649> you

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
there now that's two colors that you

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.260 
there now that's two colors that you
similar<00:02:05.189> there<00:02:05.369> let's<00:02:05.909> go<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> bit<00:02:06.210> lighter

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.330 

okay<00:02:10.270> now<00:02:10.929> instead<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:11.709> putting<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:12.040> at<00:02:12.100> center

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
okay now instead of putting it at center

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.580 
okay now instead of putting it at center
I'm<00:02:12.400> gonna<00:02:12.520> put<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.790> up<00:02:12.910> there<00:02:13.360> because<00:02:13.600> I

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
I'm gonna put it up there because I

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.870 
I'm gonna put it up there because I
think<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.830> looks<00:02:14.950> better<00:02:15.100> I've<00:02:15.580> done<00:02:15.850> a

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
think it looks better I've done a

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.970 
think it looks better I've done a
channel<00:02:16.209> law<00:02:16.270> similar<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.020> before<00:02:17.260> for

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
channel law similar to this before for

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.430 
channel law similar to this before for
someone<00:02:18.400> now<00:02:19.240> we're<00:02:19.450> gonna<00:02:19.540> make<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.870> font<00:02:20.140> it

gonna put Shappy there let's make this
around<00:02:55.690> 200<00:02:56.220> GIMP<00:02:57.220> doesn't<00:02:57.820> have<00:02:57.970> vector

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
around 200 GIMP doesn't have vector

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.350 
around 200 GIMP doesn't have vector
scaling<00:02:59.260> like<00:02:59.890> Photoshop<00:03:00.700> does<00:03:00.910> so<00:03:01.150> if<00:03:01.209> you

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
scaling like Photoshop does so if you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.550 
scaling like Photoshop does so if you
scale<00:03:01.570> things<00:03:01.750> around<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.260> will<00:03:02.380> get

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
scale things around it will get

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.040 
scale things around it will get
pixelated<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:04.410> that's<00:03:05.410> for<00:03:05.590> texts<00:03:06.069> and<00:03:07.050> what

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
pixelated and that's for texts and what

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.580 
pixelated and that's for texts and what
if<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.620> have<00:03:08.800> G<00:03:09.010> if<00:03:09.190> you<00:03:09.400> have<00:03:09.430> script<00:03:10.120> foo

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
if you have G if you have script foo

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.430 
if you have G if you have script foo
then<00:03:11.970> that's<00:03:12.970> good<00:03:13.209> but<00:03:13.390> if<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.600> don't<00:03:13.870> then

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
then that's good but if you don't then

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.039 
then that's good but if you don't then
you<00:03:15.250> should<00:03:15.579> probably<00:03:15.820> download<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.570> can<00:03:16.840> go

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
you should probably download it I can go

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.979 
you should probably download it I can go
and<00:03:17.290> find<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.829> download<00:03:18.280> link<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:18.850> if<00:03:19.420> you

let's<00:03:32.530> make<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:32.799> around<00:03:33.070> 6<00:03:35.310> boom<00:03:36.310> there<00:03:36.549> you

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
let's make this around 6 boom there you

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.789 
let's make this around 6 boom there you
have<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.180> then<00:03:37.329> let's<00:03:37.900> say<00:03:38.079> it<00:03:38.410> depends<00:03:38.739> on

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
have it and then let's say it depends on

but I've had this before so I'm just
going<00:07:04.030> to<00:07:04.120> show<00:07:04.240> you<00:07:04.270> how<00:07:04.360> to<00:07:04.480> solve<00:07:04.690> it<00:07:04.840> you

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.050 
going to show you how to solve it you

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.120 
going to show you how to solve it you
just<00:07:05.230> make<00:07:05.380> this<00:07:05.620> black<00:07:07.200> go<00:07:08.200> new<00:07:08.380> transparent

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.130 
just make this black go new transparent

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.390 
just make this black go new transparent
layer<00:07:09.190> you<00:07:09.730> paste<00:07:10.030> a<00:07:10.290> black<00:07:11.290> on<00:07:11.530> to<00:07:11.680> it<00:07:11.800> then

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
layer you paste a black on to it then

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.880 
layer you paste a black on to it then
you<00:07:12.520> put<00:07:12.760> this<00:07:13.150> black<00:07:13.480> layer<00:07:13.720> under<00:07:14.350> the<00:07:14.380> text

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
you put this black layer under the text

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.830 
you put this black layer under the text
around<00:07:15.280> there<00:07:15.520> then<00:07:16.240> you<00:07:16.360> just<00:07:16.540> turn<00:07:16.690> the

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 
around there then you just turn the

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.260 
around there then you just turn the
transparency<00:07:17.410> down<00:07:17.680> to<00:07:18.670> wherever<00:07:18.880> you<00:07:19.240> want

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
transparency down to wherever you want

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.190 
transparency down to wherever you want
to<00:07:19.540> it<00:07:19.600> with<00:07:19.810> this<00:07:20.020> thing<00:07:20.260> around<00:07:20.680> sixty<00:07:22.200> then

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:23.200 
to it with this thing around sixty then

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.830 
to it with this thing around sixty then
it'll<00:07:23.410> make<00:07:23.500> everything<00:07:23.920> in<00:07:24.130> the<00:07:24.220> background

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 
it'll make everything in the background

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.170 
it'll make everything in the background
darker<00:07:25.840> but<00:07:26.230> your<00:07:26.380> text<00:07:26.650> will<00:07:26.740> stick<00:07:26.920> out<00:07:27.070> so

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
darker but your text will stick out so

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.220 
darker but your text will stick out so
then<00:07:28.180> you'll<00:07:28.300> see<00:07:28.480> this<00:07:28.660> is<00:07:28.840> a<00:07:28.870> dark

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:29.230 
then you'll see this is a dark

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.050 
then you'll see this is a dark
background<00:07:29.530> so<00:07:30.070> it<00:07:30.130> won't<00:07:30.310> you<00:07:30.550> matter<00:07:30.730> but<00:07:30.970> if

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
background so it won't you matter but if

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.760 
background so it won't you matter but if
you<00:07:31.150> have<00:07:31.240> a<00:07:31.300> white<00:07:31.540> background<00:07:31.810> with<00:07:32.740> white

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:32.770
