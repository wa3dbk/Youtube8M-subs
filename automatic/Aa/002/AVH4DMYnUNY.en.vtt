 hello friends this is a video tutorial of 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.490
 answer about this video that I made of 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.880
 how to update the winning lb 9 with the 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.860
 Peruvian league 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.000
 they told me about a doubt for 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.000
 introduce the patches 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.230
 sure friend in fret in this 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.619
 folder but I tell you that this is not the 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.619
 correct 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.080
 what you have to do is the following 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.080
 download the winrar file 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.989
 once done this we unzip it 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.780
 doing this will leave us a folder in 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.290
 which are all 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.290
 updates 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.320
 we copy all these files 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.570
 now yes a lot of attention please 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.200
 we have two options the first one we are going to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.479
 my documents the konami folder we open 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.380
 until we reach forde 1 here we paste the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.380
 updates 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.460
 we mark this box and we give in 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.690
 copy and replace I canceled it because 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.690
 if I would not lose my data 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.680
 now we go to the second option that 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.610
 it would go to my pc local disk file 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.810
 of the program we look for the konami folder 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.310
 We open until we reach folder 1 and 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.729
 we do the same as with the other 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.729
 process 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.200
 well that's all I hope to have 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.030
 solved your problem and if you have another 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.280
 do not hesitate to ask 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.280
