00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
look at the games he played in he was an

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.670 
look at the games he played in he was an
absolute<00:01:38.040> fantastic<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.970> unflappable<00:01:39.900> for

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
absolute fantastic and unflappable for

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.670 
absolute fantastic and unflappable for
but<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.549> he<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.320> look<00:01:43.320> back<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
but you know and he I look back and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.080 
but you know and he I look back and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
think how he never got international

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.920 
think how he never got international
calls<00:01:45.860> or<00:01:46.860> he<00:01:47.250> got<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> England<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.720> be

calls or he got to the England the be
international<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.680> think<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.070> played<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.490> one

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610

international I think we played in one
game<00:01:50.759> together<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.960> he<00:01:52.079> never<00:01:52.439> got<00:01:52.590> beyond

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
game together but he never got beyond

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.609 
game together but he never got beyond
that<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.430> find<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:54.960> hard<00:01:55.380> suit

then and we I think sometimes we took
that<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:56.880> granted<00:02:56.910> with<00:02:57.420> him<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.660> know<00:02:57.810> and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
that for granted with him you know and

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.410 
that for granted with him you know and
didn't<00:02:58.830> give<00:02:59.040> Cyril<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.910> credit<00:03:00.240> that

didn't give Cyril the the credit that

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.890 
didn't give Cyril the the credit that
possibly<00:03:01.320> he<00:03:01.560> deserved<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.220> again

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
possibly he deserved and again

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.790 
possibly he deserved and again
internationally<00:03:03.900> he<00:03:03.930> didn't<00:03:04.380> get<00:03:04.650> the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
internationally he didn't get the

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.250 
internationally he didn't get the
recognition<00:03:05.100> that's<00:03:05.810> possibly<00:03:06.810> should<00:03:07.110> have

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
recognition that's possibly should have

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.830 
recognition that's possibly should have
