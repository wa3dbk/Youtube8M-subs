ordered them special from somebody and

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.490 
ordered them special from somebody and
make<00:01:09.409> sure<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.680> wiring<00:01:11.159> goes<00:01:12.229> goes<00:01:13.229> through

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
make sure the wiring goes goes through

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.359 
make sure the wiring goes goes through
there<00:01:14.479> comes<00:01:15.479> around<00:01:15.869> over<00:01:16.140> there

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.800 

there's<00:01:23.369> actually<00:01:23.759> some<00:01:24.000> lights<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.570> stole

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
there's actually some lights and stole

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.480 
there's actually some lights and stole
my<00:01:25.020> friend<00:01:25.259> did<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:26.420> when<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.600> actually

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
my friend did that when it's actually

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.490 
my friend did that when it's actually
printing<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.729> very<00:01:29.909> hot<00:01:30.319> lights<00:01:31.319> will

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
printing and very hot lights will

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.630 
printing and very hot lights will
flicker<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:32.340> normal<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:34.439> yeah<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.490> not

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
flicker that's normal that yeah it's not

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.249 
flicker that's normal that yeah it's not
an<00:01:35.759> issue<00:01:40.909> that's<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> controller<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
an issue that's the controller you

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.169 
an issue that's the controller you
actually<00:01:44.450> push<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.659> sink<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.060> could

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
actually push it sink and then you could

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.529 
actually push it sink and then you could
move<00:01:48.479> around<00:01:50.929> there's<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.849> proof<00:01:53.849> so<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> three

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
move around there's the proof so I three

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.669 
move around there's the proof so I three
I<00:01:54.569> built<00:01:55.459> this<00:01:56.459> case<00:01:57.049> was<00:01:58.049> printed<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
I built this case was printed on the

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:07.429 
I built this case was printed on the
Ultimaker<00:02:02.989> this<00:02:03.989> is<00:02:04.340> point2<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> think<00:02:06.439> where's

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
Ultimaker this is point2 I think where's

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:18.940 
Ultimaker this is point2 I think where's
the<00:02:07.560> point<00:02:07.799> one<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.549> I<00:02:08.910> don't<00:02:09.179> know<00:02:09.410> let's<00:02:10.410> check

this<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.320> on<00:02:28.440> windows<00:02:29.480> okay<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.660> actually

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
this is on windows okay I actually

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.450 
this is on windows okay I actually
printed<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.710> at<00:02:32.900> point<00:02:33.900> two<00:02:34.320> seven<00:02:34.650> cuz<00:02:35.340> i

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
printed that at point two seven cuz i

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.930 
printed that at point two seven cuz i
was<00:02:35.670> going<00:02:35.880> for<00:02:35.940> speed<00:02:37.310> okay<00:02:38.310> that's<00:02:38.760> how<00:02:38.880> i

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
was going for speed okay that's how i

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:49.070 
was going for speed okay that's how i
did<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:42.260> even<00:02:44.330> point<00:02:45.330> 27<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:46.500> pla<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:48.720> really

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
did that on the prison but the case is

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.700 
did that on the prison but the case is
PLA

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.670 

and<00:03:02.300> should<00:03:03.300> see<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.510> really<00:03:03.900> don't<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.230> room

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
and should see I really don't have room

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.350 
and should see I really don't have room
in<00:03:04.710> here<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:07.070> am<00:03:08.070> going<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.490> put<00:03:08.640> my<00:03:08.790> new<00:03:08.940> type<00:03:09.180> a

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
in here I am going to put my new type a

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.750 
in here I am going to put my new type a
machine<00:03:09.810> where<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.440> Ultimaker<00:03:10.770> is<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.400> just

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
machine where the Ultimaker is I just

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:22.710 
machine where the Ultimaker is I just
expanded<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.420> shelf

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.140 

give<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.440> an<00:03:23.530> idea<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:24.010> how<00:03:24.280> big<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:25.030> new

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
give you an idea of how big the new

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:32.730 
give you an idea of how big the new
machine<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:28.510> piece<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.380> wood<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:31.740> where

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
machine is this piece of wood is where

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.330 
machine is this piece of wood is where
it's<00:03:32.860> going<00:03:33.220> so<00:03:33.250> I'd<00:03:33.640> say<00:03:33.880> it's<00:03:34.060> a

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
it's going so I'd say it's a

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.740 
it's going so I'd say it's a
significantly<00:03:36.340> bigger<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:40.330> guy<00:03:40.480> who<00:03:40.540> put

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
significantly bigger and the guy who put

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.360 
significantly bigger and the guy who put
this<00:03:40.870> machine<00:03:41.290> together<00:03:41.530> my<00:03:41.860> engineering

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
this machine together my engineering

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.790 
this machine together my engineering
friend<00:03:42.670> jet<00:03:42.910> guy<00:03:43.150> he<00:03:44.020> actually<00:03:44.200> cut<00:03:44.530> me<00:03:44.680> the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
friend jet guy he actually cut me the

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.860 
friend jet guy he actually cut me the
new<00:03:44.920> case<00:03:46.020> so<00:03:47.310> yeah<00:03:48.420> it's<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.480> nice<00:03:49.600> machine<00:03:49.870> I

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
new case so yeah it's a nice machine I

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.360 
new case so yeah it's a nice machine I
actually<00:03:52.870> have<00:03:56.490> box<00:03:57.490> of<00:03:57.670> spare<00:03:57.880> parts<00:03:57.940> here

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
actually have box of spare parts here

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.949 
actually have box of spare parts here
nozzles<00:04:00.370> wires<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:04.260> this<00:04:05.260> this<00:04:06.010> plastic<00:04:06.550> box
