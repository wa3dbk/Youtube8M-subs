00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
but I missed look it's a really good at

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:23.730 
but I missed look it's a really good at
this<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:17.380> basically<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.800> will<00:03:20.580> then<00:03:22.740> watch

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
this but basically I will then watch

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.470 
this but basically I will then watch
example<00:03:24.310> think<00:03:24.700> this<00:03:24.820> one<00:03:25.350> look<00:03:26.350> at<00:03:26.440> this<00:03:26.500> one

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
example think this one look at this one

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.970 
example think this one look at this one
this<00:03:28.480> was<00:03:28.690> an<00:03:28.810> African<00:03:29.290> palm<00:03:29.500> tree<00:03:31.860> she<00:03:32.860> got

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
this was an African palm tree she got

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.280 
this was an African palm tree she got
away<00:03:33.070> too<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:37.000> anyways<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:37.570> this<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.020> a<00:03:38.050> night

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
away too but anyways and this is a night

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.190 
away too but anyways and this is a night
like<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.970> is<00:03:40.270> like<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.870> middle<00:03:41.020> of<00:03:41.140> the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
like this is like the middle of the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.130 
like this is like the middle of the
night<00:03:41.380> it's<00:03:41.680> like<00:03:41.830> probably<00:03:41.980> twelve<00:03:43.140> twelve

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
night it's like probably twelve twelve

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:52.020 
night it's like probably twelve twelve
and<00:03:44.350> nine<00:03:44.850> eleven<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.890> there<00:03:51.520> you<00:03:51.610> go<00:03:51.730> that's

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
and nine eleven so there you go that's

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.070 
and nine eleven so there you go that's
my<00:03:52.270> night-vision<00:03:52.870> setup<00:03:54.030> just<00:03:55.030> another<00:03:55.570> one<00:03:55.870> I

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
my night-vision setup just another one I

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.740 
my night-vision setup just another one I
missed<00:03:56.470> again<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:59.550> but<00:04:00.550> that<00:04:00.730> was<00:04:00.760> because<00:04:01.180> my

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
missed again so but that was because my

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.110 
missed again so but that was because my
aim<00:04:02.020> was<00:04:02.410> on<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.460> crosshairs<00:04:04.710> my<00:04:05.710> my<00:04:06.490> aim<00:04:06.760> was

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
aim was on the crosshairs my my aim was

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.890 
aim was on the crosshairs my my aim was
lower

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
lower

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.020 
lower
so<00:04:08.380> either<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.220> understand<00:04:09.610> why<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:09.790> was

I was like why am i hitting this thing
and<00:04:30.670> I<00:04:31.600> find<00:04:31.840> out<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.290> my<00:04:32.730> aim<00:04:33.730> was<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.030> little

and I find out that my aim was a little

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.190 
and I find out that my aim was a little
bit<00:04:34.480> lower<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:38.910> what<00:04:39.910> I<00:04:39.940> did<00:04:40.060> was<00:04:40.540> I<00:04:40.750> aim<00:04:41.170> a

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
bit lower so what I did was I aim a

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.270 
bit lower so what I did was I aim a
little<00:04:41.380> higher<00:04:41.560> I<00:04:41.950> got<00:04:43.260> enough<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.440> that<00:04:44.590> I<00:04:44.860> got

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
little higher I got enough to that I got

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.380 
little higher I got enough to that I got
every<00:04:45.550> single<00:04:45.580> shot<00:04:47.460> but<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:49.090> one<00:04:49.240> right

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
every single shot but that one right

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.159 
every single shot but that one right

after that what's nice now and after

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.339 
after that what's nice now and after
that<00:05:00.710> I<00:05:01.710> guess<00:05:02.220> some<00:05:02.460> rats<00:05:03.050> but<00:05:04.050> I'm<00:05:04.139> not<00:05:04.199> going

right these one of these one of these
brackets

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
brackets

00:05:53.849 --> 00:06:00.760 
brackets
what<00:05:54.659> are<00:05:54.750> we<00:05:54.840> call<00:05:55.080> them<00:05:56.449> to<00:05:57.449> attach<00:05:57.750> my

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.270 

camera<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:02.009> my<00:06:02.039> scope<00:06:03.320> top<00:06:04.320> of<00:06:04.470> that<00:06:04.590> that<00:06:05.190> was

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
camera to my scope top of that that was

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.070 
camera to my scope top of that that was
a<00:06:05.310> pretty<00:06:05.550> solid<00:06:05.759> that's<00:06:06.630> a<00:06:06.750> pretty<00:06:06.900> solid

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
a pretty solid that's a pretty solid

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.240 
a pretty solid that's a pretty solid
bill<00:06:07.590> right<00:06:07.800> there

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
bill right there

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:16.100 
bill right there
but<00:06:08.909> then<00:06:09.180> I<00:06:09.710> got<00:06:10.710> me<00:06:10.860> screw<00:06:13.310> to<00:06:14.310> put<00:06:14.610> it<00:06:15.110> right

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
but then I got me screw to put it right

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:22.969 
but then I got me screw to put it right
here<00:06:16.880> what<00:06:17.880> this<00:06:18.060> does<00:06:19.789> it<00:06:20.900> relieves<00:06:21.979> the

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
here what this does it relieves the

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.860 
here what this does it relieves the
stress<00:06:24.409> from<00:06:25.409> here<00:06:26.150> there's<00:06:27.150> stress<00:06:27.570> right

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
stress from here there's stress right

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.110 
stress from here there's stress right
there<00:06:28.169> because<00:06:29.099> this<00:06:29.550> is<00:06:29.699> a<00:06:29.729> little<00:06:30.000> bit

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
there because this is a little bit

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.510 
there because this is a little bit
heavier<00:06:30.509> for<00:06:30.690> the<00:06:30.780> scope<00:06:31.130> so<00:06:32.130> if<00:06:32.250> you<00:06:32.340> don't

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
heavier for the scope so if you don't

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.029 
heavier for the scope so if you don't
have<00:06:32.639> well<00:06:33.180> at<00:06:33.960> least<00:06:34.110> in<00:06:34.289> my<00:06:34.409> case<00:06:34.440> I<00:06:34.650> didn't

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
have well at least in my case I didn't

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.620 
have well at least in my case I didn't
have<00:06:35.250> it<00:06:35.460> it<00:06:35.909> used<00:06:36.150> to<00:06:36.270> tilt<00:06:36.630> the<00:06:36.750> camera<00:06:36.960> down

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
have it it used to tilt the camera down

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:44.300 
have it it used to tilt the camera down
so<00:06:39.919> put<00:06:40.919> that<00:06:40.949> there<00:06:41.659> it's<00:06:42.979> just<00:06:43.979> really

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
so put that there it's just really

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.020 
so put that there it's just really
getting<00:06:44.550> some<00:06:44.909> stress<00:06:45.270> on<00:06:45.419> that<00:06:45.599> scope<00:06:47.840> so

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
getting some stress on that scope so

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.510 
getting some stress on that scope so
I<00:06:50.530> think<00:06:51.530> that<00:06:52.310> works<00:06:52.580> perfectly
