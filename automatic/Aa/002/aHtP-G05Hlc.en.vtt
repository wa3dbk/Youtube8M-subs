00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.780
 visas with you i'm an elephant and today we have 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.210
 away 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.750
 team captain for 4 Oleg Oleg 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.230
 please introduce yourself, good evening 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.890
 My name is Oleg Nickname magic I play for 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.250
 the z4 command is like this 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.690
 captain as i said here recently 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.809
 passed qualifying 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.309
 techlabs and qualification in Moscow from here 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:44.579
 on March 23 here as already known to many 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.010
 you passed that is qualifying passed 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.350
 What are your impressions of the game which 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.170
 were expecting 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.699
 were these expectations also justified 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.120
 opponents and so on but all 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.559
 more detail please just command 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.680
 Recently, in principle, formed 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.309
 probably even three weeks will not be here 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.920
 so many had to sacrifice as 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.880
 organization of such and some kind of personal 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.510
 preferences 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.390
 for the sake of success, let's say so the type of choice is not 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.310
 was actually had to give everything 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.400
 at all to show that something we 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.159
 nevertheless we can here the composition on this 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.159
 The moment in my opinion is only 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.380
 at the development stage but we are already showing 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.710
 results are not going on this 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.229
 stop what was expected what is up 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.600
 waited for a rival in principle no one was 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.150
 ready to me it seems to what we play 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.400
 would be a new team new team 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.430
 I think it is because of this we 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.070
 still won 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.280
 Well, that is, I watched watching the game 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.560
 yours against 3d clans against rox.kis yourself 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.149
 honestly looking even by their style 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.149
 games by what they were picking 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.880
 so they did not expect such a game 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.350
 from you just just guys were not 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.349
 are you ready are you going to Moscow 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.390
 if rand is in principle satisfied of course 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.560
 actually get that we are one 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.910
 of 4 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.610
 top teams in the CIS, we proved it 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.640
 I am very pleased with the result of course 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.980
 I would also like to show something and 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:32.130
 Moscow that is not to be in the top 4 second 31 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.780
 places like how to get ready but in known 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.620
 on the bottom will be at the moment we 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.769
 are trying 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.430
 secure that we have nothing 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.050
 we do not think out more we sharpen 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.530
 discipline try to do 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.080
 less superfluous but somehow accent 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.080
 goes for it basically that is nothing 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:56.819
 There were no plans yet 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.730
 here after. dogs you will be time you can 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.360
 there will be something and think how to improve 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.830
 our style of play bring something add 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:12.030
 it may be new chips that do not know 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.940
 like this about four days games 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.430
 the main numbers I interrupt does not scare summer 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.130
 in Moscow you will play swear to some 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:26.489
 ice navi there m pairs it does not scare back 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:28.400
 familiar enough with most players 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.890
 of these teams 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.180
 talked then talked a lot in Kiev 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:40.859
 communicated on ossus I thought we can do that 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:46.019
 it still show the same hour, plus their 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:48.510
 new roadster slightly modified na'vi 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.730
 not the fact that someone out there of them 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.630
 coming from foreigners will also 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.760
 team with butter pancake well and most basic 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.480
 opponents will probably be virtus.pro 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.720
 I must consider the tournament favorites with them 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.329
 need to be at the limit 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.230
 played anyone today with them again 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.810
 lost 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.630
 they surprised us with their peaks with these 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:17.760
 non-standard ie the game is read 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:21.560
 in advance while specifically oppose 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:24.530
 they were essentially nothing 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.490
 yes of course we didn’t want a finger all ours from 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.070
 and played default I think time will tell 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.950
 how it all depends on how we react 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.200
 for training but stayed here and 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.270
 what approach to this is generally new 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.190
 maximally enhanced natasha hours 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.590
 day on this non-stop play tournaments 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.470
 all sorts of here we try to show 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.230
 the result we try to be lit because 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.720
 what's the enthusiasm as you know 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.600
 you will not go far to create such 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.680
 prestigious organization learn to do 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.300
 zhilochkam fell final position to 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.979
 the offer is there but it's all for now 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.710
 the moment is at the negotiation stage 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.710
 there is nothing to say on this particular 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.810
 I can’t eat 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.800
 sentence you noticed but i think 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.979
 after after the number of dog it would be them 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.500
 more you show something good yourself 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.479
 will follow you and wanting of course 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.760
 good luck on it 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.160
 would love to hear oligarch tournaments 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.200
 what are you currently involved in or 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.880
 plan in the near future 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:35.000
 participate well at the moment big 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.330
 point battle play out in the home 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.300
 part of the main qualifications here 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:48.380
 waiting for the grid to appear 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:49.240
 won at Le league play and now and in 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.880
 groves 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.669
 the organization is also conducting its league there 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.700
 also trying to light up that is in this 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:00.800
 already there yes we have 2 already played 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.110
 the first matches so far everything is successful with us 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.500
 of course I also wanted to ask about 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.310
 salad do you play there in what 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:13.130
 division 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:16.010
 well and so on specifically one and a half I 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.500
 I can’t say anything because 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.440
 we are now very tough on this 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.690
 about going 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.330
 I think all the same new season 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.030
 Starladdera you see us all we 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:35.150
 show that somewhere just 1 series is not 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:38.540
 lower itar tass have the opportunity to get 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.240
 coolest opportunity yes good well i 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:45.770
 I think we will finish all seven 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.700
 questions we are interested in are exhausted by you 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:52.160
 I want to wish 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.730
 great big luck on Moscow 23
