00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.900 
like to show you quickly is I made my
own<00:00:28.050> design<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> perk<00:00:29.310> machine<00:00:29.670> because

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
own design for a perk machine because

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730 
own design for a perk machine because
you<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.090> how<00:00:30.269> every<00:00:30.510> map<00:00:30.750> zombie<00:00:31.439> Matt<00:00:31.590> they

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
you know how every map zombie Matt they

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.990 
you know how every map zombie Matt they
come<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.160> they<00:00:32.279> always<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> new<00:00:32.790> perk

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
come up with they always have a new perk

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.630 
come up with they always have a new perk
machine<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.410> mine<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.309> prototype

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
machine so this is mine it's a prototype

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.240 
machine so this is mine it's a prototype
I<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.630> could<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.829> finished<00:00:37.980> design

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
I I could have the finished design

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.799 
I I could have the finished design
completely<00:00:38.730> different<00:00:39.090> from<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.329> one<00:00:39.390> but

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
completely different from this one but

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.700 
completely different from this one but
basically<00:00:41.840> right<00:00:42.840> now<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.200> called<00:00:43.410> dual

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
basically right now it's called dual

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.709 
basically right now it's called dual
mania<00:00:44.129> I've<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.520> actually<00:00:45.239> given<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.570> good

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the silver or white this is the machine

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.900 
the silver or white this is the machine
it's<00:00:58.260> about<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.620> tall<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.219> quick<00:00:59.640> revive

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
it's about as tall as the quick revive

machine 5 feet by 6 feet tall and what

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.299 
machine 5 feet by 6 feet tall and what
it<00:01:03.840> does<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.350> gives<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> user<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.159> ability

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it does is it gives the user the ability

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.300 
it does is it gives the user the ability
to<00:01:05.939> dual-wield<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.780> smgs<00:01:07.500> pistols<00:01:08.070> and

to dual-wield all smgs pistols and
pistol<00:01:08.670> size<00:01:08.820> wonder<00:01:09.150> weapons<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:10.080> includes

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
pistol size wonder weapons that includes

pistol size wonder weapons that includes
the<00:01:10.680> reagan<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.310> winters<00:01:11.700> howl<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.240> infernal

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.510 

but<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.259> course<00:01:16.470> there<00:01:16.650> are<00:01:16.740> limitations<00:01:17.100> with

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
but of course there are limitations with

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.929 
but of course there are limitations with
only<00:01:18.020> smgs<00:01:19.020> pistols<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.189> pistol<00:01:20.729> sized

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
wonder weapons so there are some

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
wonder weapons so there are some
limitations<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> perk<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.770> guys

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950

could change that be great but um well
to<00:01:33.509> those<00:01:33.689> tips<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.560> tricks<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> was

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to those tips and tricks that I was

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.660 
to those tips and tricks that I was
going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.610> show<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:37.040> first<00:01:38.040> thing<00:01:38.340> is

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
going to show you first thing is

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.330 
going to show you first thing is
something<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.659> people<00:01:39.720> get<00:01:40.650> messed<00:01:41.130> up

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
something that people get messed up

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.859 
something that people get messed up
about<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.640> lot<00:01:42.000> our<00:01:42.470> circles<00:01:44.600> you<00:01:45.600> want<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> make

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
about a lot our circles you want to make

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.260 
about a lot our circles you want to make
a<00:01:45.930> circle<00:01:46.320> find<00:01:47.070> something<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.909> circle

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
a circle find something that's a circle

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:56.350 
a circle find something that's a circle
and<00:01:48.420> trace<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.520> that's<00:01:50.600> kind<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.659> obvious<00:01:54.920> but

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
and trace it that's kind of obvious but

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.789 
and trace it that's kind of obvious but
kind<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.390> doing<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:57.930> hand<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> can't

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
kind of doing this one hand so I can't

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.060 
kind of doing this one hand so I can't
really<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.310> well<00:01:59.490> but<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.890> know<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
really do this so well but I know it's a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
really do this so well but I know it's a
horrible<00:02:02.280> circle<00:02:02.670> half<00:02:03.509> circle<00:02:04.310> but<00:02:05.310> uh<00:02:05.340> you

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
horrible circle half circle but uh you

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.300 
horrible circle half circle but uh you
get<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.329> idea<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.810> trace<00:02:07.500> it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
get the idea just trace it

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
inside of the circle is that it will be

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.059 
inside of the circle is that it will be
the<00:02:19.380> same<00:02:19.530> size<00:02:19.800> as<00:02:20.069> what<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.370> traced<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:22.069> a

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
lot of the thing is um this is just one

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.979 
lot of the thing is um this is just one
layered<00:02:26.580> cardboard<00:02:27.150> there's<00:02:27.330> only<00:02:27.450> one<00:02:27.750> layer
