uses<00:01:46.170> out<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> will<00:01:47.520> explain<00:01:47.700> how

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
uses out of this but I will explain how

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.480 
uses out of this but I will explain how
I<00:01:48.300> used<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.200> flat<00:01:49.470> foundation<00:01:49.740> brush<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.400> apply

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
I used a flat foundation brush to apply

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.430 
I used a flat foundation brush to apply
this<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.910> my<00:01:51.030> skin<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.390> find<00:01:51.750> it<00:01:51.960> gets<00:01:52.170> really

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
this to my skin I find it gets really

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.380 
this to my skin I find it gets really
good<00:01:52.560> coverage<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.430> don't<00:01:53.670> waste<00:01:53.910> an<00:01:54.150> E<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
good coverage you don't waste an E and

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.240 
good coverage you don't waste an E and
you<00:01:55.080> can<00:01:55.230> really<00:01:55.380> share<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.830> out<00:01:55.890> where<00:01:56.160> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you can really share it out where you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.470 
you can really share it out where you
don't<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.490> need<00:01:56.730> as<00:01:56.880> much<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.300> you<00:01:57.360> can

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
don't really need as much and you can

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.940 
don't really need as much and you can
really<00:01:57.930> layer<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.590> center<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
really layer it on in the center of the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.890 
really layer it on in the center of the
face<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.370> I<00:01:59.580> found<00:01:59.790> using<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.330> with<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
face and I found using this with the

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.020 
face and I found using this with the
part<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.710> face<00:02:01.860> mask<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.220> used<00:02:02.490> very<00:02:02.610> very

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
part of the face mask I used very very

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.910 
part of the face mask I used very very
little<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.330> it<00:02:03.420> comparatively<00:02:04.050> this<00:02:04.560> product

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
little of it comparatively this product

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.630 
little of it comparatively this product
almost<00:02:05.130> looks<00:02:05.550> like<00:02:05.810> gray<00:02:06.810> tar<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.489> you're

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
almost looks like gray tar and as you're

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.190 
almost looks like gray tar and as you're
painting<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:08.970> on<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.179> face<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.599> almost

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
painting it on your face it almost

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.930 
painting it on your face it almost
immediately<00:02:10.470> starts<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.069> dry<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.580> lighten<00:02:11.790> up

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
immediately starts to dry and lighten up

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.940 
immediately starts to dry and lighten up
in<00:02:12.150> color<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:12.959> there's<00:02:13.110> also<00:02:13.290> chunks<00:02:13.830> of

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
in color but there's also chunks of

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.170 
in color but there's also chunks of
little<00:02:14.160> black<00:02:14.280> things<00:02:14.609> in<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.030> can

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
little black things in it that can

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.610 
little black things in it that can
sometimes<00:02:15.540> fall<00:02:15.689> off<00:02:15.840> your<00:02:15.989> face<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.409> I<00:02:16.500> was

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
sometimes fall off your face and I was

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.959 
sometimes fall off your face and I was
kind<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:16.769> like<00:02:16.890> what's<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.489> about<00:02:17.730> but

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
kind of like what's this about but

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:18.970 
kind of like what's this about but
apparently<00:02:18.269> it's<00:02:18.480> all<00:02:18.599> apart

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
apparently it's all apart

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.080 
apparently it's all apart
the<00:02:19.099> glandular<00:02:19.280> experience<00:02:21.970> it's<00:02:22.970> a

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the glandular experience it's a

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.809 
the glandular experience it's a
game-changer<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.890> I'm<00:02:25.040> really<00:02:25.250> reluctant<00:02:25.519> to

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
game-changer and I'm really reluctant to

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.030 
game-changer and I'm really reluctant to
say<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.269> I'm<00:02:26.510> like<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:27.110> am<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.650> last<00:02:27.860> person

I get my breakouts so as you can see

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.339 
I get my breakouts so as you can see
from<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.120> clip<00:02:50.299> this<00:02:50.599> is<00:02:50.750> how<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.900> apply<00:02:51.290> it

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349

from the clip this is how I apply it
obviously<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.310> share<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.760> out<00:02:52.849> a<00:02:52.910> lot<00:02:53.239> more

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
obviously I share it out a lot more

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.750 
obviously I share it out a lot more
around<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.260> perimeter<00:02:54.799> of<00:02:54.830> my<00:02:55.160> face<00:02:55.400> because

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
I don't need it there a lot they're not

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.350 
I don't need it there a lot they're not
my<00:02:56.989> problem<00:02:57.319> areas<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.920> I<00:02:58.640> leave<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.910> on<00:02:59.000> for

my problem areas and I leave it on for

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.270 
my problem areas and I leave it on for
about<00:02:59.420> 20<00:02:59.840> minutes<00:02:59.989> during<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.739> 20<00:03:01.010> minutes

will continue to use with the flat
foundation<00:04:29.419> brush<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:30.050> if<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.200> don't<00:04:30.380> use<00:04:30.530> a

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560

flat

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.640 
flat
brush<00:04:31.389> try<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:32.050> think<00:04:32.230> it'd<00:04:32.320> make<00:04:32.350> a<00:04:32.530> big

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.140 
brush try it I think it'd make a big
difference<00:04:33.010> so<00:04:33.190> I<00:04:33.400> think<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.700> fact<00:04:33.850> that<00:04:34.000> I

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
difference so I think the fact that I

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.150 
difference so I think the fact that I
