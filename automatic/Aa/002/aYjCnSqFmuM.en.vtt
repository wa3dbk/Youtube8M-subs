kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.590> stuff<00:01:55.829> around<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.189> house<00:01:56.340> take

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
kind of do stuff around the house take

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.120 
kind of do stuff around the house take
them<00:01:56.850> out<00:01:56.969> rinse<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.450> mouth<00:01:57.509> out<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.710> your

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
teeth are beautifully white in that one

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.249 
teeth are beautifully white in that one
hour<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.890> think<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.430> says<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.880> removes<00:02:03.540> years<00:02:04.079> of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
just because that's how I remember to do

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.550 
just because that's how I remember to do
it<00:02:33.360> because<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.660> know<00:02:33.720> I<00:02:33.840> do<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.140> every<00:02:34.350> three

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
it because I know I do that every three

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.300 
it because I know I do that every three
months<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.610> um<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.570> think<00:02:37.350> they're<00:02:37.830> great<00:02:38.040> I

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
months so um I think they're great I

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.830 
months so um I think they're great I
don't<00:02:38.430> have<00:02:38.790> any<00:02:38.910> sensitivity<00:02:39.300> with<00:02:39.720> these

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
don't have any sensitivity with these

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.500 
don't have any sensitivity with these
now<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.050> have<00:02:40.380> used<00:02:40.590> crest<00:02:40.980> strips<00:02:41.520> before<00:02:41.700> that

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
now I have used crest strips before that

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.270 
now I have used crest strips before that
I<00:02:42.540> had<00:02:42.720> sensitivity<00:02:43.470> when<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> use<00:02:43.860> them<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.250> I

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
I had sensitivity when I use them and I

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.440 
I had sensitivity when I use them and I
think<00:02:44.520> there<00:02:44.640> were<00:02:44.730> more<00:02:44.880> ones<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.360> had

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
think there were more ones that you had

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.780 
think there were more ones that you had
to<00:02:45.570> use<00:02:45.690> like<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.250> think<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.310> had<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.490> use<00:02:47.640> them

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
to use like I think I had to use them

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.990 
to use like I think I had to use them
for<00:02:48.000> four<00:02:48.750> five<00:02:49.530> days<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.100> row<00:02:50.130> for<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.790> half

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
for four five days in a row for a half

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.630 
for four five days in a row for a half
hour<00:02:51.120> each<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.740> might<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:52.980> did<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.280> for<00:02:53.520> my

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
hour each I might and I did that for my

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.070 
hour each I might and I did that for my
wedding<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:54.240> couple<00:02:54.540> years<00:02:54.720> ago<00:02:54.900> three

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
wedding like couple years ago three

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.350 
wedding like couple years ago three
years<00:02:55.110> ago<00:02:55.320> but<00:02:55.860> my<00:02:56.040> teeth<00:02:56.400> were<00:02:56.610> super<00:02:57.209> super

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
years ago but my teeth were super super

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.910 
years ago but my teeth were super super
sensitive<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.990> I<00:02:58.020> still<00:02:58.290> remember<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.890> I

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
sensitive and I still remember that so I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.400 
sensitive and I still remember that so I
was<00:02:59.040> really<00:02:59.280> hesitant<00:02:59.610> about<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.270> but<00:03:01.020> I

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
was really hesitant about this but I

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.020 
was really hesitant about this but I
decided<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.250> give<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.580> try<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.850> had

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
decided to give this a try I had

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.850 
decided to give this a try I had
something<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.450> go<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:03.959> wanted<00:03:04.170> my<00:03:04.350> teeth

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
something to go to and I wanted my teeth

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.880 
something to go to and I wanted my teeth
to<00:03:05.010> be<00:03:05.100> a<00:03:05.130> little<00:03:05.370> bit<00:03:05.490> whiter<00:03:05.700> um<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:07.260> this

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
to be a little bit whiter um and this

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.330 
to be a little bit whiter um and this
definitely<00:03:08.700> I<00:03:09.380> enjoyed<00:03:10.380> way<00:03:10.680> more<00:03:10.950> than<00:03:11.160> those

after<00:03:27.380> because<00:03:28.380> you've<00:03:28.620> already<00:03:28.830> removed<00:03:29.100> all

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
after because you've already removed all

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.310 
after because you've already removed all
the<00:03:29.670> plaque<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:29.910> stuff<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.720> not<00:03:30.930> trying

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
the plaque and stuff so it's not trying

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.300 
the plaque and stuff so it's not trying
to<00:03:31.410> eat<00:03:31.560> through<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.100> it's<00:03:32.190> just

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
to eat through that and it's just

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.420 
to eat through that and it's just
whitening<00:03:33.150> but<00:03:33.780> which<00:03:34.440> makes<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.890> work<00:03:35.190> much

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
whitening but which makes that work much

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.979 
whitening but which makes that work much
better<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.880> that's<00:03:36.000> when<00:03:36.209> I<00:03:36.239> started<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.810> and

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
better so that's when I started this and

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.960 
better so that's when I started this and
then<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.110> kind<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.440> kept<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.769> up<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.010> sometimes

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
then I kind of kept it up and sometimes

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.759 
then I kind of kept it up and sometimes
it<00:03:39.120> follows<00:03:39.420> right<00:03:39.600> around<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:40.110> same<00:03:40.260> time<00:03:40.320> as

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
it follows right around the same time as

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.110 
it follows right around the same time as
when<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:40.950> get<00:03:41.160> my<00:03:41.280> teeth<00:03:41.519> cleaned<00:03:41.610> because<00:03:41.940> I

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
when I get my teeth cleaned because I

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.220 
when I get my teeth cleaned because I
get<00:03:42.239> them<00:03:42.360> cleaned<00:03:42.570> every<00:03:42.750> six<00:03:42.810> months

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
get them cleaned every six months

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.650 
get them cleaned every six months
sometimes<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:44.130> doesn't<00:03:44.280> but<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:45.299> try<00:03:45.600> to

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
sometimes it doesn't but I try to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.479 
sometimes it doesn't but I try to
remember<00:03:46.110> when<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:46.530> get<00:03:46.709> my<00:03:46.799> teeth<00:03:47.010> clean<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.370> do

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
remember when I get my teeth clean to do

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.370 
remember when I get my teeth clean to do
this<00:03:47.640> somewhere<00:03:48.360> fairly<00:03:48.660> close<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.230> when<00:03:49.350> I

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
this somewhere fairly close to when I

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.430 
this somewhere fairly close to when I
did<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.709> because<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.760> way<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.209> has<00:03:51.390> more<00:03:51.720> like

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
did it because that way it has more like

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.039 
did it because that way it has more like
ability<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.130> work<00:03:53.340> I<00:03:53.910> think<00:03:54.630> these<00:03:54.750> are<00:03:54.810> great

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
ability to work I think these are great

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.449 
ability to work I think these are great
these<00:03:55.320> are<00:03:55.440> probably<00:03:55.739> one<00:03:55.860> of<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.040> best<00:03:56.220> ones

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
these are probably one of the best ones

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.060 
these are probably one of the best ones
I've<00:03:56.640> used<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:57.030> have<00:03:57.330> tried<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:58.320> gel<00:03:58.620> in<00:03:58.950> the
