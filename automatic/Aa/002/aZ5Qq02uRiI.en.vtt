different ways you can put together a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.750 
different ways you can put together a
system<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.500> mostly<00:00:40.920> contingent<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.610> all

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
system and it's mostly contingent on all

now<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.789> most<00:00:47.969> important<00:00:48.600> thing<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.989> remember

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
now the most important thing to remember

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.040 
now the most important thing to remember
is<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.039> want<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.520> best<00:00:50.760> connection<00:00:51.050> possible

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
is you want the best connection possible

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
is you want the best connection possible
for<00:00:52.710> any<00:00:52.890> individual<00:00:53.489> input<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.940> output<00:00:54.239> you

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
for any individual input and output you

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.139 
for any individual input and output you
can<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.559> sometimes<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.309> run<00:00:56.520> out<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.879> inputs

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
can but sometimes you run out of inputs

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.610 
can but sometimes you run out of inputs
and<00:00:57.329> outputs<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.899> have<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.199> use<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> best

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and outputs and you have to use the best

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.189 
and outputs and you have to use the best
one<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.969> available<00:01:00.120> ok<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.050> I'm

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
one that you have available ok so I'm

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.299 
one that you have available ok so I'm
going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.379> go<00:01:01.469> through<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> few<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> cords

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
going to go through a few of the cords

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.210 
going to go through a few of the cords
you<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:03.059> coaxial<00:01:03.930> cable<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:05.070> is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
you have a coaxial cable here this is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.490 
you have a coaxial cable here this is
used<00:01:05.460> often<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:06.479> connecting<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.110> antenna

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
used often for connecting your antenna

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.070 
used often for connecting your antenna

or cable or satellite the next step up

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.980 
or cable or satellite the next step up
is<00:01:10.920> composite<00:01:11.640> cables<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> red

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
is composite cables this is the red

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.320 
is composite cables this is the red
white<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.290> yellow<00:01:13.790> usually<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.090> used

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
white and yellow usually this is used

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.140 
white and yellow usually this is used
for<00:01:15.630> an<00:01:15.780> analog<00:01:16.259> signal<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:17.040> okay<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
for an analog signal it's okay but you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.120 
for an analog signal it's okay but you
can<00:01:18.509> usually<00:01:18.720> do<00:01:19.170> better<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.740> analog

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
can usually do better on the analog

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
can usually do better on the analog
realm<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:21.330> next<00:01:21.840> step<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:24.170> component

one<00:01:43.710> important<00:01:44.189> thing<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.369> remember<00:01:44.640> about

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
one important thing to remember about

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.420 
one important thing to remember about
HDMI<00:01:45.799> is<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.210> it's<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.360> digital<00:01:48.720> signal<00:01:49.320> so<00:01:49.890> it

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
HDMI is that it's a digital signal so it

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.819 
HDMI is that it's a digital signal so it
really<00:01:50.820> doesn't<00:01:51.149> matter<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.079> quote-unquote

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
really doesn't matter the quote-unquote

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
really doesn't matter the quote-unquote
quality<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.579> works<00:01:53.880> you're<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.329> get

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
quality if it works you're going to get

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.660 
quality if it works you're going to get
that<00:01:54.659> good<00:01:54.990> signal<00:01:55.439> now<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.070> have<00:01:56.100> two

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that good signal now here I have two

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.719 
that good signal now here I have two
HDMI<00:01:57.180> cables<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.899> really<00:01:58.409> expensive<00:01:58.799> one<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
HDMI cables a really expensive one that

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.510 
HDMI cables a really expensive one that
was<00:01:59.850> probably<00:02:00.119> 70<00:02:00.719> or<00:02:00.810> $80<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.890> store<00:02:02.399> like

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.150 
going to use that it's okay that we
don't<00:03:51.780> use<00:03:51.900> HDMI<00:03:52.260> anyway<00:03:52.680> because<00:03:52.890> it's<00:03:53.040> just

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
don't use HDMI anyway because it's just

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.780 
don't use HDMI anyway because it's just
regular<00:03:53.490> DVD<00:03:54.300> it's<00:03:54.540> not<00:03:54.990> even<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.380> HD<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:56.760> I

and the way I'm going to do that is I'm
going<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.840> use<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.259> TV<00:04:30.740> which<00:04:31.280> has<00:04:31.490> a<00:04:31.520> digital

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
going to use the TV which has a digital

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.850 
going to use the TV which has a digital
audio<00:04:32.300> out<00:04:32.720> which<00:04:33.320> will<00:04:33.470> allow<00:04:33.680> me<00:04:33.830> to

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
audio out which will allow me to

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.960 
audio out which will allow me to
broadcast<00:04:34.460> out<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:35.740> 7.1<00:04:36.740> or<00:04:37.070> 5.1<00:04:37.759> surround

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
broadcast out the 7.1 or 5.1 surround

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.290 
broadcast out the 7.1 or 5.1 surround
sound<00:04:38.449> so<00:04:39.199> this<00:04:39.350> has<00:04:39.590> an<00:04:39.770> optical<00:04:40.580> out<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:41.090> a

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
sound so this has an optical out and a

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.300 
sound so this has an optical out and a
coaxial<00:04:41.870> out<00:04:42.020> I<00:04:42.199> don't<00:04:42.289> have<00:04:42.740> any<00:04:42.889> optical

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
coaxial out I don't have any optical

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.999 
coaxial out I don't have any optical
cables<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:43.970> don't<00:04:44.479> even<00:04:44.600> have<00:04:44.960> what<00:04:45.650> they<00:04:45.800> call

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.760 
cables I don't even have what they call
a<00:04:46.039> coaxial<00:04:46.610> but<00:04:46.759> really<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.360> collateral<00:04:48.259> could

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
a coaxial but really a collateral could

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.469 
a coaxial but really a collateral could
be<00:04:48.919> a<00:04:48.949> composite<00:04:49.639> or<00:04:49.789> anything<00:04:50.090> because

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479
