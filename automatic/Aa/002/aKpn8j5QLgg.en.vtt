00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
like sympathetic resonance damper

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.940 
like sympathetic resonance damper
resonance<00:01:22.270> you<00:01:22.479> can<00:01:22.840> control<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.409> amounts<00:01:23.830> of

resonance you can control the amounts of

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.670 
resonance you can control the amounts of
those<00:01:24.130> if<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:24.909> need<00:01:25.090> EQ<00:01:25.600> there's<00:01:26.140> sliders<00:01:26.530> and

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
combine that with concepts that we

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.219 
combine that with concepts that we
reintroduced<00:01:57.460> last<00:01:57.700> year<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.240> with<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.510> XW

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229

series<00:01:59.650> are<00:01:59.979> now<00:02:00.220> taken<00:02:00.729> to<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.299> new<00:02:01.780> level

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
series are now taken to a new level

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.539 
series are now taken to a new level
because<00:02:02.140> we've<00:02:02.320> got<00:02:02.439> this<00:02:02.560> great<00:02:02.860> new<00:02:02.890> engine

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
because we've got this great new engine

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.179 
because we've got this great new engine
so<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:04.270> hex<00:02:04.479> layer<00:02:04.720> concept<00:02:05.380> from<00:02:05.470> XW<00:02:06.070> where

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
so the hex layer concept from XW where

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.850 
so the hex layer concept from XW where
we<00:02:06.310> have<00:02:06.490> six<00:02:06.909> layers<00:02:07.240> in<00:02:07.540> a<00:02:07.659> single<00:02:08.019> patch<00:02:08.229> but

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
we have six layers in a single patch but
