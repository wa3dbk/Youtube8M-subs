00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
put it in the right hand it will just

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.920 
put it in the right hand it will just
slide<00:03:31.260> out<00:03:31.760> okay<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:33.030> mallet<00:03:33.390> well<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:33.810> had

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
to put it on the yellow bit is will stay

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.590 
to put it on the yellow bit is will stay
in<00:03:38.130> there<00:03:38.250> pretty<00:03:38.400> snugly<00:03:38.940> while<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.390> popgun

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
in there pretty snugly while the popgun

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.590 
in there pretty snugly while the popgun
will<00:03:39.870> not<00:03:40.250> also<00:03:41.250> if<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.850> pose<00:03:42.060> four<00:03:42.239> legs<00:03:42.390> out

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
will not also if you pose four legs out

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.770 
will not also if you pose four legs out
the<00:03:42.900> natural<00:03:43.350> curve<00:03:43.620> just<00:03:43.980> kind<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.780> enables

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
the natural curve just kind of enables

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.780 
the natural curve just kind of enables
her<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.900> stand<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.470> normal<00:03:47.190> characters<00:03:47.519> with

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
her to stand like normal characters with

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.120 
her to stand like normal characters with
their<00:03:47.880> legs<00:03:48.030> together<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.680> guess<00:03:49.829> they

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
their legs together so I guess they

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.340 
their legs together so I guess they

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
mentor to be posed like that but it's

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.009
