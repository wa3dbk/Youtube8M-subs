another<00:02:23.420> aircraft<00:02:23.810> when<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.410> didn't<00:02:25.130> know

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
another aircraft when I didn't know

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.100 
another aircraft when I didn't know
which<00:02:25.430> way<00:02:25.670> he<00:02:25.880> was<00:02:26.030> turning<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.840> know<00:02:26.959> the

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
which way he was turning you know the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.050 
which way he was turning you know the
Sun<00:02:27.290> was<00:02:27.470> behind<00:02:27.740> him<00:02:27.980> all<00:02:28.520> I<00:02:28.610> could<00:02:28.760> see<00:02:28.910> was<00:02:29.000> a

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
Sun was behind him all I could see was a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.420 
Sun was behind him all I could see was a
silhouette<00:02:29.740> I've<00:02:30.740> seen<00:02:30.950> him<00:02:31.070> turning<00:02:31.280> I

silhouette I've seen him turning I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.710 
silhouette I've seen him turning I
didn't<00:02:31.580> realize<00:02:31.760> he<00:02:31.820> was<00:02:31.940> turning<00:02:32.150> in<00:02:32.300> towards

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
didn't realize he was turning in towards

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.380 
didn't realize he was turning in towards
me<00:02:32.840> well<00:02:33.050> in<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:34.060> there<00:02:35.060> he<00:02:35.150> is

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
me well in this there he is

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.949 
me well in this there he is
lock-on<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.790> solid<00:02:38.240> no<00:02:38.780> crap<00:02:40.900> didn't<00:02:41.900> pay

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
lock-on and the solid no crap didn't pay

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.860 
lock-on and the solid no crap didn't pay
attention<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.440> collision<00:02:42.860> alert<00:02:43.870> but

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
attention to the collision alert but

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.090 
attention to the collision alert but
there<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.230> now<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.500> see<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.830> solid

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
there it is now you see the solid

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.490 
there it is now you see the solid
triangle<00:02:46.670> three<00:02:46.910> triangles<00:02:47.450> indicating<00:02:48.440> a

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.570 
target lock
two<00:02:49.520> of<00:02:49.610> them<00:02:49.730> are<00:02:50.920> unfilled<00:02:51.920> one<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.370> them<00:02:52.459> is

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
two of them are unfilled one of them is

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.470 
two of them are unfilled one of them is
filled<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:53.150> filled<00:02:53.450> triangle<00:02:54.350> indicates<00:02:55.480> the

filled the filled triangle indicates the
direction<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:56.989> travel<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:58.480> you'll<00:02:59.480> always

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
direction of travel so you'll always

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.270 
direction of travel so you'll always
know<00:02:59.780> which<00:03:00.080> way<00:03:00.320> he's<00:03:00.590> turning<00:03:00.980> just<00:03:01.190> by

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
know which way he's turning just by

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.890 
know which way he's turning just by
watching<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.730> targeting<00:03:02.120> curtain<00:03:04.300> and<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.750> new

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
watching the targeting curtain and a new

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.130 
watching the targeting curtain and a new
control<00:03:06.290> setup<00:03:06.620> as<00:03:07.160> you<00:03:07.340> can<00:03:07.519> see<00:03:07.790> makes<00:03:08.510> it<00:03:08.750> so

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
control setup as you can see makes it so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.800 
control setup as you can see makes it so
much<00:03:09.410> easier<00:03:09.709> for<00:03:10.160> me<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.430> not<00:03:11.239> only<00:03:11.269> stay<00:03:11.780> on

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
much easier for me to not only stay on

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.020 
much easier for me to not only stay on
this<00:03:12.019> guy's<00:03:12.230> tail<00:03:12.560> but<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:13.010> put<00:03:13.489> effective

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
this guy's tail but to put effective

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.590 
this guy's tail but to put effective
fire<00:03:14.450> into<00:03:14.840> them

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.910 

bunch<00:03:20.600> of<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.840> have<00:03:20.870> commented<00:03:21.170> about<00:03:21.560> the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
bunch of you have commented about the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.910 
bunch of you have commented about the
sound<00:03:22.670> design<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.270> game<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.710> does

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
sound design of the game and it does

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.180 
sound design of the game and it does
sound<00:03:25.220> good

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
sound good

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.160 
sound good
of<00:03:28.190> course<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.460> couple<00:03:28.490> of<00:03:28.730> us<00:03:29.090> have<00:03:29.210> said<00:03:29.390> how

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
of course a couple of us have said how

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.780 
of course a couple of us have said how
can<00:03:30.230> you<00:03:30.380> hear<00:03:30.560> explosions<00:03:30.740> in<00:03:31.220> space<00:03:31.490> and

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
can you hear explosions in space and

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.350 
can you hear explosions in space and
well<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.810> shouldn't<00:03:33.050> be<00:03:33.170> able<00:03:33.260> to<00:03:34.270> but<00:03:35.270> you

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
well you shouldn't be able to but you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.620 
well you shouldn't be able to but you
can<00:03:35.540> in<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.750> game<00:03:35.900> for<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.200> couple<00:03:36.230> of<00:03:36.440> reasons

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
can in the game for a couple of reasons

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.260 
can in the game for a couple of reasons
the<00:03:38.630> official<00:03:38.990> explanation<00:03:39.230> is<00:03:39.770> that

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
the official explanation is that

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.820 
the official explanation is that
simulated<00:03:41.270> by<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.510> onboard<00:03:41.960> flight<00:03:42.320> computer

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
simulated by the onboard flight computer

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.680 
simulated by the onboard flight computer
in<00:03:43.040> order<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:43.370> provide<00:03:43.610> feedback<00:03:44.210> to<00:03:44.600> the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
in order to provide feedback to the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.530 
in order to provide feedback to the
pilot<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.370> allow<00:03:46.370> them<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.610> better<00:03:46.880> judge<00:03:47.180> how

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
pilot and allow them to better judge how

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.800 
pilot and allow them to better judge how
to<00:03:47.600> maneuver<00:03:48.340> in<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.460> combat<00:03:49.760> situation<00:03:49.940> that's

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
to maneuver in a combat situation that's

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.130 
to maneuver in a combat situation that's
the<00:03:51.020> official<00:03:51.230> reason<00:03:51.830> I<00:03:52.960> like<00:03:53.960> it<00:03:54.110> just

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
the official reason I like it just

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.010 
the official reason I like it just
because<00:03:54.320> it<00:03:54.650> sounds<00:03:54.800> cool<00:03:55.240> and<00:03:56.240> that's<00:03:56.780> good

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
because it sounds cool and that's good

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.280 
because it sounds cool and that's good
enough<00:03:57.050> for<00:03:57.230> me

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
enough for me

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.000 
enough for me
now<00:04:00.310> something<00:04:01.310> slightly<00:04:02.090> harder<00:04:02.800> this<00:04:03.800> is<00:04:03.860> a

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
now something slightly harder this is a

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.990 
now something slightly harder this is a
four<00:04:04.340> on<00:04:04.520> one<00:04:04.760> dogfight<00:04:05.920> however<00:04:06.920> I<00:04:07.220> now<00:04:07.820> have

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
four on one dogfight however I now have

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.570 
four on one dogfight however I now have
a<00:04:08.030> burst<00:04:08.360> laser<00:04:08.950> which<00:04:09.950> is<00:04:10.070> capable<00:04:10.280> of

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
a burst laser which is capable of

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.370 
a burst laser which is capable of
tracking<00:04:10.880> a<00:04:11.150> target<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:12.470> missile<00:04:12.800> launcher

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.500 

and<00:04:16.130> there's<00:04:16.280> missile<00:04:16.640> lock<00:04:16.880> on<00:04:17.030> but<00:04:17.420> I'm

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
and there's missile lock on but I'm

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.530 
and there's missile lock on but I'm
gonna<00:04:17.630> get<00:04:17.870> closer<00:04:18.110> before<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:18.560> fire<00:04:19.300> now<00:04:20.300> I<00:04:20.330> did

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
gonna get closer before I fire now I did

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.530 
gonna get closer before I fire now I did

control setup let's see how effective it
is

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.990 

killing<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:55.990> first<00:04:56.199> one<00:04:56.490> is<00:04:57.490> basically<00:04:57.879> a

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
killing the first one is basically a

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.309 
killing the first one is basically a
free<00:04:58.270> kill<00:04:58.509> because<00:04:58.750> they<00:04:58.990> don't<00:04:59.139> they're<00:04:59.289> not

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
free kill because they don't they're not

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.050 
free kill because they don't they're not
gonna<00:04:59.470> react<00:04:59.830> to<00:04:59.860> you<00:05:00.129> until<00:05:00.400> you<00:05:00.580> open<00:05:00.849> fire

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
gonna react to you until you open fire

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.800 
gonna react to you until you open fire
on<00:05:01.090> them<00:05:02.940> never<00:05:03.940> manage<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.389> kill<00:05:04.599> more<00:05:04.780> than

on them never manage to kill more than
two<00:05:05.169> of<00:05:05.319> them<00:05:05.440> before<00:05:07.409> see<00:05:08.409> I'm<00:05:08.500> taking<00:05:08.680> fire

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069

my<00:05:09.220> shields<00:05:09.520> again<00:05:09.729> here<00:05:11.370> you'll<00:05:12.370> note<00:05:12.580> that

my shields again here you'll note that

the burst laser you don't have to be as

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.170 
the burst laser you don't have to be as

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
precise with your aiming it will track

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.860 
precise with your aiming it will track
the<00:05:19.389> target<00:05:19.810> as<00:05:20.590> long<00:05:20.800> as<00:05:20.889> it's<00:05:21.039> more<00:05:21.310> or<00:05:21.460> less

in your sights it makes it a hell of a

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.779 
in your sights it makes it a hell of a
lot<00:05:26.080> easier<00:05:26.440> to<00:05:26.560> put<00:05:27.099> effective<00:05:27.520> firing

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
lot easier to put effective firing

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
you can you know can you take module

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.939 
you can you know can you take module
damage<00:05:40.539> or<00:05:40.870> do<00:05:41.169> you<00:05:41.229> just<00:05:41.409> have<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:41.620> back<00:05:41.830> to

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949

somebody's health down to zero so far at

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.740 
somebody's health down to zero so far at
least<00:05:45.069> in<00:05:45.190> my<00:05:45.310> experience<00:05:45.460> at<00:05:46.210> this<00:05:46.389> early

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
least in my experience at this early

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.320 
least in my experience at this early
stage<00:05:46.810> of<00:05:47.139> the<00:05:47.199> game<00:05:47.409> it<00:05:47.620> seems<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:48.039> be<00:05:48.330> that

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
stage of the game it seems to be that

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.870 
stage of the game it seems to be that
use<00:05:49.659> and<00:05:49.900> we<00:05:49.990> have<00:05:50.020> to<00:05:50.370> take<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:51.490> shields<00:05:51.819> down

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
use and we have to take the shields down

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.300 
use and we have to take the shields down
and<00:05:52.330> then<00:05:52.539> batter<00:05:53.289> down<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:53.830> whole<00:05:53.979> armor

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
and then batter down the whole armor

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.219 
and then batter down the whole armor
until<00:05:54.639> it<00:05:54.729> reaches<00:05:55.030> zero<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:55.750> then<00:05:56.020> you<00:05:56.110> get

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
until it reaches zero and then you get

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.219 
until it reaches zero and then you get
the<00:05:56.349> kill<00:05:57.539> so<00:05:58.539> so<00:05:58.930> far<00:05:59.169> I<00:05:59.229> have<00:05:59.530> not<00:05:59.860> noticed

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
the kill so so far I have not noticed

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.790 
the kill so so far I have not noticed
any<00:06:02.229> specific<00:06:02.979> module<00:06:03.520> damage<00:06:04.590> every<00:06:05.590> ship

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
I've killed I've had to reduce the hall

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.129 
I've killed I've had to reduce the hall
to<00:06:07.419> zero<00:06:07.690> and<00:06:07.990> then<00:06:08.199> they<00:06:08.500> explode<00:06:10.020> your<00:06:11.020> own

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
to zero and then they explode your own

in<00:06:18.400> mind<00:06:18.520> this<00:06:18.699> is<00:06:18.759> purely

in mind this is purely

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.080 
in mind this is purely
I<00:06:20.199> mean<00:06:20.650> this<00:06:20.710> is<00:06:20.860> alpha<00:06:21.249> this<00:06:21.370> is<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.759> very

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
I mean this is alpha this is the very

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.649 
I mean this is alpha this is the very
first<00:06:22.419> iteration<00:06:22.659> of<00:06:23.289> the<00:06:23.620> alpha<00:06:23.860> test<00:06:24.659> this

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:25.659 
first iteration of the alpha test this

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:30.809 
first iteration of the alpha test this
is<00:06:25.870> not<00:06:26.139> indicative<00:06:26.620> of<00:06:26.800> final<00:06:27.550> gameplay<00:06:29.819> the

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
is not indicative of final gameplay the

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:33.510 
is not indicative of final gameplay the
AI<00:06:30.999> is<00:06:31.479> very<00:06:31.840> basic<00:06:32.110> this<00:06:32.499> is<00:06:32.560> not<00:06:32.919> to<00:06:33.099> test<00:06:33.340> the

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
AI is very basic this is not to test the

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.390 
AI is very basic this is not to test the
AI<00:06:33.639> it's<00:06:34.060> purely<00:06:34.419> to<00:06:34.629> test<00:06:35.159> the<00:06:36.159> flight

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
AI it's purely to test the flight

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.059 
AI it's purely to test the flight
controls<00:06:36.849> so<00:06:37.529> that's<00:06:38.529> all<00:06:38.740> we<00:06:38.889> can<00:06:39.009> really

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:39.069 
controls so that's all we can really

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.999 
controls so that's all we can really
judge<00:06:39.819> by<00:06:40.180> by<00:06:40.689> watching<00:06:40.990> the<00:06:41.590> way<00:06:41.740> this<00:06:41.860> is

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009 
judge by by watching the way this is

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:46.709 
judge by by watching the way this is
playing<00:06:42.749> and<00:06:43.749> what<00:06:43.930> I<00:06:43.960> can<00:06:44.229> tell<00:06:44.379> you<00:06:44.439> is<00:06:45.719> ya

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:46.719 
playing and what I can tell you is ya

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:48.899 
playing and what I can tell you is ya
know<00:06:46.749> some<00:06:47.409> keeping<00:06:47.740> controls<00:06:48.159> properly

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:48.909 
know some keeping controls properly

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.420 
know some keeping controls properly
configured<00:06:49.509> or<00:06:50.469> fantastic

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
configured or fantastic

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.929 
configured or fantastic
I<00:06:52.590> still<00:06:53.590> think<00:06:53.740> joystick<00:06:54.219> and<00:06:54.370> throttle<00:06:54.759> is

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:54.939 
I still think joystick and throttle is

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:57.450 
I still think joystick and throttle is
gonna<00:06:55.240> be<00:06:55.360> the<00:06:55.479> way<00:06:55.569> to<00:06:55.629> go<00:06:55.870> though<00:06:56.279> so<00:06:57.279> that's

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
gonna be the way to go though so that's

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.219 
gonna be the way to go though so that's
what<00:06:57.610> I'm<00:06:57.699> gonna<00:06:57.789> start<00:06:58.090> practicing<00:06:58.659> at<00:06:58.779> next

00:06:59.219 --> 00:06:59.229 
what I'm gonna start practicing at next

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:01.290
