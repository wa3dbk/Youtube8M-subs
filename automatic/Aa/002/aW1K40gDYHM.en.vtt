00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
anyone to start off with manga I think

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.749 
anyone to start off with manga I think
it's<00:04:47.199> one<00:04:47.379> of<00:04:47.499> the<00:04:47.560> first<00:04:47.710> mangas<00:04:48.159> I<00:04:48.279> ever<00:04:48.460> read

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
it's one of the first mangas I ever read

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:50.820 
it's one of the first mangas I ever read
will<00:04:48.939> appeal<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.479> many<00:04:49.779> demographics<00:04:50.499> so

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
will appeal to many demographics so

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.260 
will appeal to many demographics so
definitely<00:04:51.370> go<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:51.520> check<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.759> one<00:04:52.029> out<00:04:52.120> if

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
definitely go and check that one out if

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.760 
definitely go and check that one out if
you're<00:04:52.419> into<00:04:52.629> manga<00:04:52.810> or<00:04:53.110> want<00:04:53.349> to<00:04:53.499> start

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
you're into manga or want to start

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.999 
you're into manga or want to start
getting<00:04:53.949> into<00:04:54.340> manga<00:04:54.490> then<00:04:55.240> there<00:04:55.449> is<00:04:55.569> what<00:04:55.900> I

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
getting into manga then there is what I

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.800 
getting into manga then there is what I
will<00:04:57.009> probably<00:04:57.279> call<00:04:57.819> my<00:04:57.969> all-time<00:04:58.210> favorite

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810

manga<00:04:59.050> and<00:04:59.439> I<00:04:59.710> think<00:04:59.889> it'll<00:05:00.009> be<00:05:00.129> very

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
manga and I think it'll be very

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.159 
manga and I think it'll be very
difficult<00:05:00.580> for<00:05:00.849> anything<00:05:01.270> ever<00:05:01.509> to<00:05:01.779> beat<00:05:01.990> it

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
difficult for anything ever to beat it

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.200 
difficult for anything ever to beat it
and<00:05:02.529> it<00:05:03.069> is<00:05:03.279> Inuyasha

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
and it is Inuyasha

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.240 
and it is Inuyasha
now<00:05:04.719> this<00:05:04.930> story<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.199> about<00:05:05.349> a<00:05:05.830> young<00:05:06.039> girl
