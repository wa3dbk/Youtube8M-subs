00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.360 

essentially<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.449> cryo<00:00:03.689> chambers<00:00:04.110> are<00:00:04.440> one<00:00:05.279> of

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
essentially the cryo chambers are one of

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.559 
essentially the cryo chambers are one of
the<00:00:05.430> new<00:00:05.549> recovery<00:00:05.819> protocols<00:00:06.390> that<00:00:06.480> we

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
the new recovery protocols that we

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.450 
the new recovery protocols that we
bought<00:00:06.750> in<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.049> season<00:00:07.440> so<00:00:08.130> we're<00:00:08.250> looking

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
bought in this season so we're looking

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.580 
bought in this season so we're looking
for<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.790> help<00:00:09.000> us<00:00:09.240> with<00:00:09.480> our<00:00:09.630> highest

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
for it to help us with our highest

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.070 
for it to help us with our highest
loading<00:00:10.889> weeks<00:00:11.070> so<00:00:11.340> our<00:00:11.490> two<00:00:11.759> to<00:00:12.570> match<00:00:12.750> weeks

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
loading weeks so our two to match weeks

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.240 
loading weeks so our two to match weeks
essentially<00:00:13.620> which<00:00:13.740> obviously<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
essentially which obviously in the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.770 
essentially which obviously in the
chairmanship<00:00:14.549> occurs<00:00:15.120> quite<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.389> lot<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
chairmanship occurs quite a lot with the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.870 
chairmanship occurs quite a lot with the
congestion<00:00:16.109> fixed<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.560> schedule<00:00:16.890> and

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
congestion fixed to schedule and

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.730 
congestion fixed to schedule and
essentially<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.630> just<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.960> very<00:00:19.500> cold

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
essentially it's just to very cold

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.019 
essentially it's just to very cold
chambers<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> first<00:00:20.490> one<00:00:20.670> more<00:00:20.880> to

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
chambers the first one more to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.150 
chambers the first one more to
acclimatize<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.289> second<00:00:22.590> one<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.710> get<00:00:22.949> a

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
acclimatize and the second one you get a

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.179 
acclimatize and the second one you get a
large<00:00:23.580> sort<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.269> response<00:00:24.930> from<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.380> body<00:00:25.590> to

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
large sort of response from the body to

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.519 
large sort of response from the body to
help<00:00:26.369> its<00:00:26.519> recovery<00:00:26.760> process<00:00:27.330> after<00:00:28.050> matches

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
help its recovery process after matches

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.080 
help its recovery process after matches
well<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.769> first<00:00:28.980> ones<00:00:29.160> minus<00:00:29.490> 60<00:00:29.880> which<00:00:30.060> is

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
well the first ones minus 60 which is

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.020 
well the first ones minus 60 which is
known<00:00:30.599> as<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> warmer<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.340> which<00:00:32.340> players

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
known as the warmer one which players

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.639 
known as the warmer one which players
don't<00:00:33.239> mind<00:00:33.420> too<00:00:33.570> much<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.930> thirty<00:00:34.140> seconds<00:00:34.590> in

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
don't mind too much as thirty seconds in

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.709 
don't mind too much as thirty seconds in
there<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.100> they<00:00:35.190> move<00:00:35.340> into<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:36.390> second

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
there and then they move into the second

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.209 
there and then they move into the second
chamber<00:00:36.960> which<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.230> about<00:00:37.590> minus<00:00:38.040> one<00:00:38.160> hundred

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
chamber which is about minus one hundred

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.979 
chamber which is about minus one hundred
and<00:00:38.460> forty<00:00:38.790> two<00:00:38.820> hundred<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.239> fifty<00:00:39.570> for<00:00:39.840> two

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and forty two hundred and fifty for two

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:40.490 
and forty two hundred and fifty for two
minutes

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
minutes

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.530 
minutes
yes<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.520> really<00:00:41.820> quite<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.390> there

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
yes it's really quite I was in there

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.479 
yes it's really quite I was in there
with<00:00:42.660> Tommy<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.290> Bernard<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.829> Tommy<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.219> him

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
with Tommy and Bernard and Tommy was him

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
with Tommy and Bernard and Tommy was him
it<00:00:45.030> made<00:00:45.690> us<00:00:45.840> really<00:00:45.989> comfortable<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.500> said

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it made us really comfortable and said

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.690 
it made us really comfortable and said
if<00:00:46.739> you're<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.309> 20<00:00:47.579> minutes

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
if you're in there for like 20 minutes

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.840 
if you're in there for like 20 minutes
you'd<00:00:47.969> die<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.860> you<00:00:49.860> can<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.550> imagine

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
you'd die so you can really just imagine

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.970 
you'd die so you can really just imagine
how<00:00:50.940> cold<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.020> yes<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.649> really

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
how cold it is so yes this is really

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.580 
how cold it is so yes this is really
cold<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.539> cool<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.050> dry

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
cold it's it's so cool it's like dry

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
cold it's it's so cool it's like dry
it's<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.160> dry<00:00:56.430> ice<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.420> can't

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
it's like dry ice and like you can't

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.450 
it's like dry ice and like you can't
really<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:58.020> anything<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.039> come<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.399> and

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
really see anything and you come out and

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.319 
really see anything and you come out and
you<00:00:59.640> got<00:00:59.820> like<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:01.010> particles<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.129> light

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
you got like like particles of light

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.549 
you got like like particles of light
it's<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.449> even<00:01:03.629> ice<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.110> you've<00:01:04.229> got<00:01:04.409> light

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
it's not even ice but you've got light

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.840 
it's not even ice but you've got light
your<00:01:04.739> bodies<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.189> oh<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.309> see<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.760> got

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
your bodies that oh I see you got

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.730 
your bodies that oh I see you got
goosebumps<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.600> really<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.619> quite

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
goosebumps it really it really is quite

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.649 
goosebumps it really it really is quite
cold<00:01:07.979> after<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> game<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.270> good<00:01:09.450> for<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
cold after the game it's good for the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.929 
cold after the game it's good for the
recovery<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> reduces<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> inflammation

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
recovery it reduces the inflammation

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.520 
recovery it reduces the inflammation
what<00:01:11.939> happens<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.750> skin<00:01:12.990> surface

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
what happens is this the skin surface

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.859 
what happens is this the skin surface
temperature<00:01:14.189> reduced<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.060> quite<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> lot<00:01:15.479> so

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
temperature reduced it's quite a lot so

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.780 
temperature reduced it's quite a lot so
you<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.740> phaser<00:01:16.920> constriction<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
you get the phaser constriction and that

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.429 
you get the phaser constriction and that
pushes<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.330> blood<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.750> major<00:01:18.990> organs

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
pushes all the blood to the major organs

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
pushes all the blood to the major organs
where<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.070> gets<00:01:20.250> rid<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> toxins<00:01:21.090> gets

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
where it gets rid of all the toxins gets

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.359 
where it gets rid of all the toxins gets
reoxygenate<00:01:22.140> 'ah<00:01:22.350> dand<00:01:22.680> then<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.159> come

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
reoxygenate 'ah dand then as you come

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.740 
reoxygenate 'ah dand then as you come
out<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.880> change<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.240> temperature<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.630> get

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
out and a change of temperature you get

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.310 
out and a change of temperature you get
warmer

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
warmer

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.350 
warmer
you<00:01:25.619> get<00:01:25.710> vasodilation<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.909> blood<00:01:27.090> comes

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
you get vasodilation and the blood comes

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.060 
you get vasodilation and the blood comes
back<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> muscles<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> cells

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
back to the to the muscles to the cells

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.649 
back to the to the muscles to the cells
and<00:01:29.280> regenerates<00:01:29.790> them<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> oxygenated

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and regenerates them with the oxygenated

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.590
