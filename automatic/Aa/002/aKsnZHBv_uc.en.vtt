00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.980
 through high frequency signals 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.269
 transmitted through the laid component 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:20.329
 cable TV 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.289
 opposite to ordinary ground and 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.499
 satellite broadcasting 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.379

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.339
 well then 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:24.429
 it does not broadcast 

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:27.129

 some kind of contact 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.399
 just connect the TV 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:45.629
