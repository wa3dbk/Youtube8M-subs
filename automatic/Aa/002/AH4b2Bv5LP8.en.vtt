 the perfect car for a skiing holiday 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.740
 you'll all be thinking of a suv but it's there 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.309
 also another car that would do a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.740
 figurone 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.950
 the new mercedes b class in this one 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.800
 four-wheel drive version 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.060
 this in fact is the b 200 si dia 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.850
 informatic turbodiesel version 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.830
 intermediate of 136 horses with traction 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.220
 integral and double automatic transmission 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.619
 spacious comfortable and not clutch 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.289
 fears practically unstoppable snow 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.300
 the design has not been distorted but 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.320
 some details have made the frontal 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.989
 of the new class b 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.030
 decidedly more sporting exalted 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.399
 in the premium sports setup with 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.190
 18 inch alloy wheels signed 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.719
 in short, ainger is fine for mothers 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.170
 that always appreciate the minivans 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.820
 of the star but also the pope is tempted 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.090
 the spacious cockpit and the trunk from 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.559
 488 liters make the class b a good one 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.320
 travel companion for families 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.489
 despite its compact size 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.500
 interiors designed by the style center 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.850
 mercedes benz of como who have 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.799
 introduced the air vents 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.840
 aeronautical style on the latest models 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.670
 of the brand are not very different from 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.979
 first and all appear theirs 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 shine really like the steering wheel 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.299
 sporty flat-bottomed the elegant ones 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.070
 tobacco leather upholstery that the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.470
 double sunroof that floods with light 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.270
 the big cockpit is not bad either 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.140
 new 8-inch display of the system 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.060
 of infotainment 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.740
 versatility is fine but why 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.960
 give up style 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.939
 to finish the session is more or less high 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.649
 as that of a su dominates the 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.729
 road and visibility is very good 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.710
 the most rigid version of the version 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.170
 premium does not, however, make the class of one 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.840
 sporty the center of gravity always remains 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.509
 rather high and then I wanted to steer 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.610
 however, it is a little more precise 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.009
 a pleasant minivan to drive with 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.929
 the right power and with a behavior 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.700
 very safe guaranteed by traction 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.560
 integral that spreads in a way 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.299
 automatic torque between the two 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.259
 axes always guaranteeing the maximum 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.000
 traction soundproofing are good i 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.619
 higher engine noise levels 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.619
 enter the car a little too much 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.560
 those who aim for comfort would do 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.480
 good to choose a different setup 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.700
 from this also because on the roads 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.890
 irregular is not particularly soft 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.350
 as for security instead 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.209
 debuts as standard on the entire range of 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.880
 new class of collision prevention

 assist plus which reduces the risk of 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.920
 rear-end collisions acting autonomously on 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.550
 brake the price you pay for everything 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.380
 this is 36 thousand 810 euros 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.290
 but don't worry you can take it home 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.459
 this minivan from 25,000 to 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.459
 410 euros
