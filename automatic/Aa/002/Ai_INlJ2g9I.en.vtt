00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.890
 a new video for the channel 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:10.170
 he made it clear mer here I bring you this 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:13.510
 server like the one youtube has 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.930
 good here 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.670
 Here there is server of son servera if in 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.060
 part plots 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.720
 on the other hand partial as those that 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:30.640
 our creatives to 100 on a server 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.640
 then here create a 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.940
 passing the load I do not know well here I made a 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.670
 strong of plots about 12 barely 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.949
 because as we are small we are just 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.320
 small group but I think we are 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.620
 been subscribers or seven that were a 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.390
 I remember well then here I tell you 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.380
 this server 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.380
 tiny 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.510
 of your channels 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.140
 the rules rules not what the cost 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.440
 have other people not put blocks 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.590
 in the constructions of people here 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.250
 he did the aids he sees diagonally good 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.760
 health health from 1 to 13 good is that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.770
 him and you put 1 through 13 from a 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.340
 kind if you see someone breaking the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.910
 rules lead to to be able to know how 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.910
 can you know 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.180
 the voice builds your house on a plot 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.250
 good 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.920
 after physical of the plots some of 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.100
 the three plots must build 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.880
 and with guys and it's still more people 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.960
 so the plots were taken good 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:02.110
 and what do I want to tell you 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.110
 but yes 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.090
 Well, yes, it is true that it is small 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.050
 the plots but no doors are a 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.739
 small group like this would be yes and by 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.420
 this 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:25.750
 to this 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:28.230
 we go upstairs with a little house and that's not 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.230
 have slowly 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.230
 osella 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.540
 where is it 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.870
 by Zealand because I believe that scarcely 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.700
 that benitez worthwhile and therefore also 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.190
 well then this term that I 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.170

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.540
 in the description of the video and aspects 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.000
 and at the expense of the video 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.019
 do not forget to like it in an important 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.069
 calm importer does not lower pressure 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.730
