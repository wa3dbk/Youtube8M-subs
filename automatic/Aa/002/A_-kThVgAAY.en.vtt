 In general, we win for the first time 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.050
 championship is not easy to pass 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.490
 happy insane team strong 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.990
 worthy very fast and mobile 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.310
 probably in our area 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.980
 Well 1 2 such and the more such guys 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.960
 they masterwork scorers here that is 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.690
 looked very worthy and more we 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.100
 series lost 12 and you studied on 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.710
 the latter wanted more well, just strength 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.470
 not enough at the limit the guys played not 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.640
 I know why but a little bit of depth 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.920
 lacked strength no such hockey in 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.860
 slow we are not able to play therefore 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.930
 much did not work the opponent imposed 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.950
 viscous game pretty tight 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.440
 tough well will be won in the strongest 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.170
 first ran all missed then 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.780
 goal ran to recoup recouped 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.190
 missed another one then started in 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.400
 play actively because it is already further 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.440
 there was no strength to the end 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.959
 tired for the price now think a little 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.480
 before it all go so the whole team 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.100
 I was very upset of course arranged 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:13.550
 everyone tried everyone wanted to be 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.550
