00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
rappel down like that so that's a Swiss

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.360 
rappel down like that so that's a Swiss
seat<00:02:27.760> not<00:02:30.239> it's<00:02:31.239> not<00:02:31.450> an<00:02:31.600> alternative<00:02:32.200> for<00:02:32.889> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
seat not it's not an alternative for the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.940 
seat not it's not an alternative for the
actual<00:02:33.970> harness<00:02:34.590> but<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.769> lot<00:02:35.889> cheaper

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
actual harness but it's a lot cheaper

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.449 
actual harness but it's a lot cheaper
and<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:40.600> works<00:02:40.840> I've<00:02:41.620> done<00:02:41.799> it<00:02:42.010> many<00:02:42.130> times
