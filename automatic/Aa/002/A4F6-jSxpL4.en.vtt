00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
you to do is boil some nice hot water in

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.470 
you to do is boil some nice hot water in
a<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> kettle<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.399> you're<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:47.940> gonna<00:00:48.059> pour

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
a in a kettle and you're just gonna pour

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.600 
a in a kettle and you're just gonna pour
the<00:00:48.690> boiling<00:00:48.899> water<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.649> there<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.520> you're

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
the boiling water in there and you're

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.709 
the boiling water in there and you're
gonna<00:00:50.700> let<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.940> stand<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.390> there<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.660> about

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
gonna let it stand in there for about

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.810 
gonna let it stand in there for about
five<00:00:52.020> maybe<00:00:52.379> ten<00:00:52.710> minutes<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.190> that's<00:00:53.579> gonna

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
five maybe ten minutes and that's gonna

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.020 
five maybe ten minutes and that's gonna
activate<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.449> minerals<00:00:54.960> okay<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.039> guess<00:00:56.879> I'll

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
activate the minerals okay I guess I'll

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.439 
activate the minerals okay I guess I'll
show<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.260> how<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.530> actually<00:00:58.559> works<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.489> first

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
show you how it actually works so first

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.869 
show you how it actually works so first
we<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.020> filter<00:01:01.500> inside<00:01:02.039> there<00:01:02.370> there's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
we have the filter inside there there's

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.340 
we have the filter inside there there's
a<00:01:03.000> little<00:01:03.239> rim<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.600> there<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.110> push

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
a little rim in there that you just push

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.070 
a little rim in there that you just push
it<00:01:04.379> down<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.670> sits<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it down and it sits on there but you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.260 
it down and it sits on there but you
take<00:01:07.320> water<00:01:07.710> whether<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.340> tap<00:01:08.580> water<00:01:08.909> or

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
take water whether it be tap water or

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.539 
take water whether it be tap water or
filtered<00:01:09.510> water<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.770> doesn't<00:01:11.130> matter<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
filtered water it doesn't matter the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.800 
filtered water it doesn't matter the
clean<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> water<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.299> put<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
clean of the water you put in the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
clean of the water you put in the
cleaner<00:01:13.080> cleaner<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.920> water<00:01:14.130> you're<00:01:14.310> going

to<00:01:14.490> get<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.900> alright<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.259> we're<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.560> gonna

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
to get out alright so we're just gonna

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.640 
to get out alright so we're just gonna
pour<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.750> water<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:21.229> don't<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:22.380> through

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
pour the water in here don't go through

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.700 
pour the water in here don't go through
the<00:01:22.740> filter<00:01:25.549> set<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.790> down<00:01:27.650> we're<00:01:28.650> gonna

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the filter set that down we're gonna

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.230 
the filter set that down we're gonna
twist<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.150> lid<00:01:30.979> okay<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.369> then<00:01:33.119> we're

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
twist on the lid okay and then we're

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.420 
twist on the lid okay and then we're
gonna<00:01:33.329> give<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.720> few<00:01:33.930> shakes<00:01:36.860> okay<00:01:37.860> then

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
gonna give it a few shakes okay then

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.789 
gonna give it a few shakes okay then
we're<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.640> let<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> sit<00:01:39.150> for<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.799> 15

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
we're gonna let it sit for about 15

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.609 
we're gonna let it sit for about 15
minutes<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.329> 15<00:01:42.869> minutes<00:01:43.140> time<00:01:43.350> what

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
minutes and in that 15 minutes time what

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.850 
minutes and in that 15 minutes time what
its<00:01:43.770> gonna<00:01:43.860> do<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.549> minerals<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.860> filters

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
its gonna do the minerals in the filters

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.670 
its gonna do the minerals in the filters
in<00:01:47.100> there<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.450> actually<00:01:48.840> alkalize

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
in there it's going to actually alkalize

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.710 
in there it's going to actually alkalize
your<00:01:49.710> waters<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.670> normal<00:01:51.090> water<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.479> about

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
your waters so normal water is about

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.350 
your waters so normal water is about
seven<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> pH<00:01:52.740> scale<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> we'll<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.149> able<00:01:54.240> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
seven on a pH scale and we'll be able to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.999 
seven on a pH scale and we'll be able to
take<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.960> about<00:01:55.170> eight<00:01:55.290> point<00:01:55.770> five

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
take that up to about eight point five

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
and the big thing is hydration it's

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.190 
and the big thing is hydration it's
wetter<00:03:19.660> water<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:21.010> molecules<00:03:21.970> have<00:03:22.329> actually

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
wetter water the molecules have actually

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.289 
wetter water the molecules have actually
been<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.739> know<00:03:23.829> taken<00:03:24.280> from<00:03:24.459> say<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.670> fifteen

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
been you know taken from say a fifteen

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.990 
been you know taken from say a fifteen
cluster<00:03:26.200> down<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.650> about<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:26.829> five<00:03:27.160> cluster<00:03:27.850> and

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
cluster down to about a five cluster and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.500 
cluster down to about a five cluster and
that<00:03:28.030> makes<00:03:28.299> it<00:03:28.420> easier<00:03:28.840> for<00:03:28.900> our<00:03:29.200> bodies<00:03:29.709> to

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
that makes it easier for our bodies to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.300 
that makes it easier for our bodies to
use<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.810> water<00:03:32.319> in<00:03:32.530> our<00:03:32.590> system<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.190> we

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
use the the water in our system and we

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.280 
use the the water in our system and we
all<00:03:33.489> know<00:03:33.730> how<00:03:33.940> important<00:03:34.359> it<00:03:34.389> is<00:03:34.540> to<00:03:34.750> drink

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290
