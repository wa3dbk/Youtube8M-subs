00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.410
 a little different today we are going to eat a 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:19.460
 typical dish of germany today we are going to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.460
 eat roast beef tired of asshole 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.710
 today we are going to eat little ones we do not know 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.710
 worry today we are going to eat pets led 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.159
 special is a type of pasta from the south of 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.199
 germany first let's take a look at 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:47.170
 the ingredients for 4 people 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:52.420
 we need 400 grams of white flour 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:55.390
 of wheat 8 eggs and a little salt and 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.030
 so then we need 5 onions and 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.449
 approximately 600 grams of cheese 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.070
 sale the cauda to make the pasta 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.070
 first you have to beat the eggs 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.400
 When everything is enough, it is as if 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.400
 we can add a little salt 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.969
 Now we mix the flour with the eggs 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.170
 what is now very important to stretch 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.170
 the dough so that everyone mixes well 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.250
 other than the mass you have to leave a little 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.080
 table that then the mass is not 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.450
 get stuck here on the table 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.550
 then the dough is stretched until 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.740
 a thin dough 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.920
 now you have to cut it more in small 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.800
 strips and throw them little by little into the water 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.440
 and now we have to remove the mass from the water 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.370
 if I feel good suspense they should have 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.370
 this way more or less 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.290
 and we start cutting the onions 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.300
 then fry the pieces with 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.340
 Butter 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.340
 and we add the pets 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.430
 and in the end we throw the cheese chimbo 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.330
 after throwing the cheese you have to cover 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.330
 the pan so that it does not burn 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.030
 we distribute all several times and when 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.850
 that it is a little doradito the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.950
 dish is ready 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.740
 and they're ready, I thought, though 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.590
 look like insects with cheese is a plate 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.470
 super super rich and good you 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.440
 they should try to do it and now we're going 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.880
 to eat and drink apple juice 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.070
