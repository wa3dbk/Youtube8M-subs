he did in his original portrait picture

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:28.780 
he did in his original portrait picture
but<00:05:27.410> far<00:05:27.800> as<00:05:27.919> this<00:05:28.010> fighting<00:05:28.340> stance<00:05:28.580> in<00:05:28.760> the

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
but far as this fighting stance in the

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.460 
but far as this fighting stance in the
way<00:05:29.000> he's<00:05:29.240> animated<00:05:29.870> with<00:05:29.960> certain<00:05:30.260> moves

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
way he's animated with certain moves

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.230 
way he's animated with certain moves
they<00:05:30.710> definitely<00:05:30.979> did<00:05:31.250> some<00:05:31.400> changes<00:05:31.790> there<00:05:32.030> I

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
they definitely did some changes there I

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.730 
they definitely did some changes there I
guess<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.870> make<00:05:32.990> him<00:05:33.140> look<00:05:33.229> a<00:05:33.440> bit<00:05:33.620> more

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
guess to make him look a bit more

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.070 
guess to make him look a bit more
different<00:05:34.220> from<00:05:34.250> Mars<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:35.120> lucina<00:05:35.720> so

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
different from Mars and lucina so

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.810 
different from Mars and lucina so
overall<00:05:36.380> they're<00:05:36.650> both<00:05:36.800> looking<00:05:36.979> pretty

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
overall they're both looking pretty

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.300 
overall they're both looking pretty
