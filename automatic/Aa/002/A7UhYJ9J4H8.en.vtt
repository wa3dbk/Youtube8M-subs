00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.310
 who has a large family suffers at the time of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.319
 buy a new car 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.740
 generally or takes passengers 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.950
 or bags but the car of today's test 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.430
 Dodge Durango takes everything at the same time and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.630
 with much comfort saw one can think of 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.029
 luxury trip 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.859
 soon comes to mind a transatlantic something 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.519
 very similar when thinking about a 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.460
 trip aboard a durango dowry 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.570
 finally, internal comfort space 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.260
 distributed over the five meters of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.739
 length 1 92 and the cure and eighty 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.489
 height impeccable leather trim 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.640
 air conditioning in three zones system 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.430
 entertainment with video and sound of 500 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.820
 watts power front seats and 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.520
 and even heated steering wheel make 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.379
 with which any trip it is a luxury 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.989
 without mentioning that there is still a good space 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.770
 to carry luggage in here and up 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.770
 down here 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.479
 access to the last row of banks 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.909
 is the easiest but the middle rebate 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.430
 with ease and available space 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.460
 allows two adults to travel with color 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.840
 to close the silence approach is a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.780
 highlights 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.369
 no matter what type of floor it is difficult to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.320
 make sure the engine is running 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.080
 But I do not think this is worthy. 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.470
 representative of the way of life 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.079
 North American swings made a ship 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.840
 security to everyone even in 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.810
 closed curves

 [Music] 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.369
 the permanent four-wheel drive 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.460
 independent suspension well design the 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.039
 arcus 20-inch rim tires are the 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.289
 responsible for this and 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.200
 electronic traction controls and 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:53.119
 stability and anti-roll 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.030
 always ready to intervene 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.159
 if necessary to ensure 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.109
 cruise speed worthy of the size 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.399
 the vehicle, especially when 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:07.640
 loaded the durango has a v6 engine of 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.739
 286 horses and the torque respected everything 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.200
 to move the more than two thousand and 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.190
 three hundred kilos of the carra and what he 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.390
 carrying a good 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.490
 [Music] 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.500
 to make life easier for those who are 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.780
 control and steering wheel with 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.780
 electrical settings and memory after 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.049
 large engine torque should have 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.720
 marches at least six as the dodge 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:01.580
 journey the younger brother is that he hesitates 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.159
 when it comes to reducing what leaves us 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.560
 a little apprehensive because in climbs with 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.870
 load and without decision makes the durango lose 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.480
 and when the exchange finally 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.640
 decides to reduce the shea two gears and one 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.940
 engine to work at high speeds. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.819
 bothers one or two more marches 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.799
 the answer would be faster by improving 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.900
 speed resumes 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.140
 not to mention that consumption would also be 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.140
 benefited 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.549
 not that the average consumption value 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.319
 we are able to be so important to 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.329
 those who buy such a car 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.579
 but if it was better it would help in 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.859
 autonomy on roads in habitat 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.870
 indicated for this Peruvian since in the 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.530
 city is a bit complicated to 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.269
 move around with her day in and day out 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.840
 now in a truck full of 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.910
 and that costs 200 thousand reais 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.030
 details such as not having 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.549
 parking gps front and the 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.540
 voice commands and French and 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.919
 Spanish 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.919
 it's the end of the bite not 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.079
 [Music] 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.969
 and you can not understand it even saw the end of 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.370
 accounts these days are such things. 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:18.100
 common or does not give in car was in

 all with the focus on the comfort it costs 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.960
 so expensive if you do not want 200 thousand reais 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:26.680
 a lot of money but will these 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.289
 plume weighed on the notes lasting it 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.449
 starts well taking eight in performance 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.710
 only that it falters and consumes and gets 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.350
 note 4 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.020
 from now on the notes are good 10 in 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.110
 safety and stability finish 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.810
 received 8 plus a maximum score in 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.570
 inner space new door 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.630
 and to close seven in the cost relation 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.630
 benefit
