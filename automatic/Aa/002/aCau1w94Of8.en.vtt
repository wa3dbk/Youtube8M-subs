00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.720 
I went into the part so now you can see
with<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:25.049> a<00:02:25.200> little<00:02:25.410> bit<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.769> foundation<00:02:25.950> it

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
with just a little bit of foundation it

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.660 
with just a little bit of foundation it
really<00:02:27.500> camouflages<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.590> part<00:02:28.950> really<00:02:29.370> well

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
really camouflages the part really well

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.750 
really camouflages the part really well
and<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.570> did<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.440> was<00:02:31.769> initially<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.310> was<00:02:32.549> going<00:02:32.700> to

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and I did I was initially I was going to

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.420 
and I did I was initially I was going to
use<00:02:32.940> concealer<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:34.380> then<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.650> decided<00:02:35.130> I

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
use concealer but then I decided I

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.819 
use concealer but then I decided I
wanted<00:02:35.910> where<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.510> part<00:02:36.810> meets<00:02:37.049> my<00:02:37.290> forehead

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
wanted where the part meets my forehead

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.220 
wanted where the part meets my forehead
I<00:02:37.860> wanted<00:02:38.310> it<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.610> match<00:02:38.820> my<00:02:39.180> complexion<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.170> I

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
I wanted it to match my complexion so I

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.630 
I wanted it to match my complexion so I
decided<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.739> just<00:02:40.980> use<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.160> little<00:02:41.310> bit<00:02:41.580> of

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
decided to just use a little bit of

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.070 
decided to just use a little bit of
foundation

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
foundation

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.720 
foundation
here's<00:02:43.350> how<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.680> came<00:02:43.800> out<00:02:43.980> my<00:02:44.220> foreheads<00:02:44.610> a

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
here's how it came out my foreheads a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.450 
here's how it came out my foreheads a
little<00:02:44.970> shiny<00:02:45.240> but<00:02:45.870> that's<00:02:46.080> okay<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.130> just

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
little shiny but that's okay so I just

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.980 
little shiny but that's okay so I just
wanted<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.790> let<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.120> know<00:02:48.300> that<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.660> washed

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
wanted to let you know that it washed

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.770 
wanted to let you know that it washed
well<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.830> washed<00:02:50.220> without<00:02:50.730> any<00:02:51.030> issues<00:02:51.570> I

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
well it washed without any issues I

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.680 
well it washed without any issues I
think<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.530> may<00:02:52.860> have<00:02:52.890> lost<00:02:53.310> about<00:02:53.580> four<00:02:54.060> strands

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
think I may have lost about four strands

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.390 
think I may have lost about four strands
it<00:02:54.840> wasn't<00:02:55.200> more<00:02:55.350> than<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.680> because<00:02:56.130> I

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
it wasn't more than that because I

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.030 
it wasn't more than that because I
always<00:02:56.640> detangle<00:02:57.480> my<00:02:57.510> wigs<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.080> case<00:02:58.290> i<00:02:58.530> was

always detangle my wigs in case i was

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.380 
always detangle my wigs in case i was
combing<00:02:59.280> through<00:02:59.700> whether<00:02:59.880> they're<00:03:00.120> tangled

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
combing through whether they're tangled

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.330

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
what I am at just to make sure that the

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.590 
what I am at just to make sure that the
way<00:05:52.650> bounces<00:05:53.250> back<00:05:53.430> once<00:05:53.790> i<00:05:53.970> flat<00:05:54.210> iron<00:05:54.420> it

way bounces back once i flat iron it
andrey<00:05:55.290> wash<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.800> so<00:05:56.400> then<00:05:56.550> that<00:05:56.730> way<00:05:56.850> we<00:05:56.880> can

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
andrey wash it so then that way we can

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.670 
andrey wash it so then that way we can
get<00:05:57.330> an<00:05:57.420> idea<00:05:57.540> if<00:05:57.870> i'm<00:05:58.020> going<00:05:58.170> to<00:05:58.260> have<00:05:58.410> these
