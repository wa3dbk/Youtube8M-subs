car which is right over here where the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.859 
car which is right over here where the
gas<00:01:04.949> pedal<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.430> you'll<00:01:06.390> see<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:08.270> data<00:01:09.270> link

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
gas pedal is you'll see this data link

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.649 
gas pedal is you'll see this data link
connector<00:01:10.970> that's<00:01:11.970> what<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.360> called

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
connector that's what it's called

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.649 
connector that's what it's called
what<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.490> short<00:01:14.760> out<00:01:14.880> pin<00:01:15.119> number<00:01:15.390> 4

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
what you do is short out pin number 4

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.250 
what you do is short out pin number 4
and<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.470> number<00:01:16.500> 8<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.729> case<00:01:18.030> it's

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
and the number 8 in this case it's

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:29.190 
and the number 8 in this case it's
one<00:01:20.920> two<00:01:21.220> three<00:01:21.580> four<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.900> eight<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.720> that's

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
one two three four and eight so that's

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.060 
one two three four and eight so that's
how<00:01:29.470> it<00:01:29.530> should<00:01:29.620> be<00:01:31.200> four<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.380> eight<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
how it should be four and eight the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.880 
how it should be four and eight the
number<00:01:36.070> four<00:01:36.520> number<00:01:37.030> four<00:01:37.450> is<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:38.440> black

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
number four number four is a black

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.820 
number four number four is a black
number<00:01:39.700> eight<00:01:39.910> pan<00:01:40.210> is<00:01:40.420> black<00:01:40.810> and<00:01:41.050> white<00:01:41.230> wire

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
number eight pan is black and white wire

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.730 
number eight pan is black and white wire
so<00:01:42.370> make<00:01:43.090> sure<00:01:43.120> you<00:01:43.450> do<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:43.750> so<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.590> don't

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
so make sure you do that so you don't

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.850 
so make sure you do that so you don't
shoot<00:01:45.040> out<00:01:45.160> like<00:01:45.400> one<00:01:45.580> of<00:01:45.700> these<00:01:45.990> or<00:01:46.990> these<00:01:47.470> you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
shoot out like one of these or these you

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.710 
shoot out like one of these or these you
know<00:01:47.950> I<00:01:47.980> mean<00:01:48.190> so<00:01:48.370> because<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.270> thing<00:01:49.510> is

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
know I mean so because this thing is

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.280 
know I mean so because this thing is
kind<00:01:49.870> of<00:01:49.960> like<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.140> triangle<00:01:51.270> edge<00:01:52.290> looking

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
kind of like a triangle edge looking

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.200 
kind of like a triangle edge looking
plug<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:54.910> once<00:01:55.120> we<00:01:55.240> do<00:01:55.360> that<00:01:56.880> before<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.030> do

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
plug so once we do that before you do

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.940 
plug so once we do that before you do
that<00:01:58.420> you've<00:01:59.170> got<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.410> make<00:01:59.440> sure<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.800> keys

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
that you've got to make sure the keys

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.100 
that you've got to make sure the keys
are<00:02:00.100> wore<00:02:00.730> out<00:02:00.940> of<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.210> ignition<00:02:01.300> since<00:02:01.900> mine

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
are wore out of the ignition since mine

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.420 
are wore out of the ignition since mine
were<00:02:02.260> not<00:02:02.410> in<00:02:02.560> all<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.740> way<00:02:02.920> I<00:02:02.950> just<00:02:03.190> had<00:02:03.310> them

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
were not in all the way I just had them

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.100 
were not in all the way I just had them
set<00:02:03.640> up<00:02:03.730> over<00:02:03.850> here<00:02:03.940> so<00:02:04.630> key<00:02:04.840> out<00:02:04.930> of<00:02:04.960> the

set up over here so key out of the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.860 
set up over here so key out of the
ignition<00:02:05.580> short<00:02:06.580> that<00:02:06.820> out<00:02:07.000> number<00:02:07.510> four<00:02:07.720> in

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
ignition short that out number four in

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.230 
ignition short that out number four in
number<00:02:08.320> eight<00:02:08.470> pin<00:02:08.710> with<00:02:09.490> a<00:02:09.520> key<00:02:09.730> and<00:02:09.820> ignition

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
number eight pin with a key and ignition

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.180

with<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:10.660> ignition<00:02:10.990> on<00:02:11.110> don't<00:02:11.620> start<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> car

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
with the ignition on don't start the car

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.410 
with the ignition on don't start the car
and<00:02:12.450> then<00:02:13.450> push<00:02:13.810> lock<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:15.160> unlock<00:02:15.460> for<00:02:16.180> thirty

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
and then push lock and unlock for thirty

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.110 
and then push lock and unlock for thirty
seconds<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.020> hold<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.490> push<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.910> and

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
seconds and hold it so we push that and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.960 
seconds and hold it so we push that and
hold<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.600> for<00:02:19.750> about<00:02:19.870> thirty<00:02:20.230> seconds<00:02:20.740> and<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
hold it for about thirty seconds and the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.530 
hold it for about thirty seconds and the
car<00:02:22.210> should<00:02:23.340> lock<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.520> unlock<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.940> door<00:02:24.970> that

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
car should lock and unlock the door that

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.240 
car should lock and unlock the door that
will<00:02:25.660> confirm<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.350> it's<00:02:26.920> been<00:02:27.070> programmed

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
will confirm that it's been programmed

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.290 
will confirm that it's been programmed
so<00:02:28.060> we'll<00:02:28.240> wait<00:02:28.420> for<00:02:28.690> thirty<00:02:28.900> seconds<00:02:33.240> now<00:02:34.240> you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
so we'll wait for thirty seconds now you

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.930 
so we'll wait for thirty seconds now you
hear<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.720> whole<00:02:34.810> card<00:02:35.050> lock<00:02:35.640> since<00:02:36.640> we<00:02:36.790> did

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
hear the whole card lock since we did

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.960 
hear the whole card lock since we did
that<00:02:37.739> what<00:02:38.739> we'll<00:02:38.950> do<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.430> turn<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.880> ignition

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
that what we'll do is turn the ignition
