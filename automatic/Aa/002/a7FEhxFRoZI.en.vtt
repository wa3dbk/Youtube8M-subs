00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.790
 I'm here in the ski hall in Neuss 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.680
 and with me the man is the one 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.070
 wants to revolutionize winter sports 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.740
 hello god you have the same 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.139
 there are several new winter sports equipment 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.449
 right that's the first one here 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.949
 this is the so-called snow barrel 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.840
 wow that already looks right 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.430
 aggravated from what is that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.660
 yes, that's how it came about, namely me 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.420
 thought me why always only 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.490
 small escaped the ski november 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.009
 The roll of the can really hurt 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.780
 Among these advantages with the berlin is me 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.100
 I do not need any special clothes 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.930
 I do not need any qualifications 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.239
 just get in the barrel and 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.010
 directly from main and we want that 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.870
 Of course, prove this and that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.670
 see barrel in action and as a tester 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.710
 we have an absolute piste profi 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:55.800
 at the beginning 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:59.000
 welcome dj ötzi greetings me 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.460
 finds really great that we today us 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.049
 to exchange yourself 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.549
 then I would say you rise ever 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.740
 into the distance and I ask again the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.540
 Inventor personally what happens? 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.979
 now as I said you do not need 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.070
 special knowledge in this respect can 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.110
 it goes straight off is a great 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.610
 invention now I am really 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.610
 curious dj 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.200
 it is quite nice to fight off 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.090
 any influence on it 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.580
 direction it for the special 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.900
 the freestyle rich 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.440
 you are you so well protected that 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.440
 nothing can happen 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:09.080
 that's great, are you coming again 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:10.820
 do so and so long explains the georg 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.020
 us the next device is already yes 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.150
 like so many discussions 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.830
 I discovered winter sports fans 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.990
 the snow fried looks best 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.130
 direct contact to the snow and that's why 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.130
 I've got something completely new 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.690
 the so-called kimi chieming 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.190
 I think you have to do ours 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.540
 let me explain that I want to explain 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.610
 like to do it is in principle quite simple 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.440
 unlike the barrel I have here 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.240
 this time no sports equipment in the actual 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.050
 but a body becomes itself 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.990
 sportgerät 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.820
 wow that sounds exactly needed 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.500
 implicitly nothing more than this 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:47.510
 special chieming pants and the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:49.010
 patented kevin chandlers were able to 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.900
 best directly on the chieming pants and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.390
 you georg tells us how chieming 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.680
 works in principle quite simply the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.959
 pants open at the back so that I can with the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.760
 buttocks have direct contact with the snow 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.709
 and by the anatomy of the human 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.090
 I almost get kimmel in the lane 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.760
 held and that is the so-called 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.930
 kevin effect but it is not terrible 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.239
 cold 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.989
 right there comes the boards playing dj mag 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.370
 you already a game and indeed the cream 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.209
 implicitly two tasks up to 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.190
 nanotechnology 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.190
 if I have me lotion so they 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.570
 save much more would have cold again 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.620
 flattened surface should that I quasi 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.620
 feel no resistance 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.970
 ok then we start now have fun 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.970
 coming of me 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.629
 money is no problem for the 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.409
 Kremlin does not have to keep watch on that 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:55.549
 the list is for example or 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:58.450
 broken glass and how to brake principle 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.450
 just like with the panel 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.000
 madness 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:11.260
 supergeil the three pack we come to 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.120
 you for your last invention 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:19.150
 we have to get to the foot of the hang right 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:22.079
 yes exactly partners now I am 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.079
 really excited 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:28.479
 that sounds crazy and deliberate 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.040
 what is the most annoying thing about skiing? 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.690
 clear downhill that's great 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.310
 but the mountain re-emerge that the 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.510
 city ​​paralyzes why should sell 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.729
 does not come to be on the double 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.380
 It would be great if the effort would be then 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.270
 everything would thought that was in principle 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.250
 simply we stretch bungee rope from 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.800
 Unround downhill it will be a dj 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.590
 hooked to have to return green 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.490
 There are almost more riders driving uphill 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.100
 hot 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:56.490
 this really looks like a super fan from dj 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.490
 you are welcome to take a break 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.419
 madness 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:14.150
 Thank you for these great inventions 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:16.220
 and of course a huge thanks to the grc 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.930
 that he has spontaneously joined in 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.389
 namely in half an hour an après 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.610
 ski concert in ischgl and thus back 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.240
 to wolfgang and anneliese peter zwegat 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.870

 Good day I come in Peter Zwegat is 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.220
 one from king david official 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.229
 Recognized debt counselor he knows where 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.650
 the problems to look for are i see them 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:41.690
 have a newborn congratulation 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:43.070
 it is her biological child , why, because you are 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.479
 otherwise maintenance claims to the 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.770
 physical father should have asserted 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.770
 but can be good
