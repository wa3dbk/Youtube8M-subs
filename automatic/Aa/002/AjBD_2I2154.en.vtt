he is going to order an alternator it's

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.289 
he is going to order an alternator it's
going<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.070> be<00:02:14.190> even<00:02:14.370> prettier<00:02:14.730> than<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.150> moon

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
going to be even prettier than the moon

appreciate you muscling medicom comms a
regulator<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.670> we<00:02:35.760> actually<00:02:35.910> got<00:02:36.150> off<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
regulator that we actually got off the

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.790 
regulator that we actually got off the
grand<00:02:36.660> Torino<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.380> we

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
grand Torino and we

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.830 
grand Torino and we
are<00:02:37.860> going<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.040> put<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.310> into<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.700> Mustang<00:02:39.210> 69

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
are going to put it into the Mustang 69

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.010 
are going to put it into the Mustang 69
and<00:02:40.220> see<00:02:41.220> if<00:02:41.490> that<00:02:41.520> is<00:02:41.940> having<00:02:42.240> issues<00:02:42.480> or<00:02:42.840> not

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
and see if that is having issues or not

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.600 
and see if that is having issues or not
if<00:02:43.350> it's<00:02:43.530> still<00:02:43.710> operating<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.250> same<00:02:44.430> way

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
if it's still operating the same way

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.840 
if it's still operating the same way
even<00:02:44.970> with<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.300> then<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:47.040> means<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.550> the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
even with this then it means that the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.400 
even with this then it means that the
alternator<00:02:48.270> is<00:02:48.420> going<00:02:48.480> someone<00:02:49.260> recommended

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
alternator is going someone recommended

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.640 
alternator is going someone recommended
that<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.100> not<00:02:50.430> we<00:02:50.940> bypass<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.720> regulator<00:02:52.140> not

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
that we not we bypass the regulator not

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.740 
that we not we bypass the regulator not
a<00:02:52.680> good<00:02:52.860> idea<00:02:52.920> especially<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> 69<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.630> not

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
a good idea especially in a 69 it's not

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.380 
a good idea especially in a 69 it's not
a<00:02:54.810> self-regulating<00:02:55.680> alternator<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:57.300> will

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
a self-regulating alternator and it will

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.000 
a self-regulating alternator and it will
burn<00:02:57.600> out<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.930> alternator<00:02:58.380> without<00:02:58.830> this

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
burn out the alternator without this

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.190 
burn out the alternator without this
regulator<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.730> neither<00:03:00.360> regulator<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
regulator so neither regulator for the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.410 
regulator so neither regulator for the
69<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.980> we're<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.490> test<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:02.880> one<00:03:03.090> now

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.850 

here's<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.510> old<00:03:06.660> regulator<00:03:07.080> there's<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.710> new

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
here's the old regulator there's a new

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.830 
here's the old regulator there's a new
one<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.100> showed<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.970> we<00:03:09.510> are<00:03:09.540> going

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
one I just showed you and we are going

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.380 
one I just showed you and we are going
to<00:03:09.930> plug<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.830> one<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.550> let<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.180> core

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
to plug this one in and let the core

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.080 
to plug this one in and let the core
idle<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.020> watch<00:03:13.650> am<00:03:13.980> Cait<00:03:14.250> see<00:03:14.550> if<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.730> goes<00:03:14.880> up

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
idle and watch am Cait see if it goes up

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.170 
idle and watch am Cait see if it goes up
past<00:03:15.360> 12<00:03:15.660> point<00:03:16.190> 12.5<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.520> balls<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:18.030> has

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
past 12 point 12.5 on balls this has

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.330 
past 12 point 12.5 on balls this has
been<00:03:18.210> unplugged<00:03:18.750> and<00:03:19.320> we<00:03:19.650> are<00:03:19.740> plugging<00:03:20.010> this

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
been unplugged and we are plugging this

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.370 
been unplugged and we are plugging this
in<00:03:20.580> now<00:03:20.760> again<00:03:21.180> I'm<00:03:21.360> doing<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.750> so<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.170> can't

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
in now again I'm doing it so it can't

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.750 
in now again I'm doing it so it can't
show<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.620> actually<00:03:22.950> go<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:23.340> it's<00:03:23.460> going

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
show it actually go in but it's going

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.470 
show it actually go in but it's going
right<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.090> there<00:03:24.300> plugged<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:26.480> bypassing

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
right in there plugged in and bypassing

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.450 
right in there plugged in and bypassing
the<00:03:27.510> other<00:03:27.720> one<00:03:27.960> so<00:03:28.740> we<00:03:28.980> are<00:03:29.100> going<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:29.280> just

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
the other one so we are going to just

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.180 
the other one so we are going to just
lay<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:29.940> right<00:03:30.210> over<00:03:30.360> here<00:03:30.770> in<00:03:31.770> some<00:03:32.010> good

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
lay this right over here in some good

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.550 
lay this right over here in some good
spots<00:03:32.490> so<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.820> doesn't<00:03:33.060> move<00:03:33.240> and<00:03:33.600> idler<00:03:34.380> and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
spots so it doesn't move and idler and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.870 
spots so it doesn't move and idler and
see<00:03:34.770> what<00:03:34.920> happens<00:03:35.250> we're<00:03:35.430> going<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.730> hold

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
see what happens we're going to hold

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.220 
see what happens we're going to hold
this<00:03:36.060> why<00:03:36.270> I'm<00:03:36.420> running<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.750> engine<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:40.080> so

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
this why I'm running the engine and so

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.450 
this why I'm running the engine and so
we're<00:03:40.350> going<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.530> have<00:03:40.620> Ricky<00:03:40.890> just<00:03:41.100> hold<00:03:41.310> this

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
we're going to have Ricky just hold this

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.160 
we're going to have Ricky just hold this
so<00:03:41.700> it's<00:03:41.850> secure<00:03:42.209> doesn't<00:03:42.600> fall<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.900> anything

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
so it's secure doesn't fall in anything

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.960 
so it's secure doesn't fall in anything
and<00:03:43.890> I'm<00:03:44.130> going<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.600> get<00:03:45.600> in<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.780> car<00:03:46.020> and

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
and I'm going to get in the car and

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.930 
and I'm going to get in the car and
start<00:03:47.970> her<00:03:48.030> up<00:03:48.650> kind<00:03:49.650> of<00:03:49.680> move<00:03:49.830> my<00:03:49.980> stick<00:03:50.400> got

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
start her up kind of move my stick got

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.490 
start her up kind of move my stick got
to<00:03:51.060> move<00:03:51.209> my<00:03:51.390> snicks<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.140> batteries<00:03:52.410> are

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
to move my snicks the batteries are

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.350 
to move my snicks the batteries are
connected<00:03:52.890> here<00:03:53.130> at<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.220> battery<00:03:53.640> he's

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
connected here at the battery he's

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.449 
connected here at the battery he's
holding<00:03:54.750> on<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.170> testing<00:03:56.010> regulator

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
holding on to the testing regulator

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.960 
holding on to the testing regulator
which<00:03:56.850> is<00:03:57.030> basically<00:03:57.720> off<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.560> the<00:03:58.830> 70<00:03:59.190> off<00:03:59.730> the

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
which is basically off of the 70 off the

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.540 
which is basically off of the 70 off the
73<00:04:00.650> gran<00:04:01.650> torino<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:03.090> am<00:04:03.239> getting<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.810> and

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
73 gran torino and I am getting in and

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:13.010 
73 gran torino and I am getting in and
gonna<00:04:05.550> start<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.060> car<00:04:09.170> keys<00:04:10.170> in<00:04:10.200> Pocket<00:04:12.020> keys

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
gonna start the car keys in Pocket keys

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.979 
gonna start the car keys in Pocket keys
in<00:04:13.380> ignition<00:04:13.970> give<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.090> couple<00:04:15.270> pumps<00:04:17.989> yeah

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
in ignition give it a couple pumps yeah

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:32.300 
in ignition give it a couple pumps yeah
that's<00:04:19.530> starting<00:04:19.890> up<00:04:19.950> nice<00:04:20.160> or<00:04:20.430> what

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.950 

yeah<00:04:33.310> we're<00:04:33.580> only<00:04:33.729> at<00:04:33.940> 12<00:04:34.300> we<00:04:34.599> should<00:04:34.840> be

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
yeah we're only at 12 we should be

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.580 
yeah we're only at 12 we should be
closer<00:04:35.259> to<00:04:35.440> fourteen<00:04:36.069> to<00:04:36.220> sixteen<00:04:36.430> amps<00:04:37.090> so<00:04:37.330> I

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
closer to fourteen to sixteen amps so I

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.409 
closer to fourteen to sixteen amps so I
think<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.860> decisions<00:04:39.340> made<00:04:39.430> any<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.330> the

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
think the decisions made any of the

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.570 
think the decisions made any of the
alternator<00:04:40.930> is<00:04:41.080> going<00:04:41.110> bad<00:04:41.590> and<00:04:41.860> the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
alternator is going bad and the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.010 
alternator is going bad and the
regulator<00:04:42.970> is<00:04:43.120> making<00:04:43.389> a<00:04:43.449> heck<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.750> a<00:04:43.840> lot<00:04:43.960> of

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
regulator is making a heck of a lot of

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.689 
regulator is making a heck of a lot of
noise<00:04:44.289> and<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.680> doesn't<00:04:45.009> normally<00:04:45.130> make<00:04:45.430> noise

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
noise and it doesn't normally make noise

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.469 
noise and it doesn't normally make noise
so<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:47.710> looks<00:04:48.099> like<00:04:48.550> we<00:04:48.880> are<00:04:49.030> going<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.270> need<00:04:49.360> an

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
so it looks like we are going to need an

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.930 
so it looks like we are going to need an
alternator<00:04:49.990> for<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:53.289> this<00:04:54.069> is<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.340> last<00:04:54.550> part

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
alternator for and this is the last part

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.689 
alternator for and this is the last part
of<00:04:55.150> getting<00:04:55.509> that<00:04:55.720> the<00:04:56.080> vinyl<00:04:56.470> top<00:04:56.650> stuck<00:04:57.520> up

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 
of getting that the vinyl top stuck up

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.180 
of getting that the vinyl top stuck up
there<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:58.030> best<00:04:58.210> we<00:04:58.389> can<00:04:58.620> so<00:04:59.620> that's<00:04:59.979> going<00:05:00.130> to

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
there the best we can so that's going to

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.469 
there the best we can so that's going to
cure<00:05:00.520> tonight<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.150> should<00:05:02.080> be<00:05:03.270> look<00:05:04.270> for<00:05:04.449> a

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:15.909 
plugged in the original regulator and

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:17.879 
plugged in the original regulator and
we're<00:05:16.180> going<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.360> see<00:05:16.569> what<00:05:16.720> we<00:05:16.840> get<00:05:16.990> good
