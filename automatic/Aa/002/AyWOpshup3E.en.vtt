00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.800
 I've been carrying demolition timbers. 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.680
 singing things from the bay antique dealers 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 old wooden parts including focus 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.460
 of wood and many years ago 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.440
 20 years ago and today I'm here in 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 Israel is not from my land, right? 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.769
 cacao region and return to the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.379
 to produce the parts with the 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.930
 own wood sold in mines and 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.019
 came to live a few years in tiradentes 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.089
 I have spent years working 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:02.519
 selling leading our 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:05.070
 priorities here for families and then 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.619
 I started a business here in the bay 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.140
 even explore our own market 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.180
 our business from here by returning to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.409
 our region in old wood pole 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.930
 demolition wood and old wood 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.880
 explains that the viewer is a 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.040
 demolition demolition say we were not 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.460
 we demolish houses 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.039
 ancient cities but also farm 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.929
 most in contact with the farm to 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.749
 our cocoa region is a rich region 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.479
 in woods and our Atlantic forest 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:39.210
 our forest biome plan biome 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.130
 so many years behind us in our region 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.270
 our cocoa crop has 12 more than 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.130
 200 years 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.700
 so if you build many mansions 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.060
 many houses and came the decadence of 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.280
 90's here was the witch's broom 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.899
 who sees the bankruptcy of the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.639
 our farmers' region 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.979
 with that the black people the official 

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:05.909
 Columbus will stay in these married houses 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.520
 in ruin in a precarious situation and today 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.340
 usually they sell or they leave the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.720
 that it is samba that you remove the wood 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.209
 How does it happen? 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.970
 they sell they trade with us 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.010
 change with the move if not caught do not lose 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.170
 totally that thing they accept that 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.200
 We do any business, I already went. 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.720
 lumberman have already cleared a lot, but I 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.110
 I am with my conscience that is bad and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.730
 harmful to the environment the planet 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.850
 understood then I'm working today 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.220
 with this thing that 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.500
 and a politician who decomposes 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.090
 we are taking advantage of the fact that wood has no 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.630
 does not take into who is not old is free 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.690
 200 years to more than 90 300 ha and 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.060
 How do you build a property? 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.580
 the mobile so that it including the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.400
 wood if you want more has to 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.710
 wood initiative of the state of 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.740
 decomposition that is Carlos who is 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.940
 sunning rain made the mobile that has 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.580
 sofa 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.980
 This seat that seat this months. 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.500
 between the work of the house is treated 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.370
 bracelet with some product that will not 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.200
 will not validate more of theorization 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.140
 Good way to live many years. 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.260
 of time and you do the drawing but how it is 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.420
 that is because the artist he creates 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.000
 How do you make your children? 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.950
 inspired by even dressing up things 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.110
 old old parts have too much oil 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.320
 very much I have a vocation as a child of 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.440
 make copy of drawing things and see 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.890
 where already from many years and to make carts 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:46.220
 hand that thing there I have an air of 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.150
 Graham 's Keeper of Keeping was born with 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.630
 this art 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.630
 now and I really enjoyed that one of those is 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.930
 a sofa is how I would say it's a sofa 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.210
 bed sofa bed sofa bed creation our 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.660
 drawing all of ours and becomes a 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.240
 bed and and so very stylish and was a 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.530
 an order that comes from outside between the 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.080
 rio de janeiro we even attended 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.840
 customer here is jane de sÃ£o paulo 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.210
 Our main focus is the gringo I the 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.580
 gringo is not my people that comes the 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.100
 tourist but grid as well as the 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.600
 gringo that here in the camp when I was 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.150
 in my store in the village focusing on this 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.680
 gringo story of the person who 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.910
 lives out that already knows the history of 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.850
 demolition 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.100
 We're on the road, starting now. 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.870
 but Europe already knows demolition many 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.390
 years much more than we 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.150
 and you find this very useful because of 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.420
 anyway it's the furniture they are 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.790
 created nor built through 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:48.150
 a process that I do not drink anything with the name 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.610
 the episode against the environment and not 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.400
 no aggression to the environment are 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.770
 taking parts that life opposition to 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.990
 new environment reads recovering 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.780
 unlike you do the recording 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.510
 of the Atlantic forest and the 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.880
 environment where such decomposition and would be 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.840
 It is coming in to manufacture parts that 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.510
 recycling 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.820
 We want to invite you as a tourist to 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.570
 know our store emporium wood 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.570
 old here in the real
