00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.029
 brother's press with you again sneakyjoe 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.460
 and welcome to thirty seventh 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.099
 angels creation lesson 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.280
 nakid I bet you didn't expect me 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.740
 but nevertheless let's continue as you 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.470
 remember initially we added to our 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.490
 level simple eat same ki object with 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.769
 using brushes 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.930
 then we switched to statistical grids 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.119
 and then from the static grids you 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.000
 did inter factors by which 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.779
 we did the animation through unlimited here 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.239
 this tool 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.280
 but how much less can you understand 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.500
 it's not enough to level 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.550
 necessary interactivity 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.890
 Today I will tell you about physical 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.140
 objects let's get started don't forget 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.040
 what can be done clear &amp; cis right here from 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.590
 right button 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.000
 if something is selected and let's find 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.250
 the object that we are going to do 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.500
 let it be physical 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.660
 static month and let's see 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.239
 some little nice little object 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.520
 knot let's barrel a barrel of this canonical 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.699
 a barrel is orthodox let's do 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.100
 a copy of this orthodox barrels and place 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.299
 her in new pc 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.479
 solely in order not to 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.580
 zagazhivat the main object maybe you want 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.170
 No, it's not that, although it is possible and mine will show 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.130
 how to ult my professor pyg him 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.400
 so here now i have my patch 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.960
 in which the barrels are cool let's 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.240
 this because hours we keep 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.979
 after that it is fully loaded and this 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.119
 great on and now we have to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.759
 start editing this barrel 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.799
 we go here and what we see after 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.320
 We press the button twice 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.150
 mouse on this barrel we see this 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.610
 here is the thing that is directly ours 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.780
 model to barrel which we can turn 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.090
 see what happens to him 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.159
 and let's see here there is such 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.909
 Kalyazin show button it is to the left 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.619
 boat of the world and let's get her and click like you 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.719
 see this green one 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.520
 appeared around our barrel she is not 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.969
 adjacent to this kidney if you look 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.600
 closer 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.850
 she is about this barrel is now i 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.190
 I will tell you about one thing is not this thing 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.300
 is that the harder the mesh 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.220
 collisions 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.110
 which is exactly the collision grid which 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.510
 will respond to shots and on 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.000
 the player's movement is correspondingly 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.100
 longer modelka will be loaded on 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.480
 level of course it's not critical but if u 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.540
 you such models 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.700
 60,000 you may suffer a little 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.810
 so let's simplify this model we 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.120
 go to college and choose paragraph 6 of 6 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.800
 to all parish mode post about how we 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.470
 we will do it here 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.600
 ask que no se que collisions with which 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.640
 There will be no problems with booting and 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.880
 in principle for such a simple beta as 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.120
 a barrel of difference won't be what we 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.140
 can do here we are right in 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:57.090
 we can find one more piece 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:59.100
 let's do a search here in the water 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.800
 setup there is such a parameter as the masses 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.170
 Scale precisely this parameter is responsible for 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.450
 the mass of the object that is, the greater the mass 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.780
 the less this object will react 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.360
 on the action of the players and the less weight 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.900
 accordingly, the object will be stronger 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.120
 to react 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.800
 I just repeated I hope not 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.959
 Well, I hope that you somehow understood 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.720
 what I wanted to say let's do 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.810
 mass of this barrel. 2 and after we 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.959
 This is done, let's make sure that yes here 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.130
 no option to keep the grid close 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.450
 do safe in content browser and 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.880
 make sure everything is fully loaded 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.390
 saving the package once again and now 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.840
 let's do this thing i just 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.400
 how do we choose this grid are we doing here 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.830
 so here we right click on 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.080
 surfaces and let's add simple 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:53.400
 static grid to demonstrate a 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.739
 side by side we put this rigidbody exactly 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.100
 this thing is physical 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.550
 objects and let's check how this 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.370
 thing works in the game go to level 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.530
 and look on the right grid is not static 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.410
 we shoot and nothing happens 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.080
 and on the left is a physical object according to 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.730
 nifiga myself as he flew and by the way 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.200
 Please note that if we try 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.640
 it will be like she will 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.250
 bounce in the air 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.959
 it's because she has a square body 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.770
 collisions 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.690
 if we have this body did not 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.350
 square and would have become a round barrel 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.569
 would skate 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.270
 well, respectively, now you guys 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.120
 know how to make that awesome 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.430
 a tower of heaps of falling barrels that you 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.000
 see one of the videos that i 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.620
 dumped a long time ago and by the way 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.840
 pay attention if the mouth is simple 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.150
 static grid 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.440
 a turquoise color is a physical object 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.860
 Green colour 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.289
 In the grid display mode , well, it seems 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.449
 that's all the guys wanted to show you 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.949
 good luck to you all with you 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.949
 Joe do youtube routine
