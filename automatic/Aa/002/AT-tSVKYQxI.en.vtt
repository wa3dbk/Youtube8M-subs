to<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> two<00:01:04.170> carburetors<00:01:05.090> okay<00:01:06.090> we're<00:01:06.450> now

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to the two carburetors okay we're now

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.750 
to the two carburetors okay we're now
going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.080> fire<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> motor<00:01:07.680> up<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
