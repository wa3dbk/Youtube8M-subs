but I feel like this is pretty fitting
for<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> logic<00:00:24.990> channel<00:00:25.320> seeing<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.250> my

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
for the logic channel seeing as it is my

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.189 
for the logic channel seeing as it is my
best<00:00:26.609> gameplay<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.180> pretty<00:00:27.420> fast-paced<00:00:27.750> get

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
gameplay and i'm actually using a not

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.380 
gameplay and i'm actually using a not
really<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> different<00:01:08.400> setup<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:09.000> like<00:01:09.180> I

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
really a different setup but like I

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.510 
really a different setup but like I
switch<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.960> around<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.320> bit<00:01:10.619> instead<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
switch it around a little bit instead of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
switch it around a little bit instead of
using<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.909> cat<00:01:12.180> 40<00:01:12.540> which<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:12.780> always<00:01:13.049> use<00:01:13.229> on

attack<00:01:16.049> 45<00:01:16.470> which<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.220> much<00:01:17.610> better<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:17.939> I

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119

highly<00:01:18.479> advise<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.900> guys<00:01:18.960> try<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.380> out<00:01:19.500> cuz

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
highly advise you guys try that out cuz

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.060 
highly advise you guys try that out cuz
that's<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> tooth<00:01:20.850> shotgun<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.780> mean<00:01:22.070> it's

that's like a tooth shotgun I mean it's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.859 
that's like a tooth shotgun I mean it's
basically<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.880> better<00:01:24.060> than<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> shotgun<00:01:24.720> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
basically be better than the shotgun to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.240 
basically be better than the shotgun to
be<00:01:24.960> honest<00:01:25.259> life<00:01:25.350> because<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:25.979> range

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
be honest life because that's more range

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.640 
be honest life because that's more range
it<00:01:26.549> has<00:01:26.700> more<00:01:27.420> power<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.810> mean<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.080> kills<00:01:28.259> almost
