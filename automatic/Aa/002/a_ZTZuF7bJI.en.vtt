course<00:03:49.400> then<00:03:49.790> that<00:03:50.030> side<00:03:50.239> is<00:03:50.480> going<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.750> get

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
course then that side is going to get

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.199 
course then that side is going to get
the<00:03:51.050> darker<00:03:51.410> lipstick<00:03:51.800> on<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.220> but<00:03:52.940> you<00:03:53.030> could

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
the darker lipstick on it but you could

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.089 
the darker lipstick on it but you could
just<00:03:53.390> wash<00:03:53.599> like<00:03:53.959> brush<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.440> off<00:03:54.620> with<00:03:55.069> a

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
just wash like brush that off with a

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.040 
just wash like brush that off with a
piece<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.430> tissue<00:03:55.640> paper<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.750> wouldn't

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
piece of tissue paper but I wouldn't

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.360 
piece of tissue paper but I wouldn't
recommend<00:03:57.140> doing<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:57.830> other<00:03:57.920> way<00:03:58.069> around

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
recommend doing it the other way around

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.710 
recommend doing it the other way around
because<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.790> feel<00:03:58.940> like<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.150> lighter<00:03:59.390> color

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
because I feel like the lighter color

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.720 
because I feel like the lighter color
wouldn't<00:04:00.530> do<00:04:00.680> much<00:04:00.830> underneath<00:04:01.250> the<00:04:01.519> brighter

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
wouldn't do much underneath the brighter

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.460 
wouldn't do much underneath the brighter
color<00:04:02.030> so<00:04:02.239> I<00:04:02.300> feel<00:04:02.480> like<00:04:02.510> you'd<00:04:02.750> want<00:04:03.050> to<00:04:03.110> use

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
color so I feel like you'd want to use

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.259 
color so I feel like you'd want to use
the<00:04:04.069> lighter<00:04:04.310> color<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:04.730> kind<00:04:04.910> of<00:04:05.000> highlight

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
the lighter color to kind of highlight

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.509 
the lighter color to kind of highlight
the<00:04:05.630> tops<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:06.050> your<00:04:06.200> lips<00:04:06.380> on<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.709> inner<00:04:06.860> parts

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
the tops of your lips on the inner parts

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.190 
the tops of your lips on the inner parts
of<00:04:07.610> your<00:04:07.760> lips<00:04:07.910> to<00:04:08.150> create<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.599> illusion<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:09.110> a

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
of your lips to create the illusion of a

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.650 
of your lips to create the illusion of a
fuller<00:04:09.380> lip<00:04:09.769> so<00:04:10.160> that<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.850> kind<00:04:11.060> of<00:04:11.120> my<00:04:11.180> shorter

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
fuller lip so that is kind of my shorter

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.900 
fuller lip so that is kind of my shorter
view<00:04:11.870> on<00:04:12.049> this<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.470> do<00:04:12.560> like<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.130> it<00:04:13.310> cost<00:04:13.580> nine

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
view on this I do like it it cost nine

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.520 
view on this I do like it it cost nine
dollars<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:14.600> it's<00:04:14.989> a<00:04:15.049> little<00:04:15.260> bit<00:04:15.350> pricey

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
dollars so it's a little bit pricey

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.830 
dollars so it's a little bit pricey
although<00:04:16.070> for<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:17.090> thought<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.419> it<00:04:17.540> you<00:04:17.660> are

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
although for the thought of it you are

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.810 
although for the thought of it you are
getting<00:04:18.139> two<00:04:18.290> different<00:04:18.500> lip<00:04:18.829> colors<00:04:19.160> and

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
getting two different lip colors and

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.129 
getting two different lip colors and
I'll<00:04:20.150> go<00:04:20.239> ahead<00:04:20.419> and<00:04:20.540> give<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:20.810> swatch<00:04:21.079> of

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
I'll go ahead and give you a swatch of

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.190 
I'll go ahead and give you a swatch of
each<00:04:21.440> one<00:04:21.799> first<00:04:22.760> this<00:04:23.030> is<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.300> lighter<00:04:23.750> shade

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
each one first this is the lighter shade

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.510 
each one first this is the lighter shade
it's<00:04:25.040> a<00:04:25.100> really<00:04:25.400> pretty<00:04:25.669> blue<00:04:26.030> based<00:04:26.500> pink<00:04:29.169> and

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
it's a really pretty blue based pink and

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.920 
it's a really pretty blue based pink and
then<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.639> is<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.030> darker<00:04:32.389> shade<00:04:32.600> it's<00:04:32.870> a

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
then this is the darker shade it's a

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.650 
then this is the darker shade it's a
little<00:04:33.139> bit<00:04:33.260> of<00:04:33.440> more<00:04:33.680> of<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.860> hot<00:04:34.070> pink<00:04:34.660> again

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
little bit of more of a hot pink again

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.290 
little bit of more of a hot pink again
so<00:04:36.229> very<00:04:36.260> blue<00:04:36.889> based<00:04:39.880> so<00:04:40.880> there's<00:04:41.060> the

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
so very blue based so there's the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.820 
so very blue based so there's the
brighter<00:04:41.510> color<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.110> there<00:04:42.290> is<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.590> lighter

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
brighter color and there is the lighter

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.130 
brighter color and there is the lighter
one<00:04:43.070> now<00:04:43.970> I<00:04:44.000> really<00:04:44.270> like<00:04:44.450> these<00:04:44.630> together<00:04:44.870> I

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
one now I really like these together I

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.960 
one now I really like these together I
think<00:04:45.440> they're<00:04:45.560> really<00:04:45.770> complementary<00:04:46.490> but<00:04:46.940> I

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
think they're really complementary but I

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.310 
think they're really complementary but I
do<00:04:47.060> think<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.510> could<00:04:47.660> also<00:04:47.810> wear<00:04:48.020> them<00:04:48.169> each

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
do think you could also wear them each

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.840 
do think you could also wear them each
on<00:04:48.530> their<00:04:48.620> own<00:04:48.680> as<00:04:49.010> you<00:04:49.160> can<00:04:49.280> see<00:04:49.430> even<00:04:49.640> the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
on their own as you can see even the

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.150 
on their own as you can see even the
lighter<00:04:50.060> color<00:04:50.360> has<00:04:50.960> enough<00:04:51.380> pigment<00:04:51.860> to<00:04:52.039> be

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
lighter color has enough pigment to be

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.130 
lighter color has enough pigment to be
worn<00:04:52.400> on<00:04:52.580> its<00:04:52.640> own<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.690> course<00:04:53.930> the

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
worn on its own and of course the

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.750 
worn on its own and of course the
brighter<00:04:54.380> one<00:04:54.590> can<00:04:54.860> be<00:04:54.950> worn<00:04:55.190> on<00:04:55.340> its<00:04:55.490> own<00:04:55.610> as

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
brighter one can be worn on its own as

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.029 
brighter one can be worn on its own as
well<00:04:55.970> so<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.660> hope<00:04:57.050> that<00:04:57.289> helps<00:04:57.650> in<00:04:57.830> the

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
well so I hope that helps in the

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.520 
well so I hope that helps in the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
encourage you guys to try it out if you

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.379 
encourage you guys to try it out if you
are<00:05:07.100> interested<00:05:07.250> in<00:05:07.639> it<00:05:07.760> I<00:05:07.880> think<00:05:07.940> it's<00:05:08.180> nice

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
are interested in it I think it's nice

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.270 
are interested in it I think it's nice
because<00:05:08.750> having<00:05:09.289> two<00:05:09.590> different<00:05:09.860> colors<00:05:10.130> you

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
because having two different colors you

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.830 
because having two different colors you
can<00:05:10.310> kind<00:05:10.550> of<00:05:10.580> play<00:05:10.729> around<00:05:10.760> with<00:05:11.060> that<00:05:11.270> but

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
can kind of play around with that but

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.420 
can kind of play around with that but
they<00:05:11.990> definitely<00:05:12.169> are<00:05:12.530> complementary<00:05:13.160> and

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
they definitely are complementary and

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:14.529 
they definitely are complementary and
they<00:05:13.490> feel<00:05:13.669> like<00:05:13.700> they<00:05:13.910> look<00:05:14.090> really<00:05:14.419> nice

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
they feel like they look really nice

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.840 
they feel like they look really nice
together<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:15.320> then<00:05:15.889> of<00:05:16.130> course<00:05:16.160> on<00:05:16.580> another

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
together and then of course on another

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.640 
together and then of course on another
note<00:05:17.090> I<00:05:17.120> think<00:05:17.600> for<00:05:17.900> Valentine's<00:05:18.410> Day<00:05:18.590> this

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
note I think for Valentine's Day this

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.400 
note I think for Valentine's Day this
it's<00:05:18.889> a<00:05:18.979> very<00:05:19.010> simple<00:05:19.520> pretty<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:21.050> just<00:05:21.139> not

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
it's a very simple pretty and just not

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.590 
it's a very simple pretty and just not
over-the-top<00:05:21.740> look<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.729> do<00:05:22.880> just<00:05:23.360> very

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
over-the-top look to do just very

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.300
