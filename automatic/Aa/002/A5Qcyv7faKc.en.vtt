technique didn't really work out the way
that<00:00:33.870> intended<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.590> guess<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.239> guess<00:00:36.239> it

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that intended that guess I guess it

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.220 
that intended that guess I guess it
didn't<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> whole<00:00:36.780> thing<00:00:36.809> where<00:00:37.110> like

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
didn't do the whole thing where like

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.830

totally<00:01:05.129> out<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.489> your<00:01:05.610> favor<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.240> that's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
totally out of your favor and that's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.450 
totally out of your favor and that's
another<00:01:07.200> reason<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.560> my<00:01:07.680> light<00:01:07.890> cards<00:01:08.189> like

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
another reason to my light cards like

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.850 
another reason to my light cards like
number<00:01:09.180> seven<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:10.229> their<00:01:10.380> Arcana<00:01:10.619> force

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
number seven I like their Arcana force

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.050 
number seven I like their Arcana force
cards<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.220> think<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:11.700> they<00:01:11.970> are

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
cards I think just because they are

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210 
cards I think just because they are
based<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.450> much<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.750> luck<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.799> makes<00:01:14.040> them

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
based so much on luck not it makes them

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.920 
based so much on luck not it makes them
not<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.909> competitive<00:01:15.330> because<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.810> that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
not so competitive because of that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
not so competitive because of that
although<00:01:16.290> number<00:01:16.650> seven<00:01:16.920> was<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.250> worlds

bring<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.600> guess<00:01:51.810> at<00:01:52.020> most<00:01:52.380> six<00:01:52.829> levels

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
bring it up I guess at most six levels

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
that's a lot of people are thinking but

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.350 
that's a lot of people are thinking but
I<00:02:01.020> kind<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> think<00:02:01.439> about<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:01.920> wondered

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
I kind of think about it and wondered

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.789 
I kind of think about it and wondered
since<00:02:03.360> now<00:02:03.570> we<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.869> before<00:02:04.020> synchros<00:02:04.530> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
since now we have before synchros and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.010 
since now we have before synchros and
exceeds<00:02:05.159> why<00:02:05.759> not<00:02:05.939> use<00:02:06.149> its<00:02:06.360> effect<00:02:06.540> for

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
exceeds why not use its effect for

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.180 
exceeds why not use its effect for
something<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.590> being<00:02:07.799> able<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.979> roll

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
something like that being able to roll

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.440 
something like that being able to roll
the<00:02:08.340> dice<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.520> go

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
the dice and go

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.940 
the dice and go
or<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> higher<00:02:10.440> rank<00:02:10.800> XD<00:02:11.160> monster<00:02:11.459> easier<00:02:11.790> or<00:02:12.390> a

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
or a higher rank XD monster easier or a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.070 
or a higher rank XD monster easier or a
higher<00:02:13.950> level<00:02:14.340> synchro<00:02:15.120> monster<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:15.629> mean<00:02:15.840> why

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
higher level synchro monster I mean why

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.380 
higher level synchro monster I mean why
not<00:02:16.200> it'd<00:02:17.010> be<00:02:17.190> kind<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.519> cool<00:02:17.640> option<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.239> of

for a stronger monster the one with the
level<00:02:25.980> picton<00:02:26.790> be<00:02:27.390> another<00:02:27.690> way<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.870> bring<00:02:28.200> out

level picton be another way to bring out
the<00:02:28.410> most<00:02:28.530> high<00:02:28.680> level<00:02:28.920> must<00:02:29.040> urge<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.370> just

the most high level must urge to just
kind<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.849> plain<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.269> simple<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.720> think<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.560> a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
kind of plain and simple I think it's a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.559 
kind of plain and simple I think it's a
cool<00:02:31.739> card<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.250> reason<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.760> how<00:02:33.239> you<00:02:33.300> can

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
cool card for that reason of how you can

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.229 
cool card for that reason of how you can
either<00:02:33.690> use<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.849> way<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.030> was<00:02:36.090> intended

either use it the way it was intended

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.850 
either use it the way it was intended
like<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.720> old<00:02:36.870> days<00:02:36.959> just<00:02:37.319> to<00:02:37.349> bring<00:02:37.500> out<00:02:37.680> a

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
like in the old days just to bring out a

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.009 
like in the old days just to bring out a
stronger<00:02:38.459> monster<00:02:38.910> or<00:02:39.209> he'll<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.810> can<00:02:39.930> either

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
stronger monster or he'll you can either

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.559

nowadays where you can go for and exceed
semin<00:02:42.930> or<00:02:43.110> synchro<00:02:43.470> summon<00:02:43.769> so<00:02:44.220> that's<00:02:44.489> one<00:02:44.700> of

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
semin or synchro summon so that's one of

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.920 
semin or synchro summon so that's one of
the<00:02:44.819> reasons<00:02:45.060> why<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.180> think<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.510> card<00:02:45.780> should

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
the reasons why I think this card should

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.380 
the reasons why I think this card should
be<00:02:45.989> print<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.260> mean<00:02:46.410> why<00:02:46.560> not<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.340> know<00:02:47.549> not

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
be print I mean why not it's I know not

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.449 
be print I mean why not it's I know not
really<00:02:48.750> competitive<00:02:49.170> but<00:02:49.829> if<00:02:49.920> they<00:02:50.130> can<00:02:50.310> keep

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
really competitive but if they can keep

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.949 
really competitive but if they can keep
something<00:02:50.760> similar<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.269> artwork<00:02:51.630> it

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
something similar to that artwork it

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.319 
something similar to that artwork it
would<00:02:52.110> be<00:02:52.230> amazing<00:02:52.560> to<00:02:52.799> have<00:02:52.890> for<00:02:53.329> collecting

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
would be amazing to have for collecting

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.059 
would be amazing to have for collecting
it's<00:02:54.569> what<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.170> guess<00:02:55.380> may<00:02:55.560> not<00:02:55.769> want<00:02:55.920> for

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
it's what I guess may not want for

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.500 
it's what I guess may not want for
collecting<00:02:56.430> but<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.940> would<00:02:57.030> still<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.360> fun

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
collecting but it would still be a fun

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.750 
collecting but it would still be a fun
car<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.720> use<00:02:57.870> if<00:02:58.019> it's<00:02:58.170> just<00:02:58.319> for<00:02:58.500> fun<00:02:59.160> duel<00:02:59.459> I
