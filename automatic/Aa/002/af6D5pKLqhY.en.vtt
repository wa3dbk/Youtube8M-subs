00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the coax cable right here make sure it's

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.220 
the coax cable right here make sure it's
flat<00:00:55.590> your<00:00:56.430> compression<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.809> sorry<00:00:58.050> your

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
flat your compression I'm sorry your

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.069 
flat your compression I'm sorry your
crimp<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> go<00:00:59.940> up<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.690> there<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
crimp is going to go up in there all the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.180 
crimp is going to go up in there all the
way<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.710> wall

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
way to the wall

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.920 
way to the wall
you're<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> mash<00:01:03.360> it<00:01:03.539> down<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.899> your

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
you're going to mash it down with your

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.499 
you're going to mash it down with your
thumb<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.649> forefinger<00:01:05.039> so<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.520> makes<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.360> nice

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
thumb and forefinger so it makes a nice

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.440 
thumb and forefinger so it makes a nice
tight<00:01:06.899> grip<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> cable<00:01:08.300> then<00:01:09.300> you're

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
tight grip on the cable then you're

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.929 
tight grip on the cable then you're
going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.660> go<00:01:09.810> around<00:01:12.110> several<00:01:13.110> times<00:01:13.939> until

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
going to go around several times until

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.990 
going to go around several times until
you<00:01:15.630> don't<00:01:15.750> hear<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> cutting<00:01:16.760> wire<00:01:17.760> any

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
you don't hear it cutting wire any

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.410 
you don't hear it cutting wire any
longer<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.590> should<00:01:22.830> give<00:01:23.010> you<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> nice<00:01:24.090> cut

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
longer so it should give you a nice cut

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.810 
longer so it should give you a nice cut
like<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.130> now<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.460> these<00:01:26.640> little

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like that now you see all these little

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.570 
like that now you see all these little
metal<00:01:27.180> wires<00:01:27.390> around<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.080> these<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.340> need

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
metal wires around here these all need

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.469 
metal wires around here these all need
to<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:29.790> delicately<00:01:30.270> pulled<00:01:30.600> back<00:01:32.479> and

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
to be delicately pulled back and

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.570 
to be delicately pulled back and
completely<00:01:34.140> off<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> copper<00:01:35.070> rod<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
completely off of the copper rod in the

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.260 
completely off of the copper rod in the
middle<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.869> coaxial<00:01:37.409> cable

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.120 

you<00:01:43.270> don't<00:01:43.630> want<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.810> have<00:01:43.930> any<00:01:44.200> strands

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
you don't want to have any strands

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.180 
you don't want to have any strands
touching<00:01:45.820> it<00:01:45.970> so<00:01:46.960> once<00:01:47.590> you<00:01:47.710> pull<00:01:47.890> those<00:01:48.040> all

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
touching it so once you pull those all

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.270 
touching it so once you pull those all
back<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.730> want<00:01:48.910> to<00:01:49.030> fold<00:01:49.810> them<00:01:49.960> down<00:01:50.280> along

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
back you want to fold them down along

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.090 
back you want to fold them down along
the<00:01:51.430> outer<00:01:51.580> casing<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.510> cable<00:01:52.900> so<00:01:53.800> it<00:01:53.920> looks

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
the outer casing the cable so it looks

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.000 
the outer casing the cable so it looks
like<00:01:54.160> this<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.760> have<00:01:54.880> your<00:01:55.060> your<00:01:55.480> coax<00:01:56.010> I'm

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
like this you have your your coax I'm

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.210 
like this you have your your coax I'm
sorry<00:01:57.310> your<00:01:57.580> metal<00:01:58.090> rod<00:01:58.320> your<00:01:59.320> insulation<00:01:59.740> and

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
sorry your metal rod your insulation and

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.630 
sorry your metal rod your insulation and
then<00:02:01.120> the<00:02:01.300> copper<00:02:01.810> strands<00:02:02.340> then<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.460> take

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
then the copper strands then you take

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.510 
then the copper strands then you take
your<00:02:03.790> compression<00:02:04.390> end<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:06.160> can<00:02:06.280> see

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
your compression end and you can see

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.930 
your compression end and you can see
that<00:02:08.160> hole<00:02:09.160> down<00:02:09.369> in<00:02:09.580> there

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
that hole down in there

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.870 
that hole down in there
this<00:02:10.720> rod<00:02:11.020> needs<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.500> be<00:02:11.620> sure<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.040> goes<00:02:12.220> into

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
this rod needs to be sure it goes into

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.720 
this rod needs to be sure it goes into
that<00:02:13.060> hole<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.709> then<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.670> simply<00:02:17.310> push<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.520> up

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
that hole and then you simply push it up

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.080 
that hole and then you simply push it up
into<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.150> cable<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:21.250> see<00:02:21.430> right<00:02:21.520> now<00:02:21.700> it's

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
into the cable and see right now it's

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.110 
into the cable and see right now it's
not<00:02:22.209> there<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.690> need<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.870> twist<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:24.120> firmly

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
not there you need to twist it firmly

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.340 
not there you need to twist it firmly
onto<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.690> cable<00:02:29.400> until<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:31.540> comes<00:02:32.140> through

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
onto the cable until it comes through

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.710 
onto the cable until it comes through
like<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.790> almost<00:02:33.910> becomes<00:02:34.390> flush

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
like that and it almost becomes flush

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.650 
like that and it almost becomes flush
with<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.110> insides<00:02:35.550> once<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.760> happens<00:02:37.180> you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
with the insides once that happens you

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.730 
with the insides once that happens you
take<00:02:37.840> your<00:02:38.110> compression<00:02:39.450> tool<00:02:40.450> place<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.620> in

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
take your compression tool place it in

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.830
