to you an example on iphone five comes
in<00:02:15.610> around<00:02:15.730> 1600<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:17.170> definitely<00:02:17.860> it's<00:02:18.400> very

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
in around 1600 so definitely it's very

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.190 
fast very healthy speed for the HTC One
and<00:02:22.680> we're<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.800> see<00:02:24.010> where<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.670> HTC<00:02:25.210> One<00:02:25.480> x+<00:02:25.900> is

and we're to see where the HTC One x+ is

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.990 
and we're to see where the HTC One x+ is
going<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.440> come<00:02:26.560> in<00:02:26.710> here<00:02:26.920> here<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.670> second

with the Geekbench too and it comes in

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.850 
with the Geekbench too and it comes in
at<00:02:30.520> 14<00:02:31.030> 30<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.990> very<00:02:32.200> interesting<00:02:32.650> the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
at 14 30 so very interesting the

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.580 
at 14 30 so very interesting the
differences<00:02:33.700> between<00:02:33.730> both<00:02:34.600> these<00:02:34.840> now<00:02:35.410> we're

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
differences between both these now we're

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.110 
differences between both these now we're
going<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.740> do<00:02:35.890> just<00:02:35.950> for<00:02:36.250> fun<00:02:36.550> we're<00:02:36.940> going<00:02:37.060> to

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
going to do just for fun we're going to

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.260 
going to do just for fun we're going to
run<00:02:37.410> this<00:02:38.410> benchmark<00:02:39.010> once<00:02:39.280> again<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.850> then

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
run this benchmark once again and then

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.870 
run this benchmark once again and then
we'll<00:02:40.420> run<00:02:40.780> an<00:02:41.020> aunt<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.800> benchmark<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:42.790> we

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
we'll run an aunt to to benchmark so we

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.060 
we'll run an aunt to to benchmark so we
can<00:02:43.030> see<00:02:43.210> how<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.540> goes<00:02:43.570> on<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.650> Christmas

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
can see how that goes on the Christmas

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.580 
can see how that goes on the Christmas
show<00:02:45.370> we<00:02:45.670> routinely<00:02:46.180> review<00:02:46.810> all<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.440> major

companies and we do different

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.500 
companies and we do different

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
comparisons like this pretty much

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.960 
comparisons like this pretty much
compared<00:02:52.810> every<00:02:53.080> phone<00:02:53.290> that's<00:02:54.250> major<00:02:54.610> and

of<00:03:34.120> 11<00:03:34.209> 55<00:03:34.720> for<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.650> HTC<00:03:35.980> One<00:03:36.640> x+<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:37.900> some<00:03:38.680> very

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
of 11 55 for the HTC One x+ so some very

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.830 
of 11 55 for the HTC One x+ so some very
big<00:03:39.130> differences<00:03:39.790> in<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.150> scoring<00:03:40.600> of<00:03:40.660> these

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
big differences in the scoring of these

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.690 
big differences in the scoring of these
two<00:03:41.080> devices<00:03:41.320> even<00:03:42.040> though<00:03:42.280> they're<00:03:42.459> very

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
two devices even though they're very

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.940 
two devices even though they're very
similar<00:03:43.080> not<00:03:44.080> much<00:03:44.260> difference<00:03:44.680> in<00:03:44.830> the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
similar not much difference in the

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.130 
similar not much difference in the
Android<00:03:45.400> version<00:03:45.550> that<00:03:46.060> they're<00:03:46.209> using<00:03:46.630> not

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
Android version that they're using not

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.979 
Android version that they're using not
much<00:03:47.290> difference<00:03:47.680> in<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:47.890> core<00:03:48.190> but<00:03:48.989> there's

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
much difference in the core but there's

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.840 
much difference in the core but there's
definitely<00:03:50.590> considerable<00:03:51.280> difference<00:03:51.610> in

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
definitely considerable difference in

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.030 
definitely considerable difference in
their<00:03:52.000> performance<00:03:52.570> so<00:03:53.260> let's<00:03:53.620> take<00:03:53.800> a<00:03:53.860> look

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
their performance so let's take a look

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.350 
their performance so let's take a look
at<00:03:54.130> something<00:03:54.400> else<00:03:54.700> this<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.090> another

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
at something else this is another

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.770 
at something else this is another
benchmark<00:03:56.290> app<00:03:56.830> that<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.850> basically<00:03:58.330> used<00:03:58.600> to

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
benchmark app that is basically used to

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.430 
benchmark app that is basically used to
really<00:03:59.050> define<00:03:59.640> good<00:04:00.640> quality<00:04:04.440> determination

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
really define good quality determination

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.570 
really define good quality determination
of<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:07.709> process<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:09.100> we're<00:04:09.250> going<00:04:09.340> to<00:04:09.430> go<00:04:09.550> ahead

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
of a process so we're going to go ahead

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.630 
of a process so we're going to go ahead
and<00:04:10.209> run<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.600> test<00:04:10.900> here<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:12.130> you<00:04:12.160> can<00:04:12.489> see

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
and run the test here and so you can see

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.920 
and run the test here and so you can see
the<00:04:12.760> final<00:04:13.060> scores<00:04:13.330> between<00:04:13.540> both<00:04:13.780> these

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
the final scores between both these

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.849 
the final scores between both these
devices<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:15.040> HTC<00:04:15.519> One<00:04:15.700> coming<00:04:16.000> in<00:04:16.120> at<00:04:16.239> 19<00:04:16.859> 667

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
devices the HTC One coming in at 19 667

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.729 
devices the HTC One coming in at 19 667
you<00:04:17.950> can<00:04:18.070> see<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.340> right<00:04:18.549> down<00:04:18.789> on<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.739> HTC

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
you can see the right down on the HTC

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:21.970 
you can see the right down on the HTC
One<00:04:21.160> X

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
One X

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.940 
One X
plus<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.610> can<00:04:22.760> see<00:04:23.000> that<00:04:23.150> it<00:04:23.240> came<00:04:23.390> in<00:04:23.510> at<00:04:23.600> 13<00:04:24.020> 5

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
plus you can see that it came in at 13 5

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.130 
plus you can see that it came in at 13 5
15<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:26.240> you<00:04:26.330> can<00:04:26.480> see<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.660> breakdown<00:04:26.840> this

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
15 and you can see the breakdown this

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.290 
15 and you can see the breakdown this
course<00:04:27.440> so<00:04:27.980> definitely<00:04:28.490> much<00:04:28.790> faster<00:04:29.180> these

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
course so definitely much faster these

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.030 
course so definitely much faster these
to<00:04:29.600> see<00:04:29.780> one<00:04:29.990> of<00:04:30.170> course<00:04:30.350> you<00:04:30.470> got<00:04:30.650> so<00:04:30.920> many

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
to see one of course you got so many

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.680 
to see one of course you got so many
improvements<00:04:31.370> you've<00:04:31.730> got<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.000> front<00:04:32.300> facing

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
improvements you've got the front facing

from all the different bills that are on
it<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.550> certainly<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.420> little<00:04:41.630> great<00:04:41.900> leap

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
it and certainly a little great leap

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.490 
it and certainly a little great leap
from<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.770> HTC<00:04:43.760> One<00:04:44.180> x+<00:04:44.690> which<00:04:44.990> wasn't<00:04:45.230> a<00:04:45.380> bad

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
from the HTC One x+ which wasn't a bad

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.460 
from the HTC One x+ which wasn't a bad
phone<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.640> it's<00:04:46.820> during<00:04:47.180> this<00:04:47.270> time<00:04:47.510> so
