00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
easily whenever you have touched them

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.880

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.300 
really a fan of kamen rider beast hyper
just<00:03:21.720> because<00:03:22.019> of<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.290> confusing<00:03:22.739> motive

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
just because of the confusing motive

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.789 
just because of the confusing motive
even<00:03:23.700> with<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.269> band<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:24.810> did<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.079> great<00:03:25.349> job<00:03:25.410> in

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
even with that band I did a great job in

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.500 
even with that band I did a great job in
interpreting<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.790> character<00:03:27.269> and

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
interpreting the character and

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.750 
interpreting the character and

I<00:03:29.879> think<00:03:30.329> we<00:03:30.480> have<00:03:30.599> too<00:03:30.810> much<00:03:30.989> had

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
I think we have too much had

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.720 
I think we have too much had
replacements<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.069> could<00:03:32.340> have<00:03:32.459> substituted

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
replacements and could have substituted

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.420 
replacements and could have substituted
with<00:03:33.510> longer<00:03:33.989> fringe<00:03:34.230> as<00:03:34.500> since<00:03:34.799> these<00:03:35.220> are

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
with longer fringe as since these are

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.520 
with longer fringe as since these are
also<00:03:35.670> used<00:03:36.120> as<00:03:36.329> weapons<00:03:36.780> by<00:03:36.989> Kamen<00:03:37.349> Rider

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530
