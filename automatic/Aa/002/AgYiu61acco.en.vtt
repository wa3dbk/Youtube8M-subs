00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
sandals I can kind of understand because

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.149 
sandals I can kind of understand because
jeans<00:01:12.600> are<00:01:12.780> very<00:01:12.990> flexible<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.650> mean<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> guess

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
jeans are very flexible I mean I guess

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.100 
jeans are very flexible I mean I guess
if<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.330> wanted<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> work<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:15.960> in

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
if you really wanted to work out in

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.050 
if you really wanted to work out in
jeans<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.710> were<00:01:16.860> something<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.670> was

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
jeans if you were something that was

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.359 
jeans if you were something that was
baggy<00:01:18.299> or<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:19.020> know<00:01:19.140> had<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> little<00:01:19.979> give<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
baggy or you know had a little give to

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.260 
baggy or you know had a little give to
it<00:01:20.520> then<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.119> guess<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.650> fine<00:01:22.939> but<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.090> not

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it then I guess that fine but it's not

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.030 
it then I guess that fine but it's not
really<00:01:24.390> practical<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
really practical so that's not really a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.550 
really practical so that's not really a
big<00:01:26.159> deal<00:01:26.720> with<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> sandals<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.409> can

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
big deal with the sandals I can

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.899 
big deal with the sandals I can
understand<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.250> don't<00:01:29.310> want<00:01:29.520> sandals

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
understand why they don't want sandals

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.160 
understand why they don't want sandals
because<00:01:30.030> someone<00:01:30.450> might<00:01:30.570> drop<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.900> weight<00:01:31.110> on

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
because someone might drop a weight on

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.690 
because someone might drop a weight on
their<00:01:31.439> foot<00:01:31.680> break<00:01:31.920> their<00:01:32.100> foot<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.490> at<00:01:32.579> least

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
their foot break their foot and at least

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.490 
their foot break their foot and at least
with<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> shoe<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:34.259> protection

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
with a shoe that have some protection

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.130 
with a shoe that have some protection
not<00:01:35.130> much<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> little<00:01:35.759> bit<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> could

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
not much but a little bit so that could

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.859 
not much but a little bit so that could
be<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.290> liability<00:01:37.500> thing<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.310> like<00:01:38.520> in

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
be a liability thing just like in

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.149 
be a liability thing just like in
commercial<00:01:39.869> kitchens<00:01:39.990> all<00:01:40.530> employees<00:01:40.979> have

know it keeps the bald head like mine
warm<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.730> gives<00:03:43.000> enough<00:03:43.300> air<00:03:44.170> flowing

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
warm and it gives enough air flowing

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.810 
warm and it gives enough air flowing
through<00:03:44.860> through<00:03:45.160> all<00:03:45.250> these<00:03:45.370> little<00:03:45.670> holes

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
through through all these little holes

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.550 
through through all these little holes
to<00:03:46.060> let<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.330> breathe<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.840> it's<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.200> pretty<00:03:47.320> good

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
to let it breathe so it's a pretty good

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.280 
to let it breathe so it's a pretty good
thing<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.459> be<00:03:48.580> wearing<00:03:48.810> well<00:03:49.810> anyway<00:03:50.170> is

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.690 
thing to to be wearing well anyway is
that<00:03:50.350> planet<00:03:50.800> fitness<00:03:50.980> they<00:03:51.310> don't<00:03:51.489> allow

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
that planet fitness they don't allow

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.760 
that planet fitness they don't allow
these<00:03:51.880> things<00:03:52.180> now<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:52.840> asked<00:03:53.440> them<00:03:53.560> why<00:03:53.739> they

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
was a lot of gang activity and maybe

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.500 
was a lot of gang activity and maybe
certain<00:04:09.640> colors<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.270> know<00:04:10.500> which
