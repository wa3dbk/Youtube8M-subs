00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.690
 Hi Today's senior 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.550
 Click here to let me 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.250
 I bet I'm there with ze cormorant 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:21.900
 As this is a quite color picture , there are many people who are being considered 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:24.380
 That after inherits the exact number is more of us or next week to obtain a qualifying bait this time 3 b raised 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.380
 Want to think 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.619
 me 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.230
 The ruler is the same as usual. First, fuel in the gasoline parker 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.740
 Iggy money 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.420
 I have put up to the end 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.420
 I can not say that 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.800
 This is 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.790
 Let's run the town after this 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.540
 If it is actually used how much it will be used to verify the character's chronology 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.210
 It is a chance to say so 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.579
 Well everyone 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.850
 I think you have already seen it 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.190
 I want to go through Matti today 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.610
 goo 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.310
 So good 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.310
 I want to make it a Triff maker 0 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.980
 What 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.890
 The influence is 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.590
 Cormorants z electrophoresis 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.190
 I got on here 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:55.030
 Well, as an impression with this a 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:59.860
 Bike amount of exhaust is greater say and bought a big bike 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:03.280
 There is also a feeling that riding a large motorcycle while relatively feel free to Tsukiaeru 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.990
 For example, it does not bother me much to pull out on a day off 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.940
 The impression that it is just a good bike that you can use even while commuting 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.180
 This is fz 1 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.850
 xj 6 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:18.740
 I think it may be compared but 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.020
 When compared with fz 1, it runs much lighter than fz 1 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.420
 It is a feeling that was sparkling 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.270
 It is with it 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.830
 Something else 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:34.140
 and down for a moment you foot in fz 1 and or have that step in a location that just hits 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:37.420
 It has been a little This improvement is now I'd had a say or 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:42.350
 So basically the frame or engine is English 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:48.020
 Kedomo I'm common has become a little high easy-to-use image 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.860
 So if you really want a force like a line cc fz 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.690
 The 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.540
 I think it would be that fza or something if it became relatively a little more friendly 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.980
 I will 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.790
 The curled model is also released in ab April so it is easy to select relatively high 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.790
 I think that is not 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.840
 The distance meter that has returned now 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:32.540
 I 'm doing 24.7 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:35.810
 Then I think that I would like to try with the annual record that this takes it and put it 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.469
 Then I want to move on to the usual experiment 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.660
 This is the first 500 It is 1 liter in Japan 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:45.070
 I think that I want to disappear this from now 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.070
 See you first 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.370
 ｰｰｰwhich has entered 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.370
 Enter 5 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.380
 I will come in 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.920
 It has entered . 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.920
 So much in the living Mars 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.960
 Such mon is Kane 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.430
 200 just got rid of now 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.230
 Nanae- 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.680
 A 1 liter a 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:01.039
 Because 1 e 300 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.820
 It was rusty, so please take a moment 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:03.820
 It is attached 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.340
 Do you say it 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.340
 It has become the same state as when starting 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:22.050
 Then I think that I would like to calculate this review item 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:25.590
 Although it is this result, the total mileage is 24.8 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:31.190
 And use was in charges was that Mr. Ricker entered 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:34.660
 It will be the calculation that ran 19 liters when calculated 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:38.080
 This and the fly is a remote island 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:43.270
 Because I was running while I was not insisted on 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:46.689
 If you think about it, you may not get the same kind of enthusiasm as you did. 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:51.209
 It is only reference, but I think if it comes to something end 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.209
 See you in the next video
