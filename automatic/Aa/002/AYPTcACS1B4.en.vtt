00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.809
 Hello, how are you doing please? 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.500
 My name is Jaime Zapata and I am an artist 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.900
 painter that I am born in quito now 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.400
 I currently live in Paris I come and go 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.400
 frequently to ecuador 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.460
 I studied three years of sculpture not of 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.400
 painting and then already leaving the 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.670
 arts college there I started to interest 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.920
 a painting really like a technique 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.660
 possible that I can dominate because 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.300
 It is also not only painting 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.880
 but you have to really go further and 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.330
 beyond every time not 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.330
 i 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.310
 I started to get interested and the art was 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.100
 this office but above all a matter of 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.710
 craft like how to make violins how 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.110
 making pianos there is a tradition of how 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.340
 it is not only painting 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.080
 to say is it is from the production 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.509
 of the material with which you are going to paint 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.050
 say fabrics colors 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.470
 pigments the brushes that's the basis of 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.470
 the painting 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.260
 and between a year what you see always 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.470
 I should paint blindfolded 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.410
 to know what they are 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.890
 like sometimes blind eyes 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:08.259
 they also betray you look too much and 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.970
 stop looking at other things that I at 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.280
 least since my game so I think what 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.640
 I do so for others to see things 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.370
 which is a bit like 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.500
 as you said a moment ago 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.690
 maybe it 's helping them look and another 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.700
 way of things now that they 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.280
 they are seeing how I am painting and you 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:31.250
 You charge another dimension, it's not you anymore 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.290
 you are the same you here then it's okay 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.960
 unfold the reality if you wanted is 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.960
 say another other parameter is created 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.680
 and figurative painting I think that to me 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.310
 I'm very interested in representing 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.400
 reality 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.670
 I think I work and I specialize in 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.670
 that 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.440
 in this case there is the female presence 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:37.470
 very important always in my work because 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.880
 because I think I'm interested on the one hand 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.390
 because I was always close to 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:47.850
 women starting from my grandmother of my 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.950
 aunts that being the artist among 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.160
 in this case the woman who 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.050
 for us, women, we have 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.940
 someone 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.830
 Y 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:04.020
 transfer all your feeling to 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.020
 we deserve to be so 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:23.230
 art is not a profession because 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.450
 you can spend as in my case you 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.570
 You can spend 34 years painting what I'm going 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.360
 to expose now then paint has 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.650
 that kind of magic and attraction that 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.770
 that you paint because you like it because if 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.630
 no you would not do it is to say in the first 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.610
 so much so that for example 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.969
 I would already be in the age of almost 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.949
 retire 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.979
 and I say that not that I'm just 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:51.319
 starting my next 30 years of 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.479
 work or I do not have any 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.379
 possibility of retiring and surely 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.379
 I will die painting
