00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:10.960
 the bicycle can walk on the side 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.030
 left the street can can yes but wait a minute 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.209
 I 'm not telling you to get your 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.289
 bike and go out on a great avenue through 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.300
 Left Lane 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.910
 that's not what I mean in some 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.970
 situations, especially when you have 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.220
 that turning left at a crossroads is 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.560
 important that you have remains to 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.379
 left before reaching this 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.320
 crossing it is clear that if it is a 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.780
 fast transit a great avenue I 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.359
 I do not advise you to do that, I do not 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.480
 I advise you to stop in the 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:45.879
 pedestrians get off the bike and cross 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.980
 street through the crosswalk 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.909
 I will now show you a situation where 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.129
 I was traveling through the 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.510
 left just because I was going to turn 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.510
 left at the intersection 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.019
 I am 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.290
 many drivers do not understand this they 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.290
 come from the left side of the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.909
 track and it inclusive and not in peace 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.560
 Alberto just to be scared 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.119
 because they think you 're wrong 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.700
 driver please do not do this 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.820
 never ever you can find the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.850
 cyclist totally wrong against 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.970
 doing anything, but nothing justifies 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.159
 you honk to pass near the cyclist's 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.869

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.970
