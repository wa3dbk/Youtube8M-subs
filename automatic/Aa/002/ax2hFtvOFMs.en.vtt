00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
find this deck list and I believe I've

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.860 
find this deck list and I believe I've
stumbled<00:00:08.940> upon<00:00:09.469> what<00:00:10.469> seemed<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.980> be<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.870> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
stumbled upon what seemed to be the the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.110 
stumbled upon what seemed to be the the
winning<00:00:13.170> ycs<00:00:13.650> dark<00:00:13.980> world<00:00:14.160> deck<00:00:14.280> list<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.849> only

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
winning ycs dark world deck list I only

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.840 
winning ycs dark world deck list I only
have<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> main<00:00:15.660> deck<00:00:15.900> put<00:00:16.170> together<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.850> what

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.349 
I believe to be the cards in the extra
deck<00:00:19.710> because<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.189> really<00:00:20.400> wasn't<00:00:20.789> listed<00:00:20.970> but
