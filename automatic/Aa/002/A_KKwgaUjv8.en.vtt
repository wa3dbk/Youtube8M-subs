00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.670 
Matt we call that Joe a lead role we do
that<00:01:05.000> drill<00:01:05.269> before<00:01:05.420> every<00:01:05.960> practice<00:01:06.439> and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680

that drill before every practice and
before<00:01:07.040> every<00:01:07.460> game<00:01:07.840> basically<00:01:08.840> it's<00:01:09.409> just<00:01:09.560> to

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
before every game basically it's just to

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.520 
before every game basically it's just to
come<00:01:10.189> get<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.850> player<00:01:11.090> on<00:01:11.119> his<00:01:11.420> toes<00:01:11.689> can<00:01:12.290> also

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
come get the player on his toes can also

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.380 
come get the player on his toes can also
go<00:01:12.799> down<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.130> get<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> feel<00:01:13.610> for<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.909> back<00:01:14.030> pedal

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
go down to get a feel for the back pedal

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.450 
go down to get a feel for the back pedal
so<00:01:14.869> it's<00:01:15.020> not<00:01:15.170> really<00:01:15.229> like<00:01:15.440> hard<00:01:15.799> Joe<00:01:16.039> is<00:01:16.220> just

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
so it's not really like hard Joe is just

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:26.469 
so it's not really like hard Joe is just
a<00:01:16.640> joy<00:01:16.880> to<00:01:16.909> get<00:01:17.210> actual<00:01:18.049> fact<00:01:18.350> oh<00:01:18.530> boy<00:01:25.479> the

a joy to get actual fact oh boy the

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.929 
a joy to get actual fact oh boy the
second<00:01:26.930> drill<00:01:27.229> on<00:01:27.549> what's<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.640> actual

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
second drill on what's the actual

second drill on what's the actual
backpedal<00:01:29.539> and<00:01:29.780> on<00:01:30.319> it<00:01:30.890> shows<00:01:31.159> true<00:01:31.520> speed<00:01:31.880> you

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
backpedal and on it shows true speed you

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.059 
backpedal and on it shows true speed you
saw<00:01:32.360> stop<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.170> starts<00:01:33.440> out<00:01:33.619> on<00:01:33.770> Twitter

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
saw stop and starts out on Twitter

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.430 
saw stop and starts out on Twitter
smooth<00:01:34.369> backpedal<00:01:34.909> real<00:01:35.509> slow<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.020> then<00:01:36.289> he

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
smooth backpedal real slow and then he

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.219 
smooth backpedal real slow and then he
squeezed<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.740> up<00:01:36.979> basically<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.229> receiver

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
squeezed it up basically a receiver

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.499 
squeezed it up basically a receiver
during<00:01:39.470> the<00:01:39.530> game<00:01:39.740> is<00:01:40.310> going<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.670> run<00:01:41.210> very

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
during the game is going to run very

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.779 
during the game is going to run very
fast<00:01:41.750> action<00:01:42.020> so<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.770> have<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.069> judge<00:01:43.369> off<00:01:43.729> the

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
fast action so you have to judge off the

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.749 
fast action so you have to judge off the
receivers<00:01:44.509> temple<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.710> that's<00:01:46.250> why<00:01:46.460> we<00:01:46.520> do

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
receivers temple and that's why we do

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.100 
receivers temple and that's why we do
the<00:01:46.880> two<00:01:47.030> speeds<00:01:47.330> we<00:01:47.450> start<00:01:47.690> out<00:01:47.780> real<00:01:47.960> slow

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
the two speeds we start out real slow

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:56.279 
the two speeds we start out real slow
speed<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:49.039> up<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.929> pretty<00:01:50.929> much<00:01:51.020> that's<00:01:51.170> it

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.520 

the<00:01:57.289> third<00:01:57.560> drill<00:01:57.950> we<00:01:58.069> did<00:01:58.310> was<00:01:58.970> a<00:01:59.319> open<00:02:00.319> hip

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
the third drill we did was a open hip

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.369 
the third drill we did was a open hip
with<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.890> hand<00:02:01.250> on<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.520> hip<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.819> receiver

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:02.379 
with the hand on the hip and receiver

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:05.979 
with the hand on the hip and receiver
basically<00:02:03.379> going<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.399> game<00:02:04.610> as<00:02:04.940> the<00:02:05.599> receivers

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:05.989 
basically going to game as the receivers

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:07.510 
basically going to game as the receivers
running<00:02:06.110> towards<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.679> you<00:02:07.009> have<00:02:07.129> to<00:02:07.250> get<00:02:07.399> your

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
running towards you you have to get your

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.969 
running towards you you have to get your
hip<00:02:07.670> up<00:02:07.879> and<00:02:08.569> open<00:02:08.840> up<00:02:08.899> widow<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.349> as<00:02:09.619> you<00:02:09.770> open

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
hip up and open up widow and as you open

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.830 
hip up and open up widow and as you open
up<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.310> get<00:02:10.429> your<00:02:10.550> hand<00:02:10.759> on<00:02:10.849> his<00:02:10.970> hip<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:11.780> you

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
up and get your hand on his hip so you

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.330 
up and get your hand on his hip so you
can<00:02:11.989> run<00:02:12.110> wouldn't<00:02:12.410> she<00:02:12.560> be<00:02:12.709> side<00:02:12.950> by<00:02:12.980> side

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
can run wouldn't she be side by side

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.550 
can run wouldn't she be side by side
with<00:02:13.489> him<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:14.000> will<00:02:14.120> depend<00:02:14.959> on<00:02:15.080> which<00:02:15.200> way<00:02:15.410> he

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
with him so will depend on which way he

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.440 
with him so will depend on which way he
breaks<00:02:15.860> you<00:02:16.250> can<00:02:16.430> break<00:02:16.670> off<00:02:16.849> and<00:02:17.150> run<00:02:17.360> with

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
breaks you can break off and run with

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.410 
breaks you can break off and run with
them<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.780> we<00:02:18.349> do<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:19.180> mimic<00:02:20.180> with<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
them and we do that mimic with the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.509 
them and we do that mimic with the
receivers<00:02:20.780> going<00:02:20.959> to<00:02:21.019> do<00:02:21.140> during<00:02:21.349> game<00:02:21.590> day<00:02:21.800> so

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
receivers going to do during game day so

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.369 
receivers going to do during game day so
we<00:02:22.910> have<00:02:23.030> better<00:02:23.209> managed<00:02:23.720> or<00:02:23.959> play<00:02:24.140> against

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
we have better managed or play against

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:33.580 
we have better managed or play against
our<00:02:24.500> ponies

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.520 

fourth<00:02:34.550> drew<00:02:34.819> we<00:02:34.970> did<00:02:35.180> was<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.420> backhoe<00:02:36.230> drill

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
fourth drew we did was a backhoe drill

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.890 
fourth drew we did was a backhoe drill
and<00:02:36.950> we<00:02:37.069> break<00:02:37.280> at<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.430> 45-degree<00:02:38.150> angle<00:02:38.510> on<00:02:38.599> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
and we break at a 45-degree angle on the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.809 
and we break at a 45-degree angle on the
first<00:02:39.140> thing<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.440> coached<00:02:39.980> emphasizes<00:02:40.700> is

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
first thing that coached emphasizes is

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.460 
first thing that coached emphasizes is
that<00:02:41.000> when<00:02:41.420> you're<00:02:41.510> back<00:02:41.690> pilot<00:02:42.050> will<00:02:42.200> break

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
that when you're back pilot will break

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.140 
that when you're back pilot will break
to<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.709> comb<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.459> have<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.700> break<00:02:43.910> at<00:02:44.090> a

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
to the comb you have to break at a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.059 
to the comb you have to break at a
45-degree<00:02:44.870> angle<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.290> can't<00:02:45.500> round<00:02:45.739> it<00:02:45.920> off

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
45-degree angle you can't round it off

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:47.800 
45-degree angle you can't round it off
because<00:02:46.640> if<00:02:46.879> you<00:02:46.940> run<00:02:47.090> it<00:02:47.209> off<00:02:47.330> the<00:02:47.480> past<00:02:47.720> is

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
because if you run it off the past is

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.300 
because if you run it off the past is
going<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:47.989> be<00:02:48.080> completed<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:48.920> you're<00:02:49.160> back

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
going to be completed so you're back

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.860 
going to be completed so you're back
pedal<00:02:49.610> as<00:02:49.670> fast<00:02:49.730> as<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.090> can<00:02:50.239> or<00:02:50.450> there's<00:02:50.660> two

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
pedal as fast as you can or there's two

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.140 
pedal as fast as you can or there's two
speeds<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.500> start<00:02:52.040> off<00:02:52.099> slow<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.819> pick<00:02:53.030> up

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
speeds you start off slow you pick up

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.670 
speeds you start off slow you pick up
the<00:02:53.239> tempo<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.780> if<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:53.930> break<00:02:54.110> back<00:02:54.349> down<00:02:54.560> at

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
the tempo and if you break back down at

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.740 
the tempo and if you break back down at
45<00:02:55.099> we<00:02:55.340> do<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:55.610> both<00:02:55.819> directions<00:02:56.150> because

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
45 we do that both directions because
