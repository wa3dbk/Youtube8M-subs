00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.510
 Music in the shopping center is usually 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:08.000
 somewhere a boring music carpet 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.289
 which then trickles past one 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.759
 It was about two hours into that 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:13.480
 Remscheid is pretty different 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.700
 allee-center music was unexpected 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.500
 surprising and powerful and this 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.190
 Now you will see with a pretty 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.190
 great effect 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.270
 at point 6 the allee center becomes the 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.130
 Great stage from all corners of the shops 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.170
 and cafÃ©s come singers and singers 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.390
 chor flashmob call that the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.390
 unannounced appointment to sing 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.040
 I saw how the children started 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.750
 singing that was very sweet and sudden 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.640
 came from all sides came this one 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.840
 I sound that was just great that me 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.350
 I also have very puzzled faces 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.730
 seen 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.440
 for people who thought now bring 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.579
 children's concert and suddenly comes 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.570
 I've found it everywhere 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.250
 great effect the idea is stolen that 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.470
 he admits to that thought up 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.450
 from a youtube video in one 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.290
 Similar shopping mall in America 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.290
 has been turned 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.340
 and I said let's do that 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.630
 that it is great and then we have 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.070
 it went through wildfire through the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.689
 choirs in remscheid and son more and more 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.350
 who wanted to join and so it came 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.970
 conditions 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.350
 how simon found great action on it 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.729
 to point out the great singing in the choir 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.369
 how much fun music has always been 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.590
 to do together 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.060
 in the end there are more than 200 girls and 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.680
 young men and women out 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.840
 Choose different IT decision makers 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.100
 who make sure that the flash mob is his 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.100
 effect not missed 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.560
 without preparation but works that way 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.240
 What not a look back since weeks 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.130
 rehearsals of the choirs are already rehearsing for 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.060
 their flash mob, others too 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.689
 to inspire 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.689
 for sing along 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.890
 I think these places would sing 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.580
 they are much bigger in recent years 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.920
 has become 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.840
 not least by these unspeakable 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.670
 shot there shoots so there you have to 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.350
 Above all, dieters do not dig 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.870
 Respect for respecting that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.340
 it has succeeded in its broadcast people 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.420
 to be interested in singing live again 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.800
 and I just watch that 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.420
 since this weird casting shows 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.030
 More and more people are having fun again 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.800
 win singing and that's a pleasure 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.520
 to see that that's what it's really up to 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.520
 that is up 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.510
 so coincidentally the flash mob comes along so 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.640
 is planned so as 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.300
 motivational assistance so to speak the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.920
 get remscheid choirs amplification 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.060
 Of course we can achieve that in the one 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.770
 we just with a lot of people there 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.080
 sing this experience have like 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.790
 great it is too much sun so an event 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.010
 but also the people have to 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.110
 hear and see how much fun we have 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.370
 I hope that the spark 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.960
 skip that they say human that 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.090
 is really nice music is common 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.590
 the most beautiful 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.320
 the church has been feverish for weeks 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.530
 this moment is the end of a good 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.530
 was 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:30.370
 At the beginning you did not know if you were 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:33.430
 really with the next experience for 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.790
 us super that much fun made me 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.870
 the portal that I think would like to be there 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.220
 one or the other likes to be there 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.220
 been but catechism cake
