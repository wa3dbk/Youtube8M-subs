 development mainly he spoke 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.230
 that the interface there for you to program 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.239
 the application is very complicated and the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.120

 happened then this scared a lot 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.510
 it something else developer issues 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.760
 anonymous is the fact that nintendo 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.400
 according to him he does not know Brazil or even 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.430
 inspired in more consolidated networks like 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.439
 psn and xbox live and then complicated 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.270
 enough the situation of nintendo for that 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.250
 developer announces and looks at 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.720
 compensate the crew more calmly 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.060
 several developers there are 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.640
 expressed in favor of that nintendo 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.100
 banned programming is so easy and takes 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.680
 so long that you would take the program in 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.270
 other consortia and even defended 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.490
 iuan in relation to all this controversy 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.439

 to have a great time here in the neighborhood there 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.950
 two have a lot of things too much 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.259
 which is unique to you then you 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.329
 Who do you like a good game you know that 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.369
 the side effects when you 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.680
 watching a movie is game based 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.570
 I 'm not very good, you can not go blind. 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.229
 may have belly pain down and 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.600
 william 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.570
 finally the tech background system was a 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.490
 A beautiful piece of crap is September 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.700
 now the guys look like they're coming out 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.350
 sequence of these is one of the actors the idea 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.880
 He left the movie already raised and saying 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.250
 that will roll a movie without a sequel 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.860
 and in reality it happens before 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.580
 original work of the original text of the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.470
 movies have idea for the movie 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.970
 was so bad that even the producers of 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.320
 games series there right? 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.180
 They apologized to the people who watched it. 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.730
 The movie is a personal one. 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.930
 furthermore, it will not mask a 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.450
 you despair 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.550
 who is going to direct this movie is the prachya 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.440

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.240

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.340
 loading or have for interesting 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.300
 I do not board so it's a lot of pissing 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.340

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.230
