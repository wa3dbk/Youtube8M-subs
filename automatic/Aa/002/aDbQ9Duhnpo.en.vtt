00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.479 

we<00:00:28.849> really<00:00:29.239> wanted<00:00:29.539> something<00:00:30.050> unique<00:00:30.499> and

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
we really wanted something unique and

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.110 
we really wanted something unique and
real<00:00:32.300> incentive<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.640> we<00:00:34.640> thought<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:34.880> would

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
real incentive and we thought it would

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.080 
real incentive and we thought it would
be<00:00:35.240> really<00:00:35.420> nice<00:00:35.630> to<00:00:35.690> have<00:00:36.050> a<00:00:36.110> taste<00:00:36.830> of<00:00:37.100> the

be really nice to have a taste of the
hitman<00:00:38.420> fantasy<00:00:41.320> basically<00:00:42.320> we<00:00:42.530> were

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
hitman fantasy basically we were

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.480 
hitman fantasy basically we were
discussing<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.450> lot<00:00:44.600> how<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:44.840> make<00:00:45.200> a

interesting free or incentive for
absolution

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.340 

we<00:01:08.430> had<00:01:08.550> all<00:01:08.700> kinds<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.090> ideas<00:01:09.270> about<00:01:09.930> what<00:01:10.320> we

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
we had all kinds of ideas about what we

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.710 
we had all kinds of ideas about what we
could<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.830> levels<00:01:11.280> or<00:01:11.520> characters<00:01:12.479> or

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
could do with levels or characters or

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.500 
could do with levels or characters or
weapons<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.320> then<00:01:13.470> there<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:15.390> had

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
weapons and then there was this we had

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.330 
weapons and then there was this we had
like<00:01:15.780> an<00:01:15.900> old<00:01:16.080> design<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.010> a<00:01:17.040> sniper

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
like an old design of like a sniper

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.270 
like an old design of like a sniper
challenge<00:01:17.759> mapped<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.900> was<00:01:19.020> not<00:01:19.229> meant<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.160> be

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
challenge mapped it was not meant to be

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.890 
challenge mapped it was not meant to be
a<00:01:20.310> part<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.670> hip<00:01:20.820> massage<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.420> was<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.660> meant

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
a part of hip massage it was not meant

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.570 
a part of hip massage it was not meant
to<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.140> anything<00:01:22.500> other<00:01:22.740> than<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.190> fun<00:01:23.430> for

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
to be anything other than just fun for

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.400 
to be anything other than just fun for
the<00:01:23.670> company<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.600> was<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.170> fun<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
the company it was actually so fun that

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.990 
the company it was actually so fun that
the<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.070> rest<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> house<00:01:26.580> started

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the the rest of the house started

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.640 
the the rest of the house started
playing<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.630> know<00:01:27.750> without<00:01:28.229> really<00:01:28.560> being

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
playing it you know without really being

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.800 
playing it you know without really being
prompted<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.390> told<00:01:30.600> us<00:01:30.690> we

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
prompted to do so and that told us we

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.020 
prompted to do so and that told us we
had<00:01:30.840> something<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.350> was<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.830> little<00:01:32.190> bit<00:01:32.550> out

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
had something that was a little bit out

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.639 
had something that was a little bit out
of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.300> ordinary<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.899> we<00:01:33.990> figured<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.619> some

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
of the ordinary and we figured at some

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.950 
of the ordinary and we figured at some
point<00:01:35.039> that<00:01:35.160> this<00:01:35.820> might<00:01:36.030> actually<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:36.720> map

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
point that this might actually be a map

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.170 
point that this might actually be a map
that<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.410> use<00:01:37.440> for<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.160> game<00:01:38.399> we

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that we can use for the for the game we

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.760 
that we can use for the for the game we
knew<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.690> fun<00:01:39.899> factor<00:01:40.080> is<00:01:40.380> quite<00:01:40.619> high

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
knew that the fun factor is quite high

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
knew that the fun factor is quite high
so<00:01:40.830> we<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.280> needed<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.759> look<00:01:41.880> into<00:01:42.270> how<00:01:42.899> do<00:01:42.960> we

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
so we just needed to look into how do we

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.810 
so we just needed to look into how do we
implement<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:44.039> it<00:01:44.160> being<00:01:44.670> in<00:01:44.789> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
implement this into it being in the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:54.320 
implement this into it being in the
Hitman<00:01:51.259> it's<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.530> contained<00:01:53.460> game<00:01:54.119> on

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
Hitman it's a little contained game on

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.760 
Hitman it's a little contained game on
its<00:01:54.479> own<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:55.050> it's<00:01:55.289> simple<00:01:55.649> you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
its own if you will it's simple you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.469 
its own if you will it's simple you
shoot<00:01:55.979> two<00:01:56.100> people<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.580> then<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:56.910> to<00:01:57.000> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
shoot two people and then you have to to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.669 
shoot two people and then you have to to
figure<00:01:57.720> out<00:01:57.810> what<00:01:57.929> is<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> puzzle<00:01:58.440> you<00:01:58.560> have

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
figure out what is the puzzle you have

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.190 
figure out what is the puzzle you have
to<00:01:58.830> solve<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.580> not<00:01:59.700> alert<00:02:00.000> everyone<00:02:00.300> and<00:02:00.750> we

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
to solve to not alert everyone and we

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.570 
to solve to not alert everyone and we
actually<00:02:01.500> took<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:01.920> whole<00:02:02.039> concept<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
actually took that the whole concept and

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.449 
actually took that the whole concept and
said<00:02:02.700> okay<00:02:02.910> if<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.509> were<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.750> do<00:02:04.560> this<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:05.399> a

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
said okay if we were to do this as a

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.520 
said okay if we were to do this as a
product<00:02:05.789> how<00:02:06.000> would<00:02:06.179> that<00:02:06.300> then<00:02:06.509> p<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.959> that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
product how would that then p and that

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.139 
product how would that then p and that
turned<00:02:07.770> into<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.099> sniper<00:02:08.310> tumors<00:02:08.670> it's

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149

classy target that the HIPAA needs to
take<00:03:30.340> down<00:03:30.519> there<00:03:31.120> is<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.510> sense<00:03:31.810> that

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
take down there is the sense that

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.930 
take down there is the sense that
whatever<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.620> do<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.130> will<00:03:33.160> kind<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.580> effect

whatever you do it will kind of effect

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.970 
whatever you do it will kind of effect
it<00:03:34.239> we<00:03:34.330> can<00:03:34.510> ripple<00:03:34.750> out<00:03:34.989> into<00:03:35.410> the<00:03:35.530> whole<00:03:35.709> map

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
it we can ripple out into the whole map

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.310 
it we can ripple out into the whole map
and<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.330> have<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.480> kind<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:37.720> think<00:03:37.989> twice

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
and you have to kind of think twice

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.890 
and you have to kind of think twice
before<00:03:39.100> making<00:03:39.580> your<00:03:39.730> move<00:03:40.030> one<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
before making your move one of the

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.060 
before making your move one of the
moments<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.230> like<00:03:41.380> best<00:03:41.590> and<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.860> sniper

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
moments I like best and the sniper

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.199 
moments I like best and the sniper
challenge<00:03:42.190> is<00:03:42.519> actually<00:03:42.850> something<00:03:43.030> that

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
challenge is actually something that

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.670 
challenge is actually something that
came<00:03:43.510> in<00:03:43.660> fairly<00:03:43.959> late<00:03:43.989> which<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.530> the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
came in fairly late which is the

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.610 
came in fairly late which is the
elevator<00:03:45.280> challenge<00:03:46.150> we<00:03:46.269> did<00:03:46.450> where<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.170> you

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
elevator challenge we did where you you

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.020 
elevator challenge we did where you you
can<00:03:47.739> distract<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.130> car<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.519> then<00:03:48.760> shoot<00:03:48.970> a

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
can distract the car and then shoot a

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.090 
can distract the car and then shoot a
few<00:03:49.209> sparks<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.780> then<00:03:50.290> if<00:03:50.470> you're<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.650> fast<00:03:50.920> you

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
few sparks and then if you're a fast you

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.590 
few sparks and then if you're a fast you
shoot<00:03:51.280> them<00:03:51.370> into<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.820> elevator<00:03:52.060> shaft<00:03:52.239> and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
shoot them into the elevator shaft and

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.940 
shoot them into the elevator shaft and
then<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.840> elevator<00:03:52.989> they<00:03:53.350> all<00:03:53.380> those<00:03:53.650> clothes

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
then the elevator they all those clothes

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.190 
then the elevator they all those clothes
and<00:03:54.160> I<00:03:54.670> think<00:03:54.880> it's<00:03:55.000> it's<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.720> beautiful<00:03:56.110> way

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
and I think it's it's a beautiful way

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.350 
and I think it's it's a beautiful way
with<00:03:56.230> game<00:03:56.650> mechanics<00:03:57.100> to<00:03:57.220> sum<00:03:57.430> up<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:58.150> kind

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
with game mechanics to sum up the kind

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.560 
with game mechanics to sum up the kind
of<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:59.400> refinery<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.640> being<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.060> really<00:04:01.390> really

suicide and they're kind of like helping
him<00:04:24.100> a<00:04:24.190> better<00:04:24.370> than<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.700> way

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.370 

we<00:04:33.790> really<00:04:34.000> wanted<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.449> create<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:34.960> bus<00:04:35.169> with

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
we really wanted to create a bus with

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.810 
we really wanted to create a bus with
the<00:04:35.470> sniper<00:04:35.620> challenge<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.250> what<00:04:36.520> we<00:04:36.610> really

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
the sniper challenge and what we really

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.279 
the sniper challenge and what we really
thought<00:04:36.970> is<00:04:37.120> that<00:04:37.150> okay<00:04:37.870> we<00:04:37.960> do<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.110> few

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
thought is that okay we do a few

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.320 
thought is that okay we do a few
leaderboards<00:04:38.949> as<00:04:39.130> I<00:04:39.310> said<00:04:39.370> originally<00:04:40.210> this

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
leaderboards as I said originally this

started in the house right where people

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:43.170 
started in the house right where people
actually<00:04:42.130> just<00:04:42.460> started<00:04:42.610> playing<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:43.090> too

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.640 
actually just started playing it too
funny<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.660> they<00:04:44.050> also<00:04:44.229> started<00:04:44.590> the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
funny and they also started the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.320 
funny and they also started the
competing<00:04:45.220> on<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.520> leader<00:04:45.699> boat<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:46.060> figure

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
competing on the leader boat to figure

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.939 
competing on the leader boat to figure
out<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.539> most<00:04:46.690> creative<00:04:46.930> way<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.229> go<00:04:47.860> about

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
out the most creative way to go about

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.200 
out the most creative way to go about
the<00:04:48.280> mission<00:04:50.340> creativity<00:04:51.340> in<00:04:51.490> what<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.090> do

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
the mission creativity in what you do

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.900 
the mission creativity in what you do
combined<00:04:52.600> with<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.900> skull<00:04:53.169> was<00:04:53.680> very<00:04:54.580> wet<00:04:54.759> set

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
combined with the skull was very wet set

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.939 
combined with the skull was very wet set
people<00:04:55.090> on<00:04:55.240> fire<00:04:55.300> so<00:04:56.259> we<00:04:56.380> also<00:04:56.530> thought<00:04:56.770> that

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
people on fire so we also thought that

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.499 
people on fire so we also thought that
you<00:04:57.039> know<00:04:57.160> what<00:04:57.430> makes<00:04:57.639> most<00:04:57.850> sense<00:04:57.970> is<00:04:58.270> also

00:04:58.499 --> 00:04:58.509 
you know what makes most sense is also

00:04:58.509 --> 00:04:59.790 
you know what makes most sense is also
to<00:04:58.600> be<00:04:58.720> able<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:59.080> talk<00:04:59.289> to<00:04:59.410> your<00:04:59.500> friends<00:04:59.710> about

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
to be able to talk to your friends about

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.740 
to be able to talk to your friends about
how<00:04:59.949> you<00:05:00.130> scored<00:05:00.460> so<00:05:00.940> that's<00:05:01.150> why<00:05:01.270> we<00:05:01.300> came<00:05:01.690> up

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
how you scored so that's why we came up

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.000 
how you scored so that's why we came up
with<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.080> concept<00:05:02.199> of<00:05:02.500> just<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:02.979> know

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
with the concept of just you know

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.590 
with the concept of just you know
separating<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.699> few<00:05:03.880> different<00:05:04.240> leader<00:05:04.389> boats

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
separating a few different leader boats

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.360 
separating a few different leader boats
personally<00:05:05.350> I<00:05:05.410> would<00:05:05.680> never<00:05:05.830> figure<00:05:06.190> on<00:05:06.340> the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
personally I would never figure on the

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.370 
personally I would never figure on the
worldwide<00:05:06.940> leader<00:05:06.970> boat<00:05:07.389> but<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:07.900> do<00:05:07.990> know<00:05:08.229> how

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
worldwide leader boat but I do know how

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.320 
worldwide leader boat but I do know how
I<00:05:08.410> would<00:05:08.710> forget<00:05:09.130> my<00:05:09.340> friends<00:05:09.490> right<00:05:09.820> and<00:05:10.000> it's

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
in that way it's much more fun to

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.529 
in that way it's much more fun to

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
finding out what was it that they did

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.600 
finding out what was it that they did
that<00:05:34.539> actually<00:05:35.050> made<00:05:35.289> them<00:05:35.500> improve<00:05:35.979> so

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
that actually made them improve so

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.670 
that actually made them improve so
drastically<00:05:37.120> on<00:05:37.330> their<00:05:37.510> score

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.570 

gameplay-wise<00:05:41.680> we<00:05:41.920> really<00:05:42.130> wanted<00:05:42.340> to<00:05:42.400> make

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
gameplay-wise we really wanted to make

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.640 
gameplay-wise we really wanted to make
it<00:05:42.730> so<00:05:42.850> that<00:05:42.880> when<00:05:43.600> you<00:05:43.750> play<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.110> game<00:05:44.260> and<00:05:44.530> as

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
it so that when you play the game and as

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.110 
it so that when you play the game and as
you<00:05:44.800> improve<00:05:45.040> your<00:05:45.130> skills<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:45.850> your<00:05:45.910> unlock

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
you improve your skills and your unlock

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.850 
you improve your skills and your unlock
stuff<00:05:46.420> in<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.720> sniper<00:05:46.930> challenge<00:05:47.020> that<00:05:47.770> it

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
stuff in the sniper challenge that it

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.410 
stuff in the sniper challenge that it
actually<00:05:48.010> unlocks<00:05:48.490> an<00:05:48.610> absolution<00:05:48.970> as<00:05:49.240> well

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
actually unlocks an absolution as well

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.390 
actually unlocks an absolution as well
so<00:05:49.900> we<00:05:49.990> wanted<00:05:50.230> to<00:05:50.290> create<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:50.890> tie<00:05:51.130> in<00:05:51.190> to

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
so we wanted to create that tie in to

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.680 
so we wanted to create that tie in to
make<00:05:51.550> them<00:05:51.730> feel<00:05:51.940> that<00:05:51.970> they<00:05:52.300> are<00:05:52.330> connected

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
make them feel that they are connected

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.570 
make them feel that they are connected
even<00:05:53.470> if<00:05:53.590> the<00:05:53.680> sniper<00:05:53.890> challenge<00:05:53.980> is<00:05:54.370> mainly

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
even if the sniper challenge is mainly

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.430 
even if the sniper challenge is mainly
about<00:05:54.670> sniping<00:05:55.030> and<00:05:55.360> absolution<00:05:56.050> is<00:05:56.170> about

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
about sniping and absolution is about

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.000 
about sniping and absolution is about
everything<00:05:57.040> else<00:05:57.310> hit<00:05:57.550> man<00:05:57.730> if<00:05:57.910> you
