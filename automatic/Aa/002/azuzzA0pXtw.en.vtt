film<00:02:30.750> my<00:02:30.900> videos<00:02:31.200> on<00:02:31.410> although<00:02:31.650> you

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
film my videos on although you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.890 
film my videos on although you
definitely<00:02:32.280> could<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:33.300> then<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.450> just<00:02:33.720> keep

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
definitely could and then I just keep

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.830 
definitely could and then I just keep
the<00:02:34.050> charger<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.800> with<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:36.239> little<00:02:36.569> thing<00:02:36.720> as

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.500 
the charger in with this little thing as
well<00:02:36.989> so<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.860> fits<00:02:38.100> perfectly<00:02:38.190> inside<00:02:38.970> here

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.120 
well so it fits perfectly inside here
you<00:02:39.660> could<00:02:39.840> obviously<00:02:40.110> use<00:02:40.319> this<00:02:40.620> as<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> coin

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
good use for me saying is some gum and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.850 
good use for me saying is some gum and
this<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:47.269> don't<00:02:48.269> even<00:02:48.330> know<00:02:48.450> what<00:02:48.569> this<00:02:48.690> is

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860
