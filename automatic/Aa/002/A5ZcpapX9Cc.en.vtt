toy<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:17.390> battery<00:02:17.750> lasted<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.290> long<00:02:18.440> time

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500

we've<00:02:18.920> been<00:02:18.980> playing<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.310> for<00:02:19.340> quite<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> while

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
we've been playing it for quite a while

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.400

it does stay for children over five but

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.920 
it does stay for children over five but
I<00:02:24.830> think<00:02:25.730> maybe<00:02:25.910> they'll<00:02:26.180> need<00:02:26.420> an<00:02:26.660> adult

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
I think maybe they'll need an adult

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.530 
I think maybe they'll need an adult
supervision<00:02:27.530> because<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:29.060> does<00:02:29.269> go<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.450> little

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
supervision because it does go a little

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.509 
supervision because it does go a little
bit<00:02:29.690> crazy<00:02:29.840> if<00:02:30.290> something<00:02:30.620> goes<00:02:30.769> wrong<00:02:30.799> like

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
bit crazy if something goes wrong like

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.140 
bit crazy if something goes wrong like
one<00:02:32.000> ring<00:02:32.209> outta<00:02:32.390> line<00:02:32.629> it<00:02:33.349> goes<00:02:33.620> mad<00:02:33.879> but<00:02:34.879> I

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
one ring outta line it goes mad but I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.569 
one ring outta line it goes mad but I
can<00:02:35.420> definitely<00:02:35.870> see<00:02:36.019> why<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:36.410> on<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.799> top

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
can definitely see why it's on the top

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:47.270 
can definitely see why it's on the top
present<00:02:38.180> less<00:02:38.329> this<00:02:38.540> year

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
