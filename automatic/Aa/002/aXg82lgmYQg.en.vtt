in my opinion is when you get the phone

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.740 
in my opinion is when you get the phone
from<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.250> store<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.789> whatever<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.570> still

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
from the store or whatever and it still

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.600 
from the store or whatever and it still
has<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:48.870> factory<00:00:49.410> plastic<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.950> there<00:00:50.160> leave

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
not like the OtterBox Commuter where

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.670 
not like the OtterBox Commuter where
it's<00:01:15.060> two<00:01:15.270> separate<00:01:15.720> layers<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.530> can

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
into one where we have this softer inner

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.789 
into one where we have this softer inner
rubber<00:01:20.520> layer<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> harder<00:01:22.080> outer

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
rubber layer and then the harder outer

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.960 
rubber layer and then the harder outer
shell<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.780> let's<00:01:24.780> stick<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> HTC<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.700> in

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
look at the lip that the case provides

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.740 
look at the lip that the case provides
that's<00:01:36.060> always<00:01:36.299> one<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.020> my<00:01:37.140> favorite<00:01:37.560> parts

the back we have this cutout up here for

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.710 
the back we have this cutout up here for
it<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.280> looks<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.670> mic<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.330> then

yueji didn't they remember to make a

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.640 
yueji didn't they remember to make a
cutout<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:19.810> everything<00:03:20.170> should<00:03:20.260> work<00:03:20.320> fine

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
cutout so everything should work fine

there<00:03:20.950> and<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:22.330> buttons<00:03:22.570> still<00:03:22.720> remains

there and the buttons still remains
clicky<00:03:23.230> since<00:03:23.500> it<00:03:23.590> is<00:03:23.680> kind<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:23.980> thinner

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220

on the volume rocker side so it's a

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
did with this case is they actually left

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.520 
did with this case is they actually left
the<00:03:35.230> bottom<00:03:35.590> of<00:03:35.740> this<00:03:36.160> cutout<00:03:36.930> open<00:03:37.930> so<00:03:38.410> it's

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
the bottom of this cutout open so it's

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.320 
the bottom of this cutout open so it's
not<00:03:38.680> it's<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.920> like<00:03:39.310> this<00:03:39.490> covering<00:03:39.970> here<00:03:40.210> is

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
not it's a like this covering here is

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.600 
not it's a like this covering here is
connected<00:03:40.960> on<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.080> top<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.680> sides<00:03:41.950> but<00:03:42.490> on

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
connected on the top and sides but on

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.520 
connected on the top and sides but on
the<00:03:42.700> bottom<00:03:42.850> they<00:03:43.090> left<00:03:43.270> it<00:03:43.390> open<00:03:43.510> I'm<00:03:44.380> not

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
the bottom they left it open I'm not

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.140 
the bottom they left it open I'm not
entirely<00:03:44.800> sure<00:03:45.040> why<00:03:45.280> they<00:03:45.430> did<00:03:45.550> it<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.730> guess<00:03:45.970> it

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
entirely sure why they did it I guess it

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.510 
entirely sure why they did it I guess it
lets<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.020> button<00:03:47.260> it's<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.770> plastic<00:03:48.280> isn't

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
lets the button it's the plastic isn't

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.910 
lets the button it's the plastic isn't
as<00:03:48.610> rigid<00:03:48.850> now<00:03:49.180> it's<00:03:49.990> a<00:03:50.050> little<00:03:50.260> more<00:03:50.380> flexible

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
as rigid now it's a little more flexible

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.710 
as rigid now it's a little more flexible
and<00:03:51.130> so<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.820> keeps<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.150> buttons<00:03:52.390> feeling

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
and so it keeps the buttons feeling

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.630 
and so it keeps the buttons feeling
clicky<00:03:55.110> moving<00:03:56.110> on<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.680> left<00:03:56.980> side<00:03:57.250> there

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
clicky moving on to the left side there

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.190 
clicky moving on to the left side there
really<00:03:57.760> isn't<00:03:57.970> anything<00:03:58.210> to<00:03:58.390> be<00:03:58.510> seen<00:03:58.780> now

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
really isn't anything to be seen now

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.630 
really isn't anything to be seen now
let's<00:03:59.380> take<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.560> look<00:03:59.680> at<00:03:59.830> the<00:03:59.950> corners<00:04:00.340> on<00:04:00.490> this

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
let's take a look at the corners on this

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.100 
let's take a look at the corners on this
case<00:04:00.820> just<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.390> show<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.750> protection

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
case just to show you the protection

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.710 
case just to show you the protection
that<00:04:02.350> they<00:04:02.470> offer<00:04:02.650> as<00:04:03.640> you<00:04:03.910> can<00:04:04.030> see<00:04:04.180> here<00:04:04.660> in

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
that they offer as you can see here in

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.210 
that they offer as you can see here in
the<00:04:04.810> video<00:04:05.080> there<00:04:05.410> are<00:04:05.440> a<00:04:05.500> lot<00:04:05.710> thicker<00:04:05.950> than

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
the video there are a lot thicker than

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.590 
the video there are a lot thicker than
the<00:04:06.280> rest<00:04:06.490> of<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.700> plastic<00:04:06.910> on<00:04:07.210> the<00:04:07.330> sides

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
the rest of the plastic on the sides

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.390 
the rest of the plastic on the sides
here<00:04:07.900> or<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.500> rubber<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.860> thicker<00:04:09.070> than<00:04:09.310> the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
here or the rubber is thicker than the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.300 
here or the rubber is thicker than the
rubber<00:04:09.670> on<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.940> sides<00:04:10.150> here<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.950> these<00:04:12.070> thick

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
rubber on the sides here so these thick

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.860 
rubber on the sides here so these thick
rubber<00:04:12.460> corners<00:04:12.940> will<00:04:13.090> protect<00:04:13.600> your<00:04:13.750> phone

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
rubber corners will protect your phone

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.690 
rubber corners will protect your phone
if<00:04:14.020> you<00:04:14.080> drop<00:04:14.290> it<00:04:14.320> on<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.500> corner<00:04:14.890> or<00:04:15.280> even<00:04:15.520> just

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
if you drop it on a corner or even just

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.440 
if you drop it on a corner or even just
straight<00:04:16.030> down<00:04:16.060> like<00:04:16.330> this<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:18.239> that's<00:04:19.239> for

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
straight down like this so that's for

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.300 
straight down like this so that's for
shock<00:04:19.690> protection<00:04:20.230> you<00:04:20.739> probably<00:04:21.010> noticed

case is covered one interesting thing on
the<00:04:39.229> case<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:40.070> little<00:04:40.310> nubs<00:04:40.580> on<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:40.880> corners

the case the little nubs on the corners
they're<00:04:41.300> on<00:04:41.870> all<00:04:42.020> four<00:04:42.229> corners<00:04:43.449> so<00:04:44.449> those<00:04:44.630> are

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
they're on all four corners so those are

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.760 
they're on all four corners so those are

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
going to scratch up the case and make

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.510 
going to scratch up the case and make
this<00:04:49.580> $35<00:04:50.330> case<00:04:50.630> look<00:04:51.440> really<00:04:51.889> beat<00:04:52.039> up<00:04:52.070> in<00:04:52.400> a

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
this $35 case look really beat up in a

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.520 
this $35 case look really beat up in a
short<00:04:52.729> period<00:04:52.789> of<00:04:53.090> time<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.750> materials<00:04:54.229> feel

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
short period of time the materials feel

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.770 
short period of time the materials feel
very<00:04:54.830> durable<00:04:55.070> this<00:04:55.430> hard<00:04:55.669> smoother<00:04:56.240> plastic

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
very durable this hard smoother plastic

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.029 
very durable this hard smoother plastic
and<00:04:57.199> we've<00:04:57.320> got<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.590> rubber<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:58.009> rubber

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
and we've got the rubber the rubber

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.040 
and we've got the rubber the rubber
isn't<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.580> sticky<00:04:59.030> rubber<00:04:59.180> if<00:04:59.720> you<00:04:59.840> know<00:04:59.930> what<00:05:00.020> I

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
isn't a sticky rubber if you know what I

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.510 
isn't a sticky rubber if you know what I
mean<00:05:00.260> if<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:00.440> if<00:05:00.650> you've<00:05:00.800> used<00:05:00.979> that<00:05:01.160> type<00:05:01.370> of

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
mean if you if you've used that type of

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.219 
mean if you if you've used that type of
rubber<00:05:01.669> case<00:05:02.000> before<00:05:02.389> or<00:05:02.960> it's<00:05:03.110> always

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
rubber case before or it's always

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.779 
rubber case before or it's always
picking<00:05:03.560> up<00:05:03.680> lint<00:05:03.979> or<00:05:04.190> something<00:05:04.460> like<00:05:04.610> that

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
picking up lint or something like that

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.120 
picking up lint or something like that
this<00:05:05.600> is<00:05:05.660> more<00:05:05.990> of<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.110> smooth<00:05:06.410> plastic<00:05:06.650> I<00:05:06.949> don't

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
this is more of a smooth plastic I don't

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.379 
this is more of a smooth plastic I don't
think<00:05:07.280> it's<00:05:07.370> going<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.550> pick<00:05:07.729> up<00:05:07.789> fingerprints

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
think it's going to pick up fingerprints

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:09.279 
think it's going to pick up fingerprints
and<00:05:08.510> lint<00:05:08.720> too<00:05:08.900> easily

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
and lint too easily

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.140 
and lint too easily
I'll<00:05:09.979> stick<00:05:10.250> some<00:05:10.400> fingerprints<00:05:10.850> on<00:05:10.970> there

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
I'll stick some fingerprints on there

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.460 
I'll stick some fingerprints on there
you<00:05:11.479> guys<00:05:11.600> can<00:05:11.660> tell<00:05:11.840> me<00:05:11.990> if<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.110> can<00:05:12.229> see<00:05:12.260> him

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
you guys can tell me if you can see him

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.710 
you guys can tell me if you can see him
on<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.620> camera<00:05:12.830> I<00:05:13.039> can't<00:05:13.310> see<00:05:13.460> them<00:05:13.639> so<00:05:14.570> this

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
on the camera I can't see them so this

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.159 
on the camera I can't see them so this
case<00:05:15.169> should<00:05:15.350> be<00:05:15.410> pretty<00:05:15.680> fingerprint<00:05:16.310> free

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
case should be pretty fingerprint free

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.140 
case should be pretty fingerprint free
before<00:05:18.169> today<00:05:18.590> I'd<00:05:18.740> really<00:05:19.010> never<00:05:19.220> used<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.580> uhd

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
before today I'd really never used a uhd

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.820 
before today I'd really never used a uhd
case<00:05:20.360> but<00:05:20.900> I<00:05:20.930> really<00:05:21.199> like<00:05:21.349> them<00:05:21.500> you<00:05:21.620> know<00:05:21.710> the

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
case but I really like them you know the

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.930 
case but I really like them you know the
design<00:05:22.130> they<00:05:22.250> have<00:05:22.340> an<00:05:22.430> interesting<00:05:22.610> design

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
design they have an interesting design

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.810 
design they have an interesting design
and<00:05:23.419> they<00:05:23.930> are<00:05:24.020> pretty<00:05:24.169> protective<00:05:24.820> while

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
and they are pretty protective while

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.730 
and they are pretty protective while
keeping<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.270> phone<00:05:26.449> pretty<00:05:26.780> slim<00:05:27.110> we<00:05:27.530> just

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
keeping the phone pretty slim we just

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.980 
keeping the phone pretty slim we just
reviewed<00:05:28.039> the<00:05:28.430> UAG<00:05:28.699> case<00:05:29.060> with<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.330> galaxy<00:05:29.690> s4

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
reviewed the UAG case with the galaxy s4

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.360 
reviewed the UAG case with the galaxy s4
and<00:05:30.139> it's<00:05:30.259> it's<00:05:30.500> a<00:05:30.590> similar<00:05:30.860> case<00:05:31.039> that<00:05:31.220> keeps

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
and it's it's a similar case that keeps

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.159 
and it's it's a similar case that keeps
the<00:05:31.490> phone<00:05:31.669> really<00:05:32.060> slim<00:05:32.330> and<00:05:32.539> it<00:05:32.870> offers<00:05:33.139> a

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
the phone really slim and it offers a

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.360 
the phone really slim and it offers a
decent<00:05:33.440> layer<00:05:33.740> of<00:05:33.830> protection

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
decent layer of protection

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.159 
decent layer of protection
so<00:05:35.300> overall<00:05:35.830> $35<00:05:36.830> for<00:05:37.370> an<00:05:37.460> excellent<00:05:38.000> case<00:05:38.330> but

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
so overall $35 for an excellent case but

our case that offers excellent

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.219 
our case that offers excellent
protection<00:05:40.580> it's<00:05:41.389> more<00:05:41.539> of<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:41.720> mid-level

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
protection it's more of the mid-level

protection it's more of the mid-level
it's<00:05:42.349> not<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:42.590> heaviest<00:05:42.889> duty<00:05:43.190> case<00:05:43.490> but<00:05:44.330> for
