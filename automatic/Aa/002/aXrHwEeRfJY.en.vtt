it's<00:03:41.910> continuous<00:03:42.750> monitoring<00:03:43.260> then<00:03:43.799> it

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
it's continuous monitoring then it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.130 
it's continuous monitoring then it
becomes<00:03:44.250> early<00:03:44.610> detection<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.630> things<00:03:45.959> like

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
becomes early detection so things like

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.620 
becomes early detection so things like
hypothermia<00:03:46.799> for<00:03:47.280> example<00:03:47.880> can<00:03:48.239> be<00:03:48.360> detected

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
hypothermia for example can be detected

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.140 
hypothermia for example can be detected
early<00:03:49.170> enough<00:03:49.440> meaning<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.730> becomes

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
early enough meaning that becomes

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.080 
early enough meaning that becomes
preventive<00:03:51.900> medicine<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:53.070> that's<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> key<00:03:53.820> to

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
preventive medicine so that's the key to

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.460 
preventive medicine so that's the key to
this<00:03:54.180> health<00:03:54.450> care<00:03:54.690> monitoring<00:03:55.080> it's<00:03:55.290> never

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
this health care monitoring it's never

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.800 
this health care monitoring it's never
been<00:03:55.680> used<00:03:55.739> in<00:03:56.370> these<00:03:56.519> harsh<00:03:56.910> extreme

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
been used in these harsh extreme

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.449 
been used in these harsh extreme
conditions<00:03:58.350> before<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:59.100> it'd<00:03:59.190> be<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.310> great

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
conditions before so it'd be a great

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.150 
conditions before so it'd be a great
demonstration<00:03:59.760> of<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.930> robustness<00:04:01.440> the
