00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.500
 First, let's get to our ingredients 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.119
 150 grams of margarine 75 grams of sugar 3 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.340
 150 grams of flour a pack 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 Vanilla sugar and a little bit 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.490
 Melt baking powder first 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.170
 butter or margarine and the times in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.610
 a mixing bowl then yes as I said it 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.329
 are simple and fast weapons 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.059
 we also add the sugar 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.590
 simply generous with it and we 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.500
 continue right now, too 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.059
 Let's beat our three eggs 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.550
 Of course, the eggs of happy 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.770
 chickens and take care that no 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.660
 shell falls into it otherwise receives 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.460
 someone later a surprise waffle 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.379
 and then the surprise may be 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.910
 not quite as happy as you look at that 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.750
 so, too, would hope with the three 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.710
 u2 wash out in it 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.740
 and now the third one follows 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.740
 knock Knock 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 and that's exactly how we have almost everyone 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.830
 ingredients in it a few are still missing 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.340
 and we can do that too 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.430
 with no 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.170
 Here I have the sea ​​that too easy 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.659
 into it is nicks sieved or 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.640
 like more beautiful with and cook 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.140
 what is coming is here 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.420
 Vanilla sugar I take, of course 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.020
 real vanilla sugar with bourbon vanilla 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.840
 and not this family back and forth 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.039
 one teaspoon baking powder I once 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.229
 even with in then I'm listening to this 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.909
 whole already 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.280
 And yes, but do not want to say that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.310
 seventh I would be a little longer 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.429
 then I have a very relative 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.509
 viscous dough and just so should the 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:02.789
 yes, too 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.799
 then I take my waffle iron and 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.360
 Strike the dough into it after me 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.170
 now, of course, before on temperature 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.790
 heated up and that is natural 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.069
 with earthy so a bit viscous 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.690
 is a bit trickier than the 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.640
 liquid dough but I'll tell you 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.230
 works very well anyway 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.120
 because with meat the tiger 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.730
 maybe even a good one yourself 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.940
 So far, spread it out so far 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.380
 but fill it with wild on the sides 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.380
 that's just how it is 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.270
 and then 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:41.300
 yes, we add in the cloud and 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:42.350
 that's how the weapons look then 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.050
 when you are ready 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.330
 I did those around Easter 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.340
 Easter decoration is still the weapons gorgeous 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.860
 Delicious is just the very fast 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.690
 Variation especially without yeast none 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.240
 Waiting times at the tigers great ideas 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.600
 Must be super crispy and really 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.590
 Tasty you just try out and 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.030
 I would be happy if inflation a 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.070
 or any other comment on that 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.660
 could and at this point i would like 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.820
 Of course, also briefly on mine 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.360
 Another weapon recipe indicates that you 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.950
 yes up here in the little window 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.870
 take a look at this day 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.270
 less with a live share but great 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.470
 Delicious really worth it and otherwise 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.480
