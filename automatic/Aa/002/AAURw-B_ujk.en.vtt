 it's nine o'clock we go down to the cellar 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.200
 because the door has just opened from

 the anti creaking wooden stairs 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.739
 just looking at them is included in the price 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.950
 secret underground basement outside 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.540
 floor plan full of odds and ends 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.700
 ideal receptacle for intense 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.630
 paranormal activity of the home for the

 empire of experience succeeds in 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.229
 warn something but and it is here it is 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.670
 something happened already seen e 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.920
 told but this does not prevent 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.539
 to the evocation of the ring of being 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.459
 was the surprise of the American summer 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.920
 with more than 120 million dollars 

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.659
 cashed today but above all with 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.149
 great welcome by the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.009
 critical year of spirits yes because in a 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.869
 era in which gold is too often 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.389
 involved in extravagances of effects 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.340
 splatter this movie that prefers a 

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:34.109
 nostalgic approach the evocation of 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.659
 fear according to mechanisms exquisitely 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.149
 vintage thanks to the excellent inspired direction 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.159
 of jane it sounds fascinating 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.999
 original and above all it provokes healthy people 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.999
 chills stibilj 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.560
 I had never seen anything like it 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.680
 the author does not make the mistake of riding the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.780
 fashion of fake found footage 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.700
 documentary but of those genres so in 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.740
 vogue astutely appropriates 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.720
 simply of the basic concept that is 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.970
 the creation of suspense through 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.250
 precisely the evocation where what is not 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:11.100
 see mass that makes us even more afraid of 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.140
 what is revealed yes but to see it 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.000
 yes when the music makes the film 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.100
 works great especially in the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.170
 first part as an interesting variation 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.930
 on the theme haunted house with tack 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.760
 final on possession and exorcism as well 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.760
 successful although less original
