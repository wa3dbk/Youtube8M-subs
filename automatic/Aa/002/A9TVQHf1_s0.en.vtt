00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:08.679 
now variable pitch propeller is one

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.230 
now variable pitch propeller is one
where<00:00:08.889> you<00:00:09.010> can<00:00:09.160> change<00:00:09.370> the<00:00:09.549> propeller<00:00:10.030> pitch

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
where you can change the propeller pitch

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.530 
where you can change the propeller pitch
manually<00:00:10.870> in<00:00:11.049> flight<00:00:11.459> the<00:00:12.459> pitch<00:00:12.670> can<00:00:12.879> either

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
manually in flight the pitch can either

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.840 
manually in flight the pitch can either
high<00:00:14.750> gear<00:00:14.990> box<00:00:15.230> or<00:00:15.650> at<00:00:15.860> any<00:00:16.040> pitch<00:00:16.309> depending

on<00:00:16.940> the<00:00:17.060> aircraft<00:00:19.119> using<00:00:20.119> variable<00:00:20.540> pitch

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
on the aircraft using variable pitch

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.180 
on the aircraft using variable pitch
propellers<00:00:21.200> is<00:00:21.320> like<00:00:21.530> selecting<00:00:22.070> between

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
propellers is like selecting between

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.310 
propellers is like selecting between
fixed-pitch<00:00:22.880> propellers<00:00:23.230> meaning<00:00:24.230> of

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
fixed-pitch propellers meaning of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.870 
fixed-pitch propellers meaning of
swapping<00:00:24.680> between<00:00:24.800> fine<00:00:25.310> and<00:00:25.490> coarse<00:00:25.640> pitch

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
swapping between fine and coarse pitch

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.000 
swapping between fine and coarse pitch
mid-flight<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:26.630> since<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:27.590> acts<00:00:27.770> like<00:00:27.920> a

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
mid-flight and since it acts like a

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.859 
mid-flight and since it acts like a
fixed<00:00:28.369> pitch<00:00:28.520> propeller<00:00:28.880> you're<00:00:29.540> actually

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
fixed pitch propeller you're actually

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.540 
fixed pitch propeller you're actually
managing<00:00:30.290> your<00:00:30.410> rpm<00:00:30.830> by<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.100> pitch<00:00:31.369> and

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
managing your rpm by the pitch and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.549 
managing your rpm by the pitch and

to<00:00:36.170> illustrate<00:00:36.620> this<00:00:36.770> concept<00:00:42.010> here<00:00:43.010> I've<00:00:43.129> set

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
to illustrate this concept here I've set

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.100 
to illustrate this concept here I've set
it<00:00:43.340> up<00:00:43.550> with<00:00:43.670> a<00:00:43.730> 109<00:00:44.210> we'll<00:00:44.570> put<00:00:44.780> it<00:00:44.870> on<00:00:44.960> the

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
it up with a 109 we'll put it on the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.810 
it up with a 109 we'll put it on the
manual<00:00:45.410> pitch<00:00:45.620> control<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:46.610> what<00:00:46.699> we're

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
manual pitch control and what we're

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.009 
manual pitch control and what we're
going<00:00:46.909> to<00:00:47.000> do<00:00:47.150> is<00:00:47.300> we're<00:00:47.510> going<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.720> see<00:00:47.900> how

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
going to do is we're going to see how

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.170 
going to do is we're going to see how
the<00:00:48.080> blade<00:00:48.350> angle<00:00:48.530> changes<00:00:49.129> according<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.030> how

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
the blade angle changes according to how

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.660 
the blade angle changes according to how
propeller<00:00:50.570> pitch<00:00:50.690> changes<00:00:51.280> right<00:00:52.280> now<00:00:52.339> that

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
propeller pitch changes right now that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.520 
propeller pitch changes right now that
pitch<00:00:52.820> is<00:00:52.970> at<00:00:53.120> its<00:00:53.269> highest<00:00:53.479> or<00:00:53.900> core<00:00:54.140> setting

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
pitch is at its highest or core setting

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.170 
pitch is at its highest or core setting
as<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:54.680> can<00:00:55.040> see<00:00:55.220> on<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.400> dial<00:00:55.640> indicating

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
as you can see on the dial indicating

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.829 
as you can see on the dial indicating
8:30<00:00:56.710> now<00:00:57.710> as<00:00:57.890> I<00:00:58.040> start<00:00:58.280> decreasing<00:00:58.760> pitch<00:00:59.180> you

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
8:30 now as I start decreasing pitch you

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.049 
8:30 now as I start decreasing pitch you
can<00:00:59.989> see<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.320> blade<00:01:00.500> angle<00:01:00.710> decrease<00:01:01.339> meaning

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
can see the blade angle decrease meaning

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.820 
can see the blade angle decrease meaning
that<00:01:02.150> the<00:01:02.299> pitch<00:01:02.479> is<00:01:02.629> becoming<00:01:03.019> more<00:01:03.260> fine<00:01:03.589> as

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
that the pitch is becoming more fine as

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.850 
that the pitch is becoming more fine as
the<00:01:04.729> pitch<00:01:04.879> becomes<00:01:05.299> more<00:01:05.600> fine<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.530> bites

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
the pitch becomes more fine it bites

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.920 
the pitch becomes more fine it bites
less<00:01:07.190> and<00:01:07.430> less<00:01:07.580> air<00:01:07.940> to<00:01:08.299> allow<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.540> prop<00:01:08.810> to

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
less and less air to allow the prop to

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.100 
less and less air to allow the prop to
turn<00:01:09.140> faster<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:09.799> increase<00:01:10.159> rpm<00:01:11.110> however

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
turn faster and increase rpm however

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.500 
turn faster and increase rpm however
this<00:01:12.350> can't<00:01:12.619> go<00:01:12.770> on<00:01:12.920> forever<00:01:13.070> at<00:01:13.909> a<00:01:14.000> point<00:01:14.330> we

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
this can't go on forever at a point we

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.149 
this can't go on forever at a point we
hit<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.780> fine<00:01:14.990> pitch<00:01:15.200> stop<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:16.010> is

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
hit the fine pitch stop and this is

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:17.680 
hit the fine pitch stop and this is
where<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.430> propeller<00:01:16.760> pitch<00:01:17.000> won't<00:01:17.270> decrease

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
where the propeller pitch won't decrease

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.800 
where the propeller pitch won't decrease
any<00:01:17.869> more<00:01:18.640> when<00:01:19.640> we're<00:01:19.820> at<00:01:19.940> this<00:01:20.150> point<00:01:20.480> we<00:01:20.660> can

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
any more when we're at this point we can

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.080 
any more when we're at this point we can
only<00:01:20.930> increase<00:01:21.350> rpm<00:01:21.860> further<00:01:22.190> by<00:01:22.520> increasing

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
only increase rpm further by increasing

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.360 
only increase rpm further by increasing
air<00:01:23.240> speed<00:01:23.510> and<00:01:23.690> throttle<00:01:23.870> now<00:01:24.170> I'll<00:01:25.130> change

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
air speed and throttle now I'll change

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.100 
air speed and throttle now I'll change
propeller<00:01:25.820> pitch<00:01:26.030> from<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.360> fine<00:01:26.600> stop<00:01:26.930> to

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
propeller pitch from the fine stop to

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.780 
propeller pitch from the fine stop to
the<00:01:27.200> coarse<00:01:27.410> stop<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:27.950> look<00:01:28.250> at<00:01:28.400> how<00:01:28.550> it<00:01:28.640> works

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
the coarse stop and look at how it works

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.090 
the coarse stop and look at how it works
in<00:01:29.000> Reverse<00:01:29.330> now<00:01:29.570> as<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.590> clockface<00:01:30.800> is

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
in Reverse now as the clockface is

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.320 
in Reverse now as the clockface is
moving<00:01:31.430> towards<00:01:31.790> 830

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
moving towards 830

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.140 
moving towards 830
this<00:01:33.230> means<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.650> pitch<00:01:33.800> is<00:01:33.980> increasing<00:01:34.610> so

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
this means the pitch is increasing so

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.090 
this means the pitch is increasing so
the<00:01:35.270> blade<00:01:35.480> angle<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:35.840> increasing<00:01:36.470> this

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
the blade angle is increasing this

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.980 
the blade angle is increasing this
increases<00:01:37.760> how<00:01:37.910> much<00:01:38.090> other<00:01:38.270> propeller<00:01:38.720> bites

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
increases how much other propeller bites

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.010 
increases how much other propeller bites
and<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:39.830> will<00:01:40.010> lower<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.460> RPM<00:01:40.640> when<00:01:41.600> flying

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
and this will lower the RPM when flying

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.110 
and this will lower the RPM when flying
aircraft<00:01:42.260> like<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.830> 109<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.520> can<00:01:43.670> adjust<00:01:43.970> the

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
aircraft like the 109 you can adjust the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.660 
aircraft like the 109 you can adjust the
pitch<00:01:44.330> anywhere<00:01:44.840> over<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.170> entire<00:01:45.500> range<00:01:45.830> but

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
pitch anywhere over the entire range but

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.340 
pitch anywhere over the entire range but
some<00:01:46.910> aircraft<00:01:47.120> can<00:01:47.540> only<00:01:47.660> choose<00:01:47.960> certain

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
some aircraft can only choose certain

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.620 
some aircraft can only choose certain
points<00:01:48.740> in<00:01:48.920> perspective<00:01:49.760> this<00:01:50.060> means<00:01:50.330> that<00:01:50.480> an

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
points in perspective this means that an

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.120 
points in perspective this means that an
aircraft<00:01:50.780> might<00:01:51.260> only<00:01:51.470> be<00:01:51.680> able<00:01:51.800> to<00:01:51.920> choose

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
aircraft might only be able to choose

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.440 
aircraft might only be able to choose
between<00:01:52.160> nine<00:01:52.670> o'clock<00:01:52.940> and<00:01:53.090> 12<00:01:53.330> o'clock

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
between nine o'clock and 12 o'clock

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.359 
between nine o'clock and 12 o'clock
instead<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.200> entire<00:01:54.470> range

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.849 

now<00:01:57.939> will<00:01:58.149> airborne<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.840> 109<00:01:59.259> and<00:01:59.619> we'll

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
now will airborne and the 109 and we'll

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.609 
now will airborne and the 109 and we'll
go<00:01:59.979> through<00:02:00.009> these<00:02:00.429> principles<00:02:00.939> in<00:02:01.060> practice

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
go through these principles in practice

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.630 
go through these principles in practice
so<00:02:02.619> I'm<00:02:02.710> going<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:02.979> leave<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.369> throttle

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
so I'm going to leave the throttle

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.639 
so I'm going to leave the throttle
steady<00:02:03.820> at<00:02:04.000> 1.2<00:02:04.390> atmosphere<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.439> I'm<00:02:05.530> going

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
steady at 1.2 atmosphere and I'm going

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.580 
steady at 1.2 atmosphere and I'm going
to<00:02:05.679> turn<00:02:05.890> off<00:02:06.009> automatic<00:02:06.520> pitch<00:02:06.670> control<00:02:07.590> now

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
to turn off automatic pitch control now

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.990 
to turn off automatic pitch control now
I'm<00:02:08.679> going<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.890> do<00:02:09.009> some<00:02:09.250> maneuvering<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:09.819> try

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
I'm going to do some maneuvering and try

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.580 
I'm going to do some maneuvering and try
and<00:02:10.090> keep<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.390> engine<00:02:10.539> at<00:02:10.929> 25<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.620> 2,600<00:02:12.250> rpm

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and keep the engine at 25 to 2,600 rpm

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.320 
and keep the engine at 25 to 2,600 rpm
so<00:02:14.590> sticking<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.370> climb<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:16.030> airspeed

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
so sticking it in the climb the airspeed

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.589 
so sticking it in the climb the airspeed
will<00:02:16.510> drop<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.129> will<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.370> RPM<00:02:18.790> so<00:02:19.540> you

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
will drop and so will the RPM so you

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.420 
will drop and so will the RPM so you
decrease<00:02:20.260> propeller<00:02:20.650> pitch<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.099> a<00:02:21.160> fine

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
decrease propeller pitch to a fine

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.940 
decrease propeller pitch to a fine
setting<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.900> you'll<00:02:23.019> note<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.319> RPM<00:02:23.680> starts

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
setting and you'll note the RPM starts

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
setting and you'll note the RPM starts
increasing<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:26.379> clock<00:02:26.620> face<00:02:26.830> is<00:02:27.040> at<00:02:27.220> 10:45

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
increasing the clock face is at 10:45

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.300 
increasing the clock face is at 10:45
right<00:02:28.269> now<00:02:28.420> now<00:02:29.380> if<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.620> was<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.769> roll<00:02:29.980> over<00:02:30.010> and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
right now now if I was to roll over and

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.430 
right now now if I was to roll over and
start<00:02:30.640> increasing<00:02:31.090> my<00:02:31.239> airspeed<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.319> then

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
start increasing my airspeed and then

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.250 
start increasing my airspeed and then
have<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.620> adjust<00:02:32.920> propeller<00:02:33.310> pitch<00:02:33.459> again

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
have to adjust propeller pitch again

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.960 
have to adjust propeller pitch again
airspeed<00:02:35.260> increases<00:02:35.829> my<00:02:36.220> rpm<00:02:36.670> will<00:02:36.790> start

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
airspeed increases my rpm will start

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.550 
airspeed increases my rpm will start
increasing<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.079> make<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.349> pitch

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
increasing so I have to make the pitch

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.740 
increasing so I have to make the pitch
more<00:02:38.860> coarse<00:02:39.190> in<00:02:39.519> order<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:39.940> keep<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.299> rpm<00:02:40.720> of

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
more coarse in order to keep the rpm of

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.339 
more coarse in order to keep the rpm of
25<00:02:41.260> or<00:02:41.410> 2600<00:02:42.360> it's<00:02:43.360> not<00:02:43.540> just<00:02:43.810> climbs<00:02:44.140> and

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
25 or 2600 it's not just climbs and

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.110 
25 or 2600 it's not just climbs and
dives<00:02:44.560> we<00:02:44.829> will<00:02:44.950> be<00:02:45.040> managing<00:02:45.459> up<00:02:45.579> here<00:02:45.849> my

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
prop pitch you also have to manage it in

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.000 
prop pitch you also have to manage it in
the<00:02:48.519> turn<00:02:49.410> especially<00:02:50.410> if<00:02:50.530> it's<00:02:50.709> a<00:02:50.799> turn

that's going to bleed off a lot of
airspeed<00:02:52.540> as<00:02:52.750> I'll<00:02:52.930> show<00:02:52.959> now<00:02:53.640> initiating<00:02:54.640> a

fair bit of back pressure and decrease
my<00:02:58.780> airspeed<00:03:01.709> you'll<00:03:02.709> have<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.950> manage<00:03:03.250> the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
propeller fish during a turn like this

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.569 
propeller fish during a turn like this
as<00:03:04.989> your<00:03:05.139> airspeed<00:03:05.470> Falls<00:03:05.799> because<00:03:06.100> this<00:03:06.400> way

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
as your airspeed Falls because this way

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.039 
as your airspeed Falls because this way
you<00:03:06.639> give<00:03:06.940> yourself<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.420> correct<00:03:07.720> amount<00:03:07.959> of

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
you give yourself the correct amount of

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.960 
you give yourself the correct amount of
thrust<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.500> maintain<00:03:08.889> the<00:03:09.010> turn

if you don't do so you'll end up falling
out<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.190> turn<00:03:12.400> a<00:03:12.430> lot<00:03:12.640> faster<00:03:13.030> than<00:03:13.060> you

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
out of the turn a lot faster than you

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.080 
out of the turn a lot faster than you
