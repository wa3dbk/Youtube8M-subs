00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.000
 very good to all boys and girls 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.040
 welcome once again to the channel the 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.680
 I bring a new gta 5 video online 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.379
 this time it's a good trick the 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.809
 first patch trick 1.6 is worth the 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.000
 last patrick attacked and as you see then 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.730
 in the story mode we will go to a 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.110
 session by invitation to start 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.330
 make the first steps worth 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.310
 I recommend doing the steps as is 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.410
 I do, I know there are some steps that 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.140
 well they are not obligatory let's say but 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.150
 good in my case the trick we're going to 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.880
 do with bikes worth always remember not 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.220
 exceed $ 50,000 since this 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.720
 Trick is not for luxury cars then 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.090
 we can have problems and lose 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.840
 our vehicles is worth also works 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.579
 with cars, I can not say for sure 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.800
 if this method will work with cars 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.180
 because I have not tried it but good as 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.250
 You see the first thing we have to do 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.719
 I have taken my motorbike the bike that I have and 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.100
 we go to the workshop to turn the one 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.110
 I did not have enough 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.940
 tuned but good I was out there the 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.030
 turbo and some little things more and more 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.530
 Well, I'm already looking at what I'm doing 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.180
 that they gave me for the bike, you do not know 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.609
 that the more tuned the motorcycle is 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.530
 more we go here is worth guys once 

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:10.659
 let 's get out there going to see trembles no 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.700
 do not worry, nothing happens there seems 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.709
 that as they disappear lime we will go 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.299
 to options within online and we will have 

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:18.909
 that put last location is worth 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.950
 you see the version is 1.6 is the last 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.560
 that they have done well once 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.550
 we have done that we will go again to 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.150
 online and leave 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.150
 we see the session 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.270
 we will leave the session and once 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.710
 let's be in history mode 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.840
 because when leaving the session we will 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.969
 go to the story mode once we are in 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.250
 Story mode back to give star 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.700
 again and we go back to a session 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.149
 Invitational new voucher 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.479
 as I tell you this step is not that it is 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.070
 obligatory to do it but good yes that you 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.580
 I recommend it if you want 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.410
 work 100% like me 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.030
 we'll have to do it, it's a little bit 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.820
 you are already seeing in the video that 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.400
 good are just four minutes what 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.230
 what the video and the method last 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.330
 it lasts one minute and one or two minutes 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.850
 as much so well we're not going to 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.770
 Losing a lot of time is worth good once 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.350
 we have done this as you see 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.060
 when putting the last appearance we 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.710
 we were in the workshop we are going to appear 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.330
 always close to the little one 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.220
 I have not appeared in my case 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.890
 little bit behind because nothing caught the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.980
 bike we put in the workshop is 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.990
 it's practically very easy, and it's 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.640
 practically like other tricks that already 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.670
 we've seen from previous versions of 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.190
 gta once we have the motorcycle inside 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.940
 now very attentive guys we will go to 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.770
 to sell 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.510
 we'll give it to you if we want here 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.880
 sell it will ask us if we want 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.280
 confirm it and we will confirm it once 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.470
 done this we will go fast to online you 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 we will give to change character is worth this 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.830
 you have to do it fast as you see the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.420
 doll is not inside the workshop but 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.280
 that is out and this has to be done 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.780
 quick ok do not have to do it either 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.930
 do it to every host do not go to 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.490
 confuse but not good either 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.560
 you sleep us 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.690
 and do it with a little bit of 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.610
 good guys, how do you see now what 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.190
 I go back to do this again if this is 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.140
 simple method is this once we have 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.000
 done once is all the time what 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.700
 same we sell we are going to change 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.520
 characters we select the character 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.070
 that we have and once and again and another and 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.450
 another and another and another is going to put each 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.150
 Once we enter we will put in a 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.400
 online session but do not worry 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.260
 this is the method is very simple guys 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.060

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.650
