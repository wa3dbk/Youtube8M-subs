carry talked to you about them as far as
what<00:00:12.780> styles<00:00:13.170> they<00:00:13.349> are<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.740> what<00:00:13.920> they

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
what styles they are and what they

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.010 
what styles they are and what they
typically<00:00:14.429> are<00:00:14.519> found<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.059> well<00:00:15.690> start<00:00:15.929> with

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
typically are found in well start with

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.540 
typically are found in well start with
the<00:00:16.080> rechargeable<00:00:16.650> batteries<00:00:17.039> obviously

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
the rechargeable batteries obviously

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.790 
the rechargeable batteries obviously
double-a<00:00:18.119> rechargeable<00:00:18.750> batteries<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.560> find

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
double-a rechargeable batteries you find

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.080 
double-a rechargeable batteries you find
them<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:19.980> almost<00:00:20.100> every<00:00:20.520> loader<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.850> you

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
them in almost every loader that you

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.950 
them in almost every loader that you
look<00:00:21.270> at<00:00:21.449> or<00:00:22.189> accessory<00:00:23.630> rechargeable<00:00:24.630> setups

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
look at or accessory rechargeable setups

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.300 
look at or accessory rechargeable setups
are<00:00:25.109> nice<00:00:25.320> because<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.160> keep

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
are nice because you can just keep

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.920 
are nice because you can just keep
reusing<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.849> batteries<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.359> obviously<00:00:27.810> you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
reusing the batteries and obviously you

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.880 
reusing the batteries and obviously you
never<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.380> throw<00:00:28.560> them<00:00:28.650> away

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
never have to throw them away

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.130 
never have to throw them away
so<00:00:29.279> they'll<00:00:29.490> run<00:00:29.640> forever<00:00:30.480> you<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.019> got<00:00:31.109> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
so they'll run forever you just got to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.870 
so they'll run forever you just got to
charge<00:00:31.380> them<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.309> carry<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> double

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
charge them up so we carry the double

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.490 
charge them up so we carry the double
A's<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> six<00:00:33.570> pack<00:00:33.750> here<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.320> two

they're more of a scenario set up team

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.509 
they're more of a scenario set up team
and<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.680> these<00:01:04.860> green<00:01:05.100> batteries

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
and so they have these green batteries

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.250 
and so they have these green batteries
and<00:01:05.970> then<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> blue<00:01:06.420> batteries<00:01:06.840> they're

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and then the blue batteries they're

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.870 
and then the blue batteries they're
exactly<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.680> same<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> generic<00:01:08.580> blue
