00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
with a few very iconic design elements

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
with a few very iconic design elements
that<00:00:45.180> would<00:00:45.300> speak<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.840> speed<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
that would speak the speed and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.160 
that would speak the speed and
lightweight<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.640> we<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.090> very<00:00:48.329> iconic

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
lightweight so we have this very iconic

that repeats throughout the product and

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
that repeats throughout the product and
pretty<00:00:58.199> much<00:00:58.260> aesthetic<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:59.010> driven<00:00:59.190> by

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
pretty much aesthetic was driven by

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
pretty much aesthetic was driven by
function<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.510> shoe<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.170> simple

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
function because the shoe is so simple

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.609 
function because the shoe is so simple
and<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.239> clean<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.420> its<00:01:03.570> design<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.350> also

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
and so clean in its design it's also

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.030 
and so clean in its design it's also
great<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.129> wear<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:06.090> casually<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.680> works

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
great to wear just casually it works

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.250
