00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.249 

what's<00:00:11.460> different<00:00:12.389> about<00:00:12.540> these<00:00:12.900> these

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
what's different about these these

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.440 
what's different about these these
surfboards<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:14.040> comparison<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.849> regular

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
surfboards in comparison to regular

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.720 
surfboards in comparison to regular
surfboard<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.320> they<00:00:16.830> have<00:00:17.100> what's

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
surfboard is that they have what's

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.660 
surfboard is that they have what's
called<00:00:17.970> perimeter<00:00:18.660> primitive<00:00:19.410> stringers<00:00:19.830> so

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
called perimeter primitive stringers so

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.939 
called perimeter primitive stringers so
the<00:00:21.000> stringer<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.900> actually<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.529> rail<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
the stringer is actually the rail of the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.640 
the stringer is actually the rail of the
surfboard<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:24.240> case<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.779> solid<00:00:25.439> in

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
surfboard in this case it's solid in

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.790 
surfboard in this case it's solid in
this<00:00:26.160> case<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.849> oak<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.170> have<00:00:28.410> an<00:00:28.529> oak

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
this case it's oak if you have an oak

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950 
this case it's oak if you have an oak
outside<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> surfboard<00:00:30.269> obviously<00:00:30.840> it's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
outside of the surfboard obviously it's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.080 
outside of the surfboard obviously it's
going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> make<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:31.560> very<00:00:32.009> very<00:00:32.640> strong

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
going to make it very very very strong

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.990 
going to make it very very very strong
very<00:00:33.120> durable<00:00:34.010> which<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.219> really<00:00:35.520> great

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
very durable which is a really great

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.330 
very durable which is a really great
factor<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.719> having<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.079> surfboard<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
factor to having a surfboard this is a

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.209 
factor to having a surfboard this is a
piece<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.550> oak<00:00:38.790> I've<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.210> here<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:41.070> got<00:00:41.160> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
piece of oak I've got here it's got a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.160 
piece of oak I've got here it's got a
nice<00:00:41.510> nice<00:00:42.510> curve<00:00:43.340> curve<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> plank<00:00:45.170> which

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
nice nice curve curve to the plank which

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.400 
nice nice curve curve to the plank which
helps<00:00:46.530> me<00:00:46.739> cut<00:00:47.700> out<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.180> nice<00:00:48.539> lot<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.960> lot<00:00:49.320> of

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
helps me cut out a nice lot of lot of

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.790 
helps me cut out a nice lot of lot of
rail<00:00:49.559> rails<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.879> each<00:00:51.030> plank<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.649> way<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
rail rails from each plank and the way I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.319 
rail rails from each plank and the way I
do<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:54.350> I'll<00:00:55.350> make<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> template<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:57.270> then

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
do that is I'll make a template and then

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.650 
do that is I'll make a template and then
this<00:00:57.629> goes<00:00:57.930> on<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> plank<00:00:59.660> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
this goes on to the on to the plank and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.250 
this goes on to the on to the plank and
I<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.899> cut<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.309> probably<00:01:02.329> about<00:01:03.329> three<00:01:03.780> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
I can cut out probably about three of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:16.760 
I can cut out probably about three of
each<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.890> each<00:01:05.040> plank<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.519> wood

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.680 

on<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.890> outside<00:01:18.250> of<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.430> surfboard<00:01:18.940> is<00:01:19.240> ply

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
on the outside of the surfboard is ply

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.350 
on the outside of the surfboard is ply
and<00:01:20.020> it's<00:01:20.410> a<00:01:20.680> it's<00:01:21.460> a<00:01:21.520> birch<00:01:21.730> face<00:01:22.030> play<00:01:22.330> and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
and it's a it's a birch face play and

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.800 
and it's a it's a birch face play and
it's<00:01:22.780> three<00:01:23.080> layers<00:01:23.290> of<00:01:23.410> fly<00:01:23.740> very<00:01:24.310> thin<00:01:24.580> it's

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
it's three layers of fly very thin it's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.100 
it's three layers of fly very thin it's
1.5<00:01:25.810> mil<00:01:26.080> thin<00:01:26.740> 1.5<00:01:27.250> mile<00:01:27.850> thick<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.360> that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
1.5 mil thin 1.5 mile thick and that

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.870 
1.5 mil thin 1.5 mile thick and that
goes<00:01:29.290> over<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.710> outside<00:01:30.040> of<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.400> board<00:01:30.640> and

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
goes over the outside of the board and

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.430 
goes over the outside of the board and
creates<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.510> really<00:01:31.660> really<00:01:32.110> really<00:01:33.070> strong

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
creates a really really really strong

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.710 
creates a really really really strong
skin<00:01:35.440> to<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:35.890> surfboard<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:36.670> haven't<00:01:37.510> got<00:01:37.690> a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
skin to the surfboard I haven't got a

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.800 
skin to the surfboard I haven't got a
glass<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.470> board<00:01:39.090> which<00:01:40.090> is<00:01:40.240> which<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.570> great

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
glass the board which is which is great

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.570 
glass the board which is which is great
for<00:01:40.840> me<00:01:41.170> from<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.500> construction<00:01:41.830> point<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:42.370> view

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
for me from a construction point of view

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.380 
for me from a construction point of view
because<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.920> more<00:01:45.130> of<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.280> build<00:01:45.550> rather<00:01:46.090> than

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
because it's more of a build rather than

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.180 
because it's more of a build rather than
rather<00:01:46.780> than<00:01:46.990> sculpting<00:01:47.530> something<00:01:47.950> and<00:01:48.100> then

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
rather than sculpting something and then

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.150 
rather than sculpting something and then
and<00:01:48.430> then<00:01:48.550> glassing<00:01:49.060> it<00:01:49.210> it's<00:01:50.160> partly

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
and then glassing it it's partly

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160 
and then glassing it it's partly
sculpting<00:01:51.760> and<00:01:52.000> then<00:01:52.390> it's<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.690> real<00:01:52.900> build

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
sculpting and then it's a real build

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.430 
sculpting and then it's a real build
it's<00:01:53.560> it's<00:01:53.950> putting<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.060> board<00:01:55.240> together<00:01:55.440> in

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
it's it's putting the board together in

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.670 
it's it's putting the board together in
a<00:01:56.500> way<00:01:56.800> that's<00:01:57.430> when<00:01:58.030> it's<00:01:58.180> when<00:01:58.420> it's<00:01:58.450> done<00:01:58.810> it

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
a way that's when it's when it's done it

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.410 
a way that's when it's when it's done it
doesn't<00:01:59.979> need<00:02:00.070> any<00:02:00.250> more<00:02:00.490> reinforcing<00:02:01.210> that's

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
doesn't need any more reinforcing that's

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.749 
doesn't need any more reinforcing that's
that's<00:02:01.869> it<00:02:02.110> it's<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.440> wooden<00:02:02.710> surfboard<00:02:03.310> it<00:02:03.520> it

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
that's it it's a wooden surfboard it it

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.260 
that's it it's a wooden surfboard it it
holds<00:02:04.150> itself<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:05.250> all<00:02:06.250> I<00:02:06.280> do<00:02:06.430> what's<00:02:06.970> on<00:02:07.150> the

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
holds itself and all I do what's on the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.389 
holds itself and all I do what's on the
outside<00:02:07.300> is<00:02:07.930> just<00:02:07.960> paint<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.500> with<00:02:08.649> with<00:02:09.100> with

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
outside is just paint it with with with

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.300 
outside is just paint it with with with
a<00:02:09.459> varnish<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.320> give<00:02:11.320> it<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.470> multiple<00:02:12.100> coats

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
a varnish and give it a multiple coats

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.510 
a varnish and give it a multiple coats
of<00:02:12.610> varnish<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.570> it's<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> woods<00:02:14.860> fully

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
of varnish so it's so the woods fully

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.820 
of varnish so it's so the woods fully
protected<00:02:16.030> but<00:02:16.360> there's<00:02:16.540> no<00:02:16.810> actual<00:02:17.410> actual

strength provided by the varnish on the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.600 
strength provided by the varnish on the
outside<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.380> just<00:02:20.410> literally<00:02:21.070> to<00:02:21.190> protect<00:02:21.519> the
