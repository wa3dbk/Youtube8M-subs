00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.779
 hi to all today I would like to talk to you about 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.400
 of the difficulty of putting the drops 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.219
 of chocolate inside the dl 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.219
 ciambellone made every time 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.380
 I did it I practically noticed her 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.380
 drips slip and as you cook the 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.660
 the donut lele who I find at the end 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.170
 all find themselves at the base 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.759
 precisely of our ciambellone e 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.220
 looking around among internet ho 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.710
 also asked some people with more 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.570
 experience I found a little secret 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.960
 and now that now I will explain but 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.660
 really a stupid but trivial secret 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.520
 very effective then you see this is one 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.060
 spray these are our drops of 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:52.390
 chocolate I will start to wet them all 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:56.380
 in order to make them all moist 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:02.260
 here it is done after which it inserts a 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:05.590
 spoon of flour and mixes 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.060
 as you can see you see they bathe the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.460
 flour sticks all the drops of 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.619
 chocolate what happens practically 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.119
 on a physical level how it works while the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.740
 drop of chocolate and smooth then 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.990
 inside the dough while they are 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.390
 the oven tends to slide towards the 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.070
 low with the flour becomes the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.229
 surface becomes rough so when 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.020
 I insert it in the dough it stops where 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:30.280
 where I entered it as you can 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.710
 see is very effective now inserted the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.719
 my drops of chocolate in the dough vi 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.380
 I show and then put it in the oven there 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.380
 I will show the result 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.380
 this is my dough from the donut 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.000
 then clearly everyone each goes to the 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.120
 your own thing the thing 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.800
 fundamental are precisely how to treat 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:58.800
 we put these our drops 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:02.910
 inside a perfect one 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.180
 we give it a shuffle you see we are one 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.330
 small mixed and at this point the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.620
 our dough is ready 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.360
 here I have filled the vessel with it 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.180
 I put it in the oven and I will show you too much 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.180
 just made our voices state 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.170
 and here is the final result as you can 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.000
 see the crosses are mixed 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.730
 even outside you see in some pieces 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.970
 which are sometimes in cases they remain a lot 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.790
 high and in any case never go down 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.680
 you all see it below 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.930
 I hope this video can be there 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.569
 useful if you liked you can too

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.430
