00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
Diagnostics I not only like to look at

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.079 
Diagnostics I not only like to look at
what<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.529> scan<00:00:04.770> tool<00:00:05.009> showing<00:00:05.490> me<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:05.700> digital

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
what the scan tool showing me in digital

I<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> best<00:00:34.380> about<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.710> feature<00:00:35.190> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
I like the best about that feature the

I like the best about that feature the
first<00:00:35.790> thing<00:00:36.000> I'll<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.360> put<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.809> tool<00:00:37.020> into

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
first thing I'll do is put the tool into

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.639 
first thing I'll do is put the tool into
in<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.010> case<00:00:38.250> generic<00:00:38.760> obd2<00:00:39.180> mode<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:42.649> it's

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
in this case generic obd2 mode and it's

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.220 
in this case generic obd2 mode and it's
going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> detect<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> protocol<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.840> give<00:00:46.079> me

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
going to detect the protocol and give me

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.959 
going to detect the protocol and give me
a<00:00:46.260> list<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.680> things<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.430> do<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> quick

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
a list of things that I can do a quick

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.720 
a list of things that I can do a quick
test<00:00:48.000> look<00:00:48.870> at<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> BTC<00:00:49.920> s<00:00:49.980> look<00:00:50.579> at<00:00:50.670> the

frame whatever I want to do but for
right<00:00:55.770> now<00:00:55.829> I'm<00:00:56.640> interested<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.600> looking<00:00:57.870> at

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
right now I'm interested in looking at

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.830 
right now I'm interested in looking at
live<00:00:58.260> data<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.579> I'll<00:00:59.789> move<00:00:59.969> into<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.390> area

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
live data so I'll move into that area

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.110 
live data so I'll move into that area
and<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.829> I'll<00:01:02.129> go<00:01:02.250> down<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.460> select<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and then I'll go down and select the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.190 
and then I'll go down and select the
live<00:01:03.300> data<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.970> notice<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> scan<00:01:06.930> tool

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
live data and notice that the scan tool

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.289 
live data and notice that the scan tool
splits<00:01:07.650> its<00:01:07.830> screen<00:01:08.159> up<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
splits its screen up here we have the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.300 
splits its screen up here we have the
live<00:01:09.600> data<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.229> down<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> graph

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
live data and down here is the graph

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
live data and down here is the graph
that<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.729> was<00:01:11.880> telling<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.270> about<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.720> like

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
that I was telling you about that I like

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
that I was telling you about that I like
to<00:01:13.020> look<00:01:13.049> at<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.460> particular<00:01:14.670> case

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
to look at so in this particular case

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.670 
to look at so in this particular case
I'm<00:01:15.420> interested<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> throttle<00:01:16.409> position

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I'm interested in the throttle position

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.149 
I'm interested in the throttle position
sensors<00:01:17.400> performance<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.979> work

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
sensors performance so I'm going to work

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.730 
sensors performance so I'm going to work
my<00:01:20.400> way<00:01:20.430> down<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.060> list<00:01:21.240> until<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.259> get<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
my way down the list until I get to the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.070 
my way down the list until I get to the
parameter<00:01:23.280> identifier<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> throttle

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
parameter identifier for the throttle

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.410 
parameter identifier for the throttle
position<00:01:25.350> sensor<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.299> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
position sensor and we can see with the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
position sensor and we can see with the
percentage<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> throttle<00:01:28.829> position<00:01:28.950> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
percentage of the throttle position is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.969 
percentage of the throttle position is
here<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.600> also<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.290> down<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.770> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
here we can also see it down here on the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.090 
here we can also see it down here on the
graph<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.700> when<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> change<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.350> position<00:01:34.530> of

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
graph so when I change the position of

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.910 
graph so when I change the position of
the<00:01:35.549> throttle<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:36.540> only<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.350> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
the throttle not only can we see the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.950 
the throttle not only can we see the
percentage<00:01:38.430> change<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:39.299> can<00:01:39.450> actually<00:01:39.780> watch

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
percentage change we can actually watch

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
percentage change we can actually watch
the<00:01:40.140> performance<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> graph<00:01:41.130> at<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> same

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the performance on the graph at the same

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.149 
the performance on the graph at the same
time<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.170> here<00:01:43.380> I'm<00:01:43.470> letting<00:01:43.710> my<00:01:43.799> foot<00:01:44.040> off
