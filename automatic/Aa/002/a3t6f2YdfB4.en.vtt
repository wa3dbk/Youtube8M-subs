00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
kind of speeded up it's like I had a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.400 
kind of speeded up it's like I had a
rocket<00:00:28.560> ship<00:00:28.710> behind<00:00:29.189> me<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:30.109> before<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.260> had

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
rocket ship behind me and before I had

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.810 
rocket ship behind me and before I had
time<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.769> really<00:00:31.949> work<00:00:32.070> out<00:00:32.430> what's<00:00:32.579> happening

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
time to really work out what's happening

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.979 
time to really work out what's happening
I<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.120> what<00:00:33.300> would<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.570> caused<00:00:33.840> that

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
I was like what would have caused that

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.410 
I was like what would have caused that
and<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.800> car<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.250> swapped<00:00:35.430> ends<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.880> me<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
and the car just swapped ends on me and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.150 
and the car just swapped ends on me and
sent<00:00:36.660> me<00:00:36.719> into<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> barrier<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.559> at<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
sent me into the barrier and at that

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.770 
sent me into the barrier and at that
stage<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:38.610> thinking<00:00:38.910> uh-oh<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.540> isn't

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
stage I was thinking uh-oh this isn't

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.250 
stage I was thinking uh-oh this isn't
good

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260

was a real shame to end the weekend like
that<00:01:40.320> because<00:01:40.560> now<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.890> car<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.400> basically<00:01:41.700> in

that because now the car is basically in

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.609 
that because now the car is basically in
pieces<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> we're<00:01:42.720> gonna<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> rebuild<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
pieces and we're gonna have to rebuild a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.530 
pieces and we're gonna have to rebuild a
new<00:01:43.799> one<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.610> Australia<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> next

new one to go to Australia for the next
race<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> most<00:01:46.500> important<00:01:46.979> thing<00:01:47.159> really

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
race but the most important thing really

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.340 
race but the most important thing really
is<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.759> you're<00:01:47.970> okay<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.600> mean<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.079> was<00:01:49.320> just

is that you're okay I mean it was just

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.499

amazing<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.280> survived<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.000> how<00:01:51.450> do

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
amazing that you survived that how do

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.450 
amazing that you survived that how do
you<00:01:51.630> reconcile<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.470> dangers<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.979> your<00:01:53.070> sport

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
you reconcile the dangers of your sport

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.300 
you reconcile the dangers of your sport
when<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.759> go<00:01:53.909> out<00:01:54.119> there<00:01:54.360> I'm<00:01:55.350> really<00:01:56.009> it's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
when you go out there I'm really it's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.740 
when you go out there I'm really it's
one<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.790> those<00:01:56.850> things<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
one of those things that you just have a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.359 
one of those things that you just have a
healthy<00:01:58.079> respect<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.500> but<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.009> put<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
healthy respect for but you put to the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.280 
healthy respect for but you put to the
back<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.640> your<00:01:59.729> mind<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.180> I<00:02:00.540> mean<00:02:01.049> you

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
back of your mind I think I mean you

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.370 
back of your mind I think I mean you
have<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.619> be<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.159> little<00:02:02.820> bit<00:02:03.170> different<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
have to be a little bit different to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.569 
have to be a little bit different to
drive<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> race<00:02:04.829> car<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.189> first<00:02:05.369> place

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
drive a race car in the first place

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.390 
drive a race car in the first place
because<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.210> dangerous

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
because it is dangerous

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.370 
because it is dangerous
it's<00:02:08.270> one<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.420> those<00:02:08.540> things<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.869> just<00:02:08.899> accept

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's one of those things you just accept

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.780 
it's one of those things you just accept
and<00:02:09.680> you<00:02:09.860> know<00:02:09.979> what<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.160> would<00:02:10.369> have<00:02:10.460> got<00:02:10.640> back

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
and you know what I would have got back

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.370 
and you know what I would have got back
in<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.000> racecar<00:02:11.210> and<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.900> would<00:02:12.050> have<00:02:12.140> finished

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
in a racecar and I would have finished

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.750 
in a racecar and I would have finished
the<00:02:12.470> race<00:02:12.500> if<00:02:12.830> they've<00:02:12.980> been<00:02:13.100> able<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.370> fix<00:02:13.580> it

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
the race if they've been able to fix it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.460 
the race if they've been able to fix it
but<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:13.970> really<00:02:14.240> don't<00:02:14.450> think<00:02:14.720> there<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:15.320> any

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
but I really don't think there was any

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.230 
but I really don't think there was any
hope<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:15.920> no<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:16.760> you're<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.000> only

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
hope of that no and you're the only

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.610 
hope of that no and you're the only
woman<00:02:17.390> out<00:02:17.660> there<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.050> do<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.230> feel<00:02:18.380> pressure

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
woman out there so do you feel pressure

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.200 
woman out there so do you feel pressure
to<00:02:18.890> just<00:02:19.040> get<00:02:19.280> right<00:02:19.490> back<00:02:19.700> in<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> car<00:02:20.180> and

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
to just get right back in the car and

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.160 
to just get right back in the car and
continue<00:02:20.960> on<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.700> little<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.850> guess<00:02:22.910> yeah<00:02:23.630> you

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
continue on a little I guess yeah you

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.660 
continue on a little I guess yeah you
know<00:02:24.290> nobody<00:02:24.590> wants<00:02:24.710> to<00:02:24.860> see<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.130> woman<00:02:25.490> get

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
know nobody wants to see a woman get

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.950 
know nobody wants to see a woman get
hurt<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:25.910> was<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.420> other<00:02:26.570> thing<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.810> was

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
hurt that was the other thing that was

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.750 
hurt that was the other thing that was
going<00:02:27.140> through<00:02:27.200> my<00:02:27.350> mind<00:02:27.620> but<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.280> think<00:02:28.520> now

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
going through my mind but I think now

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.670 
going through my mind but I think now
that<00:02:28.790> I've<00:02:29.030> proved<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.810> know<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.200> that's<00:02:30.470> no

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
that I've proved you know that that's no

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.850 
that I've proved you know that that's no
longer<00:02:30.710> I<00:02:31.010> worry<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.550> um<00:02:32.270> I<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.230> would<00:02:33.650> say<00:02:33.800> I'm

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
longer I worry so um I I would say I'm

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.230 
longer I worry so um I I would say I'm
just<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.160> any<00:02:34.310> other<00:02:34.460> racecar<00:02:34.880> driver<00:02:35.060> I'd

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
just like any other racecar driver I'd

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.850 
just like any other racecar driver I'd
try<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.480> behave<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.840> same<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:36.410> act<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.710> same

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
try and behave the same and act the same
