00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.260
 Today I want to take advantage of the opportunity 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.700
 to bring the pocher into the raincoat 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.309

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.379
 summer rain 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.170
 it's not too cold but natural 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.960
 So what do we need one for you? 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.099

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.720

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.839
 Brockmann is here on my case 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.160
 copy can already see the length 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:33.090
 Made in the old tradition of 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.640
 klepper mentally , this is 50 years ago 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.610
 still today with modern lightweight 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.130
 breathable materials 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.520
 is very nice so long so clearly 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.520
 over the knee 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.840
 not like the modern ones 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.030
 function jackets though a drop 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.990
 transition mass russian but here are 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.510

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.540
 well prepared the raincoat ford 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.460
 this is a long cut 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.729
 a nice two way zipper 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.290
 with whom he let himself close up 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.410
 so that also the karl protection and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.960
 Of course they had the next and 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.610
 Windbreak will do the whole thing 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.600
 can also make the zipper 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.490
 is protected 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.950
 the high-closing collar sits 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.740
 pleasant and who has in math potro too 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.479
 a hood that also face and head 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.940
 good enough protects well is also 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.570
 for big people like me this hood 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.640
 is optional on or unbuttoned 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.330
 with snaps if you can not 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.920
 you can therefore take it off 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.040
 I usually wear them as they certainly do 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.220
 just seen one can already 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.810

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.880
 Then I have the apartment is whole 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.600
 that's why I like to go without it 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.720
 hood 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.160
 the back has the raincoat dry 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.710
 Slit back through the crotch 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.020
 bigger, so I can do it too 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.670

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.390
 or completely original 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.130
 which also used by riders 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.340
 even if you are sitting on the horse 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:18.700
 you have a lot of freedom of movement 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.410
 open back slit below 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.670

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.670

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.879
