00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.390
 he is the boatman of the underworld who 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.610
 protects the river stygian flow mark 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.380
 the beginning of hell charged with 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.480
 take the souls to the court of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.380
 meic there are always and when these can 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.099
 pay the price 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.160
 the celestial star of space he is 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.150
 Akron's guarantor to close 2014 with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.980
 broches sab uriz 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.080
 in this car do box we will do a review 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.089
 of the figure of the handsome caron of 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.369
 aker on the most recent spectrum by 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:43.320
 leave under the line milk obviously 

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:45.570
 This piece will arrive in Mexico thanks to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.940
 Charon is one of the most 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.500
 extravagant of the whole saga of hades and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.260
 we can see that in its peculiar 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.479
 armor and his beautiful face almost 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.580
 as beautiful as frog jealousy this 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.710
 spectrum is the ferryman that transports 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.170
 the souls by the river stygia and they 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.269
 behaves more like a mercenary than as 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.010
 a soldier of hades his loves is 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.290
 inspired by the costumes worn by 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.390
 Italian harlequins or harlequins 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.150
 Venetian gondolas and in the Greek myth 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 of caronte that yes to be a specter 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.880
 that has a limited presence in the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.250
 encourage the figure 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.659
 pretty well detailed and it should be clarified 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.670
 that the piece with which we will do the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.259
 revision is a prototype so 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.659
 there is a possibility that you have 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.610
 some improvements pity that one of the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.710
 things we do not count on is the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.869
 packaging however being a figure 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.490
 is more and web exclusive surely 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.710
 It will be similar to the muse boxes of 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.319
 misty papillon of lizards to paris and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.270
 for or of sphinx the celestial spectrum 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.189
 of space is one of the most milk 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.840
 curious that have come to date and 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.909
 that some of the pieces of the armor 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.890
 do not seem to serve to protect the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.259
 user but merely for 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.479
 decoration let's start with the helmet that 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.549
 it's pretty rough and it brings a kind of 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.530
 protective lenses and as we mentioned 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.390
 previously it is inspired by the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.939
 burlesque clowns of comedy 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.280
 dell'arte however the most interesting 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.409
 is what is below the helmet I say 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.420
 look at that face is a face that only 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.369
 your mother might want the level of 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.170
 detail of this face is incredible already 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.299
 which is one of the weirdest faces of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.280
 everything is taught and reproduced at 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.810
 perfection in the figure also a 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.790
 super characteristic element of the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.069
 jesters are tassels or bells 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.760
 these are present in the helmet 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.519
 shoulder pads 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.500
 of arms a part of the val d'on 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.030
 shin guards and chrome bone boots 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.640
 I intentionally wanted you to chant 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.170
 It looks like a medieval clown and another detail 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.689
 that could not miss in the spectra 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.670
 celestial are the wings that in this south 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.680
 plis are formed by the boat of the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.110
 object that is not really the boat 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.599
 but some special rooms but in the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.099
 manga and anime if they are the boat something 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.959
 important is that the pieces of the 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.940
 forearms are put on the arm 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.579
 right since if you go wrong side 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.500
 it will be practically impossible for you to couple 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.420
 the hands of the figure the pieces of 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.670
 metal of the carronte armor are the 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.799
 shin guards the thighs the five 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.019
 the front skirt pieces the 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.120
 shoulder pads biceps protectors 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.950
 and the protectors of the forearms and 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.709
 the plastic parts are the protector 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.200
 of the belly the helmet and the two wings 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.540
 in addition to the hand protectors and 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.370
 the clownish details of the dolls and 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.950
 the additional elements of the boat and 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.079
 the oar are also plastic the click 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.750
 of the carnation serpent even if it is called 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.269
 What does not mean does not represent a 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.220
 river but to the boatman or his boat with 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.750
 everything and the rowing armor poses 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.850
 practically the same in hate 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.770
 and in the figure however you have to have 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.900
 Care when fitting the skirt 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.000
 since as he hears he is crossing the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.010
 legs you can vote the parts of 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.990
 forward from the waist out of that 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.030
 detail the logic of the serpent of aqueronte 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.860
 It is one of the best designed to 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.870
 moment the figure of charon 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.360
 he comes with two eight faces 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.070
 hands the gondola and the oar this is one 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.170
 of the micros with accessories more 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.660
 impressive since the barge it brings is 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.430
 quite big and is totally 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.470
 inspired by Venetian gondolas and 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.110
 a funny curiosity is that charon 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.090
 if it's Italian but not Venetian but from 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.310
 napoles also something that could not miss 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.650
 is the paddle he uses to paddle and 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.910
 to attack and execute the technique of 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.709
 rowling 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.540
 Charon is part of the micro line and 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.280
 It has the same joints that 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.230
 we can expect from this line to 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.000
 difference from the ex and the head has 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.950
 a ball joint at the base of the 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.140
 skull that allows you to rotate so 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.060
 spherical only when you bring the helmet 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.890
 put the long ornaments of it 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.990
 they limit the movement towards 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.090
 sides the shoulders have their set of 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.460
 ball and pivot to rotate and raise the 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.200
 three-dimensionally in the deltoids 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.680
 has the union that allows you to rotate the 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.570
 arm 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.020
 its own axis and the elbows are pivots 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.100
 doubles to move biceps and forearms 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.840
 independently the dolls also 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.789
 they move a lot but the truth is 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.830
 pretty limited by the ornaments of the 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.720
 protector of the forearms so much so 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.880
 that in trying to achieve certain voices 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.280
 you can be enough leverage 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.740
 that the hand is voted something that turned out to be 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.419
 little frustrating when posing the figure the 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.220
 torso the truth does not have much mobility 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.380
 since the armor is quite rigid 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.270
 however the hip if it has a little 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.280
 of freedom to turn slightly towards 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.560
 the sides the legs have a 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.690
 ball and pivot juncture at the base of 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.639
 the hip to rotate them and lift them and 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.530
 the knees are like the elbows with 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.220
 double pivots for the thighs and 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.229
 pimples 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.599
 finally the ankles have a lot 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.430
 mobility to three different sides but the 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.199
 shape of the shin guards can get 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.300
 to limit the lateral turn of the feet 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.550
 also has the pivot at the tip of the 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.050
 foot to flex the spectrum 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.699
 Charon is one of the most 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.800
 recent of the micro line 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.300
 so as for other spectra 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.550
 of the new generations of happiness 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.199
 line its capacity of poses is very high 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.479
 obviously this is because the 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.220
 spectrum has 32 joints in 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.560
 the body and has a stature of 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.090
 about 16 centimeters a 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.950
 inconvenience that occurs in the 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.840
 armor are the shoulder pads since these 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.790
 they do not allow a wide movement towards 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.650
 up the arms out of that 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.210
 detail you can really pose 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.400
 many ways since rowing and 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.650
 gondola allow to put it in many 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.450
 quite interesting situations being 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.820
 that Charon did not have much stellarity in 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.530
 the saga of hades and had a battle 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.200
 pretty strong with the character 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.570
 main she of pegasus and how we have 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.460
 the version and ex of this character 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.110
 We could recreate a battle between 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.880
 Spectrum and the Knight of Athens 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.620
 also the figure of caronte can 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.960
 effect your attack more 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.210
 mighty without the oar the wild neat being 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.830
 d 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.199
 the spectrum is about the size 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.060
 average of the microphones and when 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:31.550
 positioned beside me or papillon 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.220
 we can see that the helmet gives a lot 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.560
 more height however the micros and ex 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.720
 they are still higher and do not even say 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.880
 the new line even law in that of 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.639
 plane leaves down almost all the others 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.009
 figures but as expected and still 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.630
 when it's from the little micros 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:49.880
 height is still above 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.009
 several of the lines of figures and only 8 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.050
 joaquin the figure of Charon left 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:57.650
 arrive in Mexico between March and April 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.720
 2015 and will have a cost of one thousand 450 pesos 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.400
