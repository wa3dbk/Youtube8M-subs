00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
for so real quick you roll the die you

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.580 
for so real quick you roll the die you
end<00:02:07.070> up<00:02:07.250> with<00:02:07.520> just<00:02:08.090> well<00:02:08.479> if<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:08.990> get<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.350> if

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
end up with just well if you get this if

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.930 
end up with just well if you get this if
you<00:02:09.649> give<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.890> volcano<00:02:10.280> you're<00:02:10.580> not<00:02:10.729> gonna

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
you give the volcano you're not gonna

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.200 
you give the volcano you're not gonna
actually<00:02:11.180> take<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:11.990> add<00:02:12.740> to<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.790> volcano

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
actually take and add to the volcano

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.320 
actually take and add to the volcano
itself<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.140> my<00:02:15.830> boys<00:02:16.100> love<00:02:16.700> putting<00:02:17.180> the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
itself and my boys love putting the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.770 
itself and my boys love putting the
stick

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
stick

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.980 
stick
so<00:02:18.020> this<00:02:18.170> volcano<00:02:18.800> starts<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.600> starts<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.780> blow

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
so this volcano starts to starts to blow

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.590 
so this volcano starts to starts to blow
up<00:02:21.170> starts<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.010> burst<00:02:22.310> that's<00:02:23.210> gonna<00:02:23.390> be<00:02:23.570> a

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
up starts to burst that's gonna be a

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.410 
up starts to burst that's gonna be a
problem<00:02:23.900> well<00:02:24.710> okay<00:02:25.340> there<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.610> is<00:02:25.700> all<00:02:26.300> right

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
problem well okay there it is all right

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.700 
problem well okay there it is all right
but<00:02:26.540> let's<00:02:26.660> say<00:02:26.840> it's<00:02:26.990> my<00:02:27.170> turn

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
but let's say it's my turn

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.730 
but let's say it's my turn
I<00:02:27.740> can<00:02:28.250> roll<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.970> get<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.150> two<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:30.200> move<00:02:30.320> any

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
I can roll I get a two I can move any

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.350 
I can roll I get a two I can move any
one<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.010> these<00:02:31.190> dinosaurs<00:02:31.460> I<00:02:31.910> want<00:02:32.120> now<00:02:32.300> the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
one of these dinosaurs I want now the

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.300 
one of these dinosaurs I want now the
goal<00:02:32.720> they<00:02:33.410> all<00:02:33.560> start<00:02:33.920> on<00:02:34.010> their<00:02:34.190> little

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
goal they all start on their little

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.650 
goal they all start on their little
footprints<00:02:34.910> by<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.090> way<00:02:35.240> I'm<00:02:35.330> going<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.510> leave

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
footprints by the way I'm going to leave

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.990 
footprints by the way I'm going to leave
them<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:35.870> their<00:02:36.050> sides<00:02:36.350> here<00:02:36.770> just<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.850> can

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
them on their sides here just so you can

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.750 
them on their sides here just so you can
see<00:02:38.240> them<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.750> whew<00:02:39.260> okay

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
see them and whew okay

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.970 
see them and whew okay
so<00:02:41.240> they<00:02:41.390> all<00:02:41.510> start<00:02:41.780> there<00:02:42.020> the<00:02:42.530> goal<00:02:42.709> is<00:02:42.830> to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
so they all start there the goal is to

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.100 
so they all start there the goal is to
simply<00:02:43.310> move<00:02:43.520> and<00:02:43.850> once<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.150> get<00:02:44.330> into<00:02:44.540> like

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
simply move and once you get into like

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.440 
simply move and once you get into like
their<00:02:45.380> temperate<00:02:45.800> zone<00:02:46.040> you<00:02:46.580> can<00:02:46.610> pick<00:02:47.120> one<00:02:47.330> of

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
their temperate zone you can pick one of

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.820 
their temperate zone you can pick one of
these<00:02:47.570> reveal<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.410> group<00:02:48.620> that's

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
these reveal it to the group that's

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.010 
these reveal it to the group that's
cooperative<00:02:49.370> game<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:50.180> idea<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.570> to<00:02:50.780> find

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
cooperative game the idea is to find

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.970 
cooperative game the idea is to find
your<00:02:51.800> dinosaurs<00:02:52.459> matching<00:02:53.390> picture<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.110> once

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
your dinosaurs matching picture and once

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.360 
your dinosaurs matching picture and once
you<00:02:55.160> do<00:02:55.540> they<00:02:56.540> are<00:02:57.110> joined<00:02:57.770> on<00:02:58.010> this<00:02:58.160> little

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
you do they are joined on this little

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.300 
you do they are joined on this little
island<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.120> they<00:02:59.270> get<00:02:59.450> to<00:02:59.630> escape<00:03:00.190> from<00:03:01.190> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
island and they get to escape from the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.699 
island and they get to escape from the
volcano<00:03:01.700> so<00:03:02.540> if<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.840> came<00:03:02.900> on<00:03:03.110> here<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.500> could

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
volcano so if I came on here I could

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.199 
volcano so if I came on here I could
simply<00:03:04.070> pick<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.489> say<00:03:04.640> well<00:03:04.820> there<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.180> go

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
simply pick and say well there we go

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.300 
simply pick and say well there we go
whoops<00:03:05.690> well<00:03:06.080> that's<00:03:06.350> not<00:03:06.560> going<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.800> be<00:03:06.950> him

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
whoops well that's not going to be him

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.460 
whoops well that's not going to be him
but<00:03:08.000> now<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.180> know<00:03:08.360> as<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:09.140> move<00:03:09.320> around

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
but now I know as I move around

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.250 
but now I know as I move around
clockwise<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:11.030> little<00:03:11.360> fellas<00:03:11.750> definitely

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
clockwise this little fellas definitely

clockwise this little fellas definitely
gonna<00:03:12.380> want<00:03:12.620> to<00:03:12.739> get<00:03:12.860> in<00:03:12.980> here<00:03:13.310> flip<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.090> over

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
gonna want to get in here flip that over

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.970 
gonna want to get in here flip that over
and<00:03:14.420> what<00:03:14.660> he<00:03:14.750> does<00:03:14.989> boom<00:03:15.800> they<00:03:16.730> won't<00:03:16.970> end<00:03:17.180> up

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
and what he does boom they won't end up

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.199 
and what he does boom they won't end up
down<00:03:18.980> here<00:03:19.280> now<00:03:19.520> again<00:03:19.640> II<00:03:19.790> would<00:03:19.970> have<00:03:20.120> to

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
down here now again II would have to

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.880 
down here now again II would have to
come<00:03:20.360> all<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.570> way<00:03:20.660> up<00:03:20.840> but<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.680> would<00:03:21.799> be

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
come all the way up but that would be

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.580 
come all the way up but that would be
the<00:03:22.010> idea<00:03:22.660> there's<00:03:23.660> some<00:03:23.840> things<00:03:24.110> most<00:03:24.440> of

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
the idea there's some things most of

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.620 
the idea there's some things most of
these<00:03:24.739> are<00:03:24.950> benign<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.610> there's<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.209> shell

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
these are benign a there's a shell

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.120 
these are benign a there's a shell
little<00:03:27.049> prehistoric<00:03:27.560> shell<00:03:27.799> means

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
little prehistoric shell means

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.190 
little prehistoric shell means
absolutely<00:03:28.580> nothing<00:03:28.700> here's<00:03:29.690> a<00:03:29.780> little<00:03:29.989> bunch

the t-rex all the dinosaurs have to move
back<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:50.209> if<00:03:50.299> he<00:03:50.450> was<00:03:50.600> here<00:03:51.049> they<00:03:51.260> all<00:03:51.410> have<00:03:51.590> to

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
back so if he was here they all have to

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.370 
back so if he was here they all have to
move<00:03:51.950> back<00:03:52.310> towards<00:03:53.000> the<00:03:53.299> closest<00:03:53.810> footprint

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
move back towards the closest footprint

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.840 
move back towards the closest footprint
that<00:03:54.530> they'd<00:03:54.709> be<00:03:54.860> on<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.220> just<00:03:55.400> backs<00:03:55.640> him

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
that they'd be on so it just backs him

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.240 
that they'd be on so it just backs him
up<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.090> little<00:03:56.269> bit<00:03:56.480> but<00:03:57.049> it's<00:03:57.170> simply<00:03:57.680> a<00:03:57.709> memory

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
up a little bit but it's simply a memory

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.130 
up a little bit but it's simply a memory
game<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.940> then<00:03:59.060> trying<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.510> get<00:03:59.750> them<00:03:59.930> on

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
game and then trying to get them on

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.420 
game and then trying to get them on
there<00:04:00.470> before<00:04:01.299> this<00:04:02.299> volcano<00:04:02.840> is<00:04:03.430> completely

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
there before this volcano is completely

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.810 
there before this volcano is completely
built<00:04:04.730> all<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.600> way<00:04:05.720> up<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.230> top<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:06.980> once

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
built all the way up to the top and once

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.380 
built all the way up to the top and once
it<00:04:08.000> is<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.570> get<00:04:08.750> this<00:04:08.989> super<00:04:09.440> cool<00:04:10.000> boom<00:04:11.000> now

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
it is you get this super cool boom now

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.090 
it is you get this super cool boom now
of<00:04:11.540> course<00:04:11.810> you've<00:04:12.049> got<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.260> lot<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.620> randomness

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
of course you've got a lot of randomness

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.400 
of course you've got a lot of randomness
because<00:04:13.489> it's<00:04:13.880> simply<00:04:14.209> a<00:04:14.239> die<00:04:14.510> roll<00:04:14.570> but<00:04:15.019> check

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
because it's simply a die roll but check

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.050 
because it's simply a die roll but check
this<00:04:15.560> out<00:04:15.739> I've<00:04:15.980> always<00:04:16.250> loved<00:04:16.459> this<00:04:16.609> volcano

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
blows if you do not get all three of the

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.420 
blows if you do not get all three of the
dinosaurs<00:04:20.450> rescued<00:04:21.079> off<00:04:21.320> to<00:04:21.979> this<00:04:22.130> nice
