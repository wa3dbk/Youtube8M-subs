ps3's<00:00:10.060> we<00:00:10.600> started<00:00:10.870> folding<00:00:11.080> online<00:00:12.360> using

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
ps3's we started folding online using

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.360 
ps3's we started folding online using
the<00:00:13.540> playstation<00:00:14.200> network<00:00:14.230> scan<00:00:15.220> from

that's an awful lot of research that's

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.510 
that's an awful lot of research that's
about<00:01:19.000> 50<00:01:19.630> plus<00:01:20.080> thousand<00:01:20.740> folding<00:01:21.130> units

and we've completed the ps3s were a

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.580 
and we've completed the ps3s were a
great<00:01:27.250> idea<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.900> know<00:01:29.020> they're<00:01:29.320> an<00:01:29.470> easy

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
great idea you know they're an easy
