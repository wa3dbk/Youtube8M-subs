of like freightliner and volvo and I
think<00:03:24.430> CAD<00:03:24.640> one<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:25.720> they're<00:03:26.080> like<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.230> mutant

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
think CAD one so they're like a mutant

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.120 
think CAD one so they're like a mutant
truck<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:28.570> anyways<00:03:29.400> here's<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.519> cab<00:03:32.130> these

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
truck so anyways here's the cab these

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.310 
truck so anyways here's the cab these
are<00:03:33.280> really<00:03:33.400> old<00:03:33.750> that's<00:03:34.750> where<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:34.959> sleeper

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
are really old that's where the sleeper

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.660 
are really old that's where the sleeper
would<00:03:35.470> be<00:03:35.620> but<00:03:35.800> they've<00:03:35.920> got<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.130> bench<00:03:36.400> for

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
would be but they've got a bench for

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.210 
would be but they've got a bench for
training<00:03:37.030> purposes<00:03:37.650> I'll<00:03:38.650> explain<00:03:38.769> some<00:03:39.190> of

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
training purposes I'll explain some of

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.630 
training purposes I'll explain some of
this<00:03:39.400> stuff<00:03:39.640> these<00:03:40.180> two<00:03:40.420> here<00:03:40.660> are<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:42.310> air

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
this stuff these two here are the air

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.270 
this stuff these two here are the air
brakes<00:03:42.970> if<00:03:43.180> i<00:03:43.269> push<00:03:43.480> these<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:44.080> it<00:03:44.590> releases

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
brakes if i push these in it releases

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.550 
brakes if i push these in it releases
the<00:03:45.310> tractor<00:03:45.940> bricks<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:46.510> basically<00:03:47.350> it's

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
the tractor bricks and basically it's

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.780 
the tractor bricks and basically it's
like<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.709> big<00:03:47.860> e<00:03:48.010> brake<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.340> car<00:03:48.370> won't<00:03:48.730> go

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
like a big e brake the car won't go

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.940 
like a big e brake the car won't go
anywhere<00:03:49.000> won't<00:03:49.330> go<00:03:49.390> anywhere<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:50.440> clutch

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
anywhere won't go anywhere a clutch

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.910 
anywhere won't go anywhere a clutch
pedal<00:03:51.340> brake<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:52.420> this<00:03:53.080> is<00:03:53.230> the<00:03:53.380> accelerator

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
pedal brake and this is the accelerator

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.500 
pedal brake and this is the accelerator
it's<00:03:54.100> not<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.430> gas<00:03:54.610> pedal<00:03:54.850> because<00:03:55.180> we<00:03:55.300> don't

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
it's not the gas pedal because we don't

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.320 
it's not the gas pedal because we don't
use<00:03:55.720> gas<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.400> your<00:03:57.519> air<00:03:57.670> pressure<00:03:58.000> right

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
use gas this is your air pressure right

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.720 
use gas this is your air pressure right
here<00:03:58.360> it<00:03:59.290> goes<00:03:59.440> below<00:03:59.620> 60<00:04:00.130> warning<00:04:00.400> light<00:04:00.550> goes

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
here it goes below 60 warning light goes

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.080 
here it goes below 60 warning light goes
on<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.120> goes<00:04:01.300> below<00:04:01.480> 30<00:04:02.430> these<00:04:03.430> pop<00:04:03.700> out<00:04:03.910> and

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
on it goes below 30 these pop out and

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.890 
on it goes below 30 these pop out and
don't<00:04:04.330> go<00:04:04.450> anywhere<00:04:05.670> transmission<00:04:06.670> 29<00:04:07.570> speed

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
don't go anywhere transmission 29 speed

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.449 
don't go anywhere transmission 29 speed
I<00:04:07.930> think<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.290> gear<00:04:08.500> ratio<00:04:08.650> is<00:04:08.980> right<00:04:09.160> up<00:04:09.280> here

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
I think the gear ratio is right up here

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.990 
I think the gear ratio is right up here
in<00:04:09.580> this<00:04:09.670> window<00:04:10.170> yeah<00:04:11.170> if<00:04:11.470> their<00:04:11.760> CV<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:12.910> we

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
in this window yeah if their CV that we

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.449 
in this window yeah if their CV that we
don't<00:04:13.120> use<00:04:13.799> blank<00:04:14.799> when<00:04:14.950> doesn't<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.250> one

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
don't use blank when doesn't this one

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.610 
don't use blank when doesn't this one
really<00:04:15.790> crappy<00:04:16.209> air<00:04:16.330> right<00:04:16.540> seat<00:04:16.840> ignition

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
really crappy air right seat ignition

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.699 
really crappy air right seat ignition
push<00:04:17.919> button<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.280> started<00:04:18.900> no<00:04:19.900> truck<00:04:20.560> the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
truck a guess mirrors the plane near

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.640 
truck a guess mirrors the plane near
west<00:04:25.539> coast<00:04:25.750> mirror<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.169> then

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
west coast mirror and then

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.800 
west coast mirror and then
convex<00:04:26.949> and<00:04:27.190> then<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.400> vendor<00:04:28.360> mirrors<00:04:28.600> then

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
convex and then the vendor mirrors then

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.180 
convex and then the vendor mirrors then
those<00:04:28.930> are<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.199> fire<00:04:29.590> trucks<00:04:29.889> that<00:04:29.979> I<00:04:30.070> was

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
those are the fire trucks that I was

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.370 
those are the fire trucks that I was
telling<00:04:30.310> you<00:04:30.550> about<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.910> out<00:04:31.000> there<00:04:31.210> that<00:04:31.419> kind

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
telling you about it out there that kind

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.950 
telling you about it out there that kind
of<00:04:32.410> fun<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.560> watch<00:04:32.740> when<00:04:32.919> they<00:04:33.040> mess<00:04:33.190> around<00:04:33.310> so

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
of fun to watch when they mess around so

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.330 
of fun to watch when they mess around so
these<00:04:34.960> are<00:04:35.110> this<00:04:35.229> and<00:04:35.440> maybe<00:04:35.710> I'll<00:04:35.860> be<00:04:35.979> get<00:04:36.310> a

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
these are this and maybe I'll be get a

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.740 
these are this and maybe I'll be get a
chance<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.759> can<00:04:36.850> do<00:04:36.940> one<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.210> Volvo's<00:04:37.570> and

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
chance you can do one of the Volvo's and

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.969 
chance you can do one of the Volvo's and
show<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:37.930> what<00:04:38.020> those<00:04:38.169> look<00:04:38.320> like<00:04:38.380> if<00:04:38.740> Scott's

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
show you what those look like if Scott's

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.920 
show you what those look like if Scott's
driving<00:04:39.370> down<00:04:39.490> at<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.639> pit<00:04:39.850> so<00:04:40.120> we'll<00:04:40.720> go<00:04:40.810> down

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
driving down at the pit so we'll go down

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.199 
driving down at the pit so we'll go down
there<00:04:41.020> next
