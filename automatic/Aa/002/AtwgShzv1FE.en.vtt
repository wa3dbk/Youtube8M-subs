you can see a girl I barely get about 20

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.610 
you can see a girl I barely get about 20
frames<00:02:12.880> per<00:02:13.150> second<00:02:13.570> so<00:02:13.720> this<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.079> not<00:02:14.320> going

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
frames per second so this is not going

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.180 
frames per second so this is not going
to<00:02:14.920> run<00:02:15.160> smoothly<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.350> particular

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.150 

settings<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.430> for<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.209> going<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.290> okay<00:02:23.769> not

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
settings and for that going to okay not

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.759 
settings and for that going to okay not
this<00:02:24.370> one<00:02:25.799> going<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:27.010> go<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.220> options<00:02:27.910> and

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
this one going to go to options and

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.830 
this one going to go to options and
trimmed<00:02:29.769> out<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.160> details<00:02:30.579> a<00:02:30.700> bit<00:02:30.730> only<00:02:31.540> going

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
trimmed out the details a bit only going

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.030 
trimmed out the details a bit only going
to<00:02:32.079> set<00:02:32.829> them<00:02:33.040> on<00:02:33.220> advanced<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:35.739> think<00:02:35.950> the

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
to set them on advanced and I think the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.550 
to set them on advanced and I think the
game<00:02:36.250> will<00:02:36.489> be<00:02:36.730> running<00:02:37.660> better<00:02:38.049> right<00:02:38.350> now

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
game will be running better right now

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.860 
game will be running better right now
let's<00:02:39.280> see<00:02:41.640> okay<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.120> advanced<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:43.750> I

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
let's see okay so this is advanced and I

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.470 
let's see okay so this is advanced and I
have<00:02:44.319> about<00:02:44.530> 30<00:02:44.829> frames<00:02:45.160> per<00:02:45.250> second<00:02:45.730> which<00:02:46.299> is

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
have about 30 frames per second which is

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.699 
have about 30 frames per second which is
definitely<00:02:46.660> quite<00:02:47.350> quite<00:02:48.190> good

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:01.170 

okay<00:02:56.790> traveling<00:02:57.790> around<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.330> think<00:02:58.690> out<00:03:00.180> okay

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
okay traveling around I think out okay

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:11.610 
okay traveling around I think out okay
so<00:03:01.239> there<00:03:01.629> are<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.900> enemies<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.379> can<00:03:11.500> see

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
so there are the enemies and you can see

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.440 
so there are the enemies and you can see
that<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.860> game<00:03:12.099> is<00:03:12.250> actually<00:03:12.640> running<00:03:12.910> very

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
that the game is actually running very

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:23.240 
that the game is actually running very
nicely

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.570 

of<00:03:24.250> course<00:03:24.550> I'm<00:03:24.760> playing<00:03:25.060> on<00:03:26.580> preclude

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
of course I'm playing on preclude

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.520 
of course I'm playing on preclude
difficulty<00:03:28.210> level<00:03:28.570> because<00:03:28.930> I'm<00:03:29.170> not<00:03:29.350> really

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
difficulty level because I'm not really

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.010 
difficulty level because I'm not really
that<00:03:29.770> good<00:03:30.010> at<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.250> game<00:03:30.510> but<00:03:31.510> what's

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
that good at the game but what's

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.810 
that good at the game but what's
important<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.710> see<00:03:32.890> here<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:33.250> that<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.580> game

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
important to see here is that the game

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.040 
important to see here is that the game
runs<00:03:34.210> runs<00:03:35.020> nicely<00:03:35.410> and<00:03:36.840> I've<00:03:37.840> actually

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
runs runs nicely and I've actually

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.110 
runs runs nicely and I've actually
played<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:38.710> for<00:03:38.770> a<00:03:39.040> couple<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.400> hours<00:03:39.820> and

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
played this for a couple of hours and

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.770 
played this for a couple of hours and
everything<00:03:40.780> seems<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.200> be<00:03:41.350> working<00:03:42.000> fine<00:03:43.000> with

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
everything seems to be working fine with

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.510 
everything seems to be working fine with
it<00:03:43.950> but<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:47.170> device<00:03:47.410> is<00:03:47.620> going<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:47.980> get<00:03:48.190> quite

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
it but the device is going to get quite

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.630 
it but the device is going to get quite
hot<00:03:48.550> when<00:03:49.300> playing<00:03:49.630> this<00:03:49.900> game<00:03:50.140> and<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:53.230> might

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
hot when playing this game and it might

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.850 
hot when playing this game and it might
sometimes<00:03:54.640> even<00:03:55.360> dropped<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.959> little<00:03:56.350> bit<00:03:56.560> but

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
sometimes even dropped a little bit but

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.940 
sometimes even dropped a little bit but
I<00:03:57.370> can't<00:03:58.209> really<00:03:58.360> say<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:58.959> for<00:03:59.200> sure

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.550 

the<00:04:05.879> second<00:04:06.239> game<00:04:06.390> we're<00:04:06.599> trying<00:04:06.930> actually<00:04:07.530> I

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
the second game we're trying actually I

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.380 
the second game we're trying actually I
think<00:04:07.650> it's<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.040> third<00:04:08.400> it's<00:04:08.819> dirt<00:04:09.390> 3<00:04:11.390> the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
think it's the third it's dirt 3 the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.509 
think it's the third it's dirt 3 the
third<00:04:12.569> game<00:04:12.780> we're<00:04:12.959> trying<00:04:13.260> here<00:04:13.560> it's<00:04:13.830> dirt<00:04:14.190> 3

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
third game we're trying here it's dirt 3

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.360 
third game we're trying here it's dirt 3
and<00:04:14.760> it's<00:04:15.450> running<00:04:15.750> smoothly<00:04:16.680> on<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.160> one

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and it's running smoothly on this one

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.520 
and it's running smoothly on this one
once<00:04:17.850> again<00:04:18.000> we're<00:04:18.359> at<00:04:18.510> highest<00:04:18.810> levels<00:04:19.410> of

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
once again we're at highest levels of

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.979 
once again we're at highest levels of
details<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.579> full<00:04:20.820> HD<00:04:21.150> resolution<00:04:21.209> and

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
details and the full HD resolution and

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.080 
details and the full HD resolution and
game<00:04:23.240> runs<00:04:24.240> with<00:04:24.600> about<00:04:24.900> 50<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:26.100> 60<00:04:26.580> frames<00:04:27.000> per

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
game runs with about 50 to 60 frames per

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.300 
game runs with about 50 to 60 frames per
second<00:04:27.570> which<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:27.810> actually<00:04:28.139> very<00:04:28.410> very<00:04:28.860> good

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
second which is actually very very good

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.600 
second which is actually very very good
so<00:04:29.880> you'll<00:04:30.060> be<00:04:30.240> able<00:04:30.270> to<00:04:30.479> play<00:04:30.600> this<00:04:30.960> game<00:04:31.200> on

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
so you'll be able to play this game on

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:42.040 
so you'll be able to play this game on
the<00:04:32.610> Z<00:04:33.030> on<00:04:33.270> the<00:04:33.510> you<00:04:33.630> 500<00:04:34.290> load<00:04:34.470> any<00:04:34.680> problems

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.379 

ok<00:04:43.050> so<00:04:43.110> we're<00:04:43.680> with<00:04:44.010> another<00:04:44.220> came<00:04:44.669> here<00:04:45.030> with

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
ok so we're with another came here with

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.740 
ok so we're with another came here with
need<00:04:46.050> for<00:04:46.320> speed<00:04:46.620> unleashed<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.880> once<00:04:48.600> again

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
need for speed unleashed to once again

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.140 
need for speed unleashed to once again

highest level of details Full HD
resolution<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:55.160> playing<00:04:56.160> this<00:04:56.310> quick<00:04:56.580> race

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
resolution and playing this quick race

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.350 
resolution and playing this quick race
everything<00:04:57.930> seems<00:04:58.200> to<00:04:58.260> be<00:04:58.350> working<00:04:58.500> fine

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
everything seems to be working fine

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.530 
everything seems to be working fine
about<00:05:00.470> 40<00:05:01.470> frames<00:05:01.710> per<00:05:01.979> second<00:05:02.400> which<00:05:03.180> does

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
about 40 frames per second which does

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:11.000 
about 40 frames per second which does
sound<00:05:03.930> quite<00:05:04.200> quite<00:05:05.040> nice

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:21.430 

ok<00:05:12.010> I<00:05:12.040> should<00:05:12.340> give<00:05:12.580> this<00:05:12.760> on<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.210> track

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.260 

all<00:05:21.590> right<00:05:21.800> after<00:05:22.190> playing<00:05:22.460> all<00:05:22.760> these<00:05:22.970> games

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
all right after playing all these games

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.000 
all right after playing all these games
it<00:05:23.570> seems<00:05:23.930> like<00:05:24.490> the<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:27.260> temperatures<00:05:27.770> have

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
it seems like the the temperatures have

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.550 
it seems like the the temperatures have
a<00:05:28.070> risin<00:05:28.730> that<00:05:29.060> much<00:05:29.360> I<00:05:29.630> mean<00:05:29.780> they<00:05:30.200> will<00:05:30.410> get

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
a risin that much I mean they will get

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.160 
a risin that much I mean they will get
to<00:05:30.770> about<00:05:31.010> 90<00:05:31.790> degrees<00:05:31.820> after<00:05:32.480> this<00:05:32.810> quick

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
to about 90 degrees after this quick

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.910 
to about 90 degrees after this quick
gaming<00:05:34.130> session<00:05:34.550> for<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.180> CPUs<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:35.960> let's

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
gaming session for the CPUs and let's

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.090 
gaming session for the CPUs and let's
see<00:05:37.040> for<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.370> GPU<00:05:37.850> so<00:05:38.180> above<00:05:38.930> 80<00:05:39.380> a<00:05:39.680> little<00:05:39.980> bit

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
see for the GPU so above 80 a little bit

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.190 
see for the GPU so above 80 a little bit
above<00:05:40.400> 80<00:05:40.730> which<00:05:41.570> is<00:05:41.600> actually<00:05:42.170> all<00:05:42.350> right<00:05:43.120> and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
above 80 which is actually all right and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.900 
above 80 which is actually all right and
the<00:05:45.200> temperatures<00:05:45.710> for<00:05:46.010> the<00:05:46.160> other<00:05:46.400> parts<00:05:46.820> of

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
the temperatures for the other parts of

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.470 
the temperatures for the other parts of
the<00:05:46.970> computer<00:05:47.570> mean<00:05:47.810> the<00:05:48.290> PCH<00:05:49.130> will<00:05:49.610> get<00:05:49.820> to<00:05:50.000> 79

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
the computer mean the PCH will get to 79

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.800 
the computer mean the PCH will get to 79
degrees<00:05:50.870> and<00:05:51.440> hard<00:05:52.220> drives<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:52.760> about<00:05:53.030> 50

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
degrees and hard drives to about 50

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.410 
degrees and hard drives to about 50
which<00:05:54.560> is<00:05:54.740> all<00:05:55.100> right<00:05:55.460> overall<00:05:55.970> it's<00:05:56.270> not

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
which is all right overall it's not

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.630 
which is all right overall it's not
really<00:05:56.990> of<00:05:57.350> course<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.770> device<00:05:57.980> not<00:05:58.280> really

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
really of course the device not really

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.480 
really of course the device not really
running<00:05:58.850> cool<00:05:59.390> but<00:05:59.720> I<00:06:00.080> was<00:06:00.470> pushing<00:06:00.890> it<00:06:01.010> I<00:06:01.310> was

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
running cool but I was pushing it I was

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.270 
running cool but I was pushing it I was
playing<00:06:01.760> all<00:06:02.000> bunch<00:06:02.240> of<00:06:02.450> games<00:06:02.720> and<00:06:03.220> they<00:06:04.220> were

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
playing all bunch of games and they were

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.360 
playing all bunch of games and they were
all<00:06:04.750> played<00:06:05.750> at<00:06:05.990> maximum<00:06:06.440> resolution<00:06:06.770> at<00:06:07.160> the
