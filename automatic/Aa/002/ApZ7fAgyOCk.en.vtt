the<00:00:05.940> brain<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.299> one<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.600> most<00:00:06.930> important

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the brain is one of the most important

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.350 
the brain is one of the most important
parts<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.859> our<00:00:08.040> nervous<00:00:08.250> system<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.059> today

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
parts of our nervous system and today

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.940 
parts of our nervous system and today
we're<00:00:09.540> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> go<00:00:09.870> over<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.260> various<00:00:10.590> parts

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
we're going to go over the various parts

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.129 
we're going to go over the various parts
of<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.340> brain<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.880> talk<00:00:12.059> about<00:00:12.240> some<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
of the brain and talk about some of the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.379 
of the brain and talk about some of the
ways<00:00:13.290> they<00:00:13.530> contribute<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.280> help<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
ways they contribute and help in the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.000 
ways they contribute and help in the
areas<00:00:15.719> over<00:00:15.960> which<00:00:16.170> that<00:00:16.199> part<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.770> our<00:00:16.859> brain

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
areas over which that part of our brain

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.040 
areas over which that part of our brain
control<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.300> we're<00:00:18.390> gonna<00:00:18.480> begin<00:00:18.660> then<00:00:19.020> with

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
control so we're gonna begin then with

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.529

we<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> parietal<00:00:32.279> lobe<00:00:32.460> which<00:00:32.940> receives

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
we have the parietal lobe which receives

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.819 
we have the parietal lobe which receives
sensory<00:00:33.930> information<00:00:34.200> from<00:00:34.620> touch

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829

proprioception which has to do with our

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.049 
proprioception which has to do with our
ability<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.010> tell<00:00:41.280> where<00:00:41.489> our<00:00:41.610> arms<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.000> legs

this<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.170> proprioception<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:51.180> parietal<00:00:51.420> lobe

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
this is proprioception the parietal lobe

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
this is proprioception the parietal lobe
helps<00:00:52.050> govern<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.680> also<00:00:52.920> our<00:00:53.579> sensation<00:00:54.329> of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
helps govern that also our sensation of

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.830 
helps govern that also our sensation of

the nerve pathways to the brain come
through<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.549> brainstem<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:31.530> finally

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
thalamus and hypothalamus the thalamus

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200 
thalamus and hypothalamus the thalamus
helps<00:01:40.560> integrate<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.340> relay<00:01:41.700> sensory

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
helps integrate and relay sensory

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.870 
helps integrate and relay sensory
information<00:01:42.329> from<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.200> face<00:01:43.880> feelings

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
information from the face feelings

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.600 
information from the face feelings
they're<00:01:45.149> our<00:01:45.450> retinas<00:01:45.960> our<00:01:46.500> cochlea<00:01:47.009> from<00:01:47.460> our

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
they're our retinas our cochlea from our

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.609 
they're our retinas our cochlea from our
ears<00:01:47.880> our<00:01:48.360> taste<00:01:49.020> receptors<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.189> interprets

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
ears our taste receptors and interprets

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.020 
ears our taste receptors and interprets
sensation<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.740> touch<00:01:52.979> pain<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.610> temperature

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
sensation of touch pain and temperature

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.330 
sensation of touch pain and temperature
so<00:01:54.240> our<00:01:54.329> thalamus<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.840> very<00:01:55.020> important<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.590> not

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so our thalamus is very important to not

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.020 
so our thalamus is very important to not
only<00:01:56.549> our<00:01:57.329> sense<00:01:58.170> of<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:58.920> feel<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.729> terms

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
only our sense of what we feel in terms

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.260 
only our sense of what we feel in terms
of<00:02:00.270> paying<00:02:00.450> temperature<00:02:01.079> touch<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.490> also<00:02:02.520> our

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
of paying temperature touch but also our

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.510 
of paying temperature touch but also our
retinas<00:02:03.659> our<00:02:04.020> eyes<00:02:04.259> our<00:02:04.649> cochlea<00:02:05.070> in<00:02:05.159> our<00:02:05.310> ears

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
retinas our eyes our cochlea in our ears

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.649 
retinas our eyes our cochlea in our ears
and<00:02:05.909> taste<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.930> our<00:02:07.049> tongue
