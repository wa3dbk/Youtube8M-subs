like<00:00:13.240> that<00:00:13.299> I've<00:00:13.620> went<00:00:14.620> away<00:00:14.740> right<00:00:15.219> after<00:00:15.490> I

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
like that I've went away right after I

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.980 
like that I've went away right after I
uploaded<00:00:15.879> it<00:00:16.030> so<00:00:16.150> I<00:00:16.210> couldn't<00:00:16.480> do<00:00:16.540> it<00:00:16.630> then<00:00:16.780> and

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
uploaded it so I couldn't do it then and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.370 
uploaded it so I couldn't do it then and
then<00:00:17.230> I've<00:00:17.530> been<00:00:18.310> lazy<00:00:18.850> since<00:00:19.300> but<00:00:20.020> now<00:00:20.260> I'm

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
then I've been lazy since but now I'm

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.900 
then I've been lazy since but now I'm
finally<00:00:20.590> doing<00:00:20.890> it<00:00:20.920> this<00:00:21.040> isn't<00:00:21.310> really<00:00:21.610> a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
finally doing it this isn't really a

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.020 
finally doing it this isn't really a
behind-the-scenes<00:00:22.810> because<00:00:23.500> from<00:00:24.340> recording

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.030 
behind-the-scenes because from recording

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.220 
behind-the-scenes because from recording
the<00:00:25.090> video<00:00:25.300> to<00:00:25.390> actually<00:00:25.660> uploading<00:00:26.050> it<00:00:26.140> was

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
the video to actually uploading it was

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.530 
the video to actually uploading it was
like<00:00:26.350> a<00:00:26.380> seven<00:00:26.950> to<00:00:27.040> eight<00:00:27.220> month<00:00:27.730> gap<00:00:28.030> because

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.540 
like a seven to eight month gap because

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.660 
like a seven to eight month gap because
it<00:00:28.780> just<00:00:28.960> took<00:00:29.110> that<00:00:29.350> long<00:00:29.560> to<00:00:29.620> edit<00:00:30.100> it<00:00:30.220> so<00:00:30.400> I

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:30.670 
it just took that long to edit it so I

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.890 
it just took that long to edit it so I
didn't<00:00:31.150> record<00:00:31.360> any<00:00:31.600> behind-the-scenes

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
didn't record any behind-the-scenes

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.650 
didn't record any behind-the-scenes
stuff<00:00:32.380> I've<00:00:32.590> got<00:00:32.740> a<00:00:32.770> little<00:00:33.070> bit<00:00:33.310> of<00:00:33.660> footage

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
stuff I've got a little bit of footage

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.890 
stuff I've got a little bit of footage
and<00:00:35.550> some<00:00:36.550> stuff<00:00:36.790> that<00:00:37.030> I<00:00:37.090> can<00:00:37.330> throw<00:00:37.510> in<00:00:37.750> there

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
and some stuff that I can throw in there

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.740 
and some stuff that I can throw in there
as<00:00:38.550> reference<00:00:39.550> but<00:00:39.970> I<00:00:40.150> didn't<00:00:40.480> actually

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
as reference but I didn't actually

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.780 
as reference but I didn't actually
record<00:00:41.050> anything<00:00:41.470> so<00:00:42.250> this<00:00:42.340> is<00:00:42.490> going<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.700> be

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
record anything so this is going to be

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.640 
record anything so this is going to be
more<00:00:42.940> of<00:00:43.060> a<00:00:43.240> casual<00:00:44.670> explanation<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:46.590> how<00:00:47.590> we

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
more of a casual explanation of how we

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.410 
more of a casual explanation of how we
made<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:48.310> video<00:00:48.400> rather<00:00:48.790> than<00:00:49.030> actually

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
made the video rather than actually

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.550 
made the video rather than actually
behind<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.690> scenes<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:50.079> I<00:00:50.110> haven't<00:00:50.380> uploaded

because<00:01:44.490> Riley<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.850> person<00:01:46.119> who<00:01:46.240> usually

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
because Riley the person who usually

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.250 
because Riley the person who usually
helps<00:01:47.439> me<00:01:47.500> edit<00:01:47.799> and<00:01:47.920> make<00:01:48.100> videos<00:01:48.490> he's<00:01:49.260> doing

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
helps me edit and make videos he's doing

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.719 
helps me edit and make videos he's doing
a<00:01:50.320> piloting<00:01:50.890> course<00:01:51.100> he<00:01:51.250> doesn't<00:01:51.460> have<00:01:51.549> a<00:01:51.610> lot

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
a piloting course he doesn't have a lot

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.500 
a piloting course he doesn't have a lot
of<00:01:51.760> time<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.600> help<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:53.710> I<00:01:53.909> had<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:55.330> basically

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
of time to help so I had to basically

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.969 
of time to help so I had to basically
edit<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.080> entire<00:01:56.320> thing<00:01:56.530> myself

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
edit the entire thing myself

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.090 
edit the entire thing myself
and<00:01:57.130> because<00:01:58.030> we<00:01:59.020> ran<00:01:59.170> into<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.470> same<00:01:59.650> problem

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
and because we ran into the same problem

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.499 
and because we ran into the same problem
that<00:02:00.130> we<00:02:00.400> had<00:02:00.549> with<00:02:00.700> the<00:02:00.790> first<00:02:01.000> video<00:02:01.299> which

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
that we had with the first video which

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.280 
that we had with the first video which
is<00:02:01.689> that<00:02:01.900> it's<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.890> really<00:02:03.280> long<00:02:03.549> scene<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.630> it

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
is that it's a really long scene and it

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.780 
is that it's a really long scene and it
moves<00:02:05.590> around<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:06.040> lot<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.250> camera<00:02:06.549> angle

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
moves around a lot the camera angle

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.929 
moves around a lot the camera angle
changes<00:02:07.240> it's<00:02:07.780> moving<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:08.439> it's<00:02:09.399> really

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:09.939 
changes it's moving and it's really

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:12.370 
changes it's moving and it's really
difficult<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.539> do<00:02:10.659> the<00:02:10.810> 3d<00:02:11.169> tracking<00:02:11.439> for<00:02:11.769> it

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
difficult to do the 3d tracking for it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.170 
difficult to do the 3d tracking for it
so<00:02:12.560> same<00:02:13.130> as<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.460> last<00:02:13.670> video<00:02:14.120> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
so same as the last video the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.590 
so same as the last video the
first-person<00:02:14.750> one<00:02:15.550> we<00:02:16.550> basically<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:17.450> got

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
first-person one we basically just got

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.250 
first-person one we basically just got
stuck<00:02:17.990> on<00:02:18.170> one<00:02:19.130> shot<00:02:19.370> trying<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.940> track<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.260> we

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
stuck on one shot trying to track it we

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.590 
stuck on one shot trying to track it we
basically<00:02:21.650> just<00:02:21.980> got<00:02:22.190> bored<00:02:22.460> stop<00:02:23.150> doing<00:02:23.480> it

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
basically just got bored stop doing it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.780 
basically just got bored stop doing it
stopped<00:02:23.990> editing<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.620> every<00:02:25.400> few<00:02:25.580> months

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
stopped editing it so every few months

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.000 
stopped editing it so every few months
or<00:02:26.030> weeks<00:02:26.210> I<00:02:26.420> would<00:02:26.540> come<00:02:26.690> back<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:27.020> it<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.320> try

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
or weeks I would come back to it and try

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.300 
or weeks I would come back to it and try
and<00:02:28.280> edit<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.900> eventually<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:30.560> came<00:02:31.220> up

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
and edit it and eventually I came up

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.270 
and edit it and eventually I came up
with<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.490> solution<00:02:31.760> for<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.090> scene<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:33.280> just

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
with a solution for that scene of just

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.940 
with a solution for that scene of just
tracking<00:02:34.790> each<00:02:35.330> sort<00:02:36.020> of<00:02:36.140> different<00:02:36.620> part<00:02:36.830> of

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
tracking each sort of different part of

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.890 
tracking each sort of different part of
the<00:02:37.040> shot<00:02:37.280> individually<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.240> take<00:02:38.540> one

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
the shot individually so I take one

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.840 
the shot individually so I take one
section<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.440> shot<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.310> I'd<00:02:40.400> split<00:02:40.730> that

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
section of the shot and I'd split that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.000 
section of the shot and I'd split that
up<00:02:40.910> and<00:02:41.540> I'll<00:02:41.660> track<00:02:41.930> that<00:02:42.170> part<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.620> edit

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
up and I'll track that part and edit

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.070 
up and I'll track that part and edit
that<00:02:43.100> separately<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.790> then<00:02:44.330> say<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.810> camera

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
that separately and then say the camera

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.140 
that separately and then say the camera
pans<00:02:45.350> over<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.980> something<00:02:46.280> else<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.730> would

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
pans over to something else I would

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.420 
pans over to something else I would
track<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.600> separately<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.410> in<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.160> end<00:02:49.280> I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
track that separately so in the end I

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.300 
track that separately so in the end I
think<00:02:49.490> there<00:02:49.700> was<00:02:49.820> like<00:02:50.510> four<00:02:50.750> different

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
think there was like four different

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.490 
think there was like four different
projects<00:02:52.310> for<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.730> one<00:02:53.030> scene<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:54.200> that<00:02:54.380> was

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
projects for that one scene so that was

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.380 
projects for that one scene so that was
the<00:02:54.590> main<00:02:54.770> problem<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:55.700> of<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.940> other<00:02:56.060> visual

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
the main problem all of the other visual

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.760 
the main problem all of the other visual
effects<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.840> first<00:02:56.870> shot<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.470> was<00:02:57.560> mainly

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
effects the first shot it was mainly

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.770 
effects the first shot it was mainly
just<00:02:57.920> walking<00:02:58.400> straight<00:02:58.760> didn't<00:02:59.540> have<00:02:59.630> any

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
just walking straight didn't have any

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.440 
just walking straight didn't have any
problems<00:03:00.140> with<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.860> small<00:03:01.820> shots<00:03:02.210> at

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
problems with that the small shots at

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.170 
problems with that the small shots at
the<00:03:02.540> star<00:03:02.810> those<00:03:03.080> are<00:03:03.230> pretty<00:03:03.410> easy<00:03:03.940> we've<00:03:04.940> got

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
the star those are pretty easy we've got

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.000 
the star those are pretty easy we've got
one<00:03:05.390> drawing<00:03:05.660> shot<00:03:05.960> in<00:03:06.080> there<00:03:06.230> actually

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
one drawing shot in there actually

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.740 
one drawing shot in there actually
wasn't<00:03:07.310> shot<00:03:07.460> with<00:03:07.580> a<00:03:07.640> DJI<00:03:07.970> phantom<00:03:08.480> was<00:03:08.540> shot

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
wasn't shot with a DJI phantom was shot

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.330 
wasn't shot with a DJI phantom was shot
with<00:03:08.870> an<00:03:09.020> old<00:03:09.200> quadcopter<00:03:09.980> we<00:03:10.100> built

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
with an old quadcopter we built

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.400 
with an old quadcopter we built
ourselves<00:03:10.490> there's<00:03:11.390> not<00:03:11.510> really<00:03:11.630> much<00:03:12.350> to

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
ourselves there's not really much to

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.140 
ourselves there's not really much to
talk<00:03:12.800> about<00:03:13.010> in<00:03:13.190> terms<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.550> visual<00:03:13.820> effects

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
talk about in terms of visual effects

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.090 
talk about in terms of visual effects
because<00:03:14.570> it's<00:03:14.720> pretty<00:03:14.840> much<00:03:14.960> all<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.590> same<00:03:15.800> as

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
because it's pretty much all the same as

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.190 
because it's pretty much all the same as
the<00:03:16.940> first<00:03:17.150> person<00:03:17.360> video<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.900> we've<00:03:18.020> really

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
the first person video and we've really

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.780 
the first person video and we've really
got<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:18.410> behind<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.710> scenes<00:03:18.770> for<00:03:19.070> that<00:03:19.250> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
got to behind the scenes for that the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.020 
got to behind the scenes for that the
bow<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.470> sword<00:03:21.470> usually<00:03:21.950> what<00:03:22.100> we<00:03:22.190> do<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.610> uh

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
bow and sword usually what we do is uh

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.030 
bow and sword usually what we do is uh
for<00:03:23.570> instance<00:03:23.600> with<00:03:24.020> this<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.710> just<00:03:24.890> bought

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
for instance with this we just bought

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.860 
for instance with this we just bought
this<00:03:25.160> off<00:03:25.340> eBay<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:28.030> got<00:03:29.030> like<00:03:29.180> $30<00:03:29.840> or

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
this off eBay and got like $30 or

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.780 
this off eBay and got like $30 or
something<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.650> we<00:03:30.890> just<00:03:31.070> use<00:03:31.220> those<00:03:31.430> but<00:03:31.700> it

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
something and we just use those but it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.040 
something and we just use those but it
turns<00:03:31.970> out<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.420> can't<00:03:32.720> get<00:03:33.020> foam<00:03:33.880> both<00:03:35.050> for

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
turns out you can't get foam both for

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.630 
turns out you can't get foam both for
Minecraft<00:03:36.620> they<00:03:36.740> just<00:03:36.920> don't<00:03:37.070> sell<00:03:37.310> them<00:03:37.400> no

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
Minecraft they just don't sell them no

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.460 
Minecraft they just don't sell them no
one<00:03:37.790> does<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.450> we<00:03:38.540> had<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.720> build<00:03:38.930> this<00:03:39.050> ourself

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
one does so we had to build this ourself

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.830 
one does so we had to build this ourself
and<00:03:40.010> this<00:03:40.280> took<00:03:40.550> a<00:03:40.760> lot<00:03:41.360> longer<00:03:41.390> than<00:03:41.780> you

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
and this took a lot longer than you

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.150 
and this took a lot longer than you
would<00:03:41.990> have<00:03:42.110> thought<00:03:42.290> so<00:03:42.650> we<00:03:42.770> went<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.010> bought

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
would have thought so we went and bought

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.520 
would have thought so we went and bought
a<00:03:43.430> piece<00:03:43.670> of<00:03:43.820> MDF<00:03:43.970> board<00:03:44.390> cut<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:44.870> out<00:03:44.990> painting

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
a piece of MDF board cut it out painting

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.800 
a piece of MDF board cut it out painting
it<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:45.830> I<00:03:46.040> actually<00:03:46.190> did<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.550> pretty<00:03:46.730> dodgy<00:03:47.420> job

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
it and I actually did a pretty dodgy job

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.150 
it and I actually did a pretty dodgy job
of<00:03:47.990> painting<00:03:48.380> here<00:03:48.470> there's<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.710> few<00:03:48.890> white

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
of painting here there's a few white

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.130 
of painting here there's a few white
marks<00:03:49.550> and<00:03:49.730> stuff<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.300> basically<00:03:50.420> had<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.870> tape

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
marks and stuff so basically had to tape

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.780 
marks and stuff so basically had to tape
up<00:03:51.350> all<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.740> tape<00:03:52.160> off<00:03:52.370> all<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.670> different

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
up all the tape off all the different

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.330 
up all the tape off all the different
sections<00:03:53.200> paint<00:03:54.200> that<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.710> then<00:03:54.860> rip<00:03:55.040> off<00:03:55.190> all

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
sections paint that and then rip off all

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.210 
sections paint that and then rip off all
the<00:03:55.460> tape<00:03:55.610> tape<00:03:56.360> up<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.630> next<00:03:56.810> part<00:03:56.990> and<00:03:57.290> it

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
the tape tape up the next part and it

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.700 
the tape tape up the next part and it
took<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.610> long<00:03:59.270> time<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.570> do<00:03:59.840> for<00:04:00.140> some<00:04:00.290> reason<00:04:00.320> I

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
took a long time to do for some reason I

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.560 
took a long time to do for some reason I
thought<00:04:00.920> it<00:04:01.010> would<00:04:01.160> be<00:04:01.310> pretty<00:04:01.910> simple<00:04:02.030> to

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
thought it would be pretty simple to

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.980 
thought it would be pretty simple to
make<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:02.960> proper<00:04:03.740> but<00:04:04.250> that<00:04:05.240> took<00:04:05.390> a<00:04:05.450> little

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
make a proper but that took a little

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.440 
make a proper but that took a little
while<00:04:06.260> longer<00:04:06.560> than<00:04:07.130> it<00:04:07.430> should<00:04:07.730> have<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:08.090> on

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
while longer than it should have and on

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.970 
while longer than it should have and on
the<00:04:08.540> first<00:04:08.750> person<00:04:09.140> video<00:04:09.290> because<00:04:09.830> of<00:04:09.860> the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
the first person video because of the

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.370 
the first person video because of the
star<00:04:10.250> we<00:04:10.430> showed<00:04:10.670> an<00:04:10.880> inventory<00:04:11.420> full<00:04:12.200> of

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
star we showed an inventory full of

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.260 
star we showed an inventory full of
diamonds<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.010> then<00:04:13.220> we<00:04:13.280> used<00:04:13.490> an<00:04:13.610> iron<00:04:13.820> sword

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
diamonds and then we used an iron sword

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.390 
diamonds and then we used an iron sword
and<00:04:14.390> everyone<00:04:14.630> said<00:04:14.900> while<00:04:15.620> using<00:04:15.860> iron<00:04:16.160> sword

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
and everyone said while using iron sword

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.250 
and everyone said while using iron sword
if<00:04:16.549> you've<00:04:16.670> got<00:04:16.850> so<00:04:17.030> many<00:04:17.210> diamonds<00:04:17.480> this<00:04:18.080> time

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
if you've got so many diamonds this time

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260 
if you've got so many diamonds this time
around<00:04:18.470> we<00:04:18.620> bought<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:19.460> diamond<00:04:19.609> sword<00:04:20.060> so

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.270 
around we bought the diamond sword so

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.940 
around we bought the diamond sword so
that<00:04:20.299> people<00:04:20.720> couldn't<00:04:20.900> complain<00:04:21.229> about<00:04:21.410> that

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
that people couldn't complain about that

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.350 
that people couldn't complain about that
as<00:04:22.010> well<00:04:22.520> as<00:04:22.640> this<00:04:22.700> video<00:04:22.850> I'm<00:04:23.030> also<00:04:23.060> going<00:04:23.300> to

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
as well as this video I'm also going to

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.780 
as well as this video I'm also going to
make<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.510> visual<00:04:23.870> effects<00:04:24.140> breakdown<00:04:24.680> of<00:04:24.890> some

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
make a visual effects breakdown of some

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.100 
make a visual effects breakdown of some
of<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.000> different<00:04:26.510> effects<00:04:26.780> where<00:04:27.020> I'll

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
of the different effects where I'll

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.660 
of the different effects where I'll
actually<00:04:27.140> kind<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.860> explain<00:04:28.370> what's

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
actually kind of explain what's

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.490 
actually kind of explain what's
happening<00:04:29.000> rather<00:04:29.240> than<00:04:29.570> just<00:04:29.840> show

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
happening rather than just show

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.800 
happening rather than just show
different<00:04:30.860> passes<00:04:31.370> of<00:04:31.690> global<00:04:32.690> illumination

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
different passes of global illumination

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.360 
different passes of global illumination
ambient<00:04:33.470> occlusion<00:04:33.620> because<00:04:34.040> that<00:04:34.190> doesn't

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
ambient occlusion because that doesn't

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.100 
ambient occlusion because that doesn't
really<00:04:34.580> show<00:04:34.850> anything<00:04:35.060> I<00:04:35.450> really<00:04:35.900> don't<00:04:36.080> have

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
really show anything I really don't have

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.890 
really show anything I really don't have
much<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:36.380> say<00:04:36.500> about<00:04:36.800> this<00:04:36.920> video<00:04:37.190> because

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
much to say about this video because

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.660 
much to say about this video because
really<00:04:38.900> all<00:04:39.020> there<00:04:39.200> is<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.620> is<00:04:39.740> if<00:04:40.010> the

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
really all there is to it is if the

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.150 
really all there is to it is if the
visual<00:04:41.000> effects<00:04:41.300> aren't<00:04:42.020> too<00:04:42.710> extreme

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
visual effects aren't too extreme

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.650 
visual effects aren't too extreme
they're<00:04:43.490> pretty<00:04:43.640> basic<00:04:43.790> that<00:04:44.120> just<00:04:44.300> really

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
they're pretty basic that just really

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.870 
they're pretty basic that just really
tedious<00:04:44.990> really<00:04:45.890> time-consuming<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.640> 3d

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
tedious really time-consuming the 3d

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.820 
tedious really time-consuming the 3d
tracking<00:04:47.210> was<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.690> huge<00:04:48.200> problem<00:04:48.410> that's<00:04:48.650> why

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
tracking was a huge problem that's why

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.930 
tracking was a huge problem that's why
the<00:04:48.890> video<00:04:49.130> took<00:04:49.220> so<00:04:49.580> long

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
the video took so long

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.710 
the video took so long
other<00:04:50.390> than<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.900> you<00:04:51.080> know<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.290> filming<00:04:51.740> was

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
other than that you know the filming was

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.930 
other than that you know the filming was
really<00:04:53.720> basic<00:04:54.280> so<00:04:55.280> yeah<00:04:55.430> that's<00:04:55.610> all<00:04:55.670> I<00:04:55.760> really

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
really basic so yeah that's all I really

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.820 
really basic so yeah that's all I really
have<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.240> talk<00:04:56.810> about<00:04:56.930> if<00:04:57.140> you're<00:04:57.260> interested

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
have to talk about if you're interested

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.290 
have to talk about if you're interested
in<00:04:57.950> learning<00:04:58.370> about<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.850> visual<00:04:59.060> effects

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
in learning about the visual effects

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.000 
in learning about the visual effects
check<00:04:59.810> out<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.050> visual<00:05:00.290> effects<00:05:00.530> breakdown

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
check out the visual effects breakdown

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.070 
check out the visual effects breakdown
that<00:05:01.190> eventually<00:05:01.460> I'm<00:05:02.390> going<00:05:02.660> to<00:05:02.720> get<00:05:02.870> around

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
that eventually I'm going to get around

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.930 
that eventually I'm going to get around
to<00:05:03.230> making<00:05:03.410> so<00:05:04.100> I'm<00:05:04.220> working<00:05:04.520> on<00:05:04.550> some<00:05:04.730> other

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
to making so I'm working on some other

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.610 
to making so I'm working on some other
videos<00:05:05.210> right<00:05:05.330> now<00:05:05.510> some<00:05:06.110> ones<00:05:06.290> which<00:05:06.440> are<00:05:06.590> a

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620
