whole<00:00:34.829> target<00:00:35.130> moves<00:00:35.489> around<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.360> need

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
whole target moves around so you need

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.930 
whole target moves around so you need
flexible<00:00:37.050> tubing<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.890> moves<00:00:38.219> with<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> Sun

as a scissor to lift it up the sensor
works<00:01:08.070> better<00:01:08.310> because<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.939> puts<00:01:09.150> less<00:01:09.450> torque

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
