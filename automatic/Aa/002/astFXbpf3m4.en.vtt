stuff to do it I don't get it really

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.930 
stuff to do it I don't get it really
much<00:04:41.349> but<00:04:42.349> that's<00:04:42.740> pretty<00:04:43.190> much<00:04:43.310> what<00:04:43.639> you<00:04:43.760> do

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
much but that's pretty much what you do

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.480 

or<00:04:58.889> do<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.490> put<00:05:00.060> a<00:05:00.090> video<00:05:00.960> on<00:05:01.080> e<00:05:01.139> but<00:05:01.410> if<00:05:02.190> that's

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
or do you put a video on e but if that's

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.620 
or do you put a video on e but if that's
what<00:05:02.580> would<00:05:02.849> happen<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.949> it<00:05:04.949> will<00:05:05.190> stay

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
what would happen and it will stay

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.189 
what would happen and it will stay
encoding<00:05:06.630> on<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.990> bottom<00:05:07.349> right<00:05:07.889> corner<00:05:08.000> and

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
encoding on the bottom right corner and

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.390 
encoding on the bottom right corner and
it<00:05:10.199> takes<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.710> little<00:05:10.860> while<00:05:11.069> better

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
it takes a little while better

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.559 
it takes a little while better
coordinate<00:05:12.139> and<00:05:13.400> yeah<00:05:14.400> that's<00:05:14.669> really<00:05:15.240> only

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:15.569 
coordinate and yeah that's really only

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.110 
coordinate and yeah that's really only
how<00:05:15.870> much<00:05:16.050> that's<00:05:16.590> going<00:05:16.770> way<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.400> do<00:05:17.789> it<00:05:17.970> I

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
how much that's going way to do it I

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.719 
how much that's going way to do it I
don't<00:05:18.180> might<00:05:18.990> be<00:05:19.139> other<00:05:19.319> programs<00:05:19.860> but<00:05:20.490> that's

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
don't might be other programs but that's

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.700 
don't might be other programs but that's
the<00:05:20.940> only<00:05:21.120> way<00:05:21.270> I<00:05:21.300> do<00:05:21.449> it<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:22.259> it<00:05:22.440> works<00:05:22.590> pretty

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
the only way I do it and it works pretty

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.210 
the only way I do it and it works pretty
good<00:05:22.889> thanks<00:05:23.819> for<00:05:23.940> watching
