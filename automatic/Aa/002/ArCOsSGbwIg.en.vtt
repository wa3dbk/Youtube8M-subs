yourself but I'm going to show you you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.289 
yourself but I'm going to show you you
basic<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.500> basically<00:01:15.740> basic<00:01:16.369> concept<00:01:16.880> of<00:01:17.030> it

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
basic the basically basic concept of it

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.690 
basic the basically basic concept of it
is<00:01:17.509> that<00:01:18.729> you're<00:01:19.729> going<00:01:19.939> to<00:01:20.409> take<00:01:21.409> a<00:01:21.860> few<00:01:22.399> books

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
is that you're going to take a few books

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.910 
is that you're going to take a few books
let's<00:01:23.360> say<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:23.570> have<00:01:23.840> we're<00:01:24.409> going<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.680> put

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
let's say you have we're going to put

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.800 
let's say you have we're going to put
for<00:01:25.909> this<00:01:26.030> technique<00:01:26.360> we're<00:01:26.539> going<00:01:26.659> to<00:01:26.719> use

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
for this technique we're going to use

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.200 
for this technique we're going to use
three<00:01:27.380> books<00:01:27.619> or<00:01:27.890> three<00:01:28.189> sources<00:01:28.520> you<00:01:28.880> can<00:01:29.000> go

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
three books or three sources you can go

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.350 
three books or three sources you can go
online<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.049> find<00:01:30.380> keywords<00:01:31.060> from<00:01:32.060> three

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
online and find keywords from three

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.980 
online and find keywords from three
different<00:01:32.479> sources<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.469> we're<00:01:34.100> going<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.990> use

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
different sources and we're going to use

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.440 
different sources and we're going to use
those<00:01:36.229> keywords<00:01:36.969> combine<00:01:37.969> them<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.420> create

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
those keywords combine them to create

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.260 
those keywords combine them to create
new<00:01:38.899> meanings<00:01:39.590> out<00:01:39.859> of<00:01:39.979> those<00:01:40.159> keywords<00:01:40.430> so

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
new meanings out of those keywords so

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.300 
new meanings out of those keywords so
for<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:41.719> demonstration<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:43.039> will<00:01:43.100> be<00:01:43.219> using

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
concepts new understandings see patterns

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.460

that<00:05:31.700> are<00:05:31.850> coming<00:05:32.150> up<00:05:32.210> in<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.420> cards<00:05:32.900> that

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
that are coming up in the cards that

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.870 
that are coming up in the cards that
kind<00:05:33.740> of<00:05:33.800> thing<00:05:34.070> and<00:05:34.190> then<00:05:34.310> you<00:05:34.340> can<00:05:34.430> keep

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
kind of thing and then you can keep

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.150 
kind of thing and then you can keep
wrenching<00:05:35.390> that<00:05:35.510> more<00:05:35.930> and<00:05:36.020> more<00:05:36.140> you<00:05:36.410> connect

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
wrenching that more and more you connect

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.350

each new concept with another and create

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.620 
each new concept with another and create
start<00:05:41.570> branching<00:05:41.930> out<00:05:42.020> more<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:43.220> I<00:05:43.760> believe<00:05:44.030> I

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
start branching out more and I believe I

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.330 
start branching out more and I believe I
went<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.170> when<00:05:45.320> I<00:05:45.350> talked<00:05:45.590> to<00:05:45.650> Marcus<00:05:46.040> about

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
went to when I talked to Marcus about

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.540 
went to when I talked to Marcus about
this<00:05:46.580> because<00:05:46.820> we<00:05:47.030> did<00:05:47.180> we<00:05:47.630> did<00:05:47.780> a

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
this because we did we did a

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.160 
this because we did we did a
demonstration<00:05:49.550> of<00:05:49.700> this<00:05:49.790> together<00:05:50.150> he<00:05:50.930> said

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
demonstration of this together he said

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.380 
demonstration of this together he said
that<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:51.410> further<00:05:51.710> you<00:05:51.920> branch<00:05:52.250> out<00:05:52.550> from<00:05:52.640> one

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
that the further you branch out from one

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.190 
that the further you branch out from one
card<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:54.410> key<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:55.220> meaning<00:05:55.700> start<00:05:56.200> moving

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
card the key the meaning start moving

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.470 
card the key the meaning start moving
away<00:05:57.320> from<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.890> cards<00:05:58.340> and<00:05:58.580> end<00:05:58.880> up<00:05:59.210> being

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
away from the cards and end up being

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.100 
away from the cards and end up being
something<00:05:59.900> else<00:06:00.200> that<00:06:01.510> relate<00:06:02.510> to<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.960> other

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
something else that relate to the other

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.500 
something else that relate to the other
cars<00:06:03.470> so<00:06:03.830> that<00:06:04.190> ultra<00:06:04.520> show<00:06:04.730> that<00:06:05.180> will<00:06:05.300> show

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
cars so that ultra show that will show

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.420 
cars so that ultra show that will show
how<00:06:05.780> all<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.320> cards<00:06:06.770> are<00:06:06.950> somehow<00:06:07.280> connected

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
how all the cards are somehow connected

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.000 
how all the cards are somehow connected
to<00:06:08.090> one<00:06:08.390> another<00:06:08.660> through<00:06:09.440> some<00:06:09.740> kind<00:06:09.950> of

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
to one another through some kind of

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.460 
to one another through some kind of
degree<00:06:10.190> of<00:06:10.460> separation<00:06:10.930> and<00:06:11.930> it's<00:06:12.320> kind<00:06:12.440> of

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
degree of separation and it's kind of

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.320 
degree of separation and it's kind of
like<00:06:12.590> a<00:06:12.620> giant<00:06:12.800> web<00:06:13.190> I<00:06:13.460> guess<00:06:13.880> that<00:06:14.120> all<00:06:14.150> the

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
like a giant web I guess that all the

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.020 
like a giant web I guess that all the
cards<00:06:14.540> are<00:06:14.630> connected<00:06:14.990> through<00:06:15.080> meanings<00:06:15.500> and

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
cards are connected through meanings and

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.200 
cards are connected through meanings and
this<00:06:17.030> technique<00:06:17.990> will<00:06:18.230> help<00:06:18.470> you<00:06:19.210> see

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
this technique will help you see

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.390 
this technique will help you see
connections<00:06:20.930> between<00:06:21.140> other<00:06:21.560> cars<00:06:21.920> because

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
connections between other cars because

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.220 
connections between other cars because
you<00:06:22.880> know<00:06:23.030> as<00:06:23.150> you<00:06:23.180> branch<00:06:23.540> out<00:06:23.690> further<00:06:23.960> you

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
you know as you branch out further you

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.710 
you know as you branch out further you
can<00:06:24.440> then<00:06:24.710> see<00:06:25.040> how<00:06:25.730> this<00:06:25.910> card<00:06:26.150> can<00:06:26.360> relate<00:06:26.600> to

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
can then see how this card can relate to

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.720 
can then see how this card can relate to
another<00:06:27.020> card<00:06:27.260> if<00:06:27.680> they're<00:06:27.950> together<00:06:28.250> that

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
another card if they're together that

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.300 
another card if they're together that
kind<00:06:28.940> of<00:06:29.060> thing<00:06:29.330> so<00:06:29.780> that<00:06:30.560> is<00:06:30.710> a<00:06:30.740> demonstration

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
kind of thing so that is a demonstration

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.360 
kind of thing so that is a demonstration
of<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.940> keyword<00:06:32.570> kaleidoscope<00:06:33.260> if<00:06:34.160> you<00:06:34.280> have

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
of the keyword kaleidoscope if you have

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.370 
of the keyword kaleidoscope if you have
any<00:06:34.520> questions<00:06:34.850> or<00:06:34.970> comments<00:06:35.180> please<00:06:36.080> let<00:06:36.230> me

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
any questions or comments please let me

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.290 
any questions or comments please let me
know<00:06:36.560> I<00:06:36.590> hope<00:06:37.070> I<00:06:37.280> demonstrated<00:06:38.090> this<00:06:40.180> to<00:06:41.180> the

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
know I hope I demonstrated this to the

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.210 
know I hope I demonstrated this to the
best<00:06:41.480> of<00:06:41.570> my<00:06:41.690> ability<00:06:42.110> it<00:06:42.440> was<00:06:42.980> kind<00:06:43.190> of

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
best of my ability it was kind of

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.010 
best of my ability it was kind of
confusing<00:06:43.640> for<00:06:43.670> me<00:06:43.910> at<00:06:44.000> first<00:06:44.270> I<00:06:44.540> didn't<00:06:44.840> quite

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020 
confusing for me at first I didn't quite

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.750 
confusing for me at first I didn't quite
get<00:06:45.290> it<00:06:45.350> but<00:06:45.470> I

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 
get it but I

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.970 
get it but I
I've<00:06:47.090> tried<00:06:47.360> it<00:06:47.480> out<00:06:47.600> with<00:06:47.630> Marcus<00:06:48.140> and<00:06:48.350> I<00:06:48.500> got

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
I've tried it out with Marcus and I got

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.500 
I've tried it out with Marcus and I got
it<00:06:49.190> and<00:06:49.340> I<00:06:49.490> think<00:06:49.790> it's<00:06:49.880> a<00:06:49.940> very<00:06:50.030> interesting

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:50.510 
it and I think it's a very interesting

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.130 
it and I think it's a very interesting
technique<00:06:50.930> for<00:06:51.380> kind<00:06:51.920> of<00:06:52.010> you<00:06:52.160> know

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
technique for kind of you know

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.180 
technique for kind of you know
combining<00:06:55.140> keywords<00:06:55.440> from<00:06:55.860> different

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
combining keywords from different

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.730 
combining keywords from different
sources<00:06:56.520> to<00:06:56.910> create<00:06:57.090> your<00:06:57.870> own<00:06:57.900> means<00:06:58.350> your

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740 
sources to create your own means your

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.000 
sources to create your own means your
own<00:06:59.270> understandings<00:07:00.270> of<00:07:00.420> the<00:07:00.540> cards<00:07:00.930> and<00:07:01.200> this

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
own understandings of the cards and this

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.800 
own understandings of the cards and this
is<00:07:02.190> what<00:07:02.370> this<00:07:02.490> is<00:07:02.640> just<00:07:02.820> an<00:07:02.910> example<00:07:03.300> so<00:07:03.450> try

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
is what this is just an example so try

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.480 
is what this is just an example so try
it<00:07:03.840> out<00:07:03.990> for<00:07:04.110> yourself<00:07:04.440> pull<00:07:04.650> a<00:07:04.680> card<00:07:04.980> out<00:07:05.160> you

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
it out for yourself pull a card out you

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.820 
it out for yourself pull a card out you
know<00:07:05.910> pull<00:07:06.180> three<00:07:06.450> books<00:07:06.720> that<00:07:07.020> you<00:07:07.110> have<00:07:07.140> go

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
know pull three books that you have go

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.220 
know pull three books that you have go
online<00:07:07.980> find<00:07:08.700> keywords<00:07:09.150> and<00:07:09.480> then<00:07:09.690> try<00:07:10.020> it<00:07:10.050> out

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
online find keywords and then try it out
