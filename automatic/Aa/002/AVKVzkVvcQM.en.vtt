00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.750
 hi everyone look what they have if we are 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.930
 here on this map to make a trap 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.430
 of reduction that good to see I've seen 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.700
 many repression traps but they were 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.700
 as 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.520
 a wall 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.760
 yes yes wait wait wait for her 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.590
 what 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.010
 and obviously they were not going to step on it 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.400
 then it seems to me quite shabby 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.800
 cheating types of those that are 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.280
 can see then what needs to be done 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.920
 and what I thought is 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.270
 somehow play with the view of 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.570
 other 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.700
 that he can not see or direct his sight 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.640
 to the other side so that the plate 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.410
 pressure is well placed good as 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.480
 I did this is the map of defending the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.330
 house or defend your house or whatever you want 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.400
 call it because you liked it so much 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.130
 of the mobile trap and so good 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.680
 here I bring one for people to see if 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.960
 you also like it or not and you will tell me this 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.479
 is the typical good low I am more to 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.660
 do the holes and a stairs but 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.900
 good and that is irrelevant as you see 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.660
 here is a torch that illuminates a 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.330
 little but there is a place like dark from 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.950
 the other day it seems that by her and light 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:39.119
 there is something then it will go down 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.119
 and you will see me leave 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.890
 morillo has not died because I'm in 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.159
 creative 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.100
 and as you can see it 's quite effective because it's 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.200
 that you do not see and I'm sure that the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.390
 99% of those who are watching this video 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.320
 they have not seen it 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.110
 obviously if you go with a lot 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.770
 Be careful if you can see it 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.760
 but good, I'll teach right here 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.300
 how to do it suppose that we will have 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.610
 this plate down on the network are is 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.490
 very easy the pressure plate would be 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.970
 here then what we have to do 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.970
 is what 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.910
 this would rise that is to say would have a 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.940
 sticky piston here 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.860
 there's no more this brings me or network are this 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:33.610
 it's a graphic mode that I have I have 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.610
 installed the optimal but good 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.000
 now it goes well then by doing that 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.480
 fuck is touching me already 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.080
 you can not jump 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.080
 ok and then for what I've done here 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.080
 was 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:54.610
 these pistons that go one more back 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.900
 not here all 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.770
 so so super good the computer 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.970
 what I have done has been 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.970
 here a torch 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.210
 then with a block over 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.780
 and as you know it gives energy to the piston 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:19.020
 that is also not seen today I'm going to put it in 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.020
 what I know 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.500
 sortu full because it is me 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.440
 bothering me enough that I go so badly 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.300
 and I do not want a video where good gives 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.750
 just as I did this activated would be 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:38.120
 so then from here there would be the 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.120
 pressure plate this torch 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:47.190
 it was like that there are 11 of the redstone that gives 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.190
 energy this block 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.489
 to this torch so that you can 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.940
 direct this towards this block 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.340
 Y 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.870
 oh, perfect 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.680
 then this part and this is already 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.079
 as you see I close it completely 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.769
 it's worth even where to put it to have 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.769
 easy 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.590
 Of course , these are the first 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.890
 they would explode but then you can put more 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.450
 for everything or because if you know when 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.080
 one has you explodes and there's more to your 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.340
 around the others explode cool here 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.990
 you have the trap we are going to do it 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.990
 explode because it's pretty funny 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:38.259
 to see this because it is not closed but 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.259
 well I like explosions 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.849
 and well this has been the trap 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.249
 As you know, I do not usually do many 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.919
 traps 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:52.149
 but I hope you liked it and 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.149
 see you in the next video
