 joselu in the 'valencia and as you can see 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.860

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.720
 derby of the Valencian community we play 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.490
 away from home and well let's go for the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.420
 three points because the goal is 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.700
 get the league because we are doing very well 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.920
 there you can see the classification after 14 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.460
 days we go first with 38 points 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.800
 Barça is still with 35 a ball to 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.929
 joselu who is looking for holes to see 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.760
 find the pass let's see over here 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:42.460
 for soldier soldier for the tino 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.469
 hits for the goalie let's see clear 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.879
 the defense the ball falls to the soldier 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.789
 Touch back to you do not hit with the 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.069
 right to the hands of the goalkeeper leads 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.889
 a soldier opens for valdez valdez to 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:55.329
 joselu loses her joselu attention that 

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:57.039
 comes the recover to josé luís epas es 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.069

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:03.519
 goal goal of goal of the coast in the minute 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:05.650
 45 Joselu who lost her recovered her and 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.980
 attended to the tino with that pass to 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.170
 get ahead 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.660
 in the valdez leads I'm looking back 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.670
 how well does joselu see it from afar 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.010
 rises above the crossbar but the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.110
 intention was very good look at yourself 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.600
 leave behind valdez controls try 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.610
 surprise the goalie let's go that's 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.620
 can be good joselo in band follows 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.120
 damián suárez the lateral let's see 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.400
 joselu tries to make the child 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.550
 bargaining does not take away old leisure 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.270
 in let's go joselu hits and removes 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.890
 penalty the referee gives PENALTY good I 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.020
 it seems that there has been a grab and then 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.360
 maybe a shock at the time of pulling 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.430
 yellow for damián suárez let's see 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.770
 the repetition joselu does the gave here 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.160
 he is grabbing him and here there may be a 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.170
 hit and get ready to throw it roberto 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.480
 soldier shooting the team's penalty there 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.720
 he goes soldier soldier hits him good good 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.580
 new unstoppable for the goalkeeper in 79 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.860
 We put the 0-2 and I think it 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.040
 we sentence the party set where he 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.200
 has placed unstoppable there goes to powell 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.940
 final minutes of the game we will see 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.220
 the band touches hours and the latok is 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.510
 back and the referee blows the end of the 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.909
 match 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.560
 a good game of the team set goals 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.900
 of tino costa with the assistance of joseph 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.360
 Luis then soldier after the penalty over 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.220
 joselu so I have not marked but very 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.170
 active in the game here you can see the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.340
 valuation of match 9 with 4 for 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.560
 joselu 33% in shots 83% in passes with one 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.930
 assistance two key passes a lack 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.480
 received eight dribbles one against one with 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.250
 hit hit one friends now we 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.769
 play to play against getafe 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.689
 we play in mestalla in house fixes that 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.579
 they come in a rather irregular streak 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.590
 so well let's go for the three 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.299
 points as always and I will take advantage 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.040
 that there is nelson haedo valdez for 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.659
 send a hello to nelson eggs 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.549
 valdez I told you yesterday on twitter 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.709
 so a crack greeting if you're watching 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.170
 the video and well here you can see the eleven 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.639
 initial substitutes nelson valdez that 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.290
 already has eight goals in all 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.109
 competitions the truth is that it is a 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.959
 crack and already changing the subject we're going to 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:08.510
 Getafe mestalla not touched rada 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.519
 opens it up to the band that is approaching 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.500
 diego castrol opens for bar da hits 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.930
 of first but it is going away less 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.489
 bad there goes to valdez fast back that 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.720
 well, I drank for being what good 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.880
 dribble by joselu 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.950
 eye that judged of joselu prepares the 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.610
 tino I move to the center to 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.610
 soldier soldier 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.570
 careful that you approach the accent here for 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.820
 saravia hits first what paradón 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.230
 from diego alves as this goalkeeper flies 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.100
 of truth and attention that is going to put 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.750
 diego castro ay well despeja víctor ruiz 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.670
 valdez for joselu with cell phone 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.470
 keep looking for the counterattack we're going 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.140
 feli and I'm asking again 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.730
 joselu we go that pass that comes and goes to 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.930
 make a link the lose it returns to 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.730
 recover for being careful not the 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.740
 miss what good opens it for joao 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.210
 He will go deep to fable and 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.670
 football and puts it first top 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.740
 soldier to the hands of the goalkeeper a good 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.110
 counterattack we are going to see the will take 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.730
 pablo sarabia de banda controls more the 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.950
 Cen that comes to recover joselu touches 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.750
 for soldiers soldiers inwards 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.299
 for valdez valdez demo for soldier 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.550
 he's just hitting him about to mark there 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.290
 he has kept it for tino costa tino 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.330
 coast for joselu joselo inwards 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.240
 looking for the chute bounces on the defense 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.900
 Attention is the clear penalty 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.970
 I've seen this time very clear I paste joselu 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.040
 bounced and then placo the forward well 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.200
 that there goes to soldier let's see if the 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.450
 re-dial there goes soldier soldier 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.270
 soldier who comes cheats soldier to 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.620
 goalie 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:50.170
 in minute 56 we put the 2 to 0 and there 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.510
 Joseph is again made his departure 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.820
 Traditional and good we started I 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.770
 I think he has already sentenced a ball to 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.560
 joselu let's build the play well 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.080
 joselu is leaving the dinner know no 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.550
 clear passes and then doing it in 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.260
 the mess to lance how good it happens 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.900
 for tino there goes the tino approves 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.000
 the son is out of tino although 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.950
 it's good to try it from afar there 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.780
 barred in band care that he opens 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.400
 for alvaro attention that leaves you broken 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.290
 defense careful the death step you 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.990
 he plays less badly that he is going out to 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:23.110
 lance and there's a change in the team is going 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.960
 nelson valdez applauds all mestalla and 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.270
 so the party ends friends another great 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.490
 match this time at home with goals from 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:33.130
 jose luis soldier of penalties we add 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.250
 three most important points for 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.600
 continue in the title fight and joselu 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.880
 that he never tires of pulling 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.300
 outstanding set nine and a half a 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.730
 100% shots with a goal 96% in passes 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.860
 two fouls received three dribbles one 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.930
 against one successfully here are the 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.200
 objectives of joselu asked him at least 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.120
 one 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.610
 with two of minimum of average has gotten 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.710
 a 940 at least one goal has got two 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.040
 at least two times he has got 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:03.400
 four and a 79 of passes has achieved a 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.230
 88 and more than fulfilled all good here 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.030
 we are in a game of champions that 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.710
 we play away from home against Marseille 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.780
 Joselo is not in the starting lineup 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.210
 basically because he 's tired according to 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.190
 says the coach so hopefully that 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.430
 work well without him let's see 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.950
 simulate and there you can see a 2 to 2 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.930
 they marked piatti and valdez so good 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.210
 I do not know if with this result we are worth 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.950
 to pass first is from the second group 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.810
 let's see it now and here you can see 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.940
 friends first of the group the bayern with 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.100
 11 points second the valence with 9 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.890
 third the anderlecht with seven and a quarter 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.630
 the marseille with five if we had 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.760
 won this last match against the 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.560
 Marseille would have been first of 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.690
 groups by the golaverage against the 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.670
 bayern but good is not bad 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:47.890
 goal is fulfilled we passed and see 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.240
 what team we play eighth and good 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.790
 here you can see all the 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.100
 matches of the knockout stages 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.470
 of the cup of champions in the corner 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.430
 top right you can see juventus 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.560
 Valencia 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.390
 a great team that has touched us 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.820
 could have touched some worse as by 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.250
 example the benfica the zenith of 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.500
 tottenham but good friends we are the 

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.810
 Valencia will go all out to by 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.000
 this competition to give everything to see 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.440
 how far can we go so good 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.390
 If you have to start with juve then 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.700
 for the juve a great team 

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:20.860
 defensively but let's try 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.780
 with everything and good friends now I'm going to 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.640
 explain a little bit of inactivity 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.290
 what's going to be in the channel because 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.420
 next week I'm going to 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.040
 beach vacation voucher so there's no 

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.380
 I will have internet or anything for which I do not 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.300
 I will be able to upload any video and I guess 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.850
 that when he returns to the last days of 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.400
 July you will have some new episode of 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.900
 brighton and also tell you that during 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.640
 the month of August is a little bit I'm going to 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.920
 be at home because I'm going to my town 

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.020
 so there you will not have internet either 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.150
 what I'm going to try to program some 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.340
 video for that month is one per week more 

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.740
 or less and in September I'll be back 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.750
 return to the whole rhythm to normal 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:57.130
 you will see the end of the series that you 

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.560
 notice since they're going to be pretty 

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.150
 pretty epic and good friends this 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.280
 It would be all for today I hope that I have 

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.760
 liked the episode of joselu that you leave 

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.830

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.360

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.840
