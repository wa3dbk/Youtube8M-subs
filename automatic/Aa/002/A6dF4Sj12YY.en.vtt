stick to the track but the only thing
that<00:00:35.700> needs<00:00:35.820> some<00:00:36.059> help<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.469> chassis

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that needs some help now is the chassis

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.360 
that needs some help now is the chassis
itself<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.270> Camaro<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> unibody<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.800> you

take<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.220> tubes<00:03:41.430> out<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.790> box<00:03:42.030> put<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.510> in

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
take the tubes out of the box put it in

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.050 
take the tubes out of the box put it in
the<00:03:42.630> car<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.020> start<00:03:43.230> welding<00:03:43.440> them<00:03:43.680> up

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
the car and start welding them up

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.090 
the car and start welding them up
because<00:03:45.060> as<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:46.110> cage<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.620> being<00:03:46.830> built

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
because as the cage is being built

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.580 
because as the cage is being built
inside<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.730> car<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.990> start<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.440> lose

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
inside the car you start to lose

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.710 
inside the car you start to lose
clearance<00:03:50.190> around<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.730> tubes<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.480> have<00:03:51.630> to

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
clearance around the tubes you have to

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.850 
clearance around the tubes you have to
figure<00:03:51.900> out<00:03:52.080> how<00:03:52.170> you're<00:03:52.290> going<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.440> weld<00:03:52.680> all

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
figure out how you're going to weld all

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.280 
figure out how you're going to weld all
the<00:03:52.980> way<00:03:53.100> around<00:03:53.370> them<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:53.960> there's<00:03:54.960> a<00:03:55.050> lot<00:03:55.170> of

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
the way around them and there's a lot of

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.710 
the way around them and there's a lot of
considerations<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.250> in<00:03:56.700> our<00:03:56.880> case<00:03:57.270> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
considerations like that in our case the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.020 
considerations like that in our case the
first<00:03:57.750> step<00:03:58.200> was<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:58.800> mount<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.370> floor<00:03:59.700> plates

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
first step was to mount the floor plates

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.930 
first step was to mount the floor plates
to<00:04:00.570> the<00:04:00.840> rocker<00:04:01.080> panels<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:02.280> rockers<00:04:02.700> on<00:04:02.880> a

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
to the rocker panels the rockers on a

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.030 
to the rocker panels the rockers on a
Camaro<00:04:03.300> are<00:04:03.600> structural<00:04:04.590> they're<00:04:04.860> very

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
Camaro are structural they're very

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.610 
Camaro are structural they're very
strong<00:04:05.340> it's<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.120> great<00:04:06.360> foundation<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:07.410> mount

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
strong it's a great foundation to mount

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.400 
strong it's a great foundation to mount
the<00:04:07.770> cage<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.300> kit<00:04:09.510> came<00:04:09.720> with<00:04:09.780> two<00:04:10.110> plates

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
the cage so the kit came with two plates

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.120 
the cage so the kit came with two plates
to<00:04:10.920> attach<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:11.960> roll<00:04:12.960> cage<00:04:13.170> on<00:04:13.410> each<00:04:13.560> side<00:04:13.860> of

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
to attach the roll cage on each side of

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.340 
to attach the roll cage on each side of
one<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.430> fact<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.850> rocker<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.450> one<00:04:15.750> at<00:04:16.320> the

front of the rocker panel and once we
got<00:04:18.570> those<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:18.989> place<00:04:19.230> we<00:04:20.070> put<00:04:20.580> in<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:21.090> main

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
got those in place we put in the main

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.420 
got those in place we put in the main
hoop<00:04:21.840> which<00:04:22.260> is<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.560> bar<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:23.010> goes<00:04:23.130> right

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
hoop which is the bar that goes right

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.640 
hoop which is the bar that goes right
behind<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:23.820> driver<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.330> passenger<00:04:24.870> from<00:04:25.530> the

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
behind the driver and passenger from the

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.470 
behind the driver and passenger from the
floor<00:04:25.920> up<00:04:26.250> over<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.610> top<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.090> then<00:04:27.270> back<00:04:27.300> down

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
floor up over the top and then back down

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.290 
floor up over the top and then back down
to<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.900> other<00:04:28.020> side<00:04:28.290> we<00:04:29.100> modified<00:04:29.550> our<00:04:29.760> roll

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
to the other side we modified our roll

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.450 
to the other side we modified our roll
cage<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.570> little<00:04:30.690> bit<00:04:31.050> mostly<00:04:31.680> for<00:04:31.950> aesthetic

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
cage a little bit mostly for aesthetic

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.000 
cage a little bit mostly for aesthetic
reasons<00:04:32.850> we<00:04:33.270> wanted<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.840> hide<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.530> as<00:04:34.650> much<00:04:34.860> as

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
reasons we wanted to hide it as much as

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.850 
reasons we wanted to hide it as much as
possible<00:04:35.300> so<00:04:36.300> we<00:04:36.690> leaned<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.380> main<00:04:37.590> hoop

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
possible so we leaned the main hoop

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.070 
possible so we leaned the main hoop
backwards<00:04:38.460> just<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:38.850> little<00:04:39.030> bit<00:04:39.210> so<00:04:39.900> when<00:04:39.990> you

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
backwards just a little bit so when you

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.050 
backwards just a little bit so when you
look<00:04:40.200> at<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.380> car<00:04:40.530> from<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.770> side<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.460> the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
look at the car from the side and the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.930 
look at the car from the side and the
windows<00:04:42.210> are<00:04:42.540> up<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.680> trim<00:04:44.040> would<00:04:44.370> conceal

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
windows are up the trim would conceal

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.510 
windows are up the trim would conceal
the<00:04:45.270> tube<00:04:45.570> and<00:04:46.020> if<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.230> windows<00:04:46.530> are<00:04:46.560> down<00:04:46.830> it

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
the tube and if the windows are down it

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.250 
the tube and if the windows are down it
almost<00:04:47.700> looks<00:04:48.000> like<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.780> know<00:04:48.870> just<00:04:49.080> that

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
almost looks like you know just that

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.650 
almost looks like you know just that
regular<00:04:49.710> piece<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.580> trim<00:04:50.970> there<00:04:51.210> it<00:04:51.330> doesn't

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
regular piece of trim there it doesn't

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.080 
regular piece of trim there it doesn't
really<00:04:51.780> stand<00:04:52.080> out<00:04:52.320> too<00:04:52.530> much<00:04:52.820> once<00:04:53.820> it's<00:04:54.000> on

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
really stand out too much once it's on

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.880 
really stand out too much once it's on
the<00:04:54.180> position<00:04:54.630> we<00:04:54.750> liked<00:04:54.990> we<00:04:55.440> started<00:04:55.830> the

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
the position we liked we started the

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.520 
the position we liked we started the
installation<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:57.270> forward-facing<00:04:57.990> bars

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
installation of the forward-facing bars

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.830 
installation of the forward-facing bars
and<00:04:58.950> these<00:04:59.100> go<00:04:59.340> from<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.760> rear<00:04:59.970> hoop

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
and these go from the rear hoop

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.740 
and these go from the rear hoop
across<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.740> roof<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.640> car<00:05:02.820> and<00:05:03.150> then<00:05:03.450> down

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
across the roof of the car and then down

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.380 
across the roof of the car and then down
through<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.470> dashboard<00:05:04.770> to<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:05.910> base<00:05:06.120> of<00:05:06.330> the

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
through the dashboard to the base of the

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.750 
through the dashboard to the base of the
car<00:05:06.600> again<00:05:06.720> so<00:05:07.260> we<00:05:07.980> had<00:05:08.100> to<00:05:08.190> cut<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.400> couple<00:05:08.580> of

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
car again so we had to cut a couple of

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.820 
car again so we had to cut a couple of
holes<00:05:09.060> in<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.600> dashboard<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.440> feed<00:05:10.650> these

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
holes in the dashboard to feed these

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.010 
holes in the dashboard to feed these
things<00:05:11.070> through<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.970> then<00:05:12.480> we<00:05:12.600> got<00:05:12.780> those<00:05:12.960> two

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
things through and then we got those two

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.130 
things through and then we got those two
bars<00:05:13.410> tacked<00:05:13.800> in<00:05:13.980> place<00:05:14.120> again<00:05:15.120> trying<00:05:15.930> to

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
bars tacked in place again trying to

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.630 
bars tacked in place again trying to
push<00:05:16.950> them<00:05:17.220> outward<00:05:18.180> as<00:05:18.690> far<00:05:19.020> as<00:05:19.169> we<00:05:19.320> could<00:05:19.640> so

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
push them outward as far as we could so

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.980 
push them outward as far as we could so
that<00:05:20.790> you<00:05:20.850> couldn't<00:05:21.090> see<00:05:21.300> him<00:05:21.390> so<00:05:21.570> much<00:05:21.750> but

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
that you couldn't see him so much but

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.780 
that you couldn't see him so much but
also<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.380> leave<00:05:22.620> room<00:05:22.830> for<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:23.190> interior<00:05:23.640> trim

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
also to leave room for the interior trim

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.330

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
angle again to conceal those tubes so we

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.150 
angle again to conceal those tubes so we
cut<00:05:40.080> them<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.470> added<00:05:40.740> some<00:05:40.860> straight
