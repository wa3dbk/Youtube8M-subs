00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
launching for the first season so your

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.810 
launching for the first season so your
base<00:00:35.960> has<00:00:36.500> your<00:00:36.710> base<00:00:36.860> plates<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.670> base

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
base has your base plates and the base

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.850 
base has your base plates and the base
plates<00:00:38.060> come<00:00:38.330> with<00:00:38.690> your<00:00:39.200> hardware

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
plates come with your hardware

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.210 
plates come with your hardware
you've<00:00:40.430> got<00:00:40.700> your<00:00:41.000> padding<00:00:41.920> so<00:00:42.920> this<00:00:43.040> goes

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
you've got your padding so this goes

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.130 
you've got your padding so this goes
into<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:43.700> actual<00:00:44.090> base<00:00:44.300> of<00:00:44.570> your<00:00:45.550> base<00:00:46.550> plate

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
into the actual base of your base plate

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.960 
into the actual base of your base plate
you've<00:00:48.140> got<00:00:48.290> your<00:00:48.380> high<00:00:48.560> backs<00:00:48.800> so<00:00:49.400> this<00:00:49.790> is

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
you've got your high backs so this is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.640 
you've got your high backs so this is
your<00:00:50.180> traditional<00:00:50.990> high<00:00:51.110> back<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.560> high

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
your traditional high back and the high

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.860 
your traditional high back and the high
back<00:00:51.830> comes<00:00:52.010> in<00:00:52.190> two<00:00:52.370> versions<00:00:52.580> there<00:00:53.360> is<00:00:53.390> the

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
back comes in two versions there is the

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.360 
back comes in two versions there is the
St<00:00:54.380> which<00:00:54.560> I<00:00:54.650> believe<00:00:54.800> stands<00:00:55.010> for<00:00:55.190> standard

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
St which I believe stands for standard

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.540 
St which I believe stands for standard
and<00:00:55.730> there's<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.240> FL<00:00:56.690> which<00:00:57.080> is<00:00:57.380> already<00:00:57.980> or

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
and there's the FL which is already or

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.240 
and there's the FL which is already or
actually<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.880> has<00:00:59.000> a<00:00:59.210> forward<00:00:59.870> lean<00:01:00.250> adjusted

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
actually it has a forward lean adjusted

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.790 
actually it has a forward lean adjusted
on<00:01:01.490> the<00:01:01.660> high<00:01:02.660> back<00:01:02.900> and<00:01:03.110> then<00:01:03.470> this<00:01:03.620> little

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
on the high back and then this little

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.670 
on the high back and then this little
piece<00:01:04.159> is<00:01:04.369> when<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:04.970> want<00:01:05.150> to<00:01:05.239> run<00:01:05.439> no<00:01:06.439> backs

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
piece is when you want to run no backs

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.620 
piece is when you want to run no backs
and<00:01:06.920> no<00:01:07.100> backs<00:01:07.310> is<00:01:07.490> when<00:01:07.609> you<00:01:07.729> take<00:01:07.969> your<00:01:08.329> high

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
the board so let's check it all out as

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.620 
the board so let's check it all out as
you<00:01:38.749> can<00:01:38.840> see<00:01:38.990> right<00:01:39.259> here<00:01:39.609> on<00:01:40.609> one<00:01:41.030> side<00:01:41.270> you

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
you can see right here on one side you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.999 
you can see right here on one side you
can<00:01:41.810> adjust<00:01:42.109> the<00:01:42.560> height<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.889> the<00:01:42.979> ladder<00:01:45.009> to

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
then the base padding right here it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.069 
then the base padding right here it
actually<00:01:58.490> like<00:01:58.759> lifts<00:01:59.240> up<00:01:59.450> let's<00:01:59.899> see<00:01:59.959> if<00:02:00.049> I

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
actually like lifts up let's see if I

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.230

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
can show you this it slides out so you

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.050 
can show you this it slides out so you
can<00:02:02.450> adjust<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.529> if<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:04.279> got<00:02:04.369> really<00:02:04.639> big<00:02:04.819> feet

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060
