00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.500
 mercedes benz cls shooting break 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.360
 a combination in coupe design or man 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.760
 could also say a coupe in the combo 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.340
 design in addition to the four doors 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.380
 the cls coupÃ© has the shooting 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.510
 break variant of the luxury sports car 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.920
 even over a large tailgate and 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.920
 a considerable load space 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.020
 where combo it actually meets 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.660
 not exactly 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.450
 it's kind of inside 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.800
 Coupe well but of course it has the rear 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.690
 big trunk 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.520
 but that is different again 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.559
 as a combination because you are not a level 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.680
 loading area has what it is 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.180
 actually 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.980
 fact is that it is a 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.360
 sports car with five seats and 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.360
 a large tailgate acts 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 the formal language of the front resembles the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.130
 of the cls coupe s big mercedes star im 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.130
 beefy grille 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.570
 Daytime running lights in the lower 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.159
 front apron and a three-part led 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.860
 front light support the 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.960
 sporty look 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.270
 even the turn signal in the outside mirror works 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.979
 stylish 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.000
 in the side part, the creases fall 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.000
 and edge into the eye 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.070
 below the sterns emphasizes a chrome 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.070
 handle strip the width of the tail 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.250
 standard LED rear lights like them 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.100
 already known from the coupe are rich up 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.240
 far in the pages 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.009
 Visually, our test vehicle 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.020
 convince and also the standard 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.850
 rear air suspension fits the high 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.320
 Claims that we have to this car 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.890
 make and ensure a good one 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.890
 street location 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.769
 the handling of the vehicle requires 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.329
 However, a little exercise such as is the 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.549
 gear selector not in the 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.549
 center console but on the steering wheel 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.320
 something is getting used to 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.360
 automatic selector lever here on distracting stock 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.950
 on the right side at other cars 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.720
 there the wiper lever 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.000
 that is left at mercedes everything here in 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.870
 I integrated the turn signal lever personally 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.160
 I've wanted to do that a few times 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.180
 turn on the wiper and 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.550
 turn off here 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.120
 then you turn on the gear in unfortunately 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.740
 neutral or go back offers 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.150
 of course on the other side one 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.459
 advantage here in the middle where 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.880
 normally would be the selector lever has one 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.740
 every amount of space for storage 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.450
 Motorizations up to 386 kilowatts 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.790
 mercedes for the shooting break in the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.090
 offer 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.800
 well the 350 cdi i am just driver he 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.100
 is of course far from being competitive in performance 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.110
 pointed aggregate removed but for 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.510
 Fleet of it comes he also enough 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.659
 completely off 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.629
 the diesel unit makes 195 kw 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.519
 creates electronically regulated 250 km 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:31.250
 h tip and costs in germany well 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.689
 70,000 euros for the price offers 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.689
 mercedes a lot of extras 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.380
 on request you can of course the cls 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.450
 Shooting break also with every amount 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.850
 equip electronic knickknacks 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.200
 like for example one 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.880
 Adaptive cruise control distronic plus as 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.160
 that here in this vehicle the 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.990
 practical thing is he also slows down 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.720
 until the stand for example if you are in 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.640
 jam stops and by briefly tapping the 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.680
 accelerator then drives the car again 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.410
 continue and people continue to lead the way 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.970
 and then slows again have 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.410
 actually nice feature in the 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.110
 driving assistance package plus is included 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.250
 and in addition almost 2700 euros in 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.250
 Germany costs 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.220
 the seat adjustment in the doors must 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.370
 you first find yourself again 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.860
 self-explanatory that 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:31.319
 multifunction steering wheel classic elegant 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.800
 in the middle console is a quartz watch 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.800
 installed 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.750
 with the active multicontour seat package for 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.419
 a good 1500 euros offer the front seats 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.010
 optimal page stop for the second 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.010
 this is not available 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.990
 the luggage compartment holds 590 liters 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.990
 loading volume 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.880
 the term shooting break comes from 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.650
 By the way, from previous English hunting 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.730
 Vehicles that are particularly light and 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.730
 maneuverable 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.250
 there is still a question who should be so 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.500
 buy a car someone of a combination 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.900
 I really do not want it for him 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.740
 so optimal because of the loading edge on the back 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.880
 trunk 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.440
 who wants a travel limousine well the 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.420
 feel in here maybe one 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.820
 a bit cramped and like a coupÃ© wants 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.900
 he might get up sooner 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.420
 other shapes 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.960
 on the other side I think that 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.840
 optics from the outside and from the inside very nice 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.390
 and i might be fine for such a car 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.290
 excite if not the high price 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:47.600
 would be just under 62,000 euros costs 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.380
 basic model of cls shooting break in 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.380
 Germany
