far apart I plant my broccoli and I said

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.189 
far apart I plant my broccoli and I said
usually<00:04:49.759> go<00:04:49.910> like<00:04:50.090> this<00:04:50.300> with<00:04:50.539> your<00:04:50.660> arms<00:04:50.990> make

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
usually go like this with your arms make

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.140 
usually go like this with your arms make
a<00:04:51.229> big<00:04:51.470> circle<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:52.099> that's<00:04:52.639> how<00:04:52.759> big<00:04:53.030> the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
a big circle and that's how big the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.719 
a big circle and that's how big the
plant<00:04:53.389> is<00:04:53.599> going<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:53.870> get<00:04:54.280> soon<00:04:55.280> as<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.430> plants

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
plant is going to get soon as the plants

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.279 
plant is going to get soon as the plants
go<00:04:55.849> in<00:04:55.880> you<00:04:56.240> have<00:04:56.449> to<00:04:56.599> water<00:04:56.750> them<00:04:56.870> or<00:04:57.139> they'll

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
go in you have to water them or they'll

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.719 
go in you have to water them or they'll
die<00:04:57.320> but<00:04:57.800> the<00:04:57.860> roots<00:04:58.039> need<00:04:58.220> to<00:04:58.340> get<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.550> water

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
die but the roots need to get the water

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.420 
die but the roots need to get the water
so<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.060> roots<00:04:59.210> start<00:04:59.389> to<00:04:59.539> grow<00:04:59.690> and<00:04:59.930> expand<00:05:00.430> so

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
so the roots start to grow and expand so

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.870 
so the roots start to grow and expand so
I'm<00:05:01.639> gonna<00:05:01.789> try<00:05:02.030> mulch<00:05:02.810> this<00:05:03.260> year<00:05:03.699> I've<00:05:04.699> never

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
I'm gonna try mulch this year I've never

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.300 
I'm gonna try mulch this year I've never
tried<00:05:05.120> multiple<00:05:05.300> for<00:05:05.750> and<00:05:05.990> I<00:05:06.470> heard<00:05:07.010> that<00:05:07.159> it's

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
tried multiple for and I heard that it's

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.920 
tried multiple for and I heard that it's
a<00:05:07.400> good<00:05:07.520> idea<00:05:07.639> it<00:05:07.940> helps<00:05:08.180> keep<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.449> soil<00:05:08.630> nice

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
a good idea it helps keep the soil nice

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.379 
a good idea it helps keep the soil nice
and<00:05:09.139> cool<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:09.680> wet<00:05:09.919> I'm<00:05:10.430> hoping<00:05:11.030> that'll

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
and cool and wet I'm hoping that'll

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:16.200 
and cool and wet I'm hoping that'll
solve<00:05:11.599> some<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.840> my<00:05:11.990> broccoli<00:05:12.380> administration

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.430 

last<00:05:17.210> year<00:05:17.419> I<00:05:17.449> had<00:05:17.570> some<00:05:17.690> issues<00:05:17.930> with<00:05:17.960> carrots

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
last year I had some issues with carrots

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.839 
last year I had some issues with carrots
there<00:05:18.770> were<00:05:18.860> a<00:05:18.889> little<00:05:19.039> bit<00:05:19.220> short<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.550> stubby

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
there were a little bit short and stubby

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.370 
there were a little bit short and stubby
so<00:05:20.389> this<00:05:20.539> year<00:05:20.630> I'm<00:05:20.720> going<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.900> put<00:05:21.020> some<00:05:21.139> sand

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
so this year I'm going to put some sand

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.960 
so this year I'm going to put some sand
into<00:05:21.530> the<00:05:21.680> soil<00:05:21.860> so<00:05:22.159> it'll<00:05:22.430> help<00:05:22.580> them<00:05:22.760> to<00:05:22.849> grow

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
into the soil so it'll help them to grow

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.689 
into the soil so it'll help them to grow
longer<00:05:23.270> I<00:05:23.800> want<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.860> put<00:05:24.979> them<00:05:25.039> on<00:05:25.159> my<00:05:25.190> facebook

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
the sand pick up any big clumps

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:52.409 
the sand pick up any big clumps
so<00:05:51.459> what<00:05:51.550> I'm<00:05:51.639> gonna<00:05:51.729> do<00:05:51.909> is<00:05:51.939> I'm<00:05:52.089> just<00:05:52.300> gonna

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:56.699 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
make<00:05:52.800> little<00:05:53.800> mounds<00:05:54.279> not<00:05:54.669> too<00:05:54.849> high<00:05:55.469> but<00:05:56.469> just

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:56.709 
make little mounds not too high but just

00:05:56.709 --> 00:06:00.449 
make little mounds not too high but just
nice<00:05:56.919> rose<00:05:57.599> okay<00:05:59.069> so<00:06:00.069> we're<00:06:00.249> going<00:06:00.339> to<00:06:00.429> start

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:00.459 
nice rose okay so we're going to start

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:03.689 
nice rose okay so we're going to start
with<00:06:00.699> the<00:06:00.789> radish<00:06:01.709> half<00:06:02.709> to<00:06:03.009> one<00:06:03.189> centimeter

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:03.699 
with the radish half to one centimeter

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.079 
with the radish half to one centimeter
deep<00:06:03.909> five<00:06:04.209> centimeters<00:06:04.689> apart<00:06:04.809> sounds<00:06:05.800> good

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.089 
deep five centimeters apart sounds good

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:10.409 
deep five centimeters apart sounds good
making<00:06:07.089> a<00:06:07.149> little<00:06:07.360> trench<00:06:07.599> in<00:06:07.809> here<00:06:08.080> I<00:06:09.419> usually

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
making a little trench in here I usually

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.790 
making a little trench in here I usually
plant<00:06:10.899> two<00:06:11.110> seeds<00:06:11.699> in<00:06:12.699> each<00:06:12.879> spot<00:06:13.800> because

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
plant two seeds in each spot because

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.119 
plant two seeds in each spot because
sometimes<00:06:15.429> one<00:06:15.819> doesn't<00:06:16.149> germinate<00:06:16.330> and<00:06:17.129> then

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
sometimes one doesn't germinate and then

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.600 
sometimes one doesn't germinate and then
you<00:06:18.219> always<00:06:18.399> weed<00:06:18.699> them<00:06:18.849> out<00:06:18.939> after<00:06:20.610> normally
