get<00:02:29.590> this<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.100> stay<00:02:30.400> straight<00:02:30.989> but<00:02:32.040> if<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.250> has

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
get this to stay straight but if it has

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.370 
get this to stay straight but if it has
to<00:02:33.520> be<00:02:33.580> like<00:02:33.819> this<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.360> has<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.900> be<00:02:34.989> like<00:02:35.140> that

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
to be like this it has to be like that

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.590 
to be like this it has to be like that
but<00:02:36.300> now<00:02:37.300> I'm<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:38.340> hot<00:02:39.340> glue<00:02:39.370> on<00:02:40.030> all<00:02:40.360> my

portion<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:04.140> put<00:03:08.549> where<00:03:09.549> her<00:03:10.440> oh<00:03:12.269> must<00:03:13.269> be<00:03:13.450> very

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
portion I put where her oh must be very

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.570 
portion I put where her oh must be very
straightforward<00:03:13.959> where<00:03:14.410> her<00:03:14.500> bubble<00:03:14.890> go<00:03:15.040> this

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
straightforward where her bubble go this

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.960 
straightforward where her bubble go this
is<00:03:15.730> where<00:03:15.910> she<00:03:16.330> sits<00:03:16.660> because<00:03:17.560> on<00:03:18.100> most<00:03:18.549> chairs

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
is where she sits because on most chairs

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.310 
is where she sits because on most chairs
that's<00:03:19.269> probably<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.840> cushy<00:03:20.049> cushy<00:03:20.829> ace

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
that's probably the cushy cushy ace

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.990 
that's probably the cushy cushy ace
cushion<00:03:23.320> used<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.980> think<00:03:24.519> that's<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.760> word<00:03:24.880> I'm

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
scraps I didn't put any glue so you can

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.830 
scraps I didn't put any glue so you can
like<00:04:09.430> lift<00:04:09.700> up<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:09.970> fabric<00:04:10.329> right<00:04:10.480> there<00:04:10.720> and

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
like lift up the fabric right there and

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.240 
like lift up the fabric right there and
it's<00:04:11.049> really<00:04:11.350> easy<00:04:13.530> like<00:04:14.530> using<00:04:14.739> about<00:04:15.040> this

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
it's really easy like using about this

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.979 
it's really easy like using about this
much<00:04:15.459> pressure<00:04:15.880> I<00:04:16.030> can<00:04:16.150> only<00:04:16.389> get<00:04:16.600> it<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.810> like

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
much pressure I can only get it to like

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.159 
much pressure I can only get it to like
there<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:19.500> that's<00:04:20.500> what<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:21.250> is<00:04:21.900> next<00:04:22.900> I'm
