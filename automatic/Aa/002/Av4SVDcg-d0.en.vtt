Asst miscreants you can eliminate what
you've<00:00:59.100> drawn<00:00:59.460> later<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.600> add<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.230> limb

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
you've drawn later when you add the limb

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.799 
you've drawn later when you add the limb
which<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:01.980> conceal<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.910> you'll<00:01:03.600> be

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
which will conceal it but you'll be

certain that every part of the anatomy
is<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.689> just<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.350> right<00:01:07.560> position<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
is in just the right position when you

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.270 
is in just the right position when you
finish<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> filling<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> details<00:01:10.470> you

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
finish the filling in the details you

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.730 
finish the filling in the details you
erase<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.880> construction<00:01:12.540> lines<00:01:12.780> which<00:01:13.560> have

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
erase the construction lines which have

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.429 
erase the construction lines which have
been<00:01:13.890> drawn<00:01:14.310> through<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.810> result<00:01:16.229> should

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
been drawn through and the result should

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.320 
been drawn through and the result should
look<00:01:16.500> something<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.400> final<00:01:17.790> figure<00:01:18.119> of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
look something like this final figure of

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.320 
look something like this final figure of
old<00:01:18.630> shell<00:01:18.990> head<00:01:19.259> yeah<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.280> should<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:20.909> you're

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
old shell head yeah it should if you're

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.260 
old shell head yeah it should if you're
John<00:01:21.659> Beus<00:01:21.990> Emma<00:01:22.250> but<00:01:23.250> don't<00:01:23.460> worry<00:01:23.640> you'll

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
John Beus Emma but don't worry you'll

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.929 
John Beus Emma but don't worry you'll
get<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:24.840> enough<00:01:25.110> practice<00:01:25.820> remember<00:01:26.820> if

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
get it with enough practice remember if

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.060 
get it with enough practice remember if
it<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.119> easy<00:01:27.479> everyone<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.560> doing<00:01:28.829> it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
it was easy everyone would be doing it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.480 
it was easy everyone would be doing it
now<00:01:29.759> here's<00:01:30.570> another<00:01:30.659> example<00:01:31.430> this<00:01:32.430> time

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
now here's another example this time

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
now here's another example this time
we've<00:01:33.329> started<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> stick<00:01:34.439> figure

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
we've started with a stick figure

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.300 
we've started with a stick figure
in<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.159> typical<00:01:35.369> spider-man<00:01:36.360> pose<00:01:37.100> notice<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
in a typical spider-man pose notice the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.999 
in a typical spider-man pose notice the
way<00:01:38.460> his<00:01:38.790> left<00:01:39.150> knee<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.750> bending<00:01:40.170> towards<00:01:40.829> you

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
way his left knee is bending towards you

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.749 
way his left knee is bending towards you
that's<00:01:42.000> called<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:43.170> shortening<00:01:43.799> and<00:01:44.159> it's

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that's called for shortening and it's

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.789 
that's called for shortening and it's
done<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> lot<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.750> comic<00:01:46.140> book<00:01:46.350> artwork

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
done a lot in comic book artwork

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
done a lot in comic book artwork
although<00:01:47.280> we'll<00:01:47.640> get<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.939> more<00:01:48.119> about<00:01:48.360> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
although we'll get to more about that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.160 
although we'll get to more about that
later<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.430> see<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.360> done<00:01:51.689> mostly

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
later as you can see it's done mostly

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.340 
later as you can see it's done mostly
with<00:01:52.530> basic<00:01:53.130> cylinder<00:01:53.670> shapes<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.570> those

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
with basic cylinder shapes and those

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.670 
with basic cylinder shapes and those
loose<00:01:55.740> little<00:01:56.340> lines<00:01:57.200> until<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> figure

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
loose little lines until the figure

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.020 
loose little lines until the figure
starts<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.369> take<00:01:59.610> shape

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
starts to take shape

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.859 
starts to take shape
then<00:02:00.960> as<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.560> continue<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:02.820> will<00:02:02.869> emphasize

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
then as you continue you will emphasize

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.050 
then as you continue you will emphasize
the<00:02:04.290> important<00:02:04.920> lines<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.700> eventually

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
the important lines and you eventually

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.889 
the important lines and you eventually
lose<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.719> others<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.789> John<00:02:08.789> says<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.629> like

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
lose the others as John says it's like

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.199 
lose the others as John says it's like
being<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.590> sculptor<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.520> you're<00:02:11.580> you're

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
being a sculptor and you're you're

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.630 
being a sculptor and you're you're
building<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.050> figure

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
building this figure
