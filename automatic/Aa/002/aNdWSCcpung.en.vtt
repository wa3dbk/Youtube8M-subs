in<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.270> movement<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.260> eliminate<00:02:14.180> by

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
in that movement that I eliminate by

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.320 
in that movement that I eliminate by
pausing<00:02:16.280> with<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.370> crack<00:02:17.700> above<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.150> weight

stack<00:02:19.220> relaxing<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> lake<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:21.840> slowly

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
stack relaxing the lake and it's slowly

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.610 
stack relaxing the lake and it's slowly
slowly<00:02:22.920> dragging<00:02:23.459> out<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.940> hole

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
slowly dragging out of the hole

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.370 
slowly dragging out of the hole
which<00:02:25.620> is<00:02:25.770> why<00:02:25.980> even<00:02:26.660> if<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.750> don't<00:02:27.989> get<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
which is why even if I don't get to the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.530 
which is why even if I don't get to the
top<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.010> movement

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
top of the movement

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.960 
top of the movement
because<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.780> entire<00:02:31.050> hamstring<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.880> have

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
because the entire hamstring you have

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.920 
because the entire hamstring you have
the<00:02:33.090> continuous<00:02:33.600> tension<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.320> entire<00:02:34.620> time

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
the continuous tension in entire time

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.720 
the continuous tension in entire time
and<00:02:36.930> now<00:02:37.170> we've<00:02:37.350> got<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> total<00:02:37.800> including<00:02:38.489> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
and now we've got a total including the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.210 
and now we've got a total including the
drops<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.900> six<00:02:40.230> reps<00:02:40.560> and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
drops of six reps and

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.710 
drops of six reps and
force<00:02:41.520> reps<00:02:42.680> but<00:02:44.120> fucking<00:02:45.120> destroys<00:02:45.510> our
