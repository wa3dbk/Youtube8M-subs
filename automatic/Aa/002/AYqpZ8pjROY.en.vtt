00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
you have on your cable your throttle

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.210 
you have on your cable your throttle
cable<00:01:29.640> comes<00:01:29.850> down<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.650> splits

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
cable comes down to this here and splits

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.830 
cable comes down to this here and splits
off<00:01:32.640> into<00:01:32.700> two<00:01:33.299> cables<00:01:34.729> one<00:01:35.729> here<00:01:36.150> goes<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
off into two cables one here goes to the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.800 
off into two cables one here goes to the
carb<00:01:38.720> moves<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:40.430> this<00:01:41.430> other<00:01:41.700> cable<00:01:42.210> runs

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
carb moves that this other cable runs

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.350 
carb moves that this other cable runs
down<00:01:43.020> through<00:01:43.049> here<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:44.520> your<00:01:44.670> oil<00:01:44.820> injection

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
down through here for your oil injection

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.810 
down through here for your oil injection
pump<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> moves<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.710> now<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.490> set

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
pump and it moves that so now to set

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.770
