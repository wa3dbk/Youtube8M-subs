color it's not black and white and
there's<00:01:17.310> often<00:01:17.610> well<00:01:18.240> there's<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.630> current

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
there's often well there's a current

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.679 
there's often well there's a current

trend from the old analog systems into

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.820 
trend from the old analog systems into
the<00:01:22.020> IP<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.799> networked<00:01:23.159> by<00:01:23.460> CCTV<00:01:24.530> is<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the IP and networked by CCTV is that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.280 
the IP and networked by CCTV is that
have<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> found<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.840> helping<00:01:28.140> your

business<00:01:28.409> definitely<00:01:29.340> certainly<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.820> think<00:01:29.970> if

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
business definitely certainly I think if

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.020 
business definitely certainly I think if
you<00:01:30.900> look<00:01:31.079> at<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.290> our<00:01:32.100> growth<00:01:32.610> rate<00:01:32.850> in

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
you look at the our growth rate in

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.870 
you look at the our growth rate in
Australia<00:01:33.630> over<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> last<00:01:34.110> three<00:01:34.979> years<00:01:35.009> we

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
Australia over the last three years we

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.700 
Australia over the last three years we
are<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.270> between<00:01:36.479> forty<00:01:37.229> percent<00:01:37.530> or

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
are going between forty percent or

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.990 
are going between forty percent or
seventy<00:01:38.040> percent<00:01:38.189> over<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.640> last<00:01:38.729> three

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
seventy percent over the last three

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.819 
seventy percent over the last three
years<00:01:39.030> well<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.229> South<00:01:40.470> Asia<00:01:40.650> Pacific

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
years well and in South Asia Pacific

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.260 
years well and in South Asia Pacific
alone<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.700> Australia<00:01:42.600> okay<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:44.270> big

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
alone in Australia okay and the big

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.230 
alone in Australia okay and the big
driver<00:01:45.600> behind<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:47.180> recorded<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
driver behind this is recorded a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
driver behind this is recorded a
convergent<00:01:48.840> which<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.259> convert<00:01:49.920> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
convergent which is convert the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.330 
convergent which is convert the
conversion<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.880> analog<00:01:51.780> into<00:01:52.170> digital<00:01:52.500> that's

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
conversion of analog into digital that's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.830 
conversion of analog into digital that's
right<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:53.970> customers<00:01:54.479> are<00:01:54.570> actually

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
right and so customers are actually

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.649 
right and so customers are actually
going<00:01:55.020> straight<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.530> IP<00:01:55.920> video<00:01:56.820> now<00:01:57.270> rather

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
going straight to IP video now rather

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.679 
going straight to IP video now rather
than<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.250> starting<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.000> an<00:02:00.299> analog

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
than you know starting with an analog

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.630 
than you know starting with an analog
system<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.259> building<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.619> from<00:02:01.860> their<00:02:02.040> new

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
system and building up from their new

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.429 
system and building up from their new
customers<00:02:03.329> typically<00:02:03.719> will<00:02:04.079> go<00:02:04.200> straight

communications will have a solution yes
in<00:03:06.590> fact<00:03:06.620> we<00:03:07.160> do<00:03:07.670> not<00:03:07.910> have<00:03:08.750> all<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:10.040> products

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
in fact we do not have all the products

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.590 
in fact we do not have all the products
but<00:03:10.940> we<00:03:11.330> use<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.930> partnership<00:03:12.380> model<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:14.209> SS

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
but we use a partnership model and SS

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.660 
but we use a partnership model and SS
today<00:03:14.870> we<00:03:15.080> have<00:03:15.230> more<00:03:15.260> than<00:03:15.470> 800<00:03:16.130> partners<00:03:16.520> out

there that manufactures different

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.050 
there that manufactures different
solutions<00:03:21.080> so<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:21.890> would<00:03:22.130> say<00:03:22.160> most<00:03:22.670> of<00:03:22.880> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
solutions so I would say most of the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.850 
solutions so I would say most of the
mainstream<00:03:23.390> solutions<00:03:23.959> should<00:03:24.170> be<00:03:24.500> able<00:03:24.650> to

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
mainstream solutions should be able to

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:25.930 
mainstream solutions should be able to
