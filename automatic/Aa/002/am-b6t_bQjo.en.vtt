00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
okay welcome to the outer box review of

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.279 
okay welcome to the outer box review of
the<00:00:21.560> scale<00:00:22.130> C<00:00:22.430> Leopard<00:00:23.000> process<00:00:23.599> motor<00:00:23.869> combo

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
the scale C Leopard process motor combo

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.200 
the scale C Leopard process motor combo
and<00:00:24.529> this<00:00:24.890> is<00:00:25.099> a<00:00:25.130> 110<00:00:25.730> scale

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
and this is a 110 scale

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.600 
and this is a 110 scale
Rossi's<00:00:26.779> motor<00:00:27.020> system<00:00:27.439> and<00:00:27.680> actually<00:00:28.520> it

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610 
Rossi's motor system and actually it

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.850 
Rossi's motor system and actually it
came<00:00:28.730> in<00:00:28.910> today<00:00:29.060> from<00:00:29.329> bomb<00:00:29.599> Farsi<00:00:30.079> and<00:00:30.320> this

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
came in today from bomb Farsi and this

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.069 
came in today from bomb Farsi and this
is<00:00:31.039> an<00:00:31.250> improved<00:00:31.759> version

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
is an improved version

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.140 
is an improved version
I<00:00:33.110> know<00:00:33.470> previously<00:00:34.190> there<00:00:34.340> was<00:00:34.489> a<00:00:34.820> version

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
I know previously there was a version

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.630 
I know previously there was a version
that<00:00:35.780> had<00:00:35.989> some<00:00:36.199> issues<00:00:36.559> with<00:00:36.589> the<00:00:37.070> motor<00:00:37.339> but

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
that had some issues with the motor but

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.390 
that had some issues with the motor but
this<00:00:37.760> one<00:00:37.940> apparently<00:00:38.420> is<00:00:38.809> improved<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.040> let's

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
this one apparently is improved so let's

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.979 
this one apparently is improved so let's
get<00:00:40.580> things<00:00:40.790> out<00:00:40.879> of<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.000> box<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:41.420> see<00:00:41.839> what

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
get things out of the box and see what

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.540 
get things out of the box and see what
the<00:00:42.110> quality<00:00:42.320> looks<00:00:42.800> like<00:00:43.010> for<00:00:43.220> such<00:00:43.370> a

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
the quality looks like for such a

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.720 
the quality looks like for such a
reasonable<00:00:44.000> price<00:00:44.330> coming<00:00:44.930> up<00:00:45.050> first<00:00:45.290> is<00:00:45.650> the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
reasonable price coming up first is the

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.790 
reasonable price coming up first is the
instruction<00:00:46.730> manual<00:00:47.089> and<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:48.260> can<00:00:48.440> see<00:00:48.620> it's

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
instruction manual and you can see it's

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.970 
instruction manual and you can see it's
a<00:00:48.920> colored<00:00:49.309> instruction<00:00:50.030> manual<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:51.829> get

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
a colored instruction manual and you get

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.260 
a colored instruction manual and you get
it<00:00:52.100> open<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:53.980> it<00:00:54.980> seems<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.340> be<00:00:55.579> you<00:00:56.000> can<00:00:56.149> see

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
it open and it seems to be you can see

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.790 
it open and it seems to be you can see
it's<00:00:56.390> version<00:00:56.600> 2<00:00:56.960> but<00:00:57.140> actually<00:00:57.469> it's<00:00:57.590> kind<00:00:57.770> of

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
it's version 2 but actually it's kind of

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.209 
it's version 2 but actually it's kind of
like<00:00:57.949> version<00:00:58.399> 3<00:00:58.730> ready<00:00:58.969> and<00:01:00.219> apparently

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
like version 3 ready and apparently

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.950 
like version 3 ready and apparently
they've<00:01:01.399> improved<00:01:01.820> certain<00:01:02.300> things<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:02.690> nice

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
they've improved certain things so nice

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.450 
they've improved certain things so nice
instruction<00:01:03.469> manual<00:01:03.769> seems<00:01:04.039> to<00:01:04.190> be<00:01:04.280> quite

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
instruction manual seems to be quite

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.460 
instruction manual seems to be quite
English<00:01:04.850> 5<00:01:06.070> coming<00:01:07.070> next<00:01:07.399> is<00:01:08.050> the<00:01:09.050> motor

we<00:01:30.020> have<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.259> speed<00:01:30.740> controller<00:01:31.069> programming

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
we have the speed controller programming

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.600 
we have the speed controller programming
card<00:01:32.319> and<00:01:33.319> the<00:01:33.590> programming<00:01:34.069> card<00:01:34.220> looks<00:01:34.399> very

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
card and the programming card looks very

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.479 
card and the programming card looks very
nice<00:01:34.759> I<00:01:34.970> see<00:01:35.179> and<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.780> instructions<00:01:36.470> are<00:01:36.739> all

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:37.489 
nice I see and the instructions are all

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:39.880 
nice I see and the instructions are all
to<00:01:38.209> the<00:01:38.390> rear<00:01:38.750> of<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:39.140> programming<00:01:39.739> card

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
to the rear of the programming card

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.160 
to the rear of the programming card
that's<00:01:40.550> very<00:01:40.789> nice<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.450> instructions<00:01:41.989> are

that's very nice the instructions are

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.320 
that's very nice the instructions are
not<00:01:42.380> only<00:01:43.009> in<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.280> book<00:01:43.429> but<00:01:43.729> they're<00:01:43.910> also<00:01:44.090> on

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330

not only in the book but they're also on
the<00:01:44.360> card<00:01:44.630> says<00:01:44.869> nice<00:01:45.819> lastly<00:01:46.819> but<00:01:47.090> not<00:01:47.149> this

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
the card says nice lastly but not this

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:53.740 
the card says nice lastly but not this
is<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:50.349> speed<00:01:51.349> controller<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.539> this<00:01:53.539> looks

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
is the speed controller and this looks

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.719 
is the speed controller and this looks
very<00:01:53.989> good<00:01:54.110> quality<00:01:54.349> and<00:01:54.950> looks<00:01:55.280> quite<00:01:55.550> nice

very good quality and looks quite nice
actually<00:01:55.940> for<00:01:56.360> its<00:01:56.479> cheap<00:01:56.869> reasonable<00:01:57.349> price

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
actually for its cheap reasonable price

and comes with the deans connector on on
here<00:02:01.300> once<00:02:02.300> again<00:02:02.390> says<00:02:02.720> version<00:02:03.110> 2<00:02:03.289> but<00:02:03.649> it's

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
here once again says version 2 but it's

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.900 
here once again says version 2 but it's
had<00:02:04.640> improvements<00:02:05.450> from<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.899> factory<00:02:06.470> and

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
had improvements from the factory and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.550 
had improvements from the factory and
once<00:02:07.910> again<00:02:08.060> bullet<00:02:08.450> connect<00:02:08.810> our<00:02:09.020> cooling

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
once again bullet connect our cooling

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.460 
once again bullet connect our cooling
fan<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.039> all<00:02:10.879> looks<00:02:11.060> really<00:02:11.900> good<00:02:12.200> quality

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.250 
fan and all looks really good quality
actually<00:02:13.099> for<00:02:13.340> its<00:02:13.610> price<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.239> apart<00:02:15.140> from

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
actually for its price so apart from
