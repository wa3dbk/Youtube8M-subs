00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.790 
just getting into and they had done a
show<00:00:38.850> called<00:00:39.149> tron<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:40.110> which<00:00:40.290> was<00:00:40.440> also

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
show called tron know which was also

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.990 
show called tron know which was also
kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.460> vein<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.969> if

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
kind of going in that vein so if

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.740 
kind of going in that vein so if
something<00:00:42.930> new<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:44.030> when<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.149> decided<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.600> do

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
something new that when we decided to do

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.229 
something new that when we decided to do
rebels<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:47.160> all<00:00:47.370> kind<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.850> thought<00:00:48.059> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
rebels we all kind of thought I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
rebels we all kind of thought I
especially<00:00:48.570> felt<00:00:48.809> having<00:00:49.170> finished<00:00:49.440> Clone

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920

especially felt having finished Clone
Wars<00:00:50.160> out<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:51.390> had<00:00:51.480> gotten<00:00:51.660> too<00:00:52.050> intense

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
Wars out that we had gotten too intense

Star<00:00:53.910> Wars<00:00:53.940> exists<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.289> part<00:00:55.559> of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
Star Wars exists in it I think part of

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.130 
Star Wars exists in it I think part of
what<00:00:55.829> makes<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.340> great<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.000> fun<00:00:57.270> one

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
what makes it great is that it's fun one

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
what makes it great is that it's fun one
of<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> things<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.680> unifies<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.820> all

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
of the things that unifies it with all

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.660 
of the things that unifies it with all
people<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.840> makes<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.140> laugh<00:01:01.670> it

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
people that it makes you laugh it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.340 
people that it makes you laugh it
doesn't<00:01:03.030> take<00:01:03.149> itself<00:01:03.300> too<00:01:03.629> seriously<00:01:03.780> all

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
doesn't take itself too seriously all

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.789 
doesn't take itself too seriously all
the<00:01:04.500> time<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.750> get<00:01:07.049> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> intense

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the time so you get kind of intense

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
the time so you get kind of intense
moments<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.460> very<00:01:08.700> light<00:01:08.880> moments<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
moments with very light moments and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.480 
moments with very light moments and
clone<00:01:10.170> wars<00:01:10.350> was<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> little<00:01:10.740> bit<00:01:10.890> too<00:01:11.040> heavy<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
clone wars was a little bit too heavy in

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.330 
clone wars was a little bit too heavy in
the<00:01:11.610> end<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:13.080> lost<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.740> lot<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.950> some

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the end I think we lost a lot of some

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.070 
the end I think we lost a lot of some
viewers<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.909> gained<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.330> lot<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.479> other<00:01:15.689> years

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
viewers we gained a lot of other years

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.170 
viewers we gained a lot of other years
older<00:01:16.320> viewers<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:17.460> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> look<00:01:17.759> at<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> new

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
older viewers but if you look at a new

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.149 
older viewers but if you look at a new
hope<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.630> new<00:01:18.750> hope<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.560> unique<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:19.979> its

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
hope a new hope is really unique and its

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.660 
hope a new hope is really unique and its
ability<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.549> kind<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.880> reach<00:01:21.659> everybody<00:01:22.049> and

describe<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> old<00:01:54.420> films

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and so we want to fit a little more to

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.940 
and so we want to fit a little more to
that<00:01:57.210> less<00:01:57.540> political<00:01:58.170> things<00:01:58.470> and<00:01:58.770> more

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that less political things and more

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.800 
that less political things and more
character-driven<00:01:59.850> things<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.540> Star<00:02:00.780> Wars

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
character-driven things in Star Wars

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.260 
character-driven things in Star Wars
rebels<00:02:01.230> that's<00:02:01.410> a<00:02:01.500> big<00:02:01.650> difference<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.040> me

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
rebels that's a big difference to me

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.410 
rebels that's a big difference to me
another<00:02:03.270> bottle<00:02:03.780> yeah<00:02:04.580> yeah<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.640> definitely

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
another bottle yeah yeah you definitely

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.540 
another bottle yeah yeah you definitely
approached<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.290> lot<00:02:07.470> of<00:02:07.590> war<00:02:07.740> scenes<00:02:08.010> with<00:02:08.520> a

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
approached a lot of war scenes with a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.970 
approached a lot of war scenes with a
lighter<00:02:08.910> fun<00:02:09.750> temple<00:02:10.260> even<00:02:10.530> when<00:02:10.710> you<00:02:10.740> have

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980 
lighter fun temple even when you have

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.790 
lighter fun temple even when you have
your<00:02:11.220> your<00:02:11.970> danger<00:02:12.650> there's<00:02:13.650> life

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
your your danger there's life

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
your your danger there's life
life-and-death<00:02:14.730> stakes<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.630> lot<00:02:15.750> more

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
life-and-death stakes it's a lot more

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.890 
life-and-death stakes it's a lot more
swashbuckling<00:02:16.590> fun<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.700> think<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.240> even

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
swashbuckling fun and I think that even

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.510 
swashbuckling fun and I think that even
when<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.140> hearken<00:02:19.470> back<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:19.980> usage<00:02:20.370> of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
when you hearken back to more usage of

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.080 
when you hearken back to more usage of
John<00:02:20.970> Williams<00:02:21.300> score<00:02:21.500> there's<00:02:22.500> that

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
John Williams score there's that

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.870 
John Williams score there's that
adventure<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.450> kind<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.170> pirate<00:02:25.530> movie

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
adventure and kind of the pirate movie

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.500 
adventure and kind of the pirate movie
so<00:02:26.880> we<00:02:27.030> definitely<00:02:28.550> kind<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.640> draw<00:02:29.850> it<00:02:30.180> in

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
so we definitely kind of draw it in

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.150 
so we definitely kind of draw it in
create<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.050> situations<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.800> even<00:02:32.070> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
create the situations and even the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.830 
create the situations and even the
designs<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.670> think<00:02:32.910> you're<00:02:33.450> flat<00:02:33.660> back

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
designs I think you're flat back

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.110 
designs I think you're flat back
tomorrow<00:02:34.230> yeah<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> little<00:02:35.580> bit<00:02:35.670> i<00:02:35.730> mean<00:02:35.910> we<00:02:36.030> had

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
tomorrow yeah a little bit i mean we had

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.300 
tomorrow yeah a little bit i mean we had
always<00:02:36.300> tried<00:02:36.660> on<00:02:37.020> tours<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.740> go<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.130> idea

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
always tried on tours to go to this idea

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.700 
always tried on tours to go to this idea
of<00:02:38.550> moving<00:02:38.730> penguins<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.660> was<00:02:39.810> one<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
of moving penguins that was one of the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.500 
of moving penguins that was one of the
first<00:02:40.950> things<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.460> know<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:42.330> when<00:02:42.450> you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
first things you know that when you

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.420 
first things you know that when you
talked<00:02:42.750> about<00:02:42.840> was<00:02:43.140> if<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.470> can<00:02:43.770> pulse<00:02:44.100> it<00:02:44.310> on

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
talked about was if you can pulse it on

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.220 
talked about was if you can pulse it on
any<00:02:44.670> frame<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.360> looks<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:45.780> a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
any frame and it looks like it's a

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.920 
any frame and it looks like it's a
painting<00:02:46.800> at<00:02:47.100> least<00:02:47.280> as<00:02:47.430> much<00:02:47.640> as<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.870> a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
painting at least as much as it is a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.140 
painting at least as much as it is a
still<00:02:49.290> of<00:02:49.560> CG<00:02:50.070> then<00:02:50.340> we're<00:02:50.760> kind<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:51.000> getting

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
still of CG then we're kind of getting

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.320 
still of CG then we're kind of getting
you<00:02:51.690> know<00:02:51.810> we're<00:02:52.050> getting<00:02:52.140> somewhere<00:02:53.240> but<00:02:54.240> as

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
you know we're getting somewhere but as

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.940 
you know we're getting somewhere but as
we<00:02:54.480> went<00:02:54.690> along<00:02:54.810> with<00:02:55.140> clone<00:02:55.320> wars<00:02:55.530> we<00:02:55.680> found

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
we went along with clone wars we found

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.480 
we went along with clone wars we found
them<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:57.140> photographic<00:02:58.140> approach<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.890> shooting

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
them a photographic approach to shooting

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.820 
them a photographic approach to shooting
things<00:02:59.790> was<00:03:00.090> actually<00:03:00.450> helping<00:03:01.290> with<00:03:01.680> those

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
things was actually helping with those

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.980 
things was actually helping with those
more<00:03:02.070> dramatic<00:03:02.520> with<00:03:02.730> big<00:03:03.060> big<00:03:03.330> areas<00:03:03.690> very

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
more dramatic with big big areas very

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.810 
more dramatic with big big areas very
dark<00:03:04.320> shadow<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.890> very<00:03:05.070> hot<00:03:05.370> sort<00:03:05.730> of

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
dark shadow and very hot sort of

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.880 
dark shadow and very hot sort of
highlights<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:06.959> almost<00:03:07.230> had<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.470> sort<00:03:07.800> of

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
highlights and almost had that sort of

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.610 
highlights and almost had that sort of
Sin<00:03:08.100> City<00:03:08.370> harsh<00:03:09.209> relighting<00:03:09.930> sort<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:10.440> thing

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
Sin City harsh relighting sort of thing

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.170 
Sin City harsh relighting sort of thing
and<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.220> worked<00:03:11.400> with<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.670> tone<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.150> show

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
and it worked with the tone of the show

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.820 
and it worked with the tone of the show
because<00:03:12.720> we're<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.020> getting<00:03:13.350> darker<00:03:13.800> and

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
because we're just getting darker and

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.770 
because we're just getting darker and
you<00:03:14.040> could<00:03:14.190> sort<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.430> lose<00:03:14.670> characters<00:03:15.390> into

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
you could sort of lose characters into

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.910 
you could sort of lose characters into
big<00:03:16.560> feelings<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.310> black<00:03:17.550> on<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.880> screen<00:03:18.920> but

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
big feelings of black on the screen but

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.250 
big feelings of black on the screen but
I<00:03:20.010> think<00:03:20.250> we've<00:03:20.400> gone<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.000> far<00:03:21.030> down<00:03:21.540> on<00:03:21.780> top<00:03:21.989> on

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
I think we've gone so far down on top on

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.250 
I think we've gone so far down on top on
certain<00:03:22.650> sort<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.070> ours<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.730> made<00:03:24.180> sense<00:03:24.450> you

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
certain sort of ours that made sense you

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.470 
certain sort of ours that made sense you
know<00:03:25.290> for<00:03:25.650> what<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.890> story<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.220> doing<00:03:26.580> but<00:03:26.790> as

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
know for what the story is doing but as

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.300 
know for what the story is doing but as
something<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:28.080> turn<00:03:28.260> on<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.470> TV<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:28.980> watch

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
something to turn on the TV and watch

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.400 
something to turn on the TV and watch
you<00:03:30.000> were<00:03:30.120> looking<00:03:30.390> at<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.510> largely<00:03:30.930> dark

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
you were looking at a largely dark

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.280 
you were looking at a largely dark
screen<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:32.130> fuse<00:03:32.459> or<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.820> dramatic<00:03:33.330> shapes

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
screen the fuse or the dramatic shapes

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.170 
screen the fuse or the dramatic shapes
that<00:03:34.590> were<00:03:34.830> moving<00:03:35.160> across<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.880> think

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
that were moving across it and I think

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.600

for<00:03:36.930> rebels<00:03:37.320> because<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.800> is<00:03:37.920> more<00:03:38.250> sort<00:03:38.550> of

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
for rebels because it is more sort of

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:39.990 
for rebels because it is more sort of

and then he left concealed or stuff
mainly<00:05:10.150> alone<00:05:10.479> so<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:11.080> think<00:05:11.530> that<00:05:11.740> was<00:05:11.860> one<00:05:11.890> of

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.430 
mainly alone so I think that was one of
the<00:05:12.160> main<00:05:12.280> things<00:05:12.610> and<00:05:12.880> then<00:05:13.000> definitely<00:05:13.440> the

the main things and then definitely the

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.830 
the main things and then definitely the

four episodes of this for three this

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
before so you didn't really span a whole

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.150 
before so you didn't really span a whole
season<00:05:43.060> with<00:05:43.419> the<00:05:43.510> same<00:05:43.720> people<00:05:44.160> sometimes

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
activo we wanted a soca would be like

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.500 
activo we wanted a soca would be like
the<00:05:46.930> main

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
the main

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.630 
the main
but<00:05:47.840> they<00:05:47.930> weren't<00:05:48.080> everything<00:05:48.710> so<00:05:48.920> here

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
but they weren't everything so here

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.160 
but they weren't everything so here
you're<00:05:49.820> with<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.210> same<00:05:50.420> character<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:51.050> whole

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.070 
you're with the same character the whole
time<00:05:51.230> and<00:05:51.770> I<00:05:51.860> think<00:05:51.920> that<00:05:52.220> that<00:05:52.900> lets<00:05:53.900> you

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
time and I think that that lets you

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.190 
time and I think that that lets you
attach<00:05:54.350> more<00:05:54.890> to<00:05:55.040> them<00:05:55.130> emotionally<00:05:55.730> and<00:05:56.200> then

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
attach more to them emotionally and then

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.230 
attach more to them emotionally and then
you're<00:05:57.380> invested<00:05:57.920> and<00:05:58.130> then<00:05:58.670> you<00:05:58.790> can<00:05:58.970> kind<00:05:59.120> of

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
you're invested and then you can kind of

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.690 
you're invested and then you can kind of
work<00:05:59.450> the<00:05:59.630> story<00:05:59.930> manipulate<00:06:00.620> kind<00:06:01.520> of<00:06:01.610> the

work the story manipulate kind of the

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.000 
work the story manipulate kind of the
emotions<00:06:01.970> which<00:06:02.390> that<00:06:02.750> all<00:06:02.990> affects<00:06:03.470> the<00:06:03.650> tone
