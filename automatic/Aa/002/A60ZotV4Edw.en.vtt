the healthcare enterprise one of the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.900 
the healthcare enterprise one of the
things<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> challenge<00:00:50.430> though<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
things that's a challenge though is that

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
things that's a challenge though is that
using<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.780> barcode<00:00:52.110> scanner<00:00:52.170> with<00:00:52.620> something

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
using a barcode scanner with something

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.889 
using a barcode scanner with something
like<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.219> if<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.879> nurse<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> using<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> phone

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
like this if a nurse is using a phone

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.450 
like this if a nurse is using a phone
and<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.770> phone<00:00:56.039> they're

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and they have this phone they're

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.680 
and they have this phone they're
carrying<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:56.879> them<00:00:57.120> they<00:00:57.270> may<00:00:57.360> work<00:00:57.539> on

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
carrying with them they may work on

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.580 
carrying with them they may work on
several<00:00:57.930> different<00:00:58.140> workstations

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
several different workstations

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.439 
several different workstations
throughout<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> day<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.969> we've<00:01:00.120> come<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.329> with

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
throughout the day so we've come up with

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.569 
throughout the day so we've come up with
a<00:01:00.600> clever<00:01:00.899> application<00:01:01.559> called<00:01:02.250> quick

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
a clever application called quick

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.329 
a clever application called quick
barcode<00:01:03.059> connect<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.660> QVC<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.739> allows<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
barcode connect or QVC it allows you to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.929 
barcode connect or QVC it allows you to
pair<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.060> handset<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.939> nurses

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
pair this handset with the nurses

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.760 
pair this handset with the nurses
workstation<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> way<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.500> works

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
workstation here so the way this works

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.890 
workstation here so the way this works
is<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.310> very<00:01:11.369> simple<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.210> roll<00:01:12.630> up<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
is it's very simple I just roll up the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.750 
is it's very simple I just roll up the
cursor<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.220> corners<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
cursor up to one of the corners on the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
cursor up to one of the corners on the
screen<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.720> pops<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.110> barcode<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
screen and up pops a barcode that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.679 
screen and up pops a barcode that
barcode<00:01:17.520> there<00:01:17.729> has<00:01:17.939> encoded<00:01:18.570> information

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
barcode there has encoded information

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.560 
barcode there has encoded information
about<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:20.670> workstation<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> want<00:01:21.509> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
about the the workstation that I want to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.320 
about the the workstation that I want to
pair<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:22.170> take<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> 8450<00:01:23.400> handset<00:01:23.880> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
pair with I take the 8450 handset and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.800 
pair with I take the 8450 handset and
just<00:01:24.509> do

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
just do

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.740 
just do
scan<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.890> barcode<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> screen<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.600> now

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
scan that barcode on the screen and now

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.109 
scan that barcode on the screen and now
these<00:01:27.930> devices<00:01:28.470> are<00:01:28.590> paired<00:01:28.799> together<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.939> now

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
these devices are paired together so now

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.480 
these devices are paired together so now
the<00:01:30.990> information<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.649> this<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.920> asking<00:01:32.280> for

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the information that this is asking for

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
the information that this is asking for
for<00:01:32.670> example<00:01:32.759> it's<00:01:33.149> asking<00:01:33.420> for<00:01:33.479> my<00:01:33.630> employee

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
for example it's asking for my employee

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.740 
for example it's asking for my employee
ID<00:01:34.320> information<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:35.220> take<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.700> employee<00:01:36.509> ID

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
ID information I take a employee ID

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.700 
ID information I take a employee ID
badge<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.530> scan<00:01:38.130> my<00:01:38.810> my<00:01:39.810> barcode<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.470> badge

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
badge I scan my my barcode on that badge

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.609
