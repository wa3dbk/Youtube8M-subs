farther you go down the more it's broken
down<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.259> more<00:02:01.549> fine-grain<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.820> material<00:02:03.600> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
down the more fine-grain the material is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.289 
down the more fine-grain the material is
so<00:02:04.649> um<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.430> let's<00:02:05.579> go<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> greenhouse
