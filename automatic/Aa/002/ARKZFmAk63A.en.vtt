00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.560
 vacation stayed a few days away from the canal 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.889
 The one who accompanies me must have seen that I 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.360
 I went to travel and I went to London and I went 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.480
 to paris 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.970
 so the cold there is very cool and now 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.060
 It's coming back then to start the year. 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.010
 officially with many new features 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.930
 lots of great product to show 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.599
 For you to test to make firewood. 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.810
 on the super excited blog that is going to be 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.320
 2003 and a very good year 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.790
 the blog here for the channel also and me 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.460
 I'm going to make a video showing all the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.050
 shopping but this video as you already 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.590
 must have seen here in the title is a 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.960
 video to show magnetic enamels 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.180
 I knew of the existence of these votes but 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.610
 I had never used them myself then 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.780
 when I saw there in london 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.109
 It has to take a lot and then 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.960
 It was more incredible than I ever imagined 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.970
 which could be I then bought two 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:13.439
 enamels that are these here a blue and a 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:15.990
 gold in that super pharmacy a network 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.159
 pharmacy is known here as 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.680
 It's out in london so there's a lot to 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.610
 every corner has a blitz and here 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.530
 appeared the design han the one 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.630
 magnetic enamel move away but let's go 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.280
 start from the beginning so that it is 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.610
 magnetic enamel 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.720
 you pass the enamel is normal and in 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.150
 the enamel has broad as if it were a 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.490
 particle as if it were iron knows 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.340
 effect of iron and brother for example 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.909
 so when you approach this magnet that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.030
 he has here on top of the nail he creates this 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.310
 effect here then you pass a layer 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.619
 I hope it happens to me again immediately 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.810
 then if you pass the second layer 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.240
 that the enamel is still wet 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.640
 You're going to get this cap this part. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.670
 here and will do so upstairs will not 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.270
 lean over obvious snows only approach him 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.380
 will create the effect that having the drawing 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.720
 it is enough that in my fingernail and of that I already 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.780
 and I'll show'll make one for now 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.400
 You're very close to see you. 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.790
 how it works and I think three paid 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.570
 pounds each enamel gives less than 10 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.490
 real 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.170
 and here in Brazil I know that apothecary 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.660
 I'm launching, I think it's over. 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.400
 launch a magnetic enamel that also 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.830
 I know it was included in this new 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.110
 line and now in this new collection that 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.210
 they are launching now is that should have 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.070
 arrived at the child starts from March the 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:55.690
 stores and I know you have but have not yet seen 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:56.590
 I do not know what this is like here is br and how it is 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.980
 what is written 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:06.040
 But I'll show you, then this one. 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.160
 hence it is the enamel and this is the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.200
 do not notice that mine is not 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:21.490
 made to make the same details and 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:23.440
 can see the drawing and this is one already 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.480
 I'll try to make it here with him. 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:35.160
 You one live for you to see. 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:38.770
 this is the south, whose cap is this 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.140
 then try to do that line 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.660
 here one looks at the cuticles because I 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.640
 I arrived on a trip to the river and I'll try 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.260
 do it for you then it's no use 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.190
 pass few moss have to pass 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:59.340
 Quite otherwise it does not work and let's go there 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:04.019
 so here 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:08.480
 and it has to be wet when you 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.480
 to approach the athlete pine 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.560
 the effect stays legal 2011 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:32.360
 what was not amazing nerd 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:36.350
 I loved everything to see, right? 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.960
 Look I just passed, I passed a waiting hand. 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.630
 and here spent another and when you to 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.680
 So you, I passed another hand of 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.100
 Enamel and he has it here, you see. 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:56.060
 this deal up so you then 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:58.340
 places here and comes close but does not 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.650
 You need to touch her, you'll ruin her. 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.620
 comes close so you are approaching the 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.300
 Enamel magnet and it's already so saying 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.730
 that's not amazing pec 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:11.480
 so that's it folks I hope you 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:15.830
 have been able to see why I am still 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.940
 learning here to mess with cameras and 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.630
 show all 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.510
 but then here are these two glazes 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.730
 magnetic and pass there on the blog leave 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.860
 address here under tinho year 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.870
 I went there for you to see the photos of 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.020
 result everything I explain right and 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:36.410
 also the pain plus some information to 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.479
 and that's it and let's test it and let's see if 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.120
 we apothecary I know that the 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.330
 The promise is more or less the same. 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.160
 action and is a national brand I do not know 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.710
