00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
quite like pipe Tina curls the lock that

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.820 
quite like pipe Tina curls the lock that
was<00:01:05.119> used<00:01:05.360> to<00:01:05.510> wrap<00:01:05.869> around<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.380> other<00:01:06.500> two

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830

was used to wrap around the other two
locks<00:01:07.100> came<00:01:07.909> out<00:01:08.060> nice<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.450> really<00:01:09.290> really

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
locks came out nice and really really

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.460

curly<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.850> then<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.180> other<00:01:11.390> two<00:01:11.750> lots<00:01:12.020> that

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
curly and then the other two lots that

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.150 
curly and then the other two lots that
were<00:01:13.220> used<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.850> as<00:01:14.509> a<00:01:14.869> base<00:01:15.290> by<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.619> other<00:01:15.890> lots

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
were used to as a base by the other lots

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.490 
were used to as a base by the other lots
to<00:01:16.340> be<00:01:16.460> wrapped<00:01:16.700> around<00:01:16.840> came<00:01:17.840> out<00:01:17.990> straight

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
to be wrapped around came out straight

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.609 
to be wrapped around came out straight
towards<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.369> top<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:19.970> then<00:01:20.090> curly<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:21.229> worsen

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
towards the top and then curly to worsen

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:23.890 
towards the top and then curly to worsen
it<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.610> let's<00:01:22.820> see<00:01:23.060> what<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.300> looks<00:01:23.509> like<00:01:23.690> when

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
it so let's see what it looks like when

00:01:23.900 --> 00:02:42.289 
it so let's see what it looks like when
it's<00:01:24.080> all<00:01:24.430> taken<00:01:25.430> down

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.030 

so<00:02:43.299> far<00:02:43.569> I'm<00:02:43.750> really<00:02:43.900> liking<00:02:44.049> how<00:02:44.469> these<00:02:44.620> curls

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
so far I'm really liking how these curls

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.520 
so far I'm really liking how these curls
came<00:02:45.280> out<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.150> love<00:02:46.359> how<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.629> straighter

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
came out and I love how the straighter

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.940 
came out and I love how the straighter
part<00:02:47.980> of<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.400> locks<00:02:48.670> adds<00:02:49.599> a<00:02:50.079> nice<00:02:50.319> texture

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
part of the locks adds a nice texture

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.920 
part of the locks adds a nice texture
against<00:02:51.549> the<00:02:51.700> curly<00:02:52.390> locks

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
against the curly locks

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.580 
against the curly locks
I<00:02:52.959> had<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.209> barrel<00:02:55.209> twisting<00:02:55.750> for<00:02:55.989> about<00:02:56.200> two

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
I had the barrel twisting for about two

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.280 
I had the barrel twisting for about two
weeks<00:02:56.859> and<00:02:57.189> I<00:02:57.849> would<00:02:57.909> moisturize<00:02:58.689> it<00:02:58.959> with<00:02:59.139> my

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
weeks and I would moisturize it with my

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.649 
weeks and I would moisturize it with my
own<00:02:59.319> mixture<00:02:59.950> about<00:03:00.909> every<00:03:01.239> other<00:03:01.389> day<00:03:01.629> just

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
own mixture about every other day just

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.190 
own mixture about every other day just
to<00:03:02.049> keep<00:03:02.079> it<00:03:02.379> moisturized<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:04.989> what

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
to keep it moisturized and this is what

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.990 
to keep it moisturized and this is what
it's<00:03:05.889> looking<00:03:06.159> like<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:06.730> I'm<00:03:06.819> going<00:03:06.969> to

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
it's looking like so I'm going to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000 
it's looking like so I'm going to
continue<00:03:07.629> and<00:03:08.019> show<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.829> finished

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
continue and show you the finished

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:38.540 
continue and show you the finished
product<00:03:09.459> at<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.909> end

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.030 

so<00:03:39.550> here's<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:40.000> final<00:03:40.180> look<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:41.440> took<00:03:41.830> me

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
so here's the final look it took me

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.970 
so here's the final look it took me
about<00:03:42.370> two<00:03:42.940> hours<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.870> install<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.680> barrel

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
about two hours to install the barrel

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.610 
about two hours to install the barrel
twist<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.640> about<00:03:46.300> 45<00:03:46.840> minutes<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.230> take<00:03:47.470> it

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
twist and about 45 minutes to take it

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.580 
twist and about 45 minutes to take it
down<00:03:47.800> yes<00:03:48.640> it's<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.150> long<00:03:49.390> process<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:50.440> is

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
down yes it's a long process and it is

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.550 
down yes it's a long process and it is
tedious<00:03:50.950> but<00:03:51.700> in<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.120> end<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.720> thought<00:03:53.290> it<00:03:53.440> was

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
tedious but in the end I thought it was

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.070 
tedious but in the end I thought it was
worth<00:03:53.740> it<00:03:53.950> I<00:03:54.220> really<00:03:54.730> do<00:03:54.940> like<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:55.570> results

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
the curls were a lot more tight and

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.620
