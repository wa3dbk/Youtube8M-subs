00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
Hannah or two it's just got a slightly

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.540 
Hannah or two it's just got a slightly
more<00:00:23.670> aggressive<00:00:24.619> tread<00:00:25.619> pattern<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.340> can

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
more aggressive tread pattern you can

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.790 
more aggressive tread pattern you can
use<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.359> more<00:00:27.510> intermediate<00:00:28.199> condition

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
use it in a more intermediate condition

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.460 
use it in a more intermediate condition

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.569 
Stamper
for<00:00:32.910> me<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> high<00:00:33.239> roller<00:00:33.510> tuza<00:00:34.130> tire<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.370> I

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
for me the high roller tuza tire that I

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.490 
for me the high roller tuza tire that I
can<00:00:35.820> ride<00:00:36.000> when<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.600> more<00:00:36.780> damp<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.290> instead

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
can ride when it's more damp so instead

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.010 
can ride when it's more damp so instead
of<00:00:37.559> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.250> spark<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:39.180> cut<00:00:39.420> spark<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.899> can

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
of going to a spark or cut spark I can

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.139 
of going to a spark or cut spark I can
write<00:00:40.200> at<00:00:40.350> higher<00:00:40.530> are<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.710> two<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.460> I

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
write at higher are the two and and I

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.410 
write at higher are the two and and I
find<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.690> really<00:00:43.200> aggressive<00:00:44.420> works

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
find it's just really aggressive works

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.959 
find it's just really aggressive works
well<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.809> mud<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.620> rocks<00:00:46.920> roots<00:00:47.309> it's

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
well in the mud with rocks roots it's

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.930 
well in the mud with rocks roots it's
great<00:00:48.239> when<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.899> goes<00:00:49.110> from<00:00:49.590> being<00:00:49.950> kind<00:00:50.789> of

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
great when it goes from being kind of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.650 
great when it goes from being kind of
dry<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.680> wet<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.670> high<00:00:54.120> road<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
dry to to wet I think the high road to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.229 
dry to to wet I think the high road to
clears<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.829> bit<00:00:56.039> better<00:00:56.250> than<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:57.030> high

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
clears a little bit better than a high

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.540 
clears a little bit better than a high
roller<00:00:57.510> would<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.140> high<00:00:58.410> roller<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.219> got

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
roller would the high roller to is got

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.389 
roller would the high roller to is got
sloppy<00:00:59.879> narrow<00:01:00.390> knobs<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.440> folds<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
sloppy narrow knobs so it folds and

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.609 
sloppy narrow knobs so it folds and
bends<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.510> sticks<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.960> ground<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.320> little<00:01:04.470> bit

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
bends and sticks the ground a little bit

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.410 
bends and sticks the ground a little bit
more<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.280> some<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.820> kids<00:01:05.970> coming<00:01:06.330> up

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
more I think some of the kids coming up

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.330 
more I think some of the kids coming up
now<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:07.049> see<00:01:07.260> why<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.100> more

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
now I can see why this the more

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800 
now I can see why this the more
aggressive<00:01:08.640> high<00:01:09.030> roll<00:01:09.240> or<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
aggressive high roll or to is the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.539 
aggressive high roll or to is the
perfect<00:01:09.990> time<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.560> those<00:01:10.680> guys<00:01:10.890> yeah<00:01:11.250> Josh

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
perfect time for those guys yeah Josh

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.070 
perfect time for those guys yeah Josh
braceland<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.270> definitely<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.930> those

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
braceland is definitely one of those

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.950 
braceland is definitely one of those
guys<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.159> way<00:01:14.340> he<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.729> throws<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> back<00:01:15.720> end

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
guys the way he just throws the back end

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.410 
guys the way he just throws the back end
into<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.290> turn<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.009> see<00:01:17.220> why<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.460> more

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
into a turn you can see why the more

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
into a turn you can see why the more
aggressive<00:01:18.780> tread<00:01:19.229> pattern<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.680> high<00:01:19.890> roller

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
aggressive tread pattern in high roller

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.580 
aggressive tread pattern in high roller
2<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.580> perfectly<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.540> really<00:01:22.080> enjoyed<00:01:22.350> Val

deter<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.729> nice<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:23.939> speed

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
deter you know it nice and speed

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.410 
deter you know it nice and speed
you<00:01:25.570> know<00:01:25.689> about<00:01:26.140> managing<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.710> speed<00:01:26.979> and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you know about managing the speed and

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.940 
you know about managing the speed and
not<00:01:28.420> my<00:01:28.569> hair<00:01:28.719> okay<00:01:29.140> I'll<00:01:29.259> just<00:01:29.409> be<00:01:29.499> able<00:01:29.619> to

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
not my hair okay I'll just be able to

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.059 
not my hair okay I'll just be able to
brake<00:01:30.399> hard<00:01:30.429> and<00:01:31.090> lay<00:01:31.240> where<00:01:32.140> I<00:01:32.170> needed<00:01:32.499> to<00:01:32.619> I

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
brake hard and lay where I needed to I

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.099 
brake hard and lay where I needed to I
think<00:01:33.310> it's<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:33.909> such<00:01:34.119> a<00:01:34.149> consistent

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
think it's just such a consistent

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.929 
think it's just such a consistent
feeling<00:01:35.679> you<00:01:35.740> get<00:01:35.859> with<00:01:36.039> matches<00:01:36.429> when<00:01:36.850> you

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
feeling you get with matches when you

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.429 
feeling you get with matches when you
have<00:01:37.060> a<00:01:37.090> little<00:01:37.359> root<00:01:37.600> sticking<00:01:38.020> out<00:01:38.170> it's<00:01:38.380> a

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
have a little root sticking out it's a

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.989 
have a little root sticking out it's a
little<00:01:38.649> bit<00:01:38.770> wet<00:01:38.950> or<00:01:39.189> even<00:01:39.459> at<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:39.729> edge<00:01:39.880> of

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:39.999 
little bit wet or even at the edge of

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.309 
little bit wet or even at the edge of

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
the rock sticking out this a little bit

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.529 
the rock sticking out this a little bit
where<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.829> super<00:01:42.310> tacky<00:01:42.549> compound<00:01:43.119> pin<00:01:43.359> is

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
where the super tacky compound pin is

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.830 
where the super tacky compound pin is
hit<00:01:44.380> that<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:45.039> it<00:01:45.219> seems<00:01:45.700> to<00:01:45.819> be<00:01:45.909> able<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.420> be

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
hit that and it seems to be able to be

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.809 
hit that and it seems to be able to be
more<00:01:47.079> predictable<00:01:47.829> over<00:01:48.189> that<00:01:48.340> sort<00:01:48.579> of<00:01:48.609> stuff

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
more predictable over that sort of stuff

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.279 
more predictable over that sort of stuff
you<00:01:48.969> know<00:01:49.149> what's<00:01:49.420> going<00:01:49.659> to<00:01:49.689> happen<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.140> when

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289
