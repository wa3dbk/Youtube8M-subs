small theory on what's going to happen

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.870 
small theory on what's going to happen
here<00:04:00.550> is<00:04:00.990> first<00:04:01.990> of<00:04:02.170> all<00:04:02.290> I'm<00:04:02.980> really<00:04:03.370> really

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880

hoping that Cassie will kill frost

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.110 
hoping that Cassie will kill frost
because<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.070> is<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.220> death<00:04:06.460> match<00:04:06.670> and<00:04:06.910> as<00:04:07.000> we

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
because this is a death match and as we

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.030 
because this is a death match and as we

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
fucking hate frost and if she's in the

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.810 
fucking hate frost and if she's in the
game<00:04:10.600> I'm<00:04:10.750> gonna<00:04:10.900> be<00:04:11.050> pretty<00:04:11.260> pissed<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:12.340> I'm

hoping she just dies in this death match
and<00:04:14.890> this<00:04:15.430> is<00:04:15.580> how<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.730> think<00:04:16.000> it's<00:04:16.150> going<00:04:16.239> to

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
and this is how I think it's going to

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.810 
and this is how I think it's going to
happen<00:04:16.480> now<00:04:17.410> Cassie's<00:04:18.310> going<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.489> get<00:04:18.609> our<00:04:18.700> ass

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
happen now Cassie's going to get our ass

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.940 
happen now Cassie's going to get our ass
beat<00:04:19.120> because<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.480> mean<00:04:19.690> you<00:04:19.930> got<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.410> spec<00:04:20.739> ops

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
beat because I mean you got the spec ops

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.280 
beat because I mean you got the spec ops
human<00:04:21.489> against

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
human against

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.380 
human against
you<00:04:23.620> know<00:04:23.740> chiromancy<00:04:24.610> which<00:04:24.940> isn't<00:04:25.210> really<00:04:25.240> a

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
you know chiromancy which isn't really a

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.720 
you know chiromancy which isn't really a
fair<00:04:25.630> match<00:04:25.870> at<00:04:26.050> all<00:04:26.200> but<00:04:27.070> i'm<00:04:27.670> thinking

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
fair match at all but i'm thinking

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.850 
fair match at all but i'm thinking
Cassie<00:04:28.480> can<00:04:28.630> still<00:04:28.840> hold<00:04:28.990> her<00:04:29.110> own<00:04:29.200> relatively

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
Cassie can still hold her own relatively

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.380 
Cassie can still hold her own relatively
because<00:04:30.160> it<00:04:30.280> is<00:04:30.400> more<00:04:30.550> combat<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.180> there<00:04:31.270> are

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
because it is more combat and there are

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.890 
because it is more combat and there are
things<00:04:31.630> where<00:04:31.780> striker<00:04:32.200> can<00:04:32.440> be<00:04:32.560> Kintaro<00:04:32.980> etc

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
things where striker can be Kintaro etc

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.420 
things where striker can be Kintaro etc
so<00:04:34.900> I'm<00:04:34.990> just<00:04:35.200> thinking<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:35.680> yeah<00:04:36.070> okay<00:04:36.400> so

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
so I'm just thinking that yeah okay so

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.680 
so I'm just thinking that yeah okay so
Cassie<00:04:36.970> will<00:04:37.120> be<00:04:37.180> getting<00:04:37.390> her<00:04:37.450> ass<00:04:37.660> kicked

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
Cassie will be getting her ass kicked

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.490 
Cassie will be getting her ass kicked
but<00:04:39.000> something<00:04:40.000> will<00:04:40.120> happen<00:04:40.360> like<00:04:40.930> brutally

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
but something will happen like brutally

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.800

but Miss Jax junior seems a lot more
likable<00:05:10.390> than<00:05:10.420> him<00:05:10.780> not<00:05:11.350> a<00:05:11.380> whole<00:05:11.950> lot<00:05:12.190> but<00:05:12.430> I
