 The special message tonight was brought by Bear Grylls, 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.860
 adventurer, writer, TV player and many more. 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.460
 But tonight she is a good friend we love. 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.220
 Welcome to Bear Gryllst! 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.340
 Thank you, Nicky, you're always so kind. 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.300
 I almost believed my three children to sing solo. 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.000
 (Charlie, if you thought Mrs Fletcher was an image, you should have seen that.) 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.020
 But I will actually read it. 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.280
 I tried to briefly describe what my faith meant to me. 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.740
 Maybe not brilliant, but honest, and well-intentioned. 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.240
 "Faith is only a crutch," people say. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.240
 And why will I be weak? 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 Well, what's the crutch good for? 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.140
 Helps you stop and strengthen. 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.340
 So this is my creed: 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.940
 I need crutches, especially since this crutch is much more than that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.420
 This is my backbone, which I can stand straight from the difficulties. 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.960
 It is a trust that we love 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.340
 irrespective of our own confusion or failure. 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.160
 He promised to lift us up, 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.780
 and I often need it 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.220
 Jesus' simple words touch when he says: 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.060
 “Come to me, escape to me and get your life back. 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.520
 Walk with me, work with me, watch me do it! 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.940
 Learn the easy rhythm of grace, 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.320
 because I don't put a heavy burden on you. 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.140
 Stay with me and learn to live freely and easily. ” 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.640
 These words are sweet to me on the dark mountain, 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.840
 the mountains we all meet. 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.200
 And I'm not too proud to admit that I need my Savior, 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.820
 to be with me and with me and conquer my heart.
