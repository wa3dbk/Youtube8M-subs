and<00:00:03.170> today<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.410> Darksiders<00:00:05.279> 2<00:00:05.310> we<00:00:05.730> found<00:00:05.970> a

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
and today in Darksiders 2 we found a

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.509 
and today in Darksiders 2 we found a
farming<00:00:08.189> spot<00:00:08.460> for<00:00:08.849> low<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.840> mid<00:00:10.410> range<00:00:10.920> people

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
farming spot for low to mid range people

so<00:00:12.450> if<00:00:12.690> you're<00:00:12.809> between<00:00:13.019> lake<00:00:13.380> level<00:00:14.340> 5<00:00:15.240> and

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
so if you're between lake level 5 and

let's<00:00:17.160> say<00:00:17.310> 20<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.880> think<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.390> would<00:00:18.539> work<00:00:18.570> for

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
screen that's going to be important in a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.780 
screen that's going to be important in a
few<00:01:06.720> minutes<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.260> just<00:01:08.119> watch<00:01:09.119> me<00:01:09.710> so<00:01:10.790> what

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
should have the death grip by now if not

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.929 
should have the death grip by now if not
you<00:01:19.140> might<00:01:19.290> want<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> work<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.159> otherwise

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
you might want to work on it otherwise

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.450 
you might want to work on it otherwise
it's<00:01:21.840> not<00:01:22.020> really<00:01:22.320> needed<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.250> makes

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
it's not really needed but just makes

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
it's not really needed but just makes
things<00:01:23.700> faster<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.390> now<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> that's<00:01:28.229> where

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
things faster right now so that's where

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.499 
things faster right now so that's where
we're<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:31.490> make<00:01:32.490> sure<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.329> have

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509

that<00:01:33.689> equipped<00:01:34.310> first<00:01:36.470> what<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.590> gonna<00:01:37.710> be

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
that equipped first what you're gonna be

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.480 
that equipped first what you're gonna be
doing<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> making<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.090> square<00:01:39.329> pretty<00:01:39.810> much<00:01:40.020> or

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
doing is making a square pretty much or

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.060 
doing is making a square pretty much or
an<00:01:41.509> l-shaped<00:01:42.509> form<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:45.530> this<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.770> very

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
an l-shaped form and this is very

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.230 
an l-shaped form and this is very
important<00:01:47.640> because<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:50.000> want<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.090> minimize

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
important because you want to minimize

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.910 
important because you want to minimize
the<00:01:51.540> damage<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.140> take<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:53.930> use<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.619> once

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
the damage you take so use this but once

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.859 
the damage you take so use this but once

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
you're in a higher level you can just

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.740 
you're in a higher level you can just
like<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.799> tack<00:01:59.040> from<00:01:59.250> your<00:01:59.430> main<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.570> not

should<00:02:36.120> level<00:02:36.330> up<00:02:36.569> they<00:02:36.810> give<00:02:36.959> about<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:38.750> would

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
should level up they give about I would

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.089 
should level up they give about I would
say<00:02:39.870> 100<00:02:40.230> exp<00:02:40.440> each<00:02:41.300> or<00:02:42.300> not<00:02:42.720> 100<00:02:43.050> like<00:02:43.230> 75<00:02:43.709> but

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
say 100 exp each or not 100 like 75 but

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.979 
say 100 exp each or not 100 like 75 but
it's<00:02:44.370> like<00:02:44.580> one<00:02:44.879> or<00:02:45.000> two<00:02:45.030> levels<00:02:45.450> per<00:02:45.660> half

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
it's like one or two levels per half

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.250 
it's like one or two levels per half
hour<00:02:46.140> which<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.890> pretty<00:02:47.220> good<00:02:47.430> actually

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
hour which is pretty good actually

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.820 
hour which is pretty good actually
though<00:02:49.260> there<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.590> cap<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:52.110> right<00:02:52.500> after<00:02:52.739> you

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
though there is a cap so right after you

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.100 
though there is a cap so right after you
kill<00:02:53.129> those<00:02:53.310> two<00:02:53.540> what<00:02:54.540> you're<00:02:54.690> going<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.900> want

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110

kill those two what you're going to want
to<00:02:55.230> do<00:02:55.379> is<00:02:56.750> come<00:02:57.750> around<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.080> see<00:02:58.230> that

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
to do is come around you see that

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.229 
to do is come around you see that
loading<00:02:58.680> screen<00:02:58.709> again<00:02:59.099> make<00:02:59.580> sure<00:02:59.610> you<00:03:00.000> see

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
loading screen again make sure you see

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.500 
loading screen again make sure you see
it<00:03:00.269> before<00:03:01.010> that<00:03:02.010> means<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.430> resets<00:03:02.909> and<00:03:03.269> then

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
it before that means it resets and then

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.920 
it before that means it resets and then
once<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.840> hit<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:06.239> go<00:03:06.390> backwards

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
once you hit it you just go backwards

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.380 
once you hit it you just go backwards

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
you're too high of a level to do it

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.130 
you're too high of a level to do it
again<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.380> where<00:03:53.310> we're<00:03:53.489> at<00:03:53.640> right<00:03:53.820> now

27:25 so that you give 50 exp each and

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.990 
27:25 so that you give 50 exp each and
that<00:03:59.090> was<00:04:00.090> what<00:04:00.330> less<00:04:00.569> than<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.810> minute<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:02.000> you

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
that was what less than a minute and you

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.229 
that was what less than a minute and you
just<00:04:03.150> keep<00:04:03.330> rinse<00:04:04.110> repeating<00:04:04.830> and<00:04:05.239> keep

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
just keep rinse repeating and keep

just keep rinse repeating and keep
making<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.630> l-shape<00:04:07.110> as<00:04:07.290> long<00:04:07.470> as<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.709> see

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
making that l-shape as long as you see

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.470 
making that l-shape as long as you see
the<00:04:08.069> loading<00:04:08.670> screen<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:09.150> means<00:04:09.239> they<00:04:09.420> were

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
the loading screen that means they were

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.870 
the loading screen that means they were
set<00:04:09.750> so<00:04:11.690> that's<00:04:12.690> one<00:04:13.590> way<00:04:13.800> if<00:04:14.489> you're<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.700> low

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
set so that's one way if you're a low

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.000 
set so that's one way if you're a low
level<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.390> can't<00:04:15.660> do<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.900> crucible<00:04:16.320> yet<00:04:16.650> but
