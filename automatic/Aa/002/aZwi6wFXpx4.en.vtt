there<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:21.280> then<00:04:21.400> attach<00:04:21.669> this<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.150> bottom

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
there and then attach this to the bottom

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.020 
there and then attach this to the bottom
of<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.690> grunt<00:04:23.190> body<00:04:24.190> so<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:24.610> looks<00:04:24.669> like<00:04:24.789> that

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
of the grunt body so it looks like that

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.120 
of the grunt body so it looks like that
and<00:04:25.539> you're<00:04:25.690> almost<00:04:25.900> done<00:04:26.199> now<00:04:26.440> for<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.889> head

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
and you're almost done now for the head

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.740 
and you're almost done now for the head
going<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.060> take<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.449> 1<00:04:29.380> by<00:04:29.410> 2<00:04:29.590> plate<00:04:30.070> put<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.750> put

beside<00:04:46.030> those<00:04:46.389> so<00:04:46.599> it<00:04:46.690> looks<00:04:46.840> like<00:04:46.900> that<00:04:47.110> and

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
beside those so it looks like that and

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.850 
beside those so it looks like that and

methane mask you know I take one of

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.110 
methane mask you know I take one of
these<00:04:54.370> pieces<00:04:54.729> with<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.180> double<00:04:56.169> studded<00:04:57.120> piece

these pieces with a double studded piece
or<00:04:58.620> attachment<00:04:59.620> and<00:05:00.070> then<00:05:00.220> put<00:05:00.430> two<00:05:00.700> lycra

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
head to the grunt and you are done

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.870 
head to the grunt and you are done
pretty<00:05:08.919> simple<00:05:09.900> now<00:05:11.280> you<00:05:12.280> can<00:05:12.400> give<00:05:12.610> them<00:05:12.729> a

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
pretty simple now you can give them a

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.640 
pretty simple now you can give them a
weapon<00:05:13.240> in<00:05:13.419> this<00:05:13.539> case<00:05:13.720> mugler<00:05:14.080> or<00:05:14.260> plasma

pistol<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.270> like<00:05:16.270> I<00:05:16.389> said<00:05:16.450> you<00:05:16.930> can<00:05:16.960> make<00:05:17.800> this

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
pistol and like I said you can make this

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.510 
pistol and like I said you can make this

ops<00:05:24.610> now<00:05:25.060> this<00:05:25.330> is<00:05:25.539> a<00:05:25.750> prime<00:05:26.050> example<00:05:26.080> of<00:05:27.270> how

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
ops now this is a prime example of how

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.510 
ops now this is a prime example of how
you<00:05:28.300> can<00:05:28.780> not<00:05:29.320> only<00:05:29.440> change<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.950> armor<00:05:30.340> to

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
you can not only change the armor to

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.159 
you can not only change the armor to
make<00:05:30.700> grunts<00:05:31.210> different<00:05:31.479> classes<00:05:31.870> but<00:05:32.020> also

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
make grunts different classes but also

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.900 
make grunts different classes but also
change<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.650> body<00:05:33.010> as<00:05:33.280> you<00:05:33.430> can<00:05:33.550> see<00:05:33.729> there

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
change the body as you can see there

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.879 
change the body as you can see there
most<00:05:34.240> of<00:05:34.419> the<00:05:34.479> central<00:05:34.990> body<00:05:35.139> of<00:05:35.349> the<00:05:35.440> gun<00:05:35.620> has

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
most of the central body of the gun has

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.379 
most of the central body of the gun has
been<00:05:35.919> switched<00:05:36.340> out<00:05:36.490> for<00:05:36.760> black<00:05:36.970> instead<00:05:37.330> of

been switched out for black instead of

been switched out for black instead of
dark<00:05:37.690> grey<00:05:37.870> just<00:05:38.110> to<00:05:38.199> give<00:05:38.349> it<00:05:38.380> a<00:05:38.530> little<00:05:38.680> bit

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
dark grey just to give it a little bit

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.860 
dark grey just to give it a little bit
more<00:05:39.449> a<00:05:40.449> little<00:05:40.949> more<00:05:41.949> likeness<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.610> it<00:05:42.870> and

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
more a little more likeness to it and

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.529 
more a little more likeness to it and
here<00:05:44.260> we<00:05:44.410> have<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:45.070> grunt<00:05:45.400> ultra<00:05:45.880> with<00:05:46.180> white

here we have the grunt ultra with white
armor<00:05:46.930> this<00:05:47.530> is<00:05:47.680> also<00:05:47.860> an<00:05:48.070> example<00:05:48.520> of

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
armor this is also an example of

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.220 
armor this is also an example of
changing<00:05:49.539> out<00:05:49.659> the

extremely annoying for your gun as you

extremely annoying for your gun as you
can<00:06:07.720> see<00:06:07.870> this<00:06:08.050> figure<00:06:08.230> is<00:06:08.440> slightly

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
can see this figure is slightly

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.460 
can see this figure is slightly

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.940 
Armour not being because I as far as I
know<00:06:19.210> Lego<00:06:19.450> does<00:06:19.660> not<00:06:19.870> make<00:06:20.080> dark<00:06:20.350> green<00:06:20.590> studs

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
know Lego does not make dark green studs

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.090 
know Lego does not make dark green studs
so<00:06:21.940> yeah<00:06:22.180> and<00:06:22.510> that<00:06:23.320> pretty<00:06:23.440> much<00:06:23.590> wraps<00:06:23.830> up

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.100 
so yeah and that pretty much wraps up

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.540 
so yeah and that pretty much wraps up
this<00:06:24.960> like<00:06:25.960> six<00:06:26.680> and<00:06:26.830> a<00:06:26.860> half<00:06:26.890> minute<00:06:27.340> long
