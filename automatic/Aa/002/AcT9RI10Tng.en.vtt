00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:12.710
 how it's done for all those people to 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:15.280
 know the beats of special 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.340
 health dedication of these people come 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.230
 to see mexico palms hello girlfriends hello 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.939
 friends as they are today I find another 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.580
 time here to make a new video 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.869
 with you and today we are going to talk about a topic 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.460
 very important 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.800
 let's talk about the properties and the 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.480
 benefits of nuts before 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.730
 start this video ideas send a cast 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.770
 of the game to my friend Angelo that thank you 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.809
 I learned a lot about this topic 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.570
 that his diet largely counted 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.000
 of what we are we have good we are going to 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.160
 from the video the great property of 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.980
 the nuts is that these have 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.260
 many healthy fats because in this 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.180
 case they will serve us to reduce what 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.379
 which is the bad cholesterol of increasing what 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.420
 which is the good cholesterol so 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.090
 imagine in the health issue they already have a 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.280
 7 because they are quite useful too 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.739
 besides 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.530
 contains what antioxidants are like 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.090
 vitamin c and vitamins and also 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.150
 that also serves a lot for the 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.040
 skin 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.040
 besides that they contain what they are 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.500
 B complex vitamins already in this case 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.450
 they are going to help us to reduce the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.700
 stress and fatigue and also a high 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.260
 contribution of what proteins are since 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.110
 for people who perform any 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.940
 physical activity or in this case that 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.970
 they have increase their muscle mass are 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.250
 We are going to talk about the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.140
 amount of proteins delivered by 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:43.230
 every 100 grams in this case I have 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:47.850
 a large area here as I have the judges 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.810
 I have the almonds in marÃ­n pistachios and 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.939
 a surprise 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.909
 and well, all this is ideal that the 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.250
 consume what is is without salt what 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.920
 you can consume raw or also 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.320
 you can accompany what are meals and 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.820
 desserts 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.260
 let's talk about the amount of 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.229
 proteins that he delivers for every 100 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.240
 grams what nuts are nuts 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.950
 the very truth that they have is that as 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.680
 I said earlier they contain great 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.240
 amount of healthy fats and also 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.720
 They contain a lot of proteins 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.980
 for every 100 grams he gives us 19 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.810
 grams of protein and imagine a snack 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.640
 I was suddenly training and a 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.370
 scene could be a good option in 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.410
 this case what are the nuts also 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.319
 here I have the almonds that who does not 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:41.150
 he likes almonds 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:43.370
 but good they are quite rich and apart 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.230
 of that they contain a lot of 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.930
 healthy fats and that 's one 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.569
 feature nuts 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.609
 and also contains what proteins are 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.390
 in this case for every 100 grams we 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.680
 deliver 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.680
 20 grams of protein 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.640
 I have here what is consumed enough 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.430
 which is the same in this case I'll 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.209
 I recommend consuming no salt since 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.390
 it's also quite high protein by 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:16.970
 every 100 grams they give us 27 sorry 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.450
 25 7 grams of protein I have here the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.750
 pistachios 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.580
 and they also give us a great contribution of 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.330
 proteins and for every 100 grams we 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.980
 deliver 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:31.209
 21 grams of protein 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.730
 and there are other nuts and the truth is not 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.709
 they are consumed and it is quite easy to do 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.780
 and here there are snacks in the street 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.659
 countries like in the Middle East or in the 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.640
 East of Asia that are consumed enough and 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.680
 here you are thrown away you find them 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.049
 at street fairs and 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.750
 what are these processes of 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.420
 questions what are the seeds of 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.370
 squash and squash seeds and 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.980
 they have a great contribution of proteins that 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.340
 in this case for every 100 grams it is not 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.470
 delivers 36 grams of protein the value 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.390
 highest of all sets of 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.760
 fruits I have to have two here so 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.099
 imagine and this here in chile anda 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.079
 voted in the haze for a person who 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.970
 you want to increase muscle mass because it is 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.660
 vegetarian or vegans that comes in 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.910
 finger ring 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.060
 apart imagine your price here 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.340
 practically free is already very easy to 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.680
 do you just have to take the 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.800
 squash seeds leave them in the sun 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.539
 drying for 23 days and ready the 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.039
 you can consume as I said 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:31.770
 previously the accompaniment in what 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.740
 What are they 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.320
 eat the raw or also colleagues 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.950
 of your meals 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.640
 and other advertising are also the 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:46.070
 watermelon seeds is for every 100 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.590
 grams deliveries 28 grams of protein 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.570
 they are also voted on the street 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.580
 and really people eat watermelon not the 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.530
 consume because they do not like them and the truth 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.620
 they are a great contribution of what they are 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.810
 proteins as you could see here 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.520
 we have the curiosity that would be the 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.130
 Various sant seeds and seeds 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.450
 of watermelon that give us a great 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.790
 so much number of what proteins are 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.790
 for people who do sports 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.930
 this is a great advantage count to see 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.930
 here the pistachios 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.160
 the watermelon seeds the peanut that is 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.449
 one of the best known 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.889
 the almonds 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.400
 the nuts 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.050
 and pumpkin seeds 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.210
 ah 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.210
 but it would increase to always consume these 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.099
 products there are already some that are a 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.629
 little bit more expensive, such as 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.900
 almonds here in chile that are pretty 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:44.569
 faces or also the price of what they are 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.030
 some nuts but you also have options 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:49.430
 much cheaper and free as I'm going to 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.319
 make the seeds of that base and the 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:55.520
 Santiago seeds are ignored 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:57.470
 I hope it had been sought and served 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.550
 quite this is another video from 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.199
 reactions 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.419
 You can hurt me until I get to the 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.699
 own home intranet and elevate me to 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.810
 hurt me to call me later 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:10.520
 that on the street you learn to respect me 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.009
 wait for the spears points 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.229
 waiting for the desire to fail 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:17.680
 matters follow their priorities pursued 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.680
 a dream 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.720
 and so it is
