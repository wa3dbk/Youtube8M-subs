00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
if you've seen the original Apple one

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.649 
if you've seen the original Apple one
but<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.640> original<00:01:35.790> Apple<00:01:36.180> warm<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.570> like

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
but the original Apple warm kind of like

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.289 
but the original Apple warm kind of like
starts<00:01:36.990> breaking<00:01:37.320> about<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> around

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
starts breaking about here and around

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.929 
starts breaking about here and around
there<00:01:39.570> comes<00:01:39.869> bending<00:01:40.290> off<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.610> great

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
there comes bending off it's not great

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.780 
there comes bending off it's not great
this<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.290> effectively<00:01:44.070> fought<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.670> for

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
this one one effectively fought just for

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.340 
this one one effectively fought just for
the<00:01:44.850> fact<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.149> I've<00:01:45.659> had<00:01:45.899> notions<00:01:46.320> that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the fact that I've had notions that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.499 
the fact that I've had notions that
again<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.860> could<00:01:47.009> probably<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.329> very

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
again you could probably see it's a very

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.170 
again you could probably see it's a very
very<00:01:48.689> high<00:01:48.960> quality<00:01:49.040> material<00:01:50.040> I'm<00:01:50.549> very<00:01:50.909> very

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
very high quality material I'm very very

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.429 
very high quality material I'm very very
impressed<00:01:51.329> by<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.689> quality<00:01:51.899> actual

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
impressed by the quality actual

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.620 
impressed by the quality actual
materials<00:01:52.860> used<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:53.790> again<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.270> just

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
materials used but then again in just

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.120 
materials used but then again in just
marble<00:01:54.990> generally<00:01:55.439> create<00:01:55.770> high<00:01:56.070> quality

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
marble generally create high quality

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.609 
marble generally create high quality
products<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.750> no<00:01:57.990> exception<00:01:58.110> so

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
it's going to pop that after the side as

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.850 
it's going to pop that after the side as
well<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.290> going<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.500> show<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.710> what

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
it up this is the one I've been using

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.930 
it up this is the one I've been using
the<00:02:09.810> most<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.920> inside<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.489> her<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.730> next<00:02:11.879> to

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the most just inside of her and next to

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.180 
the most just inside of her and next to
my<00:02:12.030> computer

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
my computer

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.150 
my computer

so pop the box off to the side and then

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.890 
so pop the box off to the side and then
here<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:16.940> also<00:02:17.090> do<00:02:17.270> get<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.450> little<00:02:17.660> sticker

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
here you also do get a little sticker

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.240 
here you also do get a little sticker
which<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.260> not<00:02:18.410> putting<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:18.800> one<00:02:18.950> it's<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.130> do

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
which is not putting this one it's to do

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.810 
which is not putting this one it's to do
just<00:02:19.460> more<00:02:19.640> bar<00:02:19.820> sticker<00:02:20.210> and<00:02:20.710> here<00:02:21.710> it<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.920> the

just more bar sticker and here it is the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.550 
just more bar sticker and here it is the
reason<00:02:22.940> reading<00:02:23.240> is<00:02:23.300> in<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:23.510> one<00:02:23.750> which<00:02:24.440> I

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
reason reading is in this one which I

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.650 
reason reading is in this one which I
come<00:02:24.710> hopefully<00:02:25.190> kind<00:02:25.760> of<00:02:25.850> understand<00:02:26.210> why<00:02:26.390> I

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
come hopefully kind of understand why I

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.390 
come hopefully kind of understand why I
have<00:02:27.350> this<00:02:27.470> plugged<00:02:27.740> into<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.010> side<00:02:28.190> of<00:02:28.220> my

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
have this plugged into the side of my

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.130 
have this plugged into the side of my
keyboard<00:02:28.580> because<00:02:29.090> I'm<00:02:29.270> my<00:02:29.390> Mac<00:02:29.630> keyboard

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
want my recommendation is probably the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.880 
want my recommendation is probably the
twist<00:02:56.120> cuz<00:02:56.330> it's<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.510> little<00:02:56.720> bit<00:02:56.810> longer<00:02:57.020> but

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
twist cuz it's a little bit longer but

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.070
