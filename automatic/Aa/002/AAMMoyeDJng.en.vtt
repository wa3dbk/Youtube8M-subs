open<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.790> D<00:02:40.239> which<00:02:40.540> we<00:02:40.840> already<00:02:41.349> have<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.860> we

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
open is a D which we already have so we

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.289 
open is a D which we already have so we
added<00:02:42.159> another<00:02:42.670> D<00:02:43.060> here<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:44.470> we<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.709> two<00:02:44.950> E's

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
added another D here so we have two E's

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.949 
added another D here so we have two E's
excuse<00:02:46.299> me<00:02:46.450> two<00:02:46.690> d<00:02:46.989> notes<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:48.370> this<00:02:48.670> e<00:02:48.959> seven

chord<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.530> adding<00:02:51.159> this<00:02:51.310> one<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.970> an

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
chord and adding this one that is an

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.660 
chord and adding this one that is an
octave<00:02:52.690> apart<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.290> pitch<00:02:53.590> from<00:02:54.099> that<00:02:54.310> one<00:02:54.489> and
