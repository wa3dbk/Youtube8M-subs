Treasury<00:03:21.760> makes<00:03:22.760> your<00:03:23.000> toner<00:03:23.329> with<00:03:23.930> iron

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
Treasury makes your toner with iron

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.520 
Treasury makes your toner with iron
oxide<00:03:25.070> which<00:03:25.430> is<00:03:25.760> metal<00:03:26.269> particles<00:03:26.780> which<00:03:27.380> is

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
oxide which is metal particles which is

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.860 
oxide which is metal particles which is
magnetic<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:29.030> what<00:03:29.180> happens<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.630> this

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
magnetic so what happens is this

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.440 
magnetic so what happens is this
magnetic<00:03:30.230> sensor<00:03:30.920> right<00:03:31.100> here<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.549> picks<00:03:32.239> up

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
magnetic sensor right here it picks up

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.690 
magnetic sensor right here it picks up
the<00:03:32.510> actual<00:03:33.110> particle<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.100> metal<00:03:34.430> particles

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
the actual particle the metal particles

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.690 
the actual particle the metal particles
inside<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.209> ink<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.870> allows<00:03:36.440> it<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.739> trigger

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
inside the ink and allows it to trigger

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.030 
inside the ink and allows it to trigger
the<00:03:37.970> sensor<00:03:38.239> to<00:03:38.810> allows<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.290> change<00:03:39.620> colors

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
the sensor to allows it to change colors

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.640 
the sensor to allows it to change colors
like<00:03:40.130> this<00:03:40.430> now<00:03:41.239> I<00:03:41.299> don't<00:03:41.480> care<00:03:41.840> how<00:03:42.110> much<00:03:42.380> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
like this now I don't care how much the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.920 
like this now I don't care how much the
counterfeit<00:03:43.220> or<00:03:43.250> reprint<00:03:44.180> on<00:03:44.390> five-dollar
