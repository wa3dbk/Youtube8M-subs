I'm<00:00:13.679> working<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.130> detailed<00:00:14.580> driving<00:00:15.120> review

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
I'm working on a detailed driving review

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.010 
I'm working on a detailed driving review
of<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.800> 2014<00:00:16.910> Mitsubishi<00:00:17.910> i-miev<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.930> a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
of this 2014 Mitsubishi i-miev it's a

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.769 
of this 2014 Mitsubishi i-miev it's a
100%<00:00:19.650> electric<00:00:20.520> vehicle<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.390> gets<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.630> pretty

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
100% electric vehicle it gets a pretty

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.759 
100% electric vehicle it gets a pretty
good<00:00:21.900> fuel<00:00:22.230> economy<00:00:22.470> but<00:00:22.949> how<00:00:23.609> fast<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.330> go

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
good fuel economy but how fast can it go

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.500 
good fuel economy but how fast can it go
0-60<00:00:25.920> I've<00:00:26.099> seen<00:00:26.400> some<00:00:26.550> numbers<00:00:26.820> online<00:00:27.000> that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
0-60 I've seen some numbers online that

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.890 
0-60 I've seen some numbers online that
it<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.689> achieve<00:00:27.769> 15<00:00:28.769> seconds<00:00:29.369> 0-60<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.840> I

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
it can achieve 15 seconds 0-60 but I

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.659 
it can achieve 15 seconds 0-60 but I
think<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.380> better<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.890> broke<00:00:32.340> out<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
think we can do better I broke out the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.490 
think we can do better I broke out the
solo<00:00:32.880> DL<00:00:33.210> performance<00:00:33.719> timer<00:00:33.899> which<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.260> GPS

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
solo DL performance timer which is GPS

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.170 
solo DL performance timer which is GPS
based<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.219> we'll<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> best<00:00:35.760> accuracy

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
based so we'll have the best accuracy

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
based so we'll have the best accuracy
possible<00:00:36.870> I'm<00:00:37.020> going<00:00:37.559> 0<00:00:37.800> 65<00:00:38.370> times<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.879> an
