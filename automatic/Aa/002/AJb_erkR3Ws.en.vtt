00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.760
 Today I'm going to make you a recipe that is 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.740
 basic to then do some little thing 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.660
 more than I'll teach you 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.420
 later but now what I'm going to 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.160
 to do is some slices that I have of 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.300
 nice that we are now in full 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.300
 season for its northern bonito 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.329
 two slices that I'm going to make with 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.260
 fry for shaving I will use 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:43.860
 onion garlic green pepper and tomato is 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.870
 a kind of pisto asks a salsita a 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.360
 all the vegetables that goes with it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.030
 nice perfectly this is the recipe 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.120
 basic and from there we will be playing 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.519
 with the result the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 do and this is pretty important I 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.260
 I think a lot of people do it but for sure 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.510
 that there are people who do not know yet 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.650
 I'm pretty whitening whitening 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.650
 the only thing is I put water to cook 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.990
 in a pan and when it is boiling 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.030
 get nice for another minute or 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.770
 less and the pretty let's say it's going to 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.760
 drop all that I do not know is that I do not know how 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.590
 say it 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.500
 in my house evil has always been done 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.660
 then throw a mousse that better 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.550
 it remains in that water that is not in the stew that 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.160
 let's go do later is not it 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.450
 bad but simply that that is a 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:37.940
 taste that we say spoil the taste of 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.850
 pretty and that's why I took it off if I did not 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.690
 know and see how it would be because the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.600
 ripper 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.510
 we go in parts the same water in which 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.900
 I'm going to bleach the bonito slices 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.090
 I deserve what you are going to discard 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.670
 tomatoes because total are clean and not 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.800
 gives me no bad taste to the pretty and 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.660
 as I have a is to charge us took the 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.120
 same water to do both 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.770
 operations 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.750
 well then but if the tomatoes 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.490
 perfectly not because I already have the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.679
 unloaded tomatoes 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.930
 the streams of goal so that you have a 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.409
 little because yes no 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.790
 it's like it would burn me a lot and that 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.319
 neither the plan 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.430
 good and now 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.709
 I'm going to put the slices of bonito 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.349
 which, as I said, is not a matter of 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.790
 cooking them is always a matter and 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:33.170
 just leave them a few minutes 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.180
 set the difference of the part that 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.840
 the water entered and the one that remained 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.910
 outside 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.950
 You see this technique that you see around here 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.850
 this is what I call the evil of 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.190
 this is all going to stay in the water 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.510
 and well, that's a habit that I 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.360
 I've seen in my house all my life 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.780
 then it does not mean either 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.580
 It's bad not to do it but if you do it 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.640
 I think it's pretty good tastes better 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.730
 Well, I'm finishing cutting the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.519
 pepper 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.340
 the onion and the garlic we have 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.530
 doing suffering there at medium heat 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.650
 pulling down because I want you to 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.080
 Take a flat time and the pepper would be 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.940
 made immediately that you already know that there is no 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.739
 than to throw everything at once because the 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.160
 pepper release water then do not 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.160
 I would believe 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.230
 paste the tomatoes that were also 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.300
 things that had pending fixing them 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.740
 after climbing it, look how good it is 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.380
 stick 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.990
 that's why they scale so that the skin 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.730
 come out on its own and so then we do not have 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.940
 no impurity within what is the 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.120
 sauce the purity of love the skin has is 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.830
 that is impurity but simply that no 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.830
 It's nice to find a piece of skin 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.050
 or a sauce 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.140
 that's why I'm turning and now that 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.680
 you put the peppers I'm going to let it 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.070
 cool 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.920
 finally put the tomatito and 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.630
 I have a fry let's use it 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.210
 put or to start with two eggs 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.230
 fried that are also good I do not know 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.800
 what 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.260
 that the tomatoes 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.720
 and that I'm a little clumsy that we're going 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.910
 that I'm not the world here staying 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.239
 tomatoes but see how it will look 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.019
 the 'puncture' is a little bit at the tip and 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.019
 let's go out 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.810
 Well, this has to be useful for us 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.090
 Spice to make homemade salsa because 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.639
 there is a lot of homemade salsa that the 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.490
 bought that always what happens is that 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.960
 I recognize that today sauces 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.160
 bought come very rich is a tomato 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.639
 very rich but still like home 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.699
 nothing good at all because we already have everything 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:52.060
 this ready now I have made the pepper 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:54.400
 to fry and then 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.210
 Beyond the tomato good for as 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.280
 You can see I have the chips 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.840
 practically ready I 've already put the 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.840
 tomato I have put a little water 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.850
 to make it a little more salsa 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.449
 and now I just have to let 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.539
 be done well 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.129
 and then to enjoy with her and you 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.620
 I say but you can apply in this case 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:19.139
 I'm going to do pretty complicated but 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.969
 You can see her quietly with the 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.969
 pieces of meat customers or 

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:28.939
 is to clean the slices of nice nesti 

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:32.059
 removing the thorns and some parts 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:33.849
 They are very red and well, I like them 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:36.939
 less 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:40.599
 and so I find the bulls mad 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:42.639
 chops ready to eat 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:45.059
 in the thorns are located in the 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.059
 corners 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.220
 well let's say 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:57.570
 in this part that in this part let's say 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.310
 that comes together in the two pieces by 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.410
 up are in the center making a 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.290
 kind of cross these are no longer left 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.790
 more thorns here to be with pardillas 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.610
 for talking 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:12.729
 but no longer as well and made from the 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:15.610
 stub took away his skin this bad day 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.370
 well the scope whatever it is to leave the 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:21.580
 Taste mind of the tuna I like it took away 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:25.330
 this part of the center that is very red 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.490
 and left the whitest part is by 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.510
 example no longer has any thorn 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:34.040
 look 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:36.470
 this is the central thorn that comes out all 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.420
 suddenly and then nothing we can 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.580
 of care as we remove the thorn 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:43.330
 without any problem and do not be 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.340
 a problem works with the hands 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.840
 that you have them clean is more than 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.349
 good enough here has a thorn 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.349
 always to the touch 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.919
 to this one I take this little piece 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:02.689
 and this I do not have any good left 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:05.119
 now I just let him cook here 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:06.949
 will be eight or ten minutes together 

00:07:05.119 --> 00:07:09.649
 with the sauce and the stew is already 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:11.289
 finished then I will present it that I believe 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:14.289
 which are the chips for 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:16.199
 accompany him come the new one I teach you 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:20.490
 Well, here is the result 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:23.940
 nice with fries and chips 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:26.120
 that you do not know what I'm going to put on 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.680
 you guessed I'm going to get purple 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.699
 I hope that the one in that house and I like it 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.699
 as much as I like me
