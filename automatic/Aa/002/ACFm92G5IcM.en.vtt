00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.110
 you are the thanks I bring a new 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.779
 video we are in the third episode of 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.669
 the promotion of the server finally and good 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.890
 first of all I wanted to tell you that many 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.500
 you say you told me that I was doing it for 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.230
 money and good mails apply a little 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.690
 if I do it for money because they pay me 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.420
 five euros for each promotion the thing 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.940
 is that I love him for the channel so 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.980
 simple I'm saving for a new 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.629
 pc gaming and put it in my room 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.850
 because now the one I have now 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.980
 is between the dining room the kitchen and only 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.899
 he could record when he was alone then if 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.629
 I did not have the room and over it is 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.339
 better than it would be better I would already be a 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.379
 revival of screen in which the 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.929
 pressures do not reexperience you will have 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.059
 direct daily video you would have everything 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.319
 you would not have series would continue 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.500
 all but now I do not have time 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:07.479
 and it's not that I do not have time in 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.740
 As for studies that also if not 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.110
 time in how much 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.790
 I'm just that I'm only one or two days 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.700
 a week and sometimes the ends of 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.250
 week and said this we go with the 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.229
 lasting heres promotion in efe 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.729
 when we have a great server here 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.840
 As you can see, it's a pass 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.610
 here the mc and incredible rating is very 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.119
 good to the common cool spam for a 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.130
 amazing and they have good games not only 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.289
 mini games but we also have equipment 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.560

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.979
 survival frictions etcetera etcetera 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.350
 well I would say here we have to mini 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.590
 game is under construction but soon 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.899
 will be and good 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.939

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.289
 what it is like to be everything very very nice to 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.049
 I liked what's coming 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:57.119
 being spam is worth here we have a 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.310

 elite that can not be during a 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.900
 minute to see it is worth and as you see here 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.760

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.420
 had you go here 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.010
 would go down if I would start giving you of hosts 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.620
 which I'm not going to do now because 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.640
 this is a promotion but you do not give 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.019
 voices of selling children is good, not what 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.640
 but I would record because 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.110
 I also really like the boat group and 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.599
 the server is pretty good to the fifth 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.349
 of nutritional to return to the globe 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:23.060
 we would do so rafa we would return to what 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.060
 What is this you can not do? 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.530
 and once we go back to espanyol I'm not going 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.799
 to teach what is being a 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.290
 time 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:37.000
 we take and we have this because we are going to 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.000
 go to next and build nexuses 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.060
 and as you see then here we would have a 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.420
 destroy of these that also 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.080
 we would go down here and here we would have what 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.880
 it is being destroyed the nexus then here 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.880
 says to go back south of being of 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.800
 South road is worth and therefore the link only 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.160
 we would have to here 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.840
 and then put them in here we have six 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.390
 04 players and 21 players on the team 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.940
 blue that happens well then let's go another 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:13.010
 the server spawn would say that 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.959
 I saw it scale I do not remember if perfect 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.900
 we are going to achieve we were going to go to what 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.609
 has been the next good as 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.470
 You see, it's super curran that we have 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.570
 provoke and survival faxes that now what 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.430
 let's see let's go try with my 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.650
 game that I do not know local and I would have to 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.330
 go up the truth I do not know I see it cool 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.100
 but it might be a bit boring 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.830
 go hiding or I would do it a little 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.810
 as well as trolling I do not know if here 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.930
 we would have the map of troops that are 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.340
 there playing by killing all the blocks and 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.350
 to leave when we would have here 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.030
 our points how many we are 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.490
 waiting and to go out we would do 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.250
 again server 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.319
 As you can see, the server is very good to me 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.880
 I liked it not only because 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.919
 that we promote but because I 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.960
 I like it like to judge it 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.060
 after the promotion not that it says 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.470
 so I promote it and I like that as 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.060
 to play it to the promotion because not 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.520
 has no age also has a good 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.229
 host the truth I liked a lot good 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.599
 there are those who are their rival we have the angel and 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.120
 demon angel and demon also 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.759
 we would go down here to go now they must is 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.430
 in his city ​​we wanted here since we 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.120
 would give the main clip as you see us 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:24.990
 we would achieve and here we would give in the kit 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.919
 main and then I would go to server 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.650
 South rival is worth and we are in the fifth 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:35.319
 effect this would be light and by then 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.320
 we would just have to put the fly 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.430
 flight 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.200

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.790
 you see there and well let's go up towards 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.930
 high up 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.270
 As you can see, the 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.000
 spam I have no idea if it is downloaded or 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:56.630

 We explain everything that has been 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.820
 equal portals to evaluate portals that 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.100
 let's go now portals and it would take us 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.130
 to what has been all the portals 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.530

 same as all the portals that it has 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.789
 the server and it is also very currado and 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.639
 Well, we would do the same again 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.289
 lobby as it is very good too 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:39.190

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.830
 well it comes with the factions modality that 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.050
 to create your faction with your friends and 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.110

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:05.409
 I can put over we have a block 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:07.210

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.530
 promotion I do not know why I say yes now to the 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.180
 hook with a tagline of what's coming 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.210
 being what is coming I do not know why 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.389
 I say that spain a little patience and a 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.400
 little distrust does not always say what 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:23.350
 that is being good does not matter 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.660

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.130
 another ones do it for money others to 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.139
 keep erbe but I do 

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.240
 exactly for this cause and for 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:39.130
 improve the channel and to bring you more 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.830

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.160
