00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
Doncaster a few years ago think oh they

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.060 
Doncaster a few years ago think oh they
win<00:01:00.750> from<00:01:00.960> over<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.890> where<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
win from over it really is where the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.500 
win from over it really is where the
pace<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.699> course<00:01:02.879> filled<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.239> dream

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
pace is and of course filled a dream

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.679 
pace is and of course filled a dream
will<00:01:04.110> lead<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.500> beaten<00:01:04.799> forever<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:06.390> think

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.520 
concern you so much they were never for
were<00:01:26.070> drawn<00:01:26.280> yes<00:01:26.520> obviously<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.350> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
were drawn yes obviously but on the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.069 
were drawn yes obviously but on the
whole<00:01:28.680> it's<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.180> made<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.930> so

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
whole it's not made of it I think so

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.130 
whole it's not made of it I think so
yeah<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.560> think<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:31.979> most<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.310> these<00:01:32.400> races

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
yeah I think in most of these races

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.789 
yeah I think in most of these races
especially<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> straight<00:01:34.590> course

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
especially on the straight course

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.289 
especially on the straight course
obviously<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.549> get<00:01:35.729> good<00:01:35.939> wood<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.180> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
obviously you get good wood like the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.670 
obviously you get good wood like the
Google<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.600> mile<00:01:36.810> where<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.200> both<00:01:37.380> know<00:01:37.619> if

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
Google of mile where we both know if

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.050 
Google of mile where we both know if
you're<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:37.950> drawn<00:01:38.220> minor<00:01:38.430> five<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.850> might<00:01:38.970> as

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you're not drawn minor five you might as

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.550 
you're not drawn minor five you might as
well<00:01:39.090> forget<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.450> even<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:39.869> 20<00:01:39.990> runners<00:01:40.409> in

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
well forget it even with 20 runners in

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.740

here I remember back in supper sauce in

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.780 
here I remember back in supper sauce in
the<00:01:42.899> air<00:01:43.020> yeah<00:01:43.430> Cambridgeshire<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> few<00:01:44.640> years

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the air yeah Cambridgeshire a few years

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.789 
the air yeah Cambridgeshire a few years
ago<00:01:44.909> remember<00:01:45.119> he<00:01:45.329> was<00:01:45.479> drawn<00:01:45.659> 31<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.229> 32<00:01:46.560> when

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
ago remember he was drawn 31 to 32 when

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.740 
ago remember he was drawn 31 to 32 when
he<00:01:46.860> gone<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.220> route<00:01:47.430> than<00:01:47.700> they<00:01:47.820> whatever

he gone that route than they whatever
although<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> always<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.070> better<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.399> an

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
although I always think is better for an

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
although I always think is better for an
altar<00:01:50.759> ever<00:01:51.000> route<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.450> run<00:01:51.570> against<00:01:51.930> them
