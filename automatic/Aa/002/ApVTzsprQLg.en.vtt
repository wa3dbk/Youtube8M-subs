have anything to do with saving money
but<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.120> does<00:00:54.360> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.930> prioritize<00:00:55.170> your

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
but it does kind of prioritize your

but it does kind of prioritize your
spending<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.460> you'll<00:00:56.850> probably<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.180> more

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
spending and you'll probably get more

use out of the product even if it's a
little<00:00:58.949> bit<00:00:59.160> more<00:00:59.309> expensive<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.059> this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
little bit more expensive and this

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.360 
little bit more expensive and this
second<00:01:01.170> tip<00:01:01.289> kind<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.620> goes<00:01:01.800> along<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:02.309> what

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
second tip kind of goes along with what

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.579 
second tip kind of goes along with what
i<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.699> saying<00:01:02.969> not<00:01:03.690> necessarily<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.379> save

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.200 
they're gonna be a lot of good deals but
you<00:01:11.100> don't<00:01:11.340> have<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.610> much<00:01:11.790> money<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> spend

gloss<00:05:29.850> I<00:05:30.030> can't<00:05:30.240> think<00:05:30.450> of<00:05:30.540> the<00:05:30.630> exact<00:05:30.930> name

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
right now but I'm pretty sure I bought

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.490 
right now but I'm pretty sure I bought
that<00:05:32.970> all<00:05:33.300> for<00:05:33.540> like<00:05:33.660> thirty<00:05:33.870> five<00:05:34.080> dollars
