 hi to all and axel tests mobile.fr 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.530
 we are at cs 2014 in las vegas on the 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.320
 alcatel slash tcl alcatel one stand 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.570
 touch then and we're old helping the hand 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.140
 the idol x + 1 that was announced ago 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.820
 what 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.230
 a few days we are something 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.580
 so we had heard about it 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.599
 a little bit before I thought there had been 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.170
 fluids something like that like 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.900
 usually 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.179
 and here we finally have it in our hands 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.619
 successor of the idol x with some 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.609
 little news in terms of specs 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.540
 I'm not going that's where it's 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:41.030
 we have a 5 inch full HD 1080p screen 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.680
 1920 we have 13 megapixels 13.1 megapixels 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.260
 at the camera level a flash 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.000
 led 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.770
 what else do we have that weighs 130 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.720
 grams age and specs under the eyes 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.530
 there are a lot of things to note we are 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.040
 on a path a media library chipset 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.540
 65.92 cdu oct accord of giga octo cores 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.660
 we say in French no body of 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.449
 gigahertz and the 1st oct the body of 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.630
 alcatel that's pretty cool it's 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.399
 gigant internal memory of giga of ram and 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.500
 there is the possibility also a version 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.270
 And apparently what did we 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.149
 other releases going by 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.340
 in the specs it's not necessarily very 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.899
 bundled the battery i'm trying 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.780
 to try was making a sonia that me 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.759
 blow in the ear of 2000 2500 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.310
 million father to my right 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.429
 yeah that's okay I think we 've got pretty 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.960
 close all the specs then demo mode no 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.939
 thank you 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.439
 it's a device that I like 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.170
 the last alcatel terminals they are 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.740
 very sober but well finished and that's it 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.850
 which is important 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.639
 so here we have a very strong terminal with 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.509
 up there that she does not face at the 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:54.350
 audio output we were all sensitive on 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.039
 see very badly the camera speakers 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.370
 and micro usb volume 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.600
 oh yes the dual sim 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.910
 I 'm just going to check it's absolutely 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.500
 not a professional 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.170
 that's what's funny I feel 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.850
 that he is dual sim and christine of the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.320
 on the side so in my opinion yes the dual 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.330
 sim since there is christine one of the other 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.940
 side here is a dual sim terminal 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.160
 octo cores it starts to do a lot 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.070
 it's pretty good for for alcatel 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.240
 I think this year alcatel is going 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.340
 make good sales 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.870
 I hope in any case for them can not 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.580
 lock unlock the jack to 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.010
 the back here in its red version there 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.020
 I have several versions gah bah you 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.720
 see there in fact red black and white 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.740
 that's it and that's about all 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.740
 yeah volume 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.260
 ok we went around so I think 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.680
 that the screen he is very illiterate he has 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.160
 look very successful show you a little 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.720
 that's it 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.170
 see it rather well and it looks very 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.970
 very close to 2 2 we actually have it 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.810
 manipulates at the end of the glass layer 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.480
 so it's nice enough ok this little 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:10.110
 overlay the rather elegant alcatel 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.130
 in flat design this is google a game 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.100
 see if I can access 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.959
 here's multitasking that way the 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.510
 drawer of notifications up there with 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.090
 some shortcuts and this menu the in 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.170
 quick access of course in native 1 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.790
 from android some nice widgets widgets 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.930
 nice you saw them where to start 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.140
 to type a number you have some 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.140
 proposals 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:40.970
 music player that's new 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.310
 I hope we will have this overlay there 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.010
 in France it's something that worries me 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.800
 a little there I wonder but maybe 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.239
 that this is classic android 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.019
 up to look at keyboard then we're going 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.250
 stop there that's it's the airlock and 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.530
 keyboards well finally it's a device that 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:05.510
 is really interesting it would have been 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.590
 fun to make a nice fireplace but no 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.090
 there is not and there is no 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.709
 of bench application and good I have not 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.230
 necessarily time but hey it's a 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.940
 device that in my opinion is going to be very 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.100
 interesting to test because it has a 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.010
 nice premium design some 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.810
 cool colors octo cores a device 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.120
 3 megapixel photo a beautiful screen 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.770
 obviously a very successful design a 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.090
 very fine device finally good here it is 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.950
 seems to have everything to please 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.200
 I do not have the price in mind I think it 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.270
 has been unveiled no we have not yet ok 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.010
 so do not worry 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.270
 will inform about it as soon as we have the 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.270
 data see you soon
