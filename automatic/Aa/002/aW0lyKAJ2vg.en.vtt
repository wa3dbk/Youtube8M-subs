of<00:00:11.440> Pacific<00:00:12.009> Rim<00:00:12.039> 3d<00:00:12.639> this<00:00:13.509> is<00:00:13.690> the<00:00:13.900> 3d<00:00:14.230> blu-ray

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 
of Pacific Rim 3d this is the 3d blu-ray

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.339 
of Pacific Rim 3d this is the 3d blu-ray
from<00:00:14.799> the<00:00:15.339> United<00:00:15.940> States<00:00:15.969> I<00:00:16.599> think<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.170> UK

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
from the United States I think the UK

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.080 
from the United States I think the UK
one<00:00:17.650> is<00:00:17.740> going<00:00:17.859> to<00:00:17.919> have<00:00:18.070> probably<00:00:18.759> a<00:00:18.820> similar

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
one is going to have probably a similar

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.390 
one is going to have probably a similar
cover<00:00:19.449> I<00:00:19.750> do<00:00:20.560> know<00:00:20.770> there<00:00:20.919> is<00:00:21.039> another

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
cover I do know there is another

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.220 
cover I do know there is another
lenticular<00:00:21.730> cover<00:00:22.119> for<00:00:22.360> this<00:00:22.539> one<00:00:22.750> where

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
lenticular cover for this one where

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.589 
lenticular cover for this one where
there<00:00:23.410> is<00:00:23.439> a<00:00:23.739> Jaeger<00:00:24.430> and<00:00:24.550> a<00:00:24.640> kaiju<00:00:24.849> and<00:00:25.480> when

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
there is a Jaeger and a kaiju and when

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.240 
there is a Jaeger and a kaiju and when
you<00:00:25.689> sort<00:00:25.869> of<00:00:25.900> move<00:00:26.470> it<00:00:26.590> from<00:00:26.710> left<00:00:26.890> to<00:00:27.009> right

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
you sort of move it from left to right

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.119 
you sort of move it from left to right
it<00:00:27.849> switches<00:00:28.149> between<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.719> two<00:00:28.869> so<00:00:29.259> now<00:00:29.890> but<00:00:30.040> I

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:30.129 
it switches between the two so now but I

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:31.920 
it switches between the two so now but I
do<00:00:30.189> quite<00:00:30.399> like<00:00:30.579> this<00:00:30.700> one<00:00:30.910> I<00:00:31.090> really<00:00:31.779> like

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
do quite like this one I really like

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.030 
do quite like this one I really like
that<00:00:32.050> image<00:00:32.379> something<00:00:32.619> that's<00:00:32.800> very<00:00:32.950> very

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
that image something that's very very

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.700 
that image something that's very very
cool<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:40.149> does<00:00:40.390> have<00:00:40.600> an<00:00:40.870> entire<00:00:41.199> disc<00:00:41.469> or

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
cool this does have an entire disc or

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.880 
cool this does have an entire disc or
blu-ray<00:00:42.190> features<00:00:42.640> so<00:00:43.239> I<00:00:43.270> think<00:00:43.800> well<00:00:44.800> I'd

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
blu-ray features so I think well I'd

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
blu-ray features so I think well I'd
like<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.070> think<00:00:45.250> there's<00:00:45.430> gonna<00:00:45.550> be<00:00:45.700> quite<00:00:45.880> a

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
like to think there's gonna be quite a

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.260 
like to think there's gonna be quite a
lot<00:00:46.120> on<00:00:46.239> there<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:48.100> it's<00:00:48.610> a<00:00:48.700> fairly<00:00:48.850> effect

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
lot on there it's a it's a fairly effect

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.130 
lot on there it's a it's a fairly effect
heavy<00:00:49.600> film<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.920> I'd<00:00:51.010> like<00:00:51.160> to<00:00:51.310> see<00:00:51.460> how<00:00:51.640> they

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
and I did quite a lot of it as you can

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.639 
and I did quite a lot of it as you can
see<00:00:57.100> that<00:00:57.280> it's<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.489> 3d<00:00:58.149> blu-ray<00:00:58.270> blu-ray<00:00:58.809> DVD

anybody wants free ultraviolet okay now
the<00:01:33.710> disc<00:01:34.220> artwork<00:01:34.580> on<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.150> really<00:01:35.930> cool

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
the disc artwork on this is really cool

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.920 
the disc artwork on this is really cool
on<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.950> tube<00:01:37.130> movie<00:01:37.520> blu-ray<00:01:37.850> discs<00:01:38.240> they've

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
on the tube movie blu-ray discs they've

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:48.270 
on the tube movie blu-ray discs they've
got<00:01:41.200> sketches<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.350> the<00:01:43.420> gipsy<00:01:44.420> danger<00:01:44.570> Yeager

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.740 

and<00:01:49.450> then<00:01:50.450> on<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:51.800> DVD<00:01:52.250> they've<00:01:52.490> got<00:01:52.729> I<00:01:53.000> got<00:01:53.660> my

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
and then on the DVD they've got I got my

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.150 
and then on the DVD they've got I got my
butch<00:01:53.930> one<00:01:54.110> that's<00:01:54.259> the<00:01:54.380> European<00:01:54.890> here<00:01:55.100> you

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
butch one that's the European here you

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.190 
butch one that's the European here you
go<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:56.950> think<00:01:57.950> that's<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.270> Australian<00:01:59.840> striker

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
go I think that's the Australian striker

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.279 
go I think that's the Australian striker
Eureka<00:02:00.800> wand<00:02:01.509> either<00:02:02.509> way<00:02:02.630> it's<00:02:02.899> just<00:02:02.930> really

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
Eureka wand either way it's just really

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.960 
Eureka wand either way it's just really
really<00:02:03.500> smart<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:04.070> have<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.490> little<00:02:04.789> bit<00:02:04.850> of

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
really smart to have a little bit of

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.719 
really smart to have a little bit of
effort<00:02:05.509> with<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.720> discs<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:07.190> even<00:02:07.580> more

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
effort with the discs and even more

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.850 
effort with the discs and even more
effort<00:02:08.060> where<00:02:08.209> each<00:02:08.479> disc<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:08.989> is<00:02:09.470> pretty<00:02:09.739> much

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
effort where each disc is is pretty much

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:19.180 
effort where each disc is is pretty much
different<00:02:10.340> which<00:02:10.759> I<00:02:10.880> really<00:02:11.150> like<00:02:18.100> there<00:02:19.100> we

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
different which I really like there we

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.440 
different which I really like there we
go<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.370> that's<00:02:19.549> the<00:02:19.730> set<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:19.940> think<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.269> comes

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
go so that's the set I think this comes

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.000 
go so that's the set I think this comes
out<00:02:20.570> in<00:02:20.720> maybe<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.989> week<00:02:21.200> or<00:02:21.350> two<00:02:21.500> or<00:02:21.799> it<00:02:21.860> might

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
out in maybe a week or two or it might

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.490 
out in maybe a week or two or it might
even<00:02:22.040> be<00:02:22.280> out<00:02:22.400> already<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:22.970> America<00:02:23.600> we<00:02:24.380> don't

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
even be out already in America we don't

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.910 
even be out already in America we don't
