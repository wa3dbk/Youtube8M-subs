00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
here is a overflow box I made it was

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.530 
here is a overflow box I made it was
really<00:00:06.720> simple<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.140> make<00:00:07.319> only<00:00:07.919> cost<00:00:08.130> about

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
really simple to make only cost about

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.259 
really simple to make only cost about
seven<00:00:09.540> dollars<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.080> fifty<00:00:10.230> cents<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.090> I<00:00:12.090> have

it<00:00:12.420> connected<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.139> my<00:00:13.259> 40<00:00:13.920> gallon<00:00:14.250> tank<00:00:14.719> going

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
it connected to my 40 gallon tank going

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.550 
it connected to my 40 gallon tank going
down<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.320> my<00:00:16.500> 20<00:00:17.010> gallon<00:00:17.310> sump<00:00:17.520> tank<00:00:18.109> my<00:00:19.109> return

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
pump is a zoo brand it's the model

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.779 
pump is a zoo brand it's the model
number<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.660> two<00:00:24.900> zero<00:00:24.930> zero<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.550> has

three hundred gallon per hour flow rate
now<00:00:31.080> how<00:00:31.439> about<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> overflow<00:00:32.070> boxes<00:00:33.260> started

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
now how about the overflow boxes started

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.680 
now how about the overflow boxes started
with<00:00:34.410> two<00:00:34.590> pictures<00:00:35.239> they're<00:00:36.239> fairly

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
with two pictures they're fairly

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.549 
with two pictures they're fairly
good-sized<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.850> handles<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.559> now

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
good-sized and they have handles on now

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.130 
good-sized and they have handles on now
I<00:00:40.590> had<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.920> cut<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.280> handle<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.750> it

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
I had to cut the handle because it

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.840 
I had to cut the handle because it
connected<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> top<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> bottom<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.670> I

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
connected on the top and the bottom so I

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.360 
connected on the top and the bottom so I
cut<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> handle<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.890> half<00:00:47.100> so

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
cut the handle so it was just half so

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.639 
cut the handle so it was just half so
would<00:00:47.520> hang<00:00:47.730> over<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> tank<00:00:48.270> please<00:00:48.870> follow

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
would hang over the tank please follow

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.229 
would hang over the tank please follow
the<00:00:49.920> same<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.520> goes<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.879> hang<00:00:51.030> over<00:00:51.210> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the same and it goes just hang over the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.119 
the same and it goes just hang over the
tank<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:53.250> inside<00:00:53.840> container<00:00:55.129> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
tank on the inside container the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.479 
tank on the inside container the
modification<00:00:56.850> may<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.300> be<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:58.399> put<00:00:59.399> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
modification may have to be with put it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.770 
modification may have to be with put it
in<00:00:59.609> your<00:00:59.699> tank<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.270> about<00:01:00.390> where<00:01:00.690> your

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
in your tank and see about where your

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.619 
in your tank and see about where your
water<00:01:00.960> level<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.239> then<00:01:03.239> you're<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.510> to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
water level is and then you're going to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.850 
water level is and then you're going to
drill<00:01:06.020> then<00:01:07.020> you're<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.530> drill

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
drill then you're going to have to drill

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.950 
drill then you're going to have to drill
holes<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> water<00:01:09.510> coming<00:01:09.869> in

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
holes as you can see the water coming in

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.830 
holes as you can see the water coming in
drill<00:01:10.770> holes<00:01:10.979> all<00:01:11.340> around<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> water

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
drill holes all around it at the water

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
drill holes all around it at the water
level

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.490 

and<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.630> how<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> waters<00:01:19.170> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> get

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
and that's how the waters going to get

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.130 
and that's how the waters going to get
into<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.220> intake<00:01:20.880> box<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.689> those<00:01:21.900> gold

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
into the intake box and those gold

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.200 
into the intake box and those gold
filled<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.500> around<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> loss<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.280> whole<00:01:23.460> more

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
filled all around the loss of whole more

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.140 
filled all around the loss of whole more
and<00:01:24.330> better<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.439> want<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.820> call<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.940> about

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
and better and you want to call it about

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
and better and you want to call it about
the<00:01:27.270> water<00:01:27.479> level<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:28.470> keep<00:01:28.770> putting

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the water level and then keep putting

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.130 
the water level and then keep putting
more<00:01:29.340> holes<00:01:29.610> above<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> water<00:01:30.420> levels<00:01:30.899> so<00:01:31.080> if

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
more holes above the water levels so if

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
more holes above the water levels so if
the<00:01:31.229> water<00:01:31.380> rises<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:32.610> will<00:01:32.729> have<00:01:32.880> more<00:01:33.060> ways

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the water rises it will have more ways

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.670 
the water rises it will have more ways
to<00:01:33.299> get<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:34.250> but<00:01:35.250> put<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.060> lowest<00:01:36.420> holes<00:01:36.720> where

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
to get in but put the lowest holes where

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.039 
to get in but put the lowest holes where
you<00:01:37.890> want<00:01:38.070> your<00:01:38.190> tank<00:01:38.460> water<00:01:39.060> level<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.570> stay

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you want your tank water level to stay

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.450 
you want your tank water level to stay
at<00:01:40.259> because<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:40.950> going<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.280> lowest

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
at because that's going to be the lowest

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.450 
at because that's going to be the lowest
level<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:41.940> it<00:01:42.390> will<00:01:42.509> stay<00:01:42.750> at<00:01:43.460> especially

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
level that it will stay at especially

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.230 
level that it will stay at especially
like<00:01:46.369> in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> event<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> power<00:01:48.090> failure

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
like in the event of a power failure

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.419 
like in the event of a power failure
going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> come<00:01:49.080> stop<00:01:49.350> pushing<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.190> lot<00:01:50.340> of

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
going to come stop pushing this a lot of

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.910 
going to come stop pushing this a lot of
the<00:01:50.520> tank<00:01:50.729> will<00:01:50.880> go<00:01:51.000> down<00:01:51.179> too<00:01:51.710> that's<00:01:52.710> not

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the tank will go down too that's not

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.570 
the tank will go down too that's not
super<00:01:53.310> important<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.100> tank<00:01:56.340> last

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
super important but in the in tank last

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.940 
super important but in the in tank last
I<00:01:56.789> got<00:01:56.909> my<00:01:57.149> two<00:01:57.600> cycle<00:01:57.990> tube<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.500> use<00:01:58.679> half

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
I got my two cycle tube and I use half

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.609 
I got my two cycle tube and I use half
inch<00:01:59.190> tubes<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.819> hope<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.690> use<00:02:00.810> an<00:02:00.960> h2<00:02:01.380> we'd

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
inch tubes I hope you use an h2 we'd

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.809 
inch tubes I hope you use an h2 we'd
probably<00:02:01.800> be<00:02:01.950> able<00:02:02.069> to<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:02.580> a<00:02:02.610> lot

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
probably be able to do this with a lot

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.910 
probably be able to do this with a lot
less<00:02:02.880> tubes<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.569> I<00:02:03.690> used<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.679> flow<00:02:04.890> I

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
less tubes and I used to get the flow I

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.430 
less tubes and I used to get the flow I
wanted<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.520> had<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.179> use<00:02:06.300> four<00:02:06.569> tubes<00:02:06.840> down<00:02:07.080> here

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
wanted I had to use four tubes down here

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.520 
wanted I had to use four tubes down here
and<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.850> youtube<00:02:09.330> what<00:02:09.750> about<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.140> our<00:02:10.170> half

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and to youtube what about all our half

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.979 
and to youtube what about all our half
inch<00:02:10.649> tube<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.700> could<00:02:12.000> use<00:02:12.150> one<00:02:12.450> inch<00:02:12.690> tube

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
inch tube so you could use one inch tube

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.890 
inch tube so you could use one inch tube
up<00:02:13.170> here<00:02:13.470> one<00:02:13.890> inch<00:02:14.040> youtube<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.760> one<00:02:15.750> or<00:02:15.870> two

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
up here one inch youtube and one or two

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.800 
up here one inch youtube and one or two
one<00:02:16.410> inch<00:02:16.590> drain<00:02:17.400> tubes<00:02:17.790> instead<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.540> four

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
one inch drain tubes instead of the four

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.979 
one inch drain tubes instead of the four
and<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.080> two<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.500> I'm<00:02:19.620> using<00:02:20.269> but<00:02:21.269> this<00:02:21.780> is

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
and the two that I'm using but this is

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.890 
and the two that I'm using but this is
what<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.140> had<00:02:22.350> at<00:02:22.440> home<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.130> what<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.310> use

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
what I had at home so this is what I use

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.370 
what I had at home so this is what I use
the<00:02:24.900> YouTube<00:02:25.260> is<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:26.489> this<00:02:26.670> one<00:02:27.380> the

the flow and it might take water might

the flow and it might take water might
keep<00:02:47.880> rising<00:02:52.549> okay<00:02:53.549> I'm<00:02:54.030> trying<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.600> show

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
keep rising okay I'm trying to just show

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.190 
keep rising okay I'm trying to just show
you<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.109> slave<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:55.609> has<00:02:56.609> feeling<00:02:57.600> but

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
you that the slave it has feeling but

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.370 
you that the slave it has feeling but
the<00:02:59.150> siphon<00:03:00.150> tube<00:03:00.180> should've<00:03:00.870> been<00:03:01.049> there

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
the siphon tube should've been there

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.110 
the siphon tube should've been there
they're<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.980> youtubes<00:03:02.340> are<00:03:02.519> really<00:03:02.820> low<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
they're the youtubes are really low the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.870 
they're the youtubes are really low the
bottom<00:03:03.560> coming<00:03:04.560> outside<00:03:04.890> box<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.459> exact

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
bottom coming outside box is the exact

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.620 
bottom coming outside box is the exact
same<00:03:06.150> level<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:08.459> youtubes<00:03:08.850> here<00:03:09.269> are

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
same level and the youtubes here are

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.750 
same level and the youtubes here are
also<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.200> water<00:03:10.380> ones<00:03:10.680> here<00:03:10.920> under<00:03:11.609> the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
also in the water ones here under the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.030 
also in the water ones here under the
drain<00:03:12.120> pipes<00:03:12.420> also<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:13.440> one<00:03:13.590> of<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.799> middle

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
drain pipes also and one of the middle

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.090 
drain pipes also and one of the middle
being<00:03:14.190> held<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:15.209> they<00:03:15.359> mate<00:03:15.510> there

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
being held and they mate there

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.360 
being held and they mate there
so<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.640> siphon<00:03:18.450> brings<00:03:19.140> water<00:03:19.440> for<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:20.040> tank

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
so the siphon brings water for a tank

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.059 
so the siphon brings water for a tank
box<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.819> Aventine<00:03:21.239> box<00:03:21.500> well<00:03:22.500> out<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.859> tank

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
box the Aventine box well out of tank

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:29.210 
box the Aventine box well out of tank
box<00:03:24.380> drains<00:03:25.380> down<00:03:25.859> these<00:03:26.070> four<00:03:26.370> tubes<00:03:27.769> into<00:03:28.769> my

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
box drains down these four tubes into my

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.930 
box drains down these four tubes into my
sump<00:03:29.489> tank<00:03:30.380> pretty<00:03:31.380> much<00:03:31.590> how<00:03:32.340> all<00:03:32.519> overflow

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
sump tank pretty much how all overflow

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.020 
sump tank pretty much how all overflow
boxes<00:03:33.329> work<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.949> by<00:03:34.949> placing<00:03:35.220> these<00:03:35.579> tubes<00:03:35.850> a

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
boxes work and by placing these tubes a

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.210 
boxes work and by placing these tubes a
little<00:03:36.329> bit<00:03:36.449> higher<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:37.049> drain<00:03:37.260> tubes<00:03:37.530> we

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
little bit higher the drain tubes we

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.379 
little bit higher the drain tubes we
need<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.430> put<00:03:38.579> them<00:03:38.639> on<00:03:38.729> the<00:03:38.820> side<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> little

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
need to put them on the side a little

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.849 
need to put them on the side a little
bit<00:03:39.510> tired<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:39.959> fill<00:03:40.169> up<00:03:40.260> put<00:03:40.560> them<00:03:40.709> in<00:03:40.799> the

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
bit tired we fill up put them in the

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.930 
bit tired we fill up put them in the
bottom<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.030> reason<00:03:42.419> for<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.630> is<00:03:43.760> if<00:03:44.760> the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
bottom and the reason for that is if the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.969 
bottom and the reason for that is if the
power<00:03:45.180> goes<00:03:45.269> out<00:03:45.600> they<00:03:46.410> would<00:03:46.590> drain<00:03:46.799> all<00:03:46.949> the

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
power goes out they would drain all the

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.460 
power goes out they would drain all the
water<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.729> siphon<00:03:48.150> with<00:03:48.299> your<00:03:48.419> loss<00:03:48.600> this

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
water and you siphon with your loss this

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.650 
water and you siphon with your loss this
way<00:03:49.739> if<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:49.949> power<00:03:50.250> goes<00:03:50.370> out<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:51.239> water<00:03:51.479> is

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
way if the power goes out the water is

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.180 
way if the power goes out the water is
only<00:03:51.720> going<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:51.989> drain<00:03:52.229> down<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.709> there<00:03:55.190> are

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
only going to drain down to there are

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.150 
only going to drain down to there are
under<00:03:56.609> there<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.930> cycles<00:03:58.350> may<00:03:58.560> impact<00:03:58.859> and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
under there so the cycles may impact and

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.789 
under there so the cycles may impact and
line<00:03:59.250> up<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.430> power<00:03:59.639> goes<00:03:59.850> back<00:04:00.060> on

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
line up the power goes back on

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.770 
line up the power goes back on
everything<00:04:01.799> will<00:04:02.010> keep<00:04:02.190> working<00:04:02.600> now<00:04:03.600> these

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
everything will keep working now these

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.930 
everything will keep working now these
air<00:04:04.260> tubes<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:04.829> see<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.070> got<00:04:05.340> going<00:04:05.639> in<00:04:05.760> here

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
air tubes you see I got going in here

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.319 
air tubes you see I got going in here
we're<00:04:06.780> really<00:04:06.900> important<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:08.209> little<00:04:09.209> bit

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
we're really important to little bit

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.010 
we're really important to little bit
about<00:04:09.479> the<00:04:09.600> view

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
about the view

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.740 
about the view
I<00:04:13.710> got<00:04:14.710> one<00:04:14.950> going<00:04:15.250> into<00:04:15.370> each<00:04:15.580> tube<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:16.180> then

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
I got one going into each tube and then

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.240 
I got one going into each tube and then
it's<00:04:16.900> out<00:04:17.050> in<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.410> air<00:04:17.560> on<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.830> other<00:04:17.890> side

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
it's out in the air on the other side

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.550 
it's out in the air on the other side
now<00:04:19.090> what<00:04:19.270> these<00:04:19.450> do<00:04:19.690> is<00:04:19.720> greatly<00:04:20.290> reduce<00:04:20.530> the

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
now what these do is greatly reduce the

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.290 
now what these do is greatly reduce the
sound<00:04:20.920> and<00:04:21.280> I'll<00:04:21.700> show<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:22.000> how<00:04:22.120> they<00:04:22.270> work

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
sound and I'll show you how they work

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.350 
sound and I'll show you how they work
basically<00:04:23.140> they<00:04:23.620> let<00:04:23.800> air<00:04:24.010> in<00:04:24.220> at<00:04:24.910> a<00:04:25.000> constant

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
basically they let air in at a constant

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.790 
basically they let air in at a constant
rate<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:25.690> can<00:04:25.810> see<00:04:25.990> here<00:04:26.320> is<00:04:26.410> the<00:04:26.500> end<00:04:26.650> of<00:04:26.710> the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
rate you can see here is the end of the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.880 
rate you can see here is the end of the
tubes<00:04:27.070> and<00:04:27.280> they're<00:04:27.820> letting<00:04:27.970> air<00:04:28.270> in<00:04:28.680> now<00:04:29.680> air

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
tubes and they're letting air in now air

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.300 
tubes and they're letting air in now air
is<00:04:30.040> always<00:04:30.280> going<00:04:30.790> in<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:32.020> them<00:04:32.200> but<00:04:32.950> without

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
is always going in to them but without

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.160 
is always going in to them but without
these<00:04:33.550> tubes<00:04:33.940> letting<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.300> constant<00:04:34.810> load<00:04:34.990> one

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
these tubes letting a constant load one

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.700 
these tubes letting a constant load one
we<00:04:35.740> take<00:04:35.950> this<00:04:36.100> out<00:04:38.370> it's<00:04:39.370> going<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.580> go<00:04:39.700> in

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
we take this out it's going to go in

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.810 
we take this out it's going to go in
this<00:04:41.710> one's<00:04:41.980> not<00:04:42.130> making<00:04:42.370> all<00:04:42.430> that<00:04:42.550> much<00:04:42.670> fun

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
this one's not making all that much fun

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.770 
this one's not making all that much fun
so<00:04:43.060> here<00:04:43.510> we<00:04:43.570> go

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.960 

the<00:04:46.780> air<00:04:46.930> is<00:04:46.990> going<00:04:47.110> to<00:04:47.200> come<00:04:47.410> in<00:04:47.530> at<00:04:47.970> random

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
the air is going to come in at random

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.450 
the air is going to come in at random
rates<00:04:49.450> and<00:04:49.780> make<00:04:50.470> lots<00:04:50.710> of<00:04:50.830> gurgling<00:04:51.160> noises

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
rates and make lots of gurgling noises

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.980 
rates and make lots of gurgling noises
and<00:04:52.170> if<00:04:53.170> this<00:04:53.470> was<00:04:53.650> out<00:04:53.770> all<00:04:54.010> for<00:04:54.310> two<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:55.900> would

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
and if this was out all for two it would

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.190 
and if this was out all for two it would
be<00:04:56.050> consistently<00:04:56.800> doing<00:04:57.160> this<00:04:57.310> until<00:04:57.640> we

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:11.280 

place<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.380> tube<00:05:02.620> back<00:05:02.860> in<00:05:07.950> and<00:05:08.950> now<00:05:10.140> it's<00:05:11.140> nice

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
place the tube back in and now it's nice

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.260 
place the tube back in and now it's nice
and<00:05:11.350> constant<00:05:12.040> flow<00:05:12.490> you<00:05:12.640> can<00:05:12.760> see<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.000> air<00:05:13.150> in

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
and constant flow you can see the air in

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.990 
and constant flow you can see the air in
there<00:05:13.420> and<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:14.860> makes<00:05:15.040> a<00:05:15.130> constant<00:05:15.610> flow<00:05:15.760> so

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
there and that makes a constant flow so

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.270 
there and that makes a constant flow so
there's<00:05:16.150> no<00:05:16.300> gurgling<00:05:16.780> that<00:05:17.050> goes<00:05:17.230> on<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:17.710> it

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
there's no gurgling that goes on and it

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.910 
there's no gurgling that goes on and it
makes<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:18.610> whole<00:05:18.730> system<00:05:19.320> fairly<00:05:20.320> silent

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
makes the whole system fairly silent

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.200 
makes the whole system fairly silent
there's<00:05:21.250> a<00:05:21.370> little<00:05:21.610> bit<00:05:21.730> of<00:05:21.760> water<00:05:21.970> movement

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
there's a little bit of water movement

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.280 
there's a little bit of water movement
noise<00:05:22.840> but<00:05:23.230> it's<00:05:23.620> pretty<00:05:23.740> quiet<00:05:24.010> so<00:05:25.170> that's<00:05:26.170> a

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
noise but it's pretty quiet so that's a

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.810 
noise but it's pretty quiet so that's a
cheap<00:05:26.560> about<00:05:27.390> $7<00:05:29.160> overflow<00:05:30.160> box<00:05:30.370> you<00:05:30.520> can<00:05:30.670> make

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
cheap about $7 overflow box you can make

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.560 
cheap about $7 overflow box you can make
and<00:05:31.830> it<00:05:32.830> handles<00:05:33.250> about<00:05:33.520> 300<00:05:34.150> gallons<00:05:34.450> per

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
and it handles about 300 gallons per

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.260 
and it handles about 300 gallons per
hour

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
hour

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.750
