and let me put this in a sink real quick
:

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.840 

and<00:01:22.400> by<00:01:22.520> sink<00:01:22.820> I<00:01:22.940> probably<00:01:23.150> met<00:01:23.360> my<00:01:23.480> mouth<00:01:23.690> P

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
and by sink I probably met my mouth P

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.180 
and by sink I probably met my mouth P
okay<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:27.260> want<00:01:27.410> these<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.650> open<00:01:27.770> otherwise

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
okay you want these to open otherwise

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.750 
okay you want these to open otherwise
won't<00:01:28.490> flowing<00:01:28.880> right<00:01:30.070> seal<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:31.220> in<00:01:31.400> we're

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
won't flowing right seal that in we're

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.630 
won't flowing right seal that in we're
really<00:01:32.000> flow<00:01:35.620> just<00:01:36.620> till<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.040> end<00:01:37.160> it<00:01:37.340> doesn't

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
really flow just till the end it doesn't

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.450 
really flow just till the end it doesn't
really<00:01:37.700> show<00:01:37.880> but<00:01:38.390> they<00:01:39.320> steal<00:01:39.650> quick<00:01:40.010> on<00:01:40.340> the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
really show but they steal quick on the

00:01:40.460 --> 00:02:03.180 
really show but they steal quick on the
high<00:01:47.170> let's<00:01:48.170> pour<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.470> in

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.490 

are<00:02:04.190> we<00:02:04.310> doing<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.580> bunch<00:02:04.790> of<00:02:04.910> these<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:05.500> it's

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
are we doing a bunch of these so it's

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.370 
are we doing a bunch of these so it's
not<00:02:06.620> that

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.450 

and<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.070> think<00:02:15.370> we<00:02:15.460> didn't<00:02:15.700> have<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.940> clean<00:02:16.150> it

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
and I think we didn't have to clean it

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:27.650 
and I think we didn't have to clean it
for<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.610> saloon

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.309 

there<00:02:28.660> we<00:02:28.810> are<00:02:28.959> field<00:02:30.750> shape<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.930> pressure<00:02:32.140> on

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
there we are field shape and pressure on

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.100 
there we are field shape and pressure on
that<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.920> leaks

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
that the leaks

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
that the leaks
explosions<00:02:35.110> nothing<00:02:35.410> it's<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.560> an<00:02:35.739> instance

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
explosions nothing it's just an instance

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.290 
explosions nothing it's just an instance
see<00:02:36.310> we'll<00:02:36.459> see<00:02:36.610> if<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.790> got<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.000> be<00:02:37.060> really

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
see we'll see if you got to be really

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.870 
see we'll see if you got to be really
quick<00:02:37.890> because<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:39.130> got<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.400> idea<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.700> us

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
quick because I got the idea of us

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.760 
quick because I got the idea of us
having<00:02:39.910> these<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.510> soy<00:02:40.900> sauce<00:02:41.200> ones<00:02:41.470> I<00:02:41.590> thought

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
having these a soy sauce ones I thought

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.320 
having these a soy sauce ones I thought
I<00:02:42.040> can<00:02:42.760> do<00:02:42.910> that

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
I can do that

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.000 
I can do that
now<00:02:44.170> take<00:02:44.500> ones<00:02:44.800> with<00:02:45.519> um<00:02:46.620> I'll<00:02:47.620> let<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.890> cool

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
now take ones with um I'll let it cool

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.589 
now take ones with um I'll let it cool
down<00:02:48.069> but<00:02:48.370> I'll<00:02:48.459> take<00:02:48.640> some<00:02:48.940> with<00:02:49.120> some<00:02:49.269> jelly

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
down but I'll take some with some jelly
