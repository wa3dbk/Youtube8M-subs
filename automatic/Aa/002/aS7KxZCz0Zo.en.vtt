00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.149 
in Kentucky how do we know this some of
these<00:01:57.329> birds<00:01:57.630> are<00:01:57.930> caught<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.500> same<00:01:58.799> net

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
these birds are caught in the same net

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.620 
these birds are caught in the same net
year<00:01:59.610> after<00:02:00.149> year

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
year after year

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.139 
year after year
are<00:02:01.780> you<00:02:01.899> doing<00:02:02.110> buddy<00:02:05.399> good<00:02:06.399> deal<00:02:06.670> with<00:02:06.909> male

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
are you doing buddy good deal with male

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.339 
are you doing buddy good deal with male
hooded<00:02:08.039> who<00:02:09.300> already<00:02:10.300> has<00:02:10.509> a<00:02:10.539> band<00:02:10.840> on<00:02:11.019> him

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
hooded who already has a band on him

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.490 
hooded who already has a band on him
so<00:02:11.560> this<00:02:12.069> is<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.280> guy<00:02:12.750> that<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.900> banded<00:02:14.230> last

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
so this is a guy that we banded last

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.729 
so this is a guy that we banded last
year<00:02:14.920> or<00:02:15.130> maybe<00:02:15.519> earlier<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.569> it's<00:02:17.319> flown<00:02:17.560> all

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
year or maybe earlier and it's flown all

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.240 
year or maybe earlier and it's flown all
the<00:02:17.769> way<00:02:17.890> down<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.459> Central<00:02:18.819> America<00:02:18.880> and<00:02:19.420> back

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
the way down to Central America and back

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.800 
the way down to Central America and back
with<00:02:21.250> our<00:02:21.430> band<00:02:21.610> still<00:02:21.880> on<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.330> that's<00:02:22.510> pretty

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
with our band still on so that's pretty

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.920 
with our band still on so that's pretty
neat

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
neat

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.330 
neat
on<00:02:25.930> May<00:02:26.230> 21st<00:02:26.769> 2009<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:29.410> caught<00:02:29.620> this<00:02:29.769> bird<00:02:30.069> and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
on May 21st 2009 we caught this bird and

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.420 
on May 21st 2009 we caught this bird and
banded<00:02:31.120> him<00:02:31.239> for<00:02:31.390> the<00:02:31.450> first<00:02:31.660> time<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:33.250> he

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
banded him for the first time and so he

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.930 
banded him for the first time and so he
has<00:02:33.550> flown<00:02:33.910> from<00:02:35.099> Natural<00:02:36.099> Bridge<00:02:36.250> right<00:02:36.519> here

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
has flown from Natural Bridge right here

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.860 
has flown from Natural Bridge right here
down<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.690> Central<00:02:38.080> America<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.980> back<00:02:39.870> 2010

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
down to Central America and back 2010

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.320 
down to Central America and back 2010
down<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.860> Central<00:02:42.160> America<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.670> back<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.239> we

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
down to Central America and back and we

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.420 
down to Central America and back and we
caught<00:02:43.540> him<00:02:43.630> again<00:02:43.959> at<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.650> exact<00:02:45.010> same<00:02:45.250> spot

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
caught him again at this exact same spot

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.370 
caught him again at this exact same spot
we<00:02:45.670> don't<00:02:45.819> even<00:02:45.970> move<00:02:46.090> these<00:02:46.239> nets<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.200> he's

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
we don't even move these nets so he's

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.740 
we don't even move these nets so he's
done<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.650> twice<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.299> exact<00:02:49.599> same

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
done that twice to the exact same

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.490 
done that twice to the exact same
location<00:02:49.930> which<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.590> why<00:02:51.069> we<00:02:51.280> do<00:02:51.430> this<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.910> still

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
location which is why we do this I still

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.479 
location which is why we do this I still
kind<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.560> boggles<00:02:53.860> our<00:02:53.980> mind<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.370> they<00:02:54.459> can

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
kind of boggles our mind that they can

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.150 
kind of boggles our mind that they can
do<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:54.880> it's<00:02:55.329> pretty<00:02:55.569> amazing<00:02:55.989> as<00:02:56.799> little<00:02:57.069> as

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
do that it's pretty amazing as little as

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.780 
do that it's pretty amazing as little as
this<00:02:57.280> guy<00:02:57.489> is<00:02:57.549> he<00:02:58.510> makes<00:02:58.690> that<00:02:58.870> trip<00:02:59.670> here<00:03:00.670> at

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
this guy is he makes that trip here at

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.210 
this guy is he makes that trip here at
Natural<00:03:01.180> Bridge<00:03:01.420> we're<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:02.049> one<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:03.010> most

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
Natural Bridge we're in one of the most

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.330 
Natural Bridge we're in one of the most
diverse<00:03:03.760> areas<00:03:04.269> of<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.959> state<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.470> we<00:03:06.310> have

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
diverse areas of the state and we have

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.550 
diverse areas of the state and we have
about<00:03:06.579> seven<00:03:06.970> different<00:03:07.120> types<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:08.019> rock<00:03:08.230> that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
about seven different types of rock that

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.009 
about seven different types of rock that
can<00:03:08.709> be<00:03:08.859> seen<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.609> are<00:03:09.700> exposed<00:03:10.180> from<00:03:10.840> the

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
can be seen that are exposed from the

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.289 
can be seen that are exposed from the
valley<00:03:11.200> floor<00:03:11.530> up<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.040> ridge<00:03:12.220> tops<00:03:12.519> with

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
valley floor up to the ridge tops with

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.319 
valley floor up to the ridge tops with
that<00:03:13.690> diversity<00:03:14.650> in<00:03:14.739> rock<00:03:15.120> we<00:03:16.120> get<00:03:16.299> a

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
that diversity in rock we get a

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.990 
that diversity in rock we get a
diversity<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:17.049> soil<00:03:17.590> types<00:03:17.829> which<00:03:18.489> means<00:03:18.790> a

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
diversity of soil types which means a

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.059 
diversity of soil types which means a
great<00:03:19.329> diversity<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.840> plants<00:03:20.350> which<00:03:20.709> leads<00:03:20.950> to

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
great diversity of plants which leads to

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.479 
great diversity of plants which leads to
a<00:03:21.220> diversity<00:03:21.639> of<00:03:21.730> wildlife<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.160> think<00:03:24.310> it

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
a diversity of wildlife so I think it

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.710 
a diversity of wildlife so I think it
has<00:03:24.579> a<00:03:24.609> lot<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.819> do<00:03:24.970> with<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.090> but<00:03:25.299> also<00:03:25.480> the

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
has a lot to do with that but also the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.420 
has a lot to do with that but also the
topography<00:03:26.290> obviously<00:03:27.100> you're<00:03:27.250> in<00:03:27.310> the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
topography obviously you're in the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.080 
topography obviously you're in the
shaded<00:03:27.819> valleys<00:03:28.920> that's<00:03:29.920> that's<00:03:30.280> going<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.489> be

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
shaded valleys that's that's going to be

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.569 
shaded valleys that's that's going to be
one<00:03:31.329> type<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.680> habitat<00:03:32.680> for<00:03:32.889> certain<00:03:33.370> species

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
one type of habitat for certain species

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.090 
one type of habitat for certain species
a<00:03:34.060> little<00:03:34.630> bit<00:03:34.720> more<00:03:34.870> cool<00:03:35.109> and<00:03:35.380> moist<00:03:35.500> then

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
a little bit more cool and moist then

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.559 
a little bit more cool and moist then
you<00:03:36.190> get<00:03:36.310> up<00:03:36.400> to<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.579> dry<00:03:36.760> ridge<00:03:37.000> tops<00:03:37.329> and

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
you get up to the dry ridge tops and

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.059 
you get up to the dry ridge tops and
you'll<00:03:37.690> see<00:03:37.870> a<00:03:38.109> different<00:03:38.950> set<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.579> species

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
you'll see a different set of species

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.590 
you'll see a different set of species
this<00:03:42.069> is<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.280> Louisiana<00:03:42.819> water<00:03:43.180> thrush<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:46.090> so

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
this is a Louisiana water thrush and so

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.040 
this is a Louisiana water thrush and so
it's<00:03:47.220> riparian<00:03:48.220> corridors<00:03:49.410> creeks<00:03:50.410> and

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
it's riparian corridors creeks and

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.380 
it's riparian corridors creeks and
and<00:03:52.500> he's<00:03:52.740> another<00:03:52.980> one<00:03:53.130> that's<00:03:53.370> considered<00:03:54.270> a

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
and he's another one that's considered a

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.260 
and he's another one that's considered a
species<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.080> management<00:03:55.800> concern<00:03:56.270> which

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
species of management concern which

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.760 
species of management concern which
means<00:03:57.510> they're<00:03:57.660> not<00:03:57.690> technically<00:03:58.170> endangered

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
means they're not technically endangered

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.980 
means they're not technically endangered
but<00:03:58.950> they<00:03:59.070> are<00:03:59.190> in<00:03:59.400> decline<00:03:59.720> throughout<00:04:00.720> much

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
but they are in decline throughout much

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.340 
but they are in decline throughout much
of<00:04:01.020> their<00:04:01.320> range<00:04:01.590> although<00:04:02.780> we<00:04:03.780> do<00:04:03.900> find<00:04:04.200> them

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
of their range although we do find them

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.720 
of their range although we do find them
pretty<00:04:04.620> regular<00:04:05.040> here<00:04:05.190> at<00:04:05.250> Natural<00:04:05.550> Bridge

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
pretty regular here at Natural Bridge

stumble into our Nets those red eyes
there's<00:06:22.849> nothing<00:06:23.119> else<00:06:23.709> like<00:06:24.709> it<00:06:24.919> a<00:06:25.479> lot<00:06:26.479> of

there's nothing else like it a lot of

there's nothing else like it a lot of
these<00:06:26.979> species<00:06:27.979> have<00:06:28.789> been<00:06:28.969> studied<00:06:29.360> for<00:06:29.389> a

these species have been studied for a

these species have been studied for a
long<00:06:29.749> time<00:06:30.019> but<00:06:30.229> people<00:06:30.559> still<00:06:30.919> don't<00:06:31.099> know

00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:31.309 
long time but people still don't know

00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:32.799 
long time but people still don't know
everything<00:06:31.639> about<00:06:31.999> them<00:06:32.179> people<00:06:32.329> still<00:06:32.659> don't

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:32.809 
everything about them people still don't

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.829 
everything about them people still don't
know<00:06:32.929> exactly<00:06:33.529> how<00:06:34.279> long<00:06:34.689> necessarily<00:06:35.689> all

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:35.839 
know exactly how long necessarily all

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:37.989 
know exactly how long necessarily all
these<00:06:36.019> birds<00:06:36.199> live<00:06:36.499> or<00:06:36.739> exactly<00:06:37.279> where<00:06:37.849> they

00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:37.999 
these birds live or exactly where they

these birds live or exactly where they
migrate<00:06:38.449> to<00:06:38.689> and<00:06:38.869> from<00:06:39.049> every<00:06:39.289> year<00:06:39.619> I<00:06:39.649> mean<00:06:39.860> we

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
migrate to and from every year I mean we

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.769 
migrate to and from every year I mean we
know<00:06:40.129> more<00:06:40.309> and<00:06:40.399> more<00:06:40.579> every<00:06:40.879> year<00:06:40.909> but

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:41.779 
know more and more every year but

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:42.999 
know more and more every year but
there's<00:06:42.049> still<00:06:42.169> a<00:06:42.229> lot<00:06:42.349> to<00:06:42.499> learn<00:06:42.619> about<00:06:42.679> how

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
there's still a lot to learn about how

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.569 
there's still a lot to learn about how
the<00:06:43.249> all<00:06:43.489> these<00:06:43.669> bird<00:06:43.849> species<00:06:44.089> survive
