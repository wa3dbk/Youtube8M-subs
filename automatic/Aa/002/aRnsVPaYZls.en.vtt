00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
card much higher this time that last

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.630 
card much higher this time that last
year<00:01:06.180> when<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.420> cut<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.990> had<00:01:07.740> pretty<00:01:08.130> look<00:01:08.369> how<00:01:08.400> to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
year when I cut I had pretty look how to

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.270 
year when I cut I had pretty look how to
all<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> way<00:01:09.000> through<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.830> when<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> say<00:01:11.070> low

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
all the way through it when I say low

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.550 
all the way through it when I say low
socket<00:01:11.880> we're<00:01:12.030> talking<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> hundred<00:01:12.659> 250

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
socket we're talking like a hundred 250

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.609 
socket we're talking like a hundred 250
grams<00:01:13.799> no<00:01:14.549> somos<00:01:15.150> kita<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.170> mean<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.500> had

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
grams no somos kita but I mean I had

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.740 
grams no somos kita but I mean I had
pretty<00:01:16.950> decent<00:01:17.369> results<00:01:17.790> last<00:01:18.060> year<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
pretty decent results last year but I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.450 
pretty decent results last year but I
think<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.229> will<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.409> much<00:01:19.650> better<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
think this will be much better for a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.240 
think this will be much better for a
retaining<00:01:20.909> strength<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:22.710> work<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
retaining strength the work is going to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.810 
retaining strength the work is going to
be<00:01:23.369> heavy<00:01:23.610> sex<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.210> I've<00:01:24.360> said<00:01:24.540> dream<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
be heavy sex like I've said dream with a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
be heavy sex like I've said dream with a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
reps for four to five sets may need to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.200 
reps for four to five sets may need to
keep<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> volume<00:01:32.460> up<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.790> you've<00:01:33.060> got<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
keep the volume up so you've got that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.640 
keep the volume up so you've got that
activity<00:01:33.900> level<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.829> calorie<00:01:35.520> expenditure

activity level the calorie expenditure

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.649 
activity level the calorie expenditure
but<00:01:37.650> not<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.400> much<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.060> exhausted
