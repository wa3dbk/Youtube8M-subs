00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.240
 we are aboard a helicopter based 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.849
 at the two-alpes direction la grave 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.340
 it's 6:30 am the helicopter landed on 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.440
 the dz that is on the border between 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.600
 two departments of Haut-Alpes and Isère 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.430
 about thirty people are waiting 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.790
 get on board to get to their 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.500
 job 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.539
 we have identified all the people who 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.099
 needed them 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.869
 to cross to go to work from 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.890
 the other side is isere or vice versa 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.379
 room that come from the isere and who 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.540
 come from 4 5 people 2 involved 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:40.140
 and therefore they are asked to be present at 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.149
 6:30 on the dz where I speak to you 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.710
 and so we cross them through 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.960
 after the others here we have a flow of 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.159
 60 characters hours roughly 12 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 helicopter rotations this is the 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.390
 first time you have to use this 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.180
 way there yes it's the first time around 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.559
 the boat the helicopter so that's how 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.449
 you organize the you enjoy a 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.460
 rotation is there we enjoy a 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.680
 rotation like that after we sleep there 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.880
 in both directions it was soon a little less 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.799
 of people tomorrow morning since we 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.180
 starts happiness too his girlfriend 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.549
 start happiness so that's why 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.799
 we take advantage of the opportunity you 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.079
 sleep there we will sleep there our 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.979
 magnitude lent us an apartment so 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.979
 we will sleep the colander 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.299
 since monday morning this airlift 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.460
 emergency is running two minutes 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.549
 thirty flight and here we are on the other 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.320
 side of the lake isère side if the idea is 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.790
 good she does not hide anger 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.790
 growing population 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.680
 in good shape I adapt myself I try to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.840
 luck I'm still young so here we go 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.510
 but for I know that for some 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.170
 it's really complicated and drifting 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.330
 truly bad 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.049
 here is to prefer a route anyway 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.080
 that's nice we put ourselves 1 I 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.500
 wanted to thank the regional council 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.540
 that's because they're the ones who pay for it 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.320
 do not tell you when it was not the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.940
 mine but we would like the state to take 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.890
 this road in charge and that's 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.890
 seriously occupy are still in 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.080
 anger created thank you 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.489
 and actually the annoyance since 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.000
 for two months everyone has been doing 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.950
 feet and hands 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.200
 side employees as employers side for 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.880
 get organized and we arrive as we say 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.910
 we come to the end to end solutions 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.760
 force we have trouble projecting ourselves into 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.140
 the future more than a closed road 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.940
 which still allows tourists to 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.440
 to go by the galtric or by the frejus 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.060
 we have trouble projecting ourselves into winter 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.160
 because winter the gallibier will not be 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.750
 a tunnel solution of the Frejus with the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.120
 extra cost it will not be a solution no 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.230
 more so the real difficulty is 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.720
 we think of winter 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.580
 an echo shared by the merchants of 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.830
 the serious frederick manager of this store 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.500
 and who opened three weeks ago 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.049
 ironically about the current mood 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.670
 reigns in the early summer and does not 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.560
 not hide his concern or his 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.280
 skepticism for the next season 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.650
 winter 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.140
 summer is difficult to negotiate 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.090
 not really feel like summer 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.190
 here it is very beautiful it is very 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.340
 hot down at home it's already doing 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.810
 hot and yet eh ben the streets of 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.670
 lagrave are almost deserted 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.220
 we do not see many people every day 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.599
 in the store, we are waiting on 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.670
 wait is the motto of the season 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.329
 now we have our eyes riveted towards 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.000
 winter with the immense worry is 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:27.000
 almost the certainty that there will not be 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.049
 road this winter and that it is necessary 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.120
 take seals he must take 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.340
 decisions now decisions 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.930
 like to think about the future of his 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.090
 activity or even a closure 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.250
 possible jean-pierre this town 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.650
 vreizh who just set up this 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.930
 airlift in record time and 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.030
 tired of this situation and he's going 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.700
 further he sees a disaster 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.620
 Economics on a larger scale 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.599
 a world without rods it's tens 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.630
 millions of euros that will be lost 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:58.470
 between the 2 alpes serre chevalier 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.600
 the fan of currency he shined are 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.490
 so I think it really takes 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.630
 take the measure of the economic disaster 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:08.040
 towards which we are moving side and the 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.960
 straits between three and seven thousand 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.710
 cars day that passed on this 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.240
 road can no longer pass to fitton 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.070
 a shuttle on Tuesday morning we can 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.410
 find that the mountain is not 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.540
 still not fallen the cause this time 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.000
 it is of climatic order as we 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.170
 explains david the guen on our return from 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.790
 vote then the info we got 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.080
 yesterday is that even when there was 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.180
 actually the mountain continue to 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.310
 master rhythm a day that has some 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.020
 slowdowns of then not 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.690
 slowdowns but decreases 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.190
 acceleration to be exact who 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.540
 continues surely due to dilatation 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.650
 rocks with high temperatures 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.170
 indeed it would appear that 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.390
 hot weather do not help us 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.500
 expects from this point of view a point 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.450
 geological view we have no choice 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.490
 to wait we know that the council 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.340
 departmental now does not forbid 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.030
 more purge solutions that had 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.170
 been discarded from entry so to know 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.340
 possibly hydraulic why 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.960
 not attract to the explosive every 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.960
 solutions are again being studied for 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.729
 try to facilitate aging 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.680
 to the serious like the other common 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.840
 impacted by the closure of this 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.240
 road live to the rhythm of management 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.340
 daily of this crisis with in mind 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.590
 an economic disaster that seems 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.379
 inevitable as long as decisions 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:22.229
 important quick steps are taken to 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:24.620
 restore this vital road axis to 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.620
 it's known
