between the throttle body and then close

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.390 
between the throttle body and then close
it<00:00:30.270> on<00:00:30.510> there<00:00:30.690> but<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.650> then<00:00:32.130> what

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
it on there but if you do that then what

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.670 
it on there but if you do that then what
happens<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.930> wind<00:00:34.170> up<00:00:34.440> with<00:00:36.290> this<00:00:37.290> kind<00:00:37.590> of

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
happens as you wind up with this kind of

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.440 
happens as you wind up with this kind of
spacing<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.370> can't<00:00:38.640> put<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> groove<00:00:39.239> in

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
spacing and you can't put the groove in

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.049 
spacing and you can't put the groove in
there<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:40.020> right<00:00:40.200> now<00:00:40.800> since<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.400> is<00:00:41.610> anyway

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
there all right now since it is anyway

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.510 
there all right now since it is anyway
you<00:00:42.199> have<00:00:43.199> to<00:00:43.320> adjust<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.770> spacing<00:00:43.980> all<00:00:44.340> that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
you have to adjust the spacing all that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.240 
you have to adjust the spacing all that
but<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.850> thing<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.739> don't<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
but the thing is that you don't do that

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.040 
but the thing is that you don't do that
owns<00:00:47.400> all<00:00:47.699> of<00:00:47.730> them<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.629> standard

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
owns all of them that's just a standard

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.710 
owns all of them that's just a standard
if<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.260> do<00:00:49.470> that<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.980> will<00:00:50.040> work<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:51.089> what<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
if you do that it will work but what you

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.910 
if you do that it will work but what you
want<00:00:51.900> to<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.080> is<00:00:52.290> you<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> look<00:00:52.650> and<00:00:52.739> find

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
want to do is you want to look and find

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.890 

you'll<00:00:59.120> see<00:00:59.330> the<00:00:59.450> black<00:00:59.720> mark<00:01:01.000> from<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.060> PCV

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
you'll see the black mark from the PCV

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.950 
you'll see the black mark from the PCV
gases<00:01:03.740> and<00:01:04.100> what<00:01:04.760> that<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:05.210> is<00:01:05.480> that's<00:01:05.660> the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
gases and what that is is that's the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.660 
gases and what that is is that's the
National<00:01:06.380> idle<00:01:06.740> position<00:01:06.830> because<00:01:07.280> that's

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
National idle position because that's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.160 
National idle position because that's
the<00:01:07.820> lowest<00:01:08.000> spot<00:01:08.360> on<00:01:08.570> there<00:01:08.690> so<00:01:08.900> what<00:01:09.050> you

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
the lowest spot on there so what you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.990 
the lowest spot on there so what you
want<00:01:09.350> to<00:01:09.410> do<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.800> you<00:01:10.130> just<00:01:10.460> won't<00:01:10.610> find<00:01:10.850> a

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
want to do is you just won't find a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.760 
want to do is you just won't find a
spacer<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:11.600> will<00:01:11.690> put<00:01:11.870> it<00:01:11.960> right<00:01:12.200> about<00:01:12.560> at

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
spacer that will put it right about at

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.530 
spacer that will put it right about at
that<00:01:12.950> spot<00:01:13.310> where<00:01:13.550> where<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.790> national<00:01:14.210> idol

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
that spot where where the national idol

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.250 
that spot where where the national idol
is<00:01:14.660> it<00:01:15.020> should<00:01:15.170> be<00:01:15.290> right<00:01:15.800> about<00:01:15.890> there<00:01:16.310> and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
is it should be right about there and

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.450 
is it should be right about there and
lock<00:01:18.260> it<00:01:18.440> into<00:01:18.560> position<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:18.950> can<00:01:19.040> come<00:01:19.250> help

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
lock it into position you can come help

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.719 
lock it into position you can come help
you<00:01:19.940> have<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.210> open<00:01:20.360> just<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.810> little<00:01:20.870> bit<00:01:21.320> more

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
you have to open just a little bit more

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.090 
you have to open just a little bit more
just<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:22.820> be<00:01:22.940> on<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.090> safe<00:01:23.420> side<00:01:23.470> but<00:01:24.470> that's

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
just to be on the safe side but that's

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.200 
just to be on the safe side but that's
what<00:01:25.370> you're<00:01:25.520> looking<00:01:25.550> at<00:01:25.910> that's<00:01:26.090> the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
what you're looking at that's the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.600 
what you're looking at that's the
National<00:01:26.630> idle<00:01:26.960> position<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.920> so<00:01:28.220> the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
National idle position and so the

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.150 
National idle position and so the
spacing<00:01:29.420> process<00:01:30.170> won't<00:01:30.380> work<00:01:30.560> now<00:01:30.770> i'll<00:01:30.950> show

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
spacing process won't work now i'll show

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.890 
spacing process won't work now i'll show
you<00:01:31.220> what<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.460> single

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.070 

still<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.830> be<00:01:37.950> far<00:01:38.700> too<00:01:39.000> far<00:01:39.330> out<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
still going to be far too far out you

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.400 
still going to be far too far out you
can<00:01:40.320> see<00:01:40.440> I'm<00:01:40.500> putting<00:01:40.800> it<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:40.980> there<00:01:41.660> okay<00:01:42.660> you

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
can see I'm putting it in there okay you

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.750 
can see I'm putting it in there okay you
see<00:01:43.620> where<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.890> at<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.310> still<00:01:44.460> gives<00:01:44.610> you

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
see where it's at that still gives you

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.240 
see where it's at that still gives you
enough<00:01:44.910> room<00:01:45.120> to<00:01:45.240> groove<00:01:45.620> but<00:01:46.620> there's<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
enough room to groove but there's you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.790 
enough room to groove but there's you
can<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> still<00:01:47.820> got<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.540> least<00:01:48.800> three

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
can see you still got at least three

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.250 
can see you still got at least three
sixteenths<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.370> an<00:01:50.460> inch<00:01:50.610> there<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.690> work<00:01:51.930> with

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
sixteenths of an inch there to work with

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.950 
sixteenths of an inch there to work with
