00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.829 
so anyways in this video I wanted to
talk<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:15.030> something<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.719> just

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
talk about something that I was just

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.570 
talk about something that I was just
thinking<00:00:16.080> about<00:00:16.109> last<00:00:16.410> night<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.310> is

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
thinking about last night and that is

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.230 
thinking about last night and that is
Android<00:00:18.539> wear<00:00:18.810> versus<00:00:19.710> Google<00:00:20.039> glass<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.180> if

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
Android wear versus Google glass so if

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.279 
Android wear versus Google glass so if
you<00:00:21.300> guys<00:00:21.420> haven't<00:00:21.660> noticed<00:00:21.779> these<00:00:22.109> are

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
you guys haven't noticed these are

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.730 
you guys haven't noticed these are
basically<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.670> same<00:00:23.699> device<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
basically the same device just in a

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.170 
basically the same device just in a
different<00:00:26.250> perspective

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
different perspective

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.300 
different perspective
so<00:00:27.300> they're<00:00:27.480> both<00:00:27.660> Google<00:00:28.500> now<00:00:28.650> devices<00:00:29.189> if

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
so they're both Google now devices if

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.830 
so they're both Google now devices if
you<00:00:29.400> really<00:00:29.609> think<00:00:29.730> about<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.210> except<00:00:30.630> that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
you really think about it except that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.959 
you really think about it except that
once<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.890> your<00:00:32.009> wrist<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.460> once<00:00:32.640> it's<00:00:32.880> on

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
once it's on your wrist and once it's on

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.819 
once it's on your wrist and once it's on

to give this discussion rolling so like

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.130 
to give this discussion rolling so like
I<00:00:41.579> said<00:00:41.640> Android<00:00:42.239> wear<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.750> Google<00:00:43.110> glass

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
I said Android wear and Google glass

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.040 
I said Android wear and Google glass
these<00:00:43.530> are<00:00:43.710> both<00:00:44.239> glanceable<00:00:45.239> these<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.870> both

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
these are both glanceable these are both

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.290 
these are both glanceable these are both
used<00:00:46.350> for<00:00:46.500> glanceable<00:00:46.980> notifications<00:00:47.969> so

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
used for glanceable notifications so

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.660 
used for glanceable notifications so
really<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.379> discussion<00:00:49.739> at<00:00:50.250> least<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.579> me

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
really the discussion at least for me

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.060 
really the discussion at least for me
comes<00:00:51.000> into<00:00:51.300> three<00:00:51.840> main<00:00:52.140> categories<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.890> guess

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
comes into three main categories I guess

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.790 
comes into three main categories I guess
and<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.120> guess<00:00:54.750> kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.410> features

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and that is I guess kind of the features

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
and that is I guess kind of the features
even<00:00:56.070> though<00:00:56.160> they're<00:00:56.309> mostly<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> same<00:00:56.850> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
even though they're mostly the same the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.099 
even though they're mostly the same the
price<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.440> basically<00:00:59.539> how<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> put

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
price and basically how do I want to put

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.100 
price and basically how do I want to put
this<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> social<00:01:02.160> aspect<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.660> social

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
this the social aspect and the social

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.590 
this the social aspect and the social
acceptance<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:05.100> both<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.640> these<00:01:05.729> devices<00:01:05.970> so

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
acceptance of both of these devices so

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.899 
acceptance of both of these devices so
first<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.650> both<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.100> these<00:01:08.220> things<00:01:08.549> do

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
first what can both of these things do

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.460 
first what can both of these things do
well<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.479> course<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.990> heads-up<00:01:10.409> display

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
well of course it's a heads-up display

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.770 
well of course it's a heads-up display
that's<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.490> your<00:01:11.580> face<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> can<00:01:12.659> give

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
that's just on your face and it can give

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200 
that's just on your face and it can give
you<00:01:12.900> glanceable<00:01:13.290> notifications<00:01:14.100> such<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.640> you

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
you glanceable notifications such as you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.240 
you glanceable notifications such as you
can<00:01:15.330> send<00:01:15.570> text<00:01:15.780> messages<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:17.070> get

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
can send text messages you can get

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.539 
can send text messages you can get
driving<00:01:17.580> directions<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:19.439> thing<00:01:19.890> one

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
driving directions and one thing one

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.420 
driving directions and one thing one
place<00:01:20.790> where<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.240> differs<00:01:21.750> from

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
place where this differs from

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.340 
place where this differs from
smartwatches<00:01:23.430> Early's<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.659> Android<00:01:25.140> wear

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
smartwatches Early's from Android wear

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.620 
smartwatches Early's from Android wear
smartwatches<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.700> fact<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.390> has<00:01:27.600> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
smartwatches is the fact that it has a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.230 
smartwatches is the fact that it has a
camera<00:01:28.409> but<00:01:28.829> also<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.280> camera<00:01:29.670> presents<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
camera but also that camera presents a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.700 
camera but also that camera presents a
main<00:01:30.450> problem<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.079> don't<00:01:31.140> probably<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
main problem and I don't probably the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.840 
main problem and I don't probably the
last<00:01:31.890> thing<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.310> talked<00:01:32.520> about<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
last thing that I talked about this

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.090 
last thing that I talked about this
video<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.659> other<00:01:33.810> than<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.079> that's<00:01:34.560> really

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
video but other than that that's really

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.460 
video but other than that that's really
where<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.700> difference<00:01:36.150> lies<00:01:36.470> between

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
where the difference lies between

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200 
where the difference lies between
Android<00:01:37.890> wear<00:01:38.070> devices<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.700> Google<00:01:39.030> glass

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
Android wear devices and Google glass

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.569 
Android wear devices and Google glass
devices<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.470> sits<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.829> your<00:01:40.890> face<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.400> still

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
devices it sits on your face it's still

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.399 
devices it sits on your face it's still
the<00:01:41.729> same<00:01:42.180> notifications<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.170> you're<00:01:43.290> gonna

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the same notifications that you're gonna

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.889 
the same notifications that you're gonna
be<00:01:43.560> getting<00:01:43.590> from<00:01:44.369> Android<00:01:45.299> wear<00:01:45.509> because

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
be getting from Android wear because

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.920 
be getting from Android wear because
these<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.680> both<00:01:47.040> Google<00:01:47.939> now<00:01:48.090> devices<00:01:48.750> so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
these are both Google now devices so

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.929 
these are both Google now devices so
anything<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.439> do<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.649> Google<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
anything you can do on Google now you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.249 
anything you can do on Google now you
can<00:01:51.060> basically<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.780> both<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.200> these

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
can basically do on both of these

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.649 
can basically do on both of these
platforms<00:01:52.590> except<00:01:53.490> again<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.390> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
platforms except again it's just the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.980 
platforms except again it's just the
form<00:01:55.020> factor<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.490> different<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.659> it's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
form factor that is different so it's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.410 
form factor that is different so it's
basically<00:01:58.740> hands-free<00:01:59.310> wear

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
basically hands-free wear

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.929 
basically hands-free wear
Android<00:02:01.380> wear<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.920> course<00:02:02.189> it's<00:02:02.399> gonna<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.610> on

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
Android wear of course it's gonna be on

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.219 
Android wear of course it's gonna be on
your<00:02:03.119> wrist<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:03.810> that's<00:02:03.960> not<00:02:04.079> really

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
your wrist so that's not really

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.459 
your wrist so that's not really
hands-free<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.479> really<00:02:06.600> depends<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.170> what

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
hands-free so it really depends on what

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.010 
hands-free so it really depends on what
what<00:02:07.979> type<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.489> perspective<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.509> want

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
what type of perspective you want

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.600 
what type of perspective you want
on<00:02:10.230> the<00:02:10.440> device<00:02:10.740> now<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.220> second<00:02:11.460> thing<00:02:11.490> that

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
on the device now the second thing that

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.470 
on the device now the second thing that
I<00:02:11.730> want<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.000> talk<00:02:12.120> about<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.750> price<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.680> course

unfortunately isn't out yet and this is

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.610 
unfortunately isn't out yet and this is
where<00:02:26.850> they<00:02:27.270> differ<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:27.930> lot<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.560> is

is a beta stage this is mainly for
developers<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.540> get<00:03:39.840> their<00:03:39.990> hands<00:03:40.350> on<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.500> and

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
developers to get their hands on it and

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.470 
developers to get their hands on it and
see<00:03:41.070> what<00:03:41.280> type<00:03:41.490> of<00:03:41.520> applications<00:03:42.300> they<00:03:42.450> can

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
see what type of applications they can

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.260 
see what type of applications they can
develop<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.550> we<00:03:44.550> should<00:03:44.760> be<00:03:44.880> seeing<00:03:45.120> a

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
develop and we should be seeing a

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.850 
develop and we should be seeing a
consumer<00:03:45.750> version<00:03:46.050> that's<00:03:46.200> significantly

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
consumer version that's significantly

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.710 
consumer version that's significantly
less<00:03:47.190> in<00:03:47.220> price<00:03:47.700> I<00:03:47.940> mean<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.120> think<00:03:48.480> Google

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
less in price I mean I think Google

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.640 
less in price I mean I think Google
glass<00:03:49.020> only<00:03:49.640> costs<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.880> costs<00:03:51.240> less<00:03:51.420> than<00:03:51.720> $200

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
glass only costs it costs less than $200

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.040 
glass only costs it costs less than $200
to<00:03:52.800> actually<00:03:53.220> well<00:03:53.910> at<00:03:54.000> least<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.300> materials

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
to actually well at least the materials

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.900 
to actually well at least the materials
in<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.290> I'm<00:03:55.410> sure<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.980> manufacturing<00:03:56.670> cost

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
in it I'm sure the manufacturing cost

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.570 
in it I'm sure the manufacturing cost
adds<00:03:57.690> a<00:03:57.900> lot<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:58.410> but<00:03:58.440> I'm<00:03:58.920> thinking<00:03:59.490> the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
adds a lot to it but I'm thinking the

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.730 
adds a lot to it but I'm thinking the
retail<00:03:59.940> version<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:01.170> course<00:04:01.380> gonna<00:04:01.530> be<00:04:01.710> a

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
retail version is of course gonna be a

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.740 
retail version is of course gonna be a
lot<00:04:01.950> less<00:04:02.130> than<00:04:02.190> $1000<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.300> they<00:04:03.390> even<00:04:03.540> want

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
lot less than $1000 that they even want

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.100 
lot less than $1000 that they even want
to<00:04:03.840> sell<00:04:04.110> these<00:04:04.290> units<00:04:04.730> but<00:04:05.730> Android<00:04:06.600> wear<00:04:06.870> is

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
to sell these units but Android wear is

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.390 
to sell these units but Android wear is
offering<00:04:07.590> basically<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.220> same

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
offering basically the same

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.040 
offering basically the same
functionality<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.240> know<00:04:09.420> it's<00:04:09.660> not<00:04:09.810> on<00:04:09.930> your

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
functionality I know it's not on your

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.230 
functionality I know it's not on your
face<00:04:10.290> it's<00:04:10.590> not<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:10.890> same<00:04:11.130> perspective<00:04:11.460> but

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
face it's not the same perspective but

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.700 
face it's not the same perspective but
it's<00:04:12.420> almost<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.840> same<00:04:13.080> thing<00:04:13.140> for

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
it's almost the same thing for

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.820 
it's almost the same thing for
significantly<00:04:14.460> cheaper<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.000> this<00:04:15.150> is<00:04:15.300> where

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
significantly cheaper so this is where

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.390 
significantly cheaper so this is where
there's<00:04:16.830> a<00:04:16.950> huge<00:04:17.340> margin<00:04:17.609> between<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
there's a huge margin between the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.909 
there's a huge margin between the
two<00:04:18.489> devices<00:04:19.000> and<00:04:19.269> of<00:04:20.109> course<00:04:20.440> Google<00:04:20.680> glass

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
two devices and of course Google glass

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.100 
two devices and of course Google glass
is<00:04:21.190> not<00:04:21.430> where<00:04:21.639> it<00:04:21.729> needs<00:04:21.759> to<00:04:22.000> be<00:04:22.120> right<00:04:22.300> now<00:04:22.330> so

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
is not where it needs to be right now so

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.260 
is not where it needs to be right now so
it's<00:04:23.350> kind<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:23.680> not<00:04:23.919> fair<00:04:24.310> to<00:04:24.550> compare<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:25.060> two

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
it's kind of not fair to compare the two

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.740 
it's kind of not fair to compare the two
because<00:04:25.509> one<00:04:26.080> is<00:04:26.290> still<00:04:26.650> in<00:04:26.800> development<00:04:26.949> and

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
because one is still in development and

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.719 
because one is still in development and
another<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:29.110> kind<00:04:29.919> of<00:04:30.009> in<00:04:30.160> development<00:04:30.610> but

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
another is kind of in development but

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.520 
another is kind of in development but
they<00:04:30.880> have<00:04:31.150> products<00:04:31.810> out<00:04:31.930> there<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.410> the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
they have products out there to the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.640 
they have products out there to the
public<00:04:33.210> so<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.240> this<00:04:34.720> is<00:04:34.840> a<00:04:34.870> this<00:04:35.229> is<00:04:35.289> a<00:04:35.380> place

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
public so that this is a this is a place

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.499 
public so that this is a this is a place
where<00:04:35.949> a<00:04:35.979> lot<00:04:36.310> of<00:04:36.370> where<00:04:36.940> these<00:04:37.090> two<00:04:37.300> platforms

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
where a lot of where these two platforms

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.439 
where a lot of where these two platforms
really<00:04:37.930> differ<00:04:38.229> and<00:04:39.009> I<00:04:39.759> want<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.210> know<00:04:40.300> what

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
really differ and I want to know what

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.710 
really differ and I want to know what
you<00:04:40.570> guys<00:04:40.690> think<00:04:40.960> if<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.850> cost<00:04:43.150> is<00:04:43.389> something

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
you guys think if the cost is something

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.700 
you guys think if the cost is something
that<00:04:43.870> really<00:04:44.169> puts<00:04:44.500> Android<00:04:44.979> wear<00:04:45.190> over

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
that really puts Android wear over

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.140 
that really puts Android wear over
Google<00:04:47.710> glass<00:04:48.039> sorry

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
Google glass sorry

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.029 
Google glass sorry
puts<00:04:49.479> Android<00:04:49.750> wear<00:04:49.900> over<00:04:50.139> Google<00:04:50.320> glass<00:04:50.650> in

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
puts Android wear over Google glass in

privacy aspects of both of these devices
now<00:05:02.919> this<00:05:03.100> is<00:05:03.280> something<00:05:03.520> of<00:05:03.789> course<00:05:03.820> where

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
now this is something of course where

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.350 
now this is something of course where
Android<00:05:04.750> wear<00:05:04.930> is<00:05:04.960> up<00:05:05.320> here<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:06.210> Google<00:05:07.210> glass

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
Android wear is up here and Google glass

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.629 
Android wear is up here and Google glass
is<00:05:07.570> down<00:05:07.720> here<00:05:08.080> this<00:05:08.380> is<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.590> very<00:05:08.949> experimental

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
is down here this is a very experimental

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.750 
is down here this is a very experimental
idea<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:10.870> a<00:05:11.770> lot<00:05:11.949> of<00:05:12.039> people<00:05:12.310> of<00:05:12.550> course

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
idea and a lot of people of course

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.460 
idea and a lot of people of course
aren't<00:05:12.970> gonna<00:05:13.090> like<00:05:13.270> it<00:05:13.510> in<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:14.199> earliest

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
aren't gonna like it in the earliest

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.700 
aren't gonna like it in the earliest
stages<00:05:14.770> because<00:05:15.660> it<00:05:16.660> is<00:05:17.080> kind<00:05:17.320> of<00:05:17.349> scary<00:05:17.590> if

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
stages because it is kind of scary if

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.839 
stages because it is kind of scary if
you<00:05:17.770> think<00:05:17.919> about<00:05:18.070> it<00:05:18.250> if<00:05:18.310> you're<00:05:18.430> gonna<00:05:18.490> have

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
you think about it if you're gonna have

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.120 
you think about it if you're gonna have
this<00:05:19.150> camera<00:05:19.720> on<00:05:19.870> your<00:05:19.990> face<00:05:20.259> that<00:05:20.289> can<00:05:20.620> record

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
this camera on your face that can record

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.730 
this camera on your face that can record
anything<00:05:21.610> record<00:05:22.360> conversations<00:05:23.139> and<00:05:23.410> the

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
anything record conversations and the

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.860 
anything record conversations and the
person<00:05:24.130> might<00:05:24.789> not<00:05:24.970> even<00:05:25.120> know<00:05:25.389> so<00:05:25.599> of<00:05:25.720> course

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870
