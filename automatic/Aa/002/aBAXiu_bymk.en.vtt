00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.369
 offer although we are offered a small 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.559
 appetizer of what will be the mode

 multiplayer this and so must to give us 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.700
 a great brushstroke of what we will see in 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.500
 the final game one of the novelties 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.750
 main is that we have to 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 select our specialist in 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.190
 this view only 42 men open to us 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.469
 and two women less than half of us 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.850
 indicates that there will be in the final game all 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.770
 they flaunt their agility 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.410
 doing parkour actions very the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.210
 tight and fall style that is can not 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.859
 run laterally through the walls and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.510
 doing jumps with push as if 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.609
 we had for example the former 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.830
 suit that he offers advanced worker 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.229
 we have a push bar that runs out 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820
 with the use so that we do not abuse 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.890
 Recharging after a few seconds 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.930
 the gameplay totally the same with each 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.850
 one of them the only thing that differentiates them 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.770
 is that they all have several 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.660
 special actions one of which 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.640
 we selected as the main 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.890
 character according to our game 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.930
 we can activate this action by pressing 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.050
 the top buttons of the knob on this 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.060
 case the e1 and hereu use a bow a weapon 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.500

 explosive on the ground in steer plan and 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.850
 are some examples we have again 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.350
 a limited capacity in our 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.820
 inventory what forces us to be 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 selective with the amount of weapons 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.170
 grenades accessories and perfect all 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.119
 our elements increase in level and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.340
 therefore they unlock new improvements or 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.740
 accessories we will also go little by little 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.840
 buying weapons with coins the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.610
 gameplay is fast and even though 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.200
 there is some sporadic lag this beta 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.940
 has a much more fluid play 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.070
 polished than previous call of duty for 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.479
 skip glide look for coverages 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.700

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.890
 walls attack from the heights do 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.810
 use of special weapons that is like 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.690
 any call of duty but a little more 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.550
 vitaminized that if the deaths are now 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.560
 a few shots so you have to go 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.510
 carefully the characters jump 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.709

 we can dive and dive all the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.459
 elements that decorate the environment offer 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.140
 a very good solid finish believable and 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.510
 take advantage of each one of the corners and 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.909
 strategic points because it asks for hours of 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.500
