00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
you know one of the most important uses

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.510 
you know one of the most important uses
for<00:00:19.430> a<00:00:19.460> greenhouse<00:00:19.880> is<00:00:20.210> in<00:00:20.960> plant<00:00:21.230> propagation

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520 
for a greenhouse is in plant propagation

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.150 
for a greenhouse is in plant propagation
you<00:00:22.520> know<00:00:22.720> either<00:00:23.720> by<00:00:23.960> seeds<00:00:24.410> or<00:00:24.740> with

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
you know either by seeds or with

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.610 
you know either by seeds or with
cuttings<00:00:25.550> now<00:00:26.120> in<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.360> early<00:00:26.660> season<00:00:26.900> which<00:00:27.350> a

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.620 
cuttings now in the early season which a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.680 
cuttings now in the early season which a
broad<00:00:28.610> range<00:00:28.850> of<00:00:29.000> that<00:00:29.150> would<00:00:29.330> be<00:00:29.480> safe

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
broad range of that would be safe

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.229 
broad range of that would be safe
februari<00:00:30.620> to<00:00:31.250> me<00:00:31.430> depending<00:00:31.940> on<00:00:32.029> where<00:00:32.149> you

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
februari to me depending on where you

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.500 
februari to me depending on where you
live<00:00:32.620> you'd<00:00:33.620> want<00:00:33.800> to<00:00:33.860> go<00:00:33.950> with<00:00:34.100> seeds<00:00:34.370> so<00:00:35.120> if

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
live you'd want to go with seeds so if

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.870 
live you'd want to go with seeds so if
we're<00:00:36.260> going<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:36.410> start<00:00:36.680> from<00:00:36.860> seeds<00:00:37.250> there's

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
we're going to start from seeds there's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.340 
we're going to start from seeds there's
some<00:00:38.030> great<00:00:38.120> benefits<00:00:38.390> because<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.260> know

for different conditions you probably

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.000 
for different conditions you probably
want<00:00:59.300> to<00:00:59.360> pick<00:00:59.570> seeds<00:00:59.899> that<00:01:00.440> are<00:01:00.500> very<00:01:00.649> similar

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
want to pick seeds that are very similar

want to pick seeds that are very similar
that<00:01:01.250> you<00:01:01.399> know<00:01:01.489> so<00:01:01.700> that<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:01.940> can<00:01:02.090> grow<00:01:02.180> them

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
that you know so that you can grow them

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.660 
that you know so that you can grow them
all<00:01:02.450> together<00:01:02.600> but<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.410> same<00:01:03.620> amount<00:01:04.250> of<00:01:04.339> heat

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
all together but the same amount of heat

same amount of moisture in the air you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.390 
same amount of moisture in the air you
know<00:01:08.090> during<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.360> summer<00:01:09.159> your<00:01:10.159> greenhouse

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
know during the summer your greenhouse

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.690 
know during the summer your greenhouse
normally<00:01:11.000> would<00:01:11.150> be<00:01:11.299> pretty<00:01:11.630> empty<00:01:11.840> unless

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
normally would be pretty empty unless

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.010 
normally would be pretty empty unless
you're<00:01:13.700> going<00:01:13.909> with<00:01:14.120> some<00:01:14.299> cuttings<00:01:14.659> say<00:01:14.960> you

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
you're going with some cuttings say you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.990 
you're going with some cuttings say you
get<00:01:15.680> ready<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.010> do<00:01:16.130> some<00:01:16.310> propagation<00:01:16.850> you've

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
get ready to do some propagation you've

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.820 
get ready to do some propagation you've
you've<00:01:17.450> done<00:01:17.479> some<00:01:17.840> cuttings<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.409> you've

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
you've done some cuttings and you've

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.140 
you've done some cuttings and you've
saved<00:01:19.100> money<00:01:19.340> because<00:01:19.729> you<00:01:19.820> didn't<00:01:19.970> have<00:01:20.060> to

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
saved money because you didn't have to

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.850 
saved money because you didn't have to
go<00:01:20.210> out<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:20.420> buy<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.630> seeds<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.170> just<00:01:21.650> took

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
go out and buy the seeds you just took

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.620 
go out and buy the seeds you just took
them<00:01:22.010> right<00:01:22.250> from<00:01:22.369> your<00:01:22.520> existing<00:01:22.820> plants<00:01:23.479> so

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
them right from your existing plants so

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.930 
them right from your existing plants so
you're<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:24.350> know<00:01:24.440> ultimate<00:01:25.070> recycling<00:01:25.490> there

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
you're you know ultimate recycling there

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.430 
you're you know ultimate recycling there
and<00:01:26.229> you<00:01:27.229> know<00:01:27.350> one<00:01:27.619> other<00:01:27.740> thing<00:01:28.040> with

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
and you know one other thing with

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.899 
and you know one other thing with
propagation<00:01:30.440> you<00:01:30.560> know<00:01:30.650> most<00:01:30.830> of<00:01:31.130> seeds<00:01:31.760> are

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
propagation you know most of seeds are

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.210 
propagation you know most of seeds are
going<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.090> want<00:01:32.299> some<00:01:32.420> pretty

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
going to want some pretty

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.290 
going to want some pretty
warm<00:01:34.940> soil<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.870> get<00:01:36.020> started<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.030> rather<00:01:38.030> than

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
warm soil to get started and rather than

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.390 
warm soil to get started and rather than
trying<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.630> heat<00:01:38.900> your<00:01:39.050> greenhouse<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.860> know

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
trying to heat your greenhouse you know

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.910 
trying to heat your greenhouse you know
use<00:01:40.640> propagation<00:01:41.360> mats<00:01:41.600> there<00:01:42.020> use<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> very

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
use propagation mats there use a very

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.700 
use propagation mats there use a very
low<00:01:43.040> energy<00:01:43.250> they're<00:01:43.760> low<00:01:44.000> cost<00:01:44.410> there<00:01:45.410> that's

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
low energy they're low cost there that's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.470 
low energy they're low cost there that's
a<00:01:45.830> way<00:01:45.950> that<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.130> can<00:01:46.220> just<00:01:46.850> on<00:01:47.060> your<00:01:47.240> you<00:01:47.390> know

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
a way that you can just on your you know

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.540 
a way that you can just on your you know
where<00:01:47.660> you<00:01:47.810> have<00:01:47.930> your<00:01:47.990> seeds<00:01:48.440> put<00:01:49.130> those<00:01:49.250> mats

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
where you have your seeds put those mats

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.730 
where you have your seeds put those mats
down<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.450> know<00:01:50.570> set<00:01:50.930> your<00:01:51.080> trays<00:01:51.350> right<00:01:51.560> on

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
down you know set your trays right on

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.470 
down you know set your trays right on
top<00:01:51.950> of<00:01:51.980> those<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.550> you're<00:01:52.850> going<00:01:53.000> to<00:01:53.060> do

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
top of those and you're going to do

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.960 
top of those and you're going to do
really<00:01:53.720> well<00:01:53.870> with<00:01:54.020> propagation<00:01:54.770> mats<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.280> you

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
really well with propagation mats so you

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.340 
really well with propagation mats so you
know<00:01:56.060> just<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.330> quick<00:01:56.510> overview<00:01:56.630> those<00:01:57.080> are<00:01:57.230> the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
know just a quick overview those are the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.820
