00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.790
 he should be me yes I have the love 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.010
 I did not get it and then I did not stand 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.800
 could even make a steak so how 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.269
 cooked 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:19.289
 I would like to do and who relish 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.880
 just look at these then 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.750
 I'll show you my beautiful piece now 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.039
 meat what I have I have this here 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.410
 wrapped in buttered bread paper 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.640
 Although it is not as nice marbled it 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.140
 Of course, it would be a little better if you were 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.100
 a little more fat in it, it would be natural 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.780
 also bacon he is just fine i am 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.230
 nevertheless to the meatman of my confidence 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.450
 gone and have relatively thick cut 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.579
 Although still the career still 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:58.079
 better it is that hospice that is 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.100
 the back of the cattle at the pig 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.309
 would say scotland so press 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.439
 this is hospice or why always 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.030
 hot somewhere beefsteak should 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.000
 whatever regions call it 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.720
 I should have chosen that and 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.939
 I will now 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.920
 I hope you see it looks delicious 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.460
 That's what I'm going to do with a pan 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.610
 sear 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 So the pan must be really hot 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.759
 and I take rapeseed oil for rapeseed oil 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.229
 also the property that it is higher 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.270
 can tolerate heat 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.270
 and important for me, of course 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.790
 that it's short on both sides 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.750
 is fried and I want that me 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.860
 then do the oven afterwards 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.799
 preheat 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.710
 I take it really nice 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.439
 and then will the meat piece 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 Of course there are only five minutes short 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.890
 if he in between with the pressure test 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.250
 look how far is finished 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.340
 I will not set it now 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.320
 and I will not be confused 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.399
 do 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.410
 I'll just finish that 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.220
 but I'll show you right now 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.280
 make the first now 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.900
 Furthermore, and the piece of meat in there 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.520
 I'll show you now how to do that 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.350
 so my banner is now preheated me 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.740
 I also have an iron fallada for 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.850
 it gets hot pretty fast and me 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:38.730
 I have only a bit of rapeseed oil and a fence 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.730
 it'll just be both sides now 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.910
 fry 4 minutes 12 minutes 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.340
 then the same one wobbles for 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.470
 about 50 minutes 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.920
 I will do that for you through ever 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.849
 the wireless by knocking out and pushing 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.849
 makes change 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.019
 through back and forth at one you stay 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.019
 suspect to liberate oil 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.540
 Perfectly so and now in the oven 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.919
 so it has now even four minutes 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:01.530
 left inside 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:05:10.770
 Now I take it out on the plate 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:16.419
 very important for a way away 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:19.990
 it sizzles everything so if you have it 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.220
 important I know that now one more 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.699
 two minutes stand 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.159
 I know from above in the rock salt I know 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:31.150
 already waiting now for the first time yet 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:33.449
 so 12 minutes per cent if so still 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.449
 a little bit behind 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:42.780
 and I will be here all the time too 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.490
 still from below and were aware 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.810
 I do not do that for the reason now 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.930
 easy from both sides 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.620
 because I want too much fluid 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.380
 exit 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.820
 It is generally so currently in the 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.659
 meat liquid deprives and 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.349
 that's why I do not have that 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.530
 salted 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:02.400
 I want it all inside 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:09.940
 and I'll turn that around right now but 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:13.449
 short bottles let that about 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.330
 one and a half minutes later then I will 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.310
 the meat on here now make her 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.240
 See that even has that one 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.240
 liquid lost 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:32.729
 of course I would do that in 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.729
 take herbal butter 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:42.580
 And of course, WeiÃŸbrodt must be important 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.780
 is of course now 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:48.969
 Of course, now I want too 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:51.819
 cut in and see how far that is 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:53.979
 piece in hide well is so for 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:56.009
 me that mark and that's about time 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.949
 taken far enough 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:02.430
 you can see that it is still light pink 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:07.710
 so it should be the same for me 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.710
 I hope you can see it that way now 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:16.060
 then just come the times 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:18.629
 taste test can be nicely 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.629
 to cut 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:35.280
 So he really pays that 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:39.090
 Nobody needs to eat yet 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:41.010
 They were considered relatively expensive and if you are 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:44.070
 you do not have to buy something like that 

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:45.449
 do any things because then has 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.190
 Do not miss the taste of that 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:49.740
 flesh 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.300
 So for me it's just great 

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.910
 tasty exactly become such as 

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.610
 actually wanted to have yes I hope 

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.949
 my little bow fell again 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:02.090
 it stays that way then I am glad this 

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:02.090
 user clear
