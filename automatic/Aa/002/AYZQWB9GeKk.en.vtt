examples I want to show you here and

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.569 
examples I want to show you here and
we'll<00:00:25.360> go<00:00:25.599> through<00:00:25.960> the<00:00:26.110> materials<00:00:26.710> I<00:00:26.890> use<00:00:27.250> and

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
we'll go through the materials I use and

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.780 
we'll go through the materials I use and
then<00:00:27.759> we'll<00:00:27.970> get<00:00:28.300> started<00:00:28.989> on<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:29.950> demo<00:00:30.160> so

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
then we'll get started on the demo so

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.840 
then we'll get started on the demo so
let's<00:00:31.180> start<00:00:31.540> with<00:00:31.750> some<00:00:32.579> examples<00:00:33.579> so<00:00:33.820> you

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
let's start with some examples so you

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.770 
let's start with some examples so you
know<00:00:34.300> what<00:00:34.840> to<00:00:35.019> expect<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:37.239> see<00:00:37.269> what's<00:00:37.600> going

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
know what to expect to see what's going

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.529 
know what to expect to see what's going
to<00:00:37.809> happen<00:00:37.870> today<00:00:38.500> with<00:00:38.769> the<00:00:38.920> demo

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
to happen today with the demo

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.579 
to happen today with the demo
first<00:00:40.539> of<00:00:40.719> all<00:00:40.809> edges<00:00:42.089> you<00:00:43.089> want<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.750> look<00:00:44.469> at

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
first of all edges you want to look at

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.849 
first of all edges you want to look at
your<00:00:44.800> edges<00:00:45.250> where<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:46.089> color<00:00:46.780> and<00:00:47.019> value<00:00:47.170> meet

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
your edges where a color and value meet

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:49.979 
your edges where a color and value meet
another<00:00:48.309> color<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:48.879> value<00:00:48.999> where<00:00:49.390> masses

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
another color and value where masses

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.319 
another color and value where masses
unite<00:00:50.469> you're<00:00:51.399> going<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.820> look<00:00:52.030> at<00:00:52.149> those

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
unite you're going to look at those

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.750 
unite you're going to look at those
edges<00:00:52.749> I'll<00:00:52.899> talk<00:00:53.230> about<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:53.859> and<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.730> know

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
edges I'll talk about it and you know

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.139 
edges I'll talk about it and you know
cache<00:00:55.120> shadows<00:00:55.719> form<00:00:56.260> shadow<00:00:56.589> edges<00:00:57.249> it's

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
cache shadows form shadow edges it's

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.180 
cache shadows form shadow edges it's
it's<00:00:58.629> all<00:00:58.809> these<00:00:58.989> transitions<00:00:59.710> you<00:00:59.890> want<00:01:00.100> to

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
it's all these transitions you want to

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.599 
it's all these transitions you want to
talk<00:01:01.030> about<00:01:01.390> think<00:01:01.899> about<00:01:02.309> anyway<00:01:03.309> look<00:01:03.489> at

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
talk about think about anyway look at

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.660 
talk about think about anyway look at
let's<00:01:03.969> look<00:01:04.180> at<00:01:04.269> some<00:01:04.480> of<00:01:04.570> these<00:01:04.690> examples<00:01:05.670> I'm

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
let's look at some of these examples I'm

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.179 
let's look at some of these examples I'm
a<00:01:06.729> painter<00:01:07.149> who<00:01:07.420> generally<00:01:07.930> likes<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.590> apply

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
a painter who generally likes to apply

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.460 
a painter who generally likes to apply
everything<00:01:09.549> with<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:09.909> brush<00:01:10.270> but<00:01:10.899> today<00:01:11.259> we're

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
everything with a brush but today we're

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.039 
everything with a brush but today we're
going<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.649> use<00:01:11.820> brushes<00:01:12.820> and<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.630> palette<00:01:14.020> knife

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
going to use brushes and a palette knife

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.819 
going to use brushes and a palette knife
and<00:01:14.530> we're<00:01:15.520> going<00:01:15.549> to<00:01:15.850> just<00:01:16.719> think<00:01:17.649> about

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
and we're going to just think about

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.639 
and we're going to just think about
edges<00:01:18.549> those<00:01:18.969> transitions<00:01:19.840> so<00:01:20.140> look<00:01:20.350> at<00:01:20.500> these

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
edges those transitions so look at these

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.219 
edges those transitions so look at these
two<00:01:20.950> examples<00:01:21.340> there<00:01:22.270> are<00:01:22.329> edges<00:01:22.930> really

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
two examples there are edges really

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.670 
two examples there are edges really
crisp<00:01:23.740> edges<00:01:24.090> some<00:01:25.090> intermediate<00:01:25.810> soft<00:01:26.200> edges

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
crisp edges some intermediate soft edges

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.399 
crisp edges some intermediate soft edges
and<00:01:26.890> then<00:01:27.100> there<00:01:27.310> are<00:01:27.399> some<00:01:27.610> edges<00:01:27.899> in<00:01:28.899> some<00:01:29.290> of

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
and then there are some edges in some of

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.160 
and then there are some edges in some of
these<00:01:29.560> areas<00:01:29.979> that<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.189> you<00:01:30.610> can<00:01:30.820> barely<00:01:31.420> see

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
these areas that you you can barely see

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.950 
these areas that you you can barely see
the<00:01:32.350> transition<00:01:33.130> so<00:01:33.789> that's<00:01:34.090> our<00:01:34.360> goal<00:01:34.390> today

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
the transition so that's our goal today

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.620 
the transition so that's our goal today
and<00:01:35.350> it's<00:01:35.770> good<00:01:36.039> to<00:01:36.250> set<00:01:36.490> up<00:01:36.670> little<00:01:37.299> still

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
and it's good to set up little still

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.289 
and it's good to set up little still
lifes<00:01:37.960> you'll<00:01:38.740> see<00:01:39.039> what<00:01:39.280> I'm<00:01:39.399> painting<00:01:39.909> from

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
lifes you'll see what I'm painting from

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.880 
lifes you'll see what I'm painting from
here<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:43.180> once<00:01:43.780> again<00:01:43.930> this<00:01:44.289> was<00:01:44.500> applied

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
here so this once again this was applied

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.179 
here so this once again this was applied
with<00:01:45.159> a<00:01:45.189> brush<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.729> pallet<00:01:46.420> knife<00:01:47.100> let<00:01:48.100> me

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
with a brush and pallet knife let me

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.679 
with a brush and pallet knife let me
show<00:01:48.399> you<00:01:48.460> another<00:01:48.640> one<00:01:49.090> where<00:01:49.329> I<00:01:49.359> use

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
show you another one where I use

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.770 
show you another one where I use
strictly<00:01:50.530> a<00:01:50.969> pallet<00:01:51.969> knife

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.029 

here's<00:01:55.780> another<00:01:55.960> board<00:01:56.469> that<00:01:58.679> you<00:01:59.679> can<00:01:59.710> get

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
here's another board that you can get

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.130 
here's another board that you can get
some<00:02:00.219> really<00:02:00.490> exciting<00:02:01.090> little<00:02:01.479> edges<00:02:01.990> in

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
some really exciting little edges in

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.319 
some really exciting little edges in
transitions<00:02:02.859> my<00:02:03.039> transitions<00:02:03.850> with<00:02:04.060> this

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
transitions my transitions with this

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.630 
transitions my transitions with this
were<00:02:04.539> mostly<00:02:05.020> made<00:02:05.350> with<00:02:05.799> color<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:06.460> value

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
were mostly made with color and value

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.930 
were mostly made with color and value
changes<00:02:07.420> the<00:02:08.320> transitions<00:02:09.070> in<00:02:09.340> this<00:02:09.580> board

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
changes the transitions in this board

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.600 
changes the transitions in this board
were<00:02:10.300> made<00:02:10.570> with<00:02:10.810> much<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.920> was<00:02:12.400> much<00:02:12.580> more

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
were made with much I was much more

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.089 
were made with much I was much more
aggressive<00:02:13.030> with<00:02:13.480> really<00:02:14.050> fine

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
aggressive with really fine

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.429 
aggressive with really fine
and<00:02:15.340> losing<00:02:15.730> edges<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:18.459> this<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.480> this<00:02:20.109> is<00:02:20.260> my

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
and losing edges and this is this is my

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.099 
and losing edges and this is this is my
little<00:02:20.620> practice<00:02:21.249> one<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:21.519> did<00:02:21.969> to<00:02:22.239> prepare<00:02:22.840> for

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
little practice one I did to prepare for

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:28.410 
little practice one I did to prepare for
this<00:02:25.739> I'm<00:02:26.739> going<00:02:27.129> to<00:02:27.249> use<00:02:27.459> my<00:02:27.639> little<00:02:28.180> yellow

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
this I'm going to use my little yellow

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.959
