00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.259
 very good all kids who are such 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.870
 today with the rockies and how are you watching 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.880
 today he plays modern warfare 3 and not black ops 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.309
 2 and some will ask why not 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.960
 you upload cover 2 if you're going to talk about 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.940
 that good game I'm going to make a 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.760
 tiny comparison between these two 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.130
 games and so I can explain my point 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.200
 of why black ops 2 does not 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.820
 was so successful or did not last as long 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.220
 could you say how to cut 3 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.170
 because in all the games in all 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.020
 call of duty there have always been weapons 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.640
 good weapons tied a pair to a couple of 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.640
 weapons that always stood out not in this 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.850
 case was the ap-7 and the acr in the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.829
 white was only the house 74 and fame 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.899
 is the demon warfare 2 they were almost 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.460
 all the tickets and so I could continue 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.890
 talking over and over again but those are 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.350
 the games that I play the most 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.390
 call of duty so that's the subject 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.890
 Main not in all duty cases 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.319
 there have always been good weapons weapons 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.839
 thrown weapons with which people are 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:59.909
 I felt comfortable not playing weapons with 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.309
 that you can make good games or 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.080
 simply as he said have fun in the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.150
 black ops 2 the biggest problem and the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.670
 why he was not so successful 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.380
 you could expect I think that's why 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.390
 exactly because there are no good weapons 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.610
 there are no weapons sitting there are no weapons that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.990
 highlight what does stand out in this 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 game on the white 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.730
 rather, they have patched everything 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.920
 they have started everything more 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.650
 except in the light ones but I can not 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.450
 count light as armed but as 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.520
 weapons for novices because that's what they are 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.010
 or a novice what you use are light 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.440
 light with bank seeker and it's something 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.150
 that we all know but there is not a 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.550
 good submachine gun no assault rifle 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.830
 that stands out among all the others there 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.590
 rifles that are good as ship 8 as 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.930
 the 94 and like lashkar for example but not 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.000
 They are rifles that stand out for being 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.540
 completely over power as I could 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.100
 be in this case the acr or the mp7 what 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.229
 What has bothered me the most and what 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.910
 has bothered the black ops 2 are the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.490
 a lot of patches that have put 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.440
 in the submachine guns as you see in the mode 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.930
 with fairtrade I was an uncle of his rifle 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.729
 in the white I have become the uncle of 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.740
 the assault rifles because that's what 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.149
 better suits my style of play and 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.190
 what was best suited in the way 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.420
 warfare 3 were submachine guns with a 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.040
 specialist 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.930
 completely butt as you have seen 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.060
 in this streak in this fashion and 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.130
 constantly to put enemy and was 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.840
 something has modern warfare 3 could do 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.760
 in the white bush 2 is completely 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.480
 impossible after more patches and more 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.340
 patches the thing was going worse has gone worse and 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.050
 as much as they wanted to compensate for 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.030
 what they have done, I think, has 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.920
 been little by little by little 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.660
 spoil it so I hope it has 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.580
 liked the video kids liked it 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.209
 of course this later we see the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.209
 next video
