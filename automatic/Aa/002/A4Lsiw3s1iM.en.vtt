night<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> came<00:00:44.879> down<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.089> to<00:00:45.360> check<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.600> it

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
night I came down here to check on it

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.399 
night I came down here to check on it
and<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.890> realized<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:48.050> paint<00:00:49.050> was<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.199> little

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
and I realized that paint was a little

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.259 
and I realized that paint was a little
thin<00:00:49.589> in<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.769> couple<00:00:49.979> of<00:00:50.010> places<00:00:50.220> so<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> applied

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
thin in a couple of places so I applied

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.680 
thin in a couple of places so I applied
a<00:00:51.600> little<00:00:52.080> more<00:00:52.229> paint<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:53.360> various<00:00:54.360> parts<00:00:54.540> of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
a little more paint on various parts of

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.710 
a little more paint on various parts of
the<00:00:54.809> frame<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.229> can<00:00:55.290> see<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.720> the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
the frame and you can see that the the

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.979 
the frame and you can see that the the
paint<00:00:57.989> kind<00:00:58.290> of<00:00:58.620> lifted<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.909> got<00:01:00.839> all

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
paint kind of lifted up and got all

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.500 
paint kind of lifted up and got all
wrinkly<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.500> scaly<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.159> opposed<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.269> let's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
wrinkly and scaly as opposed to let's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.810 
wrinkly and scaly as opposed to let's
say<00:01:03.720> this<00:01:04.589> portion<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.190> frame<00:01:05.339> right<00:01:05.580> here

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
say this portion of the frame right here
which<00:01:05.940> is<00:01:06.380> relatively<00:01:07.380> smooth<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.840> wanted

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
which is relatively smooth so I wanted

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.260 
which is relatively smooth so I wanted
to<00:01:09.900> show<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.729> basically<00:01:11.729> everywhere<00:01:12.240> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
to show you basically everywhere I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.039 
to show you basically everywhere I
touched<00:01:12.659> up<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.210> kind<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.450> here<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.899> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
touched up and see kind of here on the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.310 
touched up and see kind of here on the
fork<00:01:16.770> legs<00:01:17.070> not<00:01:17.640> sure<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.030> there's<00:01:18.320> quite

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
fork legs not sure if there's quite

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.810 
fork legs not sure if there's quite
enough<00:01:19.530> light<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:20.070> make<00:01:20.219> that<00:01:20.399> apparent<00:01:22.219> and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.490 

also<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.630> section<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.079> the<00:01:28.109> frame<00:01:28.350> right

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
also on this section of the frame right

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.940 
also on this section of the frame right
here<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.770> am<00:01:31.770> going<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.430> sand<00:01:32.969> this<00:01:33.180> down<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
here so I am going to sand this down and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
here so I am going to sand this down and
redo<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.159> not<00:01:35.729> today<00:01:36.060> probably<00:01:36.479> tomorrow

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
redo this not today probably tomorrow

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.870 
redo this not today probably tomorrow
and<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:39.329> reason<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.750> happened<00:01:40.109> is<00:01:40.609> if<00:01:41.609> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and the reason this happened is if you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
and the reason this happened is if you
look<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.359> can<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.719> rust-oleum<00:01:43.020> spray

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
look on the can of rust-oleum spray

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.599 
look on the can of rust-oleum spray
paint<00:01:43.969> with<00:01:44.969> the<00:01:45.090> application<00:01:45.689> instructions

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
paint with the application instructions

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.319 
paint with the application instructions
it<00:01:47.609> actually<00:01:48.179> says<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.979> recoat<00:01:50.909> pretty<00:01:51.210> much

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
it actually says to recoat pretty much

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.300 
it actually says to recoat pretty much
right<00:01:51.539> away<00:01:51.570> or<00:01:53.810> after<00:01:54.810> 24<00:01:55.229> hours<00:01:55.560> or<00:01:56.070> sorry

after<00:01:56.609> 48<00:01:57.149> hours<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.140> hadn't<00:01:58.409> waited<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
after 48 hours and I hadn't waited that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.120 
after 48 hours and I hadn't waited that
long<00:01:58.799> yet<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.600> the<00:02:00.600> fresh<00:02:00.869> paint<00:02:01.259> reacted<00:02:01.979> with

long yet so the fresh paint reacted with

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.919 
long yet so the fresh paint reacted with
the<00:02:02.659> not<00:02:03.659> yet<00:02:03.990> cured<00:02:04.350> paint<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.979> did<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
the not yet cured paint and did this so

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.730 
the not yet cured paint and did this so
this<00:02:06.929> is<00:02:07.020> just<00:02:09.200> something<00:02:10.200> that's<00:02:10.319> really
