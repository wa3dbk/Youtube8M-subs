00:00:01.623 --> 00:00:08.902
(Hungarian National Cuisine)

00:00:08.902 --> 00:00:10.888
Hello Traditionalists!

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:14.887
Today, we are going to cook Gran Lelle's potato scones.

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:16.901
The ingredients are:

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:19.332
250g cooked potatoes

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.502
800g flour

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:23.302
2tbs sour cream

00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:26.220
200g lard

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.103
1tbs salt

00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:30.074
50g yeast

00:00:30.582 --> 00:00:32.640
1tsp sugar

00:00:32.778 --> 00:00:34.811
3 eggs

00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:37.357
0.1l milk

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:41.384
The preparation is the following:

00:00:42.153 --> 00:00:45.888
We peel the cooked potatoes.

00:00:56.782 --> 00:01:00.211
Then we mash them,

00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:14.566
add the sour cream,

00:01:17.782 --> 00:01:20.113
and the lard.

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:25.110
Then we mix them well.

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:47.833
We proof the yeast in the warm mixture of the milk and sugar.

00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:52.923
In the meantime we pour the flour into a deep bowl

00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:56.440
and add the salt.

00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:09.319
Now we add the mixture of potatoes, lard and the sour cream,

00:02:10.504 --> 00:02:12.149
then the eggs

00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:18.222
and the proofed yeast.

00:02:31.637 --> 00:02:36.396
We knead it until the dough separates from the bowl.

00:02:44.874 --> 00:02:51.075
After 6 to 8 minutes of kneading, we flour the bottom of the bowl.

00:02:54.983 --> 00:02:58.958
Then we flour the top of the dough, as well.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.529
We cover it with a tea towel,

00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:11.218
and we leave it to rest in a warm place away from draft for 25 - 30 minutes.

00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:19.419
We pour it onto a floured board,

00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:26.321
then we flatten it about 1 inch thick.

00:03:35.984 --> 00:03:39.656
With a sharp knife incise it densely.

00:04:01.766 --> 00:04:05.346
With a medium sized cutter we cut it into round pieces,

00:04:08.223 --> 00:04:13.853
then we place them loosely onto a buttered baking tray.

00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:44.128
We cover the tray with a tea towel and let them rest for another 10 minutes.

00:04:45.605 --> 00:04:50.305
We carefully knead the leftover into a ball.

00:04:57.675 --> 00:05:01.258
Then we flatten and cut again.

00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:25.961
After the re-resting we carefully cover the tops with beaten egg.

00:05:38.702 --> 00:05:42.831
In pre-heated oven at middle settings (cca 200 C) we bake them.

00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:51.182
We can also season them with whole caraway seeds.

00:05:51.182 --> 00:05:58.920
We are finished, quickly we grab them out, and eat them while still hot.

00:06:21.383 --> 00:06:25.498
Enjoy the scones!

00:06:26.022 --> 00:06:30.117
Look forward to our next recipe!
