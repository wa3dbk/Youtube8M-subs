00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
something summery but still kind of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.880 
something summery but still kind of
smoky<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.750> that's<00:00:40.050> perfect<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> date

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
smoky and that's perfect for like a date

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.650 
smoky and that's perfect for like a date
night<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.309> went<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.670> bronze<00:00:42.059> smoky<00:00:42.329> eye

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
night so I went with a bronze smoky eye

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.990 
night so I went with a bronze smoky eye
I<00:00:43.050> probably<00:00:43.770> wouldn't<00:00:44.190> wear<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.760> much

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
I probably wouldn't wear this much

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.520 
I probably wouldn't wear this much
during<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> day<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.600> would<00:00:45.899> probably<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.350> do

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
during the day I would probably just do

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.049 
during the day I would probably just do
like<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> gold<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> little<00:00:47.700> bit<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.820> brown

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
like the gold with a little bit of brown

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.670 
like the gold with a little bit of brown
and<00:00:48.090> decreased<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.840> really<00:00:49.020> tone<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> down<00:00:49.350> for

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and decreased it really tone it down for

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.990 
and decreased it really tone it down for
the<00:00:49.710> daytime<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.730> would<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:50.910> perfect

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the daytime but this would be perfect

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.610 
the daytime but this would be perfect
for<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.750> at<00:00:51.870> night<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:52.320> if<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> just

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
for going out at night or if you just

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
for going out at night or if you just
like<00:00:52.920> dramatic<00:00:53.340> makeup<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:54.300> pretty<00:00:54.480> much

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
like dramatic makeup it's pretty much

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.700 
like dramatic makeup it's pretty much
room<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> from<00:00:55.079> me<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:55.350> definitely<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
room at it from me it's definitely a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.139 
room at it from me it's definitely a
step<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:56.010> from<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.370> wear<00:00:56.550> every<00:00:56.670> day<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
step up from what I wear every day and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.760 
step up from what I wear every day and
then<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> cheeks<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> lips<00:00:58.230> i<00:00:58.559> went

these<00:05:14.080> are<00:05:14.200> little<00:05:14.410> tiny<00:05:14.590> fibers<00:05:14.920> to<00:05:15.220> actually

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
these are little tiny fibers to actually

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.430 
these are little tiny fibers to actually
attach<00:05:15.850> onto<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.330> tips<00:05:16.540> of<00:05:16.660> your<00:05:16.720> lashes<00:05:17.050> and

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
make them look so much longer and then

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.550 
make them look so much longer and then
you<00:05:19.420> just<00:05:19.570> follow<00:05:19.780> that<00:05:19.900> up<00:05:20.050> with<00:05:20.200> another

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
you just follow that up with another
