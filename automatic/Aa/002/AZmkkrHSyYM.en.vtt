showing you how to glitch out a fire
stone<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.230> simple<00:00:43.380> all<00:00:43.770> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
stone it's really really simple all you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.890 
stone it's really really simple all you
need<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.310> vehicle<00:00:44.880> so<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.180> need<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.810> at

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
need is a vehicle so you need to be at

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.380 
need is a vehicle so you need to be at
least<00:00:46.050> past<00:00:46.830> that<00:00:47.130> point<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> game

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
least past that point in the in the game

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.090 
least past that point in the in the game
where<00:00:48.630> you<00:00:48.690> unlock<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> catch<00:00:49.170> ride<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.830> do

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
where you unlock the catch ride to do

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.760 
where you unlock the catch ride to do
this<00:00:50.250> glitch<00:00:50.520> which<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.690> very<00:00:52.020> early<00:00:52.350> on<00:00:52.379> so

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
this glitch which is very early on so

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.500 
this glitch which is very early on so
I'm<00:00:53.010> assuming<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.970> already<00:00:54.180> done

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
I'm assuming that you have already done

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720 
I'm assuming that you have already done
this<00:00:54.690> anyways<00:00:55.590> let's<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.340> into<00:00:56.400> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
this anyways let's get right into the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.760 
this anyways let's get right into the
guide<00:00:56.910> now<00:00:57.180> first<00:00:58.080> things<00:00:58.320> first<00:00:58.410> you're

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
guide now first things first you're

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.530 
guide now first things first you're
going<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> need<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.340> go<00:00:59.489> right<00:01:00.030> there<00:01:00.300> where

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
going to need to go right there where

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.600 
going to need to go right there where
the<00:01:00.690> orange<00:01:00.960> circle<00:01:01.290> is<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.680> map

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
the orange circle is on the map

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.270 
the orange circle is on the map
so<00:01:03.000> spawn<00:01:03.360> in<00:01:03.540> at<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:04.260> fire<00:01:04.589> stone<00:01:04.949> fast

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
so spawn in at the fire stone fast

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.610 
so spawn in at the fire stone fast
travel<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.450> your<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:06.750> over<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
travel and make your way over here to

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.280 
travel and make your way over here to
the<00:01:07.800> catcher<00:01:08.100> ride<00:01:08.490> station<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.990> does

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the catcher ride station so this does

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.250 
the catcher ride station so this does
require<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.740> vehicle<00:01:11.360> at<00:01:12.360> least<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.690> believe<00:01:13.050> so

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
require a vehicle at least I believe so

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.050 
require a vehicle at least I believe so
you<00:01:13.320> may<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.620> able<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.370> foot<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you may be able to do this on foot but I

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.730 
you may be able to do this on foot but I
recommend<00:01:15.510> doing<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> vehicle<00:01:16.380> just

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
recommend doing it on a vehicle just

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.140 
recommend doing it on a vehicle just
because<00:01:17.010> you<00:01:17.159> get<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.490> vehicle<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
because you get your vehicle out of the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.780 
because you get your vehicle out of the
map<00:01:18.350> which<00:01:19.350> makes<00:01:19.620> traveling<00:01:20.250> around<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> lot

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
map which makes traveling around a lot

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.640 
map which makes traveling around a lot
easier<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.420> quicker<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.290> you're<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.530> gonna

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
easier and quicker so you're just gonna

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.670 
easier and quicker so you're just gonna
want<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:23.190> along<00:01:23.550> this<00:01:23.820> barrier<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.690> it<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
want to go along this barrier here it is

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.310 
want to go along this barrier here it is
kind<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.100> like<00:01:26.310> an<00:01:27.030> invisible<00:01:27.240> barrier<00:01:27.960> but

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
kind of like an invisible barrier but

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.020 
kind of like an invisible barrier but
it's<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.650> an<00:01:28.799> invisible<00:01:29.310> barrier<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it's not an invisible barrier if that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.430 
it's not an invisible barrier if that
makes<00:01:30.240> sense<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.720> you're<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:30.960> gonna<00:01:31.080> want<00:01:31.350> to

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
makes sense so you're just gonna want to

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.610 
makes sense so you're just gonna want to
go<00:01:31.560> right<00:01:31.860> down<00:01:32.580> into<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.600> which<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.440> got<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
go right down into here which you got to

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.010 
go right down into here which you got to
be<00:01:34.710> really<00:01:34.920> careful<00:01:35.100> if<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> go<00:01:36.390> too<00:01:36.450> far<00:01:36.870> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
be really careful if you go too far to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.890 
be really careful if you go too far to
the<00:01:37.050> right<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.830> turrets<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:39.060> kill<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the right the turrets will kill you so

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.200 
the right the turrets will kill you so
you've<00:01:40.290> got<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.530> be<00:01:40.590> very<00:01:40.620> careful<00:01:41.130> outside<00:01:42.120> of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
you've got to be very careful outside of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.510 
you've got to be very careful outside of
the<00:01:42.270> map<00:01:42.450> here<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.750> turrets<00:01:43.260> are<00:01:43.440> for<00:01:44.340> some

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
the map here the turrets are for some

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.950 
the map here the turrets are for some
reason<00:01:44.550> I<00:01:45.120> don't<00:01:45.390> know<00:01:45.480> there's<00:01:45.690> just<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.930> lot

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
reason I don't know there's just a lot

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.380 
reason I don't know there's just a lot
of<00:01:46.080> death<00:01:46.350> barriers<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.040> as<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:47.940> we

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
of death barriers so as you can see we

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.240 
of death barriers so as you can see we
have<00:01:48.600> successfully<00:01:49.080> made<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.830> of<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.070> map

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
have successfully made it out of the map

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.760 
have successfully made it out of the map
that<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.790> all<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.180> have<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.570> do<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.080> told<00:01:52.440> you

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
that is all you have to do I told you

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.530 
that is all you have to do I told you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.080 
guys it was gonna be simple I promise
though<00:01:54.810> pretty<00:01:55.650> soon<00:01:55.830> I'm<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.400> do<00:01:56.850> some

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
though pretty soon I'm going to do some

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.900 
though pretty soon I'm going to do some
I<00:01:57.300> guess<00:01:57.450> more<00:01:58.080> difficult<00:01:58.920> out<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.700> map

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
I guess more difficult out of map

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.750 
I guess more difficult out of map
glitches<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.800> on<00:02:01.950> my<00:02:02.070> channel<00:02:02.520> like

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
glitches you know on my channel like

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.550 
glitches you know on my channel like
that<00:02:03.180> required<00:02:03.600> grenade<00:02:03.960> jumping<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.470> stuff

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that required grenade jumping and stuff

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.720 
that required grenade jumping and stuff
because<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.220> ones<00:02:05.370> that<00:02:05.460> I've<00:02:05.550> covered

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
because all the ones that I've covered

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.700 
because all the ones that I've covered
so<00:02:05.970> far<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.720> don't<00:02:06.870> even<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.230> to<00:02:07.410> grenade

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
so far you don't even have to grenade

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.880 
so far you don't even have to grenade
jump<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.989> go<00:02:09.989> out<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> map<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.769> as

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
jump you just go out of the map it's as

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.559 
jump you just go out of the map it's as
simple<00:02:11.039> as<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.310> there's<00:02:11.849> really<00:02:12.060> nothing<00:02:12.540> to

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
simple as that there's really nothing to

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.860 
simple as that there's really nothing to
it<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.050> these<00:02:13.170> but<00:02:13.440> as<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.129> see<00:02:14.370> here

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
it for these but as you can see here

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.910 
it for these but as you can see here
something<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:15.989> I've<00:02:16.170> noticed<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.769> can

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
something that I've noticed you can

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.350 
something that I've noticed you can
bring<00:02:17.129> your<00:02:17.310> car<00:02:17.580> back

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
bring your car back

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.110 
bring your car back
into<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.019> first<00:02:19.349> area<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.069> fire<00:02:20.580> stone<00:02:20.910> this

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
into the first area of fire stone this

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.360 
into the first area of fire stone this
is<00:02:21.239> where<00:02:21.569> you<00:02:21.660> get<00:02:21.780> dropped<00:02:22.080> off<00:02:22.290> at<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.340> very

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
is where you get dropped off at the very

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.610 
is where you get dropped off at the very
beginning<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> game<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.290> bring

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
beginning of the game and you can bring

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.040 
beginning of the game and you can bring
your<00:02:25.739> car<00:02:26.040> through<00:02:26.849> these<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.120> guess<00:02:27.629> gates

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
your car through these I guess gates

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.280 
your car through these I guess gates
that<00:02:28.950> normally<00:02:29.849> you<00:02:30.030> can't<00:02:30.300> go<00:02:30.510> through<00:02:31.140> on

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that normally you can't go through on

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.619 
that normally you can't go through on
foot<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.890> find<00:02:32.519> that<00:02:32.610> really<00:02:32.730> interesting

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
foot so I find that really interesting

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.940 
foot so I find that really interesting
and<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.989> can<00:02:34.110> go<00:02:34.260> over<00:02:34.409> here<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
and then you can go over here and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.130 
and then you can go over here and
explore<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:36.150> be<00:02:36.269> careful<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.989> don't<00:02:37.019> want

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
explore just be careful you don't want

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.710 
explore just be careful you don't want
to<00:02:37.290> fall<00:02:37.440> off<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.739> edge<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.340> almost<00:02:38.910> made<00:02:39.569> that

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
to fall off the edge I almost made that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.900 
to fall off the edge I almost made that
mistake<00:02:39.840> right<00:02:40.230> here<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:40.860> just<00:02:40.920> just<00:02:41.550> be<00:02:41.700> very

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
mistake right here so just just be very

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.210 
mistake right here so just just be very
careful<00:02:42.420> be<00:02:42.930> very

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
careful be very

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.920 
careful be very
cautious<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.910> deaf<00:02:44.180> barriers<00:02:44.570> there<00:02:44.810> are<00:02:44.870> a

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
cautious of deaf barriers there are a

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.320 
cautious of deaf barriers there are a
lot<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.350> them<00:02:45.500> out<00:02:45.620> here<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.130> something<00:02:47.030> else

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
lot of them out here and something else

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.640 
lot of them out here and something else
you<00:02:47.480> can<00:02:47.660> do<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.080> thought<00:02:48.290> was<00:02:48.470> pretty

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
you can do that I thought was pretty

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.770 
you can do that I thought was pretty
awesome<00:02:49.130> if<00:02:49.310> you<00:02:49.460> go<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:50.300> where<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.540> glitch

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
awesome if you go to where you glitch

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.570 
awesome if you go to where you glitch
out<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.350> follow<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.890> road<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.370> right

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
out and you follow the road to the right

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.650 
out and you follow the road to the right
instead<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.240> left

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
instead of the left

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.510 
instead of the left
you<00:02:54.200> can<00:02:54.320> go<00:02:54.440> over<00:02:54.530> here<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.040> you<00:02:55.130> can<00:02:55.280> drop

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
you can go over here and you can drop

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.030 
you can go over here and you can drop
your<00:02:55.670> vehicle<00:02:56.090> down<00:02:56.350> here<00:02:57.350> you<00:02:57.800> have<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:57.980> be

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
your vehicle down here you have to be

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.990 
your vehicle down here you have to be
really<00:02:58.250> careful<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.670> don't<00:02:58.820> want<00:02:58.940> to

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
really careful you don't want to

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.030 
really careful you don't want to
accidentally<00:02:59.750> go<00:02:59.900> down<00:03:00.110> into<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.800> endless

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
accidentally go down into the endless

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.700 
accidentally go down into the endless
abyss<00:03:01.490> but<00:03:02.030> yeah<00:03:02.600> what<00:03:03.020> I<00:03:03.050> found<00:03:03.320> out<00:03:03.530> while

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
abyss but yeah what I found out while

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.530 
abyss but yeah what I found out while
exploring<00:03:04.340> out<00:03:04.490> here<00:03:04.730> if<00:03:04.820> you<00:03:04.910> stay<00:03:05.180> near<00:03:05.390> the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
exploring out here if you stay near the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.350 
exploring out here if you stay near the
left<00:03:05.930> edge<00:03:06.460> you<00:03:07.460> can<00:03:07.580> actually<00:03:07.730> make<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.150> to

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
left edge you can actually make it to

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.930 
left edge you can actually make it to
the<00:03:08.450> very<00:03:08.690> left<00:03:08.990> corner<00:03:09.590> of<00:03:09.770> I<00:03:10.220> guess<00:03:10.430> outside

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
the very left corner of I guess outside

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.700 
the very left corner of I guess outside
of<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.150> map<00:03:11.330> which<00:03:11.600> is<00:03:11.750> really<00:03:11.960> cool<00:03:12.200> because

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
of the map which is really cool because

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.770 
of the map which is really cool because
normally<00:03:13.340> if<00:03:13.490> you<00:03:13.580> just<00:03:13.760> try<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.450> drive

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
normally if you just try to drive

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.120 
normally if you just try to drive
anywhere<00:03:15.230> out<00:03:15.410> here<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.830> you're<00:03:15.950> most

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
anywhere out here that you're most

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.520 
anywhere out here that you're most
likely<00:03:16.340> gonna<00:03:16.520> die<00:03:16.790> from<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.090> death<00:03:17.420> barrier<00:03:17.870> so

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
likely gonna die from a death barrier so

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.220 
likely gonna die from a death barrier so
if<00:03:18.740> you<00:03:18.830> stay<00:03:19.040> near<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.459> left<00:03:19.820> edge<00:03:20.150> here<00:03:20.540> you

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
if you stay near the left edge here you

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.410 
if you stay near the left edge here you
can<00:03:21.380> actually<00:03:21.470> make<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.070> all<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.220> way<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.670> the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
can actually make it all the way to the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.690 
can actually make it all the way to the
left<00:03:23.780> corner<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.620> maps<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.310> thought

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
left corner of the maps so I thought

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.160 
left corner of the maps so I thought
that<00:03:25.880> was<00:03:26.030> awesome<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.480> just<00:03:26.510> wanted<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:26.990> show

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
that was awesome I just wanted to show

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.890 
that was awesome I just wanted to show
you<00:03:27.230> guys<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.680> real<00:03:27.950> quick<00:03:28.340> but<00:03:29.240> before<00:03:29.870> I

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
you guys that real quick but before I
