00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
stove but fuel to save a little bit of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.250 
stove but fuel to save a little bit of
time<00:00:47.820> that's<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.420> needs<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.870> done<00:00:49.079> but

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
time that's all it needs to be done but

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.410 
time that's all it needs to be done but
just<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.530> careful<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.100> spill<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.420> one

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
just be careful not to spill it one

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.729 
just be careful not to spill it one
thing<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.660> definitely<00:00:51.780> recommend<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.559> not

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
thing I definitely recommend is not

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.319 
thing I definitely recommend is not
using<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> stoves<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> inside<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
using the stoves on the inside of a

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.290 
using the stoves on the inside of a
household<00:00:55.309> reason<00:00:56.309> being<00:00:56.489> my<00:00:57.090> biggest

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
household reason being my biggest

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.799 
household reason being my biggest
concern<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.969> you<00:00:59.969> know<00:01:00.059> alcohol<00:01:00.239> fuel

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
concern is that a you know alcohol fuel

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
concern is that a you know alcohol fuel
or<00:01:01.109> alcohol<00:01:01.590> fire<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.100> definitely<00:01:02.460> hard<00:01:02.640> to

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
or alcohol fire is definitely hard to

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.530 
or alcohol fire is definitely hard to
put<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.140> water<00:01:04.140> would<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.589> spread<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.070> so

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
put out water would just spread it so

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.660 
put out water would just spread it so
it's<00:01:06.540> definitely<00:01:06.869> better<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.640> on

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it's definitely better to you know be on

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.149 
it's definitely better to you know be on
the<00:01:08.850> safe<00:01:09.060> side<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.330> now<00:01:09.780> use<00:01:10.020> these<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.380> on

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the safe side and now use these on on

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.429 
the safe side and now use these on on
the<00:01:11.250> inside<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> household<00:01:12.290> using<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
lower than these holes on the outside

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.969 
lower than these holes on the outside
here<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.700> once<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> start<00:01:45.090> seeing<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> fluid

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
here so once you start seeing the fluid

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.560 
here so once you start seeing the fluid
you<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.100> build<00:01:47.340> up<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.270> you

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you know build up like that you can you

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.330 
you know build up like that you can you
know<00:01:48.689> kind<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> good<00:01:49.649> idea<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
know kind of get a good idea that the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.929 
know kind of get a good idea that the
stove<00:01:50.640> itself<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.509> uh<00:01:52.369> it's<00:01:53.369> getting<00:01:53.490> fairly

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
stove itself is uh it's getting fairly

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.620 
stove itself is uh it's getting fairly
full<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.899> what<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.259> starting<00:01:55.890> off<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.630> always

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
full but what I do starting off I always

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.639 
full but what I do starting off I always
leave<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> coin<00:01:58.469> over<00:01:58.890> two<00:01:59.100> holes<00:01:59.570> in<00:02:00.619> what<00:02:01.619> I

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
leave the coin over two holes in what I

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.880 
leave the coin over two holes in what I
want<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:03.290> you<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.530> basically

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
want to see is you know it's basically

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.280 
want to see is you know it's basically
the<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> stove<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.210> prime<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.990> I

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the you know the stove to prime and I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.559 
the you know the stove to prime and I
want<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.530> see<00:02:07.680> all<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> holes<00:02:08.250> start<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.330> light

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
want to see all the holes start to light

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.340 
want to see all the holes start to light
around<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.709> top<00:02:10.979> here<00:02:11.660> before<00:02:12.660> I

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
around the top here before I

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.050 
around the top here before I
before<00:02:13.740> I'll<00:02:13.830> open<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.190> little<00:02:14.430> bit<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.670> gap<00:02:14.850> and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
before I'll open a little bit of gap and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.300 
before I'll open a little bit of gap and
I<00:02:15.120> usually<00:02:15.330> open<00:02:15.690> and<00:02:16.530> I'll<00:02:16.650> show<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.100> in

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
I usually open and I'll show you that in

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.250 
I usually open and I'll show you that in
a<00:02:17.370> minute<00:02:17.610> once<00:02:17.910> in<00:02:18.060> social<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.630> but<00:02:18.960> I<00:02:19.020> always

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
a minute once in social it but I always

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.680 
a minute once in social it but I always
open<00:02:19.590> you<00:02:19.920> know<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.040> little<00:02:20.280> bit<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.490> gap<00:02:20.690> that

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
open you know a little bit of gap that

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.170 
open you know a little bit of gap that
way<00:02:21.870> once<00:02:22.740> it's<00:02:22.950> through<00:02:23.010> Prime<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:24.030> know

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
way once it's through Prime and you know

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.180 
way once it's through Prime and you know
it'll<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.600> a<00:02:24.630> less<00:02:24.930> tendency<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.710> you<00:02:26.100> know

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
it'll have a less tendency to you know

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.220 
it'll have a less tendency to you know
to<00:02:26.340> basically<00:02:26.850> spit<00:02:27.300> or<00:02:27.450> spew<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> little<00:02:28.110> bit

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
to basically spit or spew a little bit

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.200 
to basically spit or spew a little bit
of<00:02:28.320> alcohol<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.370> could<00:02:29.580> do<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.090> you

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
of alcohol and it could do that if you

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.760 
of alcohol and it could do that if you
don't<00:02:30.300> get<00:02:30.510> some<00:02:30.750> kind<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:30.930> air<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.380> know<00:02:31.740> a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
don't get some kind of air you know a

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.920 
don't get some kind of air you know a
small<00:02:32.040> amount<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.400> our<00:02:32.550> air<00:02:32.760> ventilation<00:02:33.270> but

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
small amount of our air ventilation but

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.090 
small amount of our air ventilation but
again<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.260> don't<00:02:34.380> really<00:02:34.560> have<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.890> worry

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
again you don't really have to worry

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.720 
again you don't really have to worry
about<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:36.170> until<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> stove<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.770> uh<00:02:37.800> you

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
about that until the stove is uh you

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.910 
about that until the stove is uh you
know<00:02:38.880> through<00:02:39.270> priming<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.900> starts<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.740> our

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
know through priming and starts to our

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.650 
know through priming and starts to our
light<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> side<00:02:41.610> let's<00:02:42.150> go<00:02:42.270> ahead<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.570> get

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
light on the side let's go ahead and get

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.050 
light on the side let's go ahead and get
it<00:02:42.750> lit<00:02:42.930> though<00:02:43.370> it's<00:02:44.370> very<00:02:44.580> simple<00:02:44.940> I'm<00:02:45.030> just

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
it lit though it's very simple I'm just

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.880 
it lit though it's very simple I'm just
using<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.510> simple<00:02:45.870> grill<00:02:46.050> lighter<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.680> use

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
using a simple grill lighter you can use

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.060 
using a simple grill lighter you can use
a<00:02:47.330> matches<00:02:48.330> or<00:02:48.540> anything<00:02:48.750> like<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.770> let's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
a matches or anything like that so let's

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:58.630 
a matches or anything like that so let's
do<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:52.230> it's<00:02:52.380> lit<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:53.060> didn't<00:02:54.060> even<00:02:54.150> know

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.400 

it's<00:02:59.640> there<00:02:59.850> so<00:02:59.880> so<00:03:00.720> now<00:03:00.840> that<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.140> see<00:03:01.170> the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
it's there so so now that you see the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.780 
it's there so so now that you see the
actually<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.220> holes<00:03:02.400> all<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.610> way<00:03:02.670> around

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
actually the holes all the way around

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.260 
actually the holes all the way around
are<00:03:03.120> actually<00:03:03.480> already<00:03:04.850> already<00:03:05.850> light<00:03:06.090> I'm

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
are actually already already light I'm

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.970 
are actually already already light I'm
gonna<00:03:06.480> go<00:03:06.840> ahead<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.080> open<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.500> little<00:03:07.680> bit<00:03:07.860> of

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
gonna go ahead and open a little bit of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.090 
gonna go ahead and open a little bit of
gap<00:03:08.190> here<00:03:08.990> to<00:03:09.990> get<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.290> air<00:03:10.440> circulation

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
gap here to get that air circulation

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.280 
gap here to get that air circulation
through<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.700> way<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:12.180> don't<00:03:13.050> know<00:03:13.230> too

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
through in that way I don't know too

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.730 
through in that way I don't know too
much<00:03:13.710> of<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:14.010> gap<00:03:15.230> but<00:03:16.230> that's<00:03:16.410> really<00:03:16.620> all

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
much of a gap but that's really all

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.200 
much of a gap but that's really all
that's<00:03:16.890> needed<00:03:17.070> I<00:03:17.460> think<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.060> probably

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
that's needed I think you can probably

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.630 
that's needed I think you can probably
see<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.570> it's<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:19.080> like<00:03:19.260> about<00:03:19.620> half<00:03:20.460> of

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
see that it's just like about half of

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.390 
see that it's just like about half of
one<00:03:20.820> hole<00:03:21.150> in<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:22.470> way<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.680> get<00:03:22.890> enough<00:03:23.190> our

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
one hole in that way to get enough our

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.400 
one hole in that way to get enough our
air<00:03:23.640> circulation<00:03:24.270> but<00:03:24.840> that's<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.260> mean

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
air circulation but that's it I mean

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.960 
air circulation but that's it I mean
that's<00:03:25.680> that's<00:03:25.950> just<00:03:26.040> as<00:03:26.310> simple<00:03:26.580> as<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
that's that's just as simple as the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.520 
that's that's just as simple as the
alcohol<00:03:27.390> stove<00:03:27.780> is<00:03:28.050> too<00:03:28.440> light<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:31.290> what<00:03:31.500> I

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
alcohol stove is too light and what I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.290
