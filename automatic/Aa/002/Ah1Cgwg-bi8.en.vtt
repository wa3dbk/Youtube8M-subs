00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.449
 hello I 'm simon from ilove 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.549
 Bodybuilding de shows in this video 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.470
 you the model of super compensation 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.480
 super compensation is a whole 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.490
 interesting model and describes the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.279
 adaptation of the muscle to the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.890
 trainingsreiz yes this model of the super 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.900
 You often find compensation in 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.820
 Textbooks in old sports science 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.960
 textbooks but also on the internet 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.140
 the whole also available 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.630
 It looks like this on the y-axis 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.730
 is the performance that could be, for example 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.340
 in the thickness of the muscle are so 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.780
 power on the y-axis you can 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.740
 by the way quite well remember that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.530
 the y-axis is here the vertical one 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.910
 because it oops i lon so goes down so 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.310
 I can always remember that when 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.920
 Psion goes down this line so so 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.900
 the y-axis here in the vertical and 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.000
 in the horizontal we have the time 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.580
 the time is always horizontal 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.390
 removed horizontally removed firmly 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.499
 we have the whole story here yes 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.179
 interesting is this model because it 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:11.520
 just describes how the muscle is 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:13.109
 I adapt the training stimulus I want that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.689
 explain whole now that is so 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:18.270
 bit chronologically starts here 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.159
 a training with a stimulus 1 vote 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.490
 songs law determinate the lust set 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.670
 becomes 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:29.280
 the training is so exciting here 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.439
 trains exactly on the spot 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.109
 this place here and first it comes 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.450
 then to a fatigue of the muscle and 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:38.189
 after only one hour after one and a half 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.139
 hours longer then training should be 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.600
 is not a muscle tired and tired 

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:44.700
 you finish a lot of training on this 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.829
 place drinks faces post world check 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.850
 It should definitely be home then 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.530
 go and start your generation 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.509
 regeneration means that with witness 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.110
 Again there is an accommodation 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.910
 recovery of the muscle up to 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.730
 origin here and taken in the reason 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.790
 even beyond the origin of that 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.830
 Not only does the muscle adapt to it 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.920
 except for the condition in which he was before 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.110
 training was better but adjusts itself 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.390
 the burden placed on them 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.970
 simply by growing thicker by 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.490
 By doing this, you just get the performance 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.240
 he improves and he does so by just 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.209
 For example, at thick wins so yes 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.000
 these areas are called the super 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.880
 Compensation a sea ​​out of the same 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.709
 adaptation of the muscle to the 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.709
 training is quite interesting now 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.230
 of course that here at this point 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.300
 optimally the new one is set to the right 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.870
 that should be here at this 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.880
 location 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.830
 you should go back to training 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.489
 Going back to sports just to get one 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.870
 new tempting to put stimulus 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.030
 you are already at this point to 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.420
 Training would be the problem that you 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.290
 the overtraining camps that the muscle 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.510
 that the watch I think it's pretty 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.130
 a sign that the curves here already 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.590
 would go down again and you 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.950
 almost does not use this whole phase if 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.989
 you go hero first for training then it is 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.730
 the problem that you just too long 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.680
 there you are, that means you already have a lot 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.810
 can go earlier and then has easy 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.400
 Giving away time is worse 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.570
 it if you too early is if you to 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.260
 Late this is of course not 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.850
 optimal 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.070
 Theoretically, that's exactly where it is 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.140
 right time but everything here 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.650
 would already be over 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.120
 training 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.100
 Of course, now the one turns 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.930
 or other question how long should be 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.750
 between the end of the first training 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.590
 and the beginning of the new training 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.870
 Time has to be found again and again 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.540
 that this period with one to three 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.280
 days is indicated 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.230
 there are three days for non-athletes 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.120
 are called three days and for 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.410
 athletes will be a day or even 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.049
 Called 24 hours 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.580
 From my point of view it is very short one 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.100
 Do not forget that it is not only 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.069
 there is a local muscle fatigue and one 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.209
 local government 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.349
 for us but also the central one 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.749
 nervous system a very crucial 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.370
 plays that means the muscle of the 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.959
 page not hours later already 24 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.909
 to be irritated again for 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.129
 trained athletes really fit 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:11.249
 are easy 24 hours a day 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.739
 little I'm talking about two of them 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:15.840
 you can not do that for four days 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.519
 hurts the whole bloody beginner 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.769
 no fitness at all or one very 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.570
 bad fitness good like up to four 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.419
 days need three days would be there 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.870
 probably a bit short so between 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.580
 the end of the first training 4 and the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.380
 The beginning of the new training should be two 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.330
 until four days lie you are just completely 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.919
 often read one to three days, I have the 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.870
 Rad explained why I am the view 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.240
 rather a bit longer at the place 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.090
 new training put that here it 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.650
 process of super compensation and if 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.289
 you look at this model now over the 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.419
 Time continues to introduce then it comes 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.220
 Of course, always one more 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.020
 Adjustment to a more offsetting too 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.699
 a super compensation firm this 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.949
 humpback who would be here in this 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.419
 Model always continue what that 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.550
 Ultimately, they can be derived from how 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.110
 the whole model looks like that shows 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.599
 you in the second part will certainly be complete 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.320
 interesting until then many greetings yours 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:10.190
 simon hello i'm simon frey 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.190
 career wants
