windows 7 by adding another forty

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.490 
windows 7 by adding another forty
dollars<00:02:36.600> so<00:02:37.600> actually<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:38.049> quite<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.290> good

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
dollars so actually is quite a good

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.070 
dollars so actually is quite a good
upgrade<00:02:38.680> over<00:02:39.250> there

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080
