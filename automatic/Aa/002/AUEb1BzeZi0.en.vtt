00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.390 
in the face because that is the way the
game<00:02:58.819> was<00:02:59.030> ment<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.420> be<00:02:59.510> played<00:02:59.950> just<00:03:00.950> hipfire

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
game was ment to be played just hipfire

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.780 
game was ment to be played just hipfire
people<00:03:01.790> all<00:03:02.209> day<00:03:02.600> look<00:03:02.989> at<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.489> see<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.700> this

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
people all day look at that see and this

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.940 
people all day look at that see and this
works<00:03:05.000> even<00:03:05.239> better<00:03:05.390> because<00:03:06.049> I<00:03:06.350> have<00:03:06.799> not

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
works even better because I have not

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.330 
works even better because I have not
played<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.580> like<00:03:08.209> two<00:03:08.420> weeks<00:03:09.100> whenever<00:03:10.100> the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
played in like two weeks whenever the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.640 
played in like two weeks whenever the
first<00:03:10.549> part<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.450> session<00:03:11.690> is<00:03:12.019> posted<00:03:12.530> that

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
first part of a session is posted that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.729 
first part of a session is posted that
is<00:03:12.830> when<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.370> whole<00:03:13.580> session<00:03:14.150> is<00:03:14.360> recorded

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
is when the whole session is recorded

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.990 
is when the whole session is recorded
obviously<00:03:15.739> because<00:03:15.980> that<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.459> like<00:03:16.640> what<00:03:16.850> a

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
obviously because that is like what a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.900 
obviously because that is like what a
session<00:03:17.239> is<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:17.959> whatever<00:03:18.290> part<00:03:18.709> one<00:03:18.950> of<00:03:19.220> those

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
session is so whatever part one of those

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.059 
session is so whatever part one of those
last<00:03:20.239> two<00:03:20.480> sessions<00:03:20.810> were<00:03:21.230> those<00:03:21.920> were

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
last two sessions were those were

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.660 
last two sessions were those were
recorded<00:03:22.519> on<00:03:22.610> the<00:03:22.730> same<00:03:22.940> day<00:03:23.150> I<00:03:23.390> think<00:03:24.670> pretty
