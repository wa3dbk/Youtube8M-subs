the<00:00:00.960> core<00:00:01.230> two<00:00:01.500> processors<00:00:02.129> come<00:00:02.580> in<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.820> single

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:03.620 
the core two processors come in a single

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.839 
the core two processors come in a single
duel<00:00:04.620> in<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:05.069> quad<00:00:05.370> core<00:00:05.759> option<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:07.069> the<00:00:08.069> max<00:00:08.429> i

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
duel in a quad core option and the max i

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.240 
duel in a quad core option and the max i
believe<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:10.010> 3.33<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:12.290> this<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> very<00:00:13.950> high

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
believe is 3.33 and this is a very high

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.590 
believe is 3.33 and this is a very high
in<00:00:14.639> very<00:00:15.330> stable<00:00:15.570> get<00:00:16.139> hurt<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.740> um<00:00:17.180> it's<00:00:18.180> super

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
in very stable get hurt so um it's super

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.710 
in very stable get hurt so um it's super
fast<00:00:18.869> again<00:00:19.380> that's<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> core<00:00:19.920> tues<00:00:20.220> and

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
fast again that's the core tues and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.939 
fast again that's the core tues and
beside<00:00:21.720> from<00:00:22.020> their<00:00:22.199> high<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.710> gigahertz

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
beside from their high and gigahertz

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.550 
beside from their high and gigahertz
feed<00:00:23.340> they<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.150> crazy<00:00:24.810> high<00:00:25.140> amounts<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
feed they have crazy high amounts of

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.609 
feed they have crazy high amounts of
cash<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.480> this<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.630> pretty<00:00:27.930> much<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> best

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
cash and this is pretty much the best

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.550 
cash and this is pretty much the best
processor<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.090> your<00:00:30.150> dollar

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
processor you can get for your dollar

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.819 
processor you can get for your dollar
right<00:00:31.560> now<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> again<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.170> core<00:00:34.500> two

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
right now so again the core two

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.430 
right now so again the core two
processors<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.540> processor<00:00:37.110> i<00:00:37.140> would

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
processors is the processor i would

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.190 
processors is the processor i would
highly<00:00:37.680> recommend<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.760> why<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> built<00:00:39.750> every

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
highly recommend it's why I built every

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.500 
highly recommend it's why I built every
computer<00:00:40.530> with<00:00:40.860> its<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.640> best<00:00:41.790> processor<00:00:42.420> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
computer with its the best processor you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.020 
computer with its the best processor you
can<00:00:42.570> get<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.079> dollar<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.820> that's<00:00:44.820> it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
can get for your dollar and that's it

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.470 
can get for your dollar and that's it
just<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.480> out<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.660> buy<00:00:45.870> some<00:00:46.670> now<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.270> have

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
just go out and buy some now if you have

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.200 
just go out and buy some now if you have
tons<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.170> money<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.620> blow<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
tons of money to blow and you want the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.900 
tons of money to blow and you want the
best<00:00:52.219> processor<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.850> there

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
best processor that is out there

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.350 
best processor that is out there
possibly<00:00:54.620> then<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.770> need<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.360> i7

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
possibly then you need to get the i7

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.049 
possibly then you need to get the i7
processor<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.309> latest<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
processor this is the latest in the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.250 
processor this is the latest in the
greatest<00:01:00.660> from<00:01:01.350> Intel<00:01:02.210> all<00:01:03.210> I've<00:01:03.600> 7s<00:01:04.110> have

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
greatest from Intel all I've 7s have

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.649 
greatest from Intel all I've 7s have
four<00:01:04.589> cores<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.280> eight<00:01:05.640> processing<00:01:06.330> threads

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
four cores in eight processing threads

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.649 
four cores in eight processing threads
which<00:01:07.290> makes<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.189> i7<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> most<00:01:09.150> beastly

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
which makes the i7 is the most beastly

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.800 
which makes the i7 is the most beastly
beast<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> market<00:01:10.979> not<00:01:11.820> even<00:01:11.970> intel<00:01:12.600> or

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
beast on the market not even intel or

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.170 
beast on the market not even intel or
AMD<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> best<00:01:14.189> processor<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.150> can

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
AMD this is the best processor you can

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.960 
AMD this is the best processor you can
get<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.659> personal<00:01:16.049> computer<00:01:16.229> right<00:01:16.680> now

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
get for a personal computer right now

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.330 
get for a personal computer right now
however<00:01:17.970> there<00:01:18.330> are<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:19.530> over<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> thousand

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
however there are like over a thousand

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.190 
however there are like over a thousand
dollars<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.939> unless<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.659> have<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
dollars so unless you have that kind of

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.710 
dollars so unless you have that kind of
money<00:01:22.290> then<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.240> wouldn't<00:01:24.240> even<00:01:24.360> worry<00:01:24.659> about

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
money then I wouldn't even worry about

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.740 
money then I wouldn't even worry about
getting<00:01:25.049> an<00:01:25.350> i7<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.390> just<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.479> case<00:01:27.509> you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
getting an i7 but just in case you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.179 
getting an i7 but just in case you
wanted<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.080> some<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> specs<00:01:28.979> on<00:01:29.159> it

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
wanted to know some of the specs on it

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.520 
wanted to know some of the specs on it
they<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:30.000> eight<00:01:30.210> megabytes<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.930> cash<00:01:31.200> which

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
they have eight megabytes of cash which

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.090 
they have eight megabytes of cash which
is<00:01:31.680> extremely<00:01:32.340> high<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.590> 2.9<00:01:34.590> three

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.440 
is extremely high and 2.9 three
gigahertz<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.759> pretty<00:01:35.939> much<00:01:36.030> handle

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
gigahertz can pretty much handle

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.649 
gigahertz can pretty much handle
anything<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.590> throw<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> get

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
anything you throw at it and if you get

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.020 
anything you throw at it and if you get
a<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.810> seven<00:01:40.409> pretty<00:01:40.740> much<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.189> processor<00:01:41.880> is

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
a I seven pretty much this processor is
