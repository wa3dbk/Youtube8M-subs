00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
take it out as you can see it takes a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:31.100 
take it out as you can see it takes a
double<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.260> battery<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.979> there

Mouse<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.360> two<00:01:38.200> buttons<00:01:38.710> in<00:01:38.920> your<00:01:41.250> wheel<00:01:42.250> in

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
Mouse and two buttons in your wheel in

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.350 
Mouse and two buttons in your wheel in
the<00:01:42.580> middle<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:45.190> you've<00:01:45.580> got<00:01:45.820> like<00:01:46.030> one<00:01:46.210> two

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
the middle and you've got like one two

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.470 
the middle and you've got like one two

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.149 

now<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:12.239> actually<00:04:12.510> gives<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.170> a<00:04:13.560> swirl<00:04:13.980> like
