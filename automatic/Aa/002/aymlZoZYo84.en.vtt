rail and comfortable coming off the end

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.060 
rail and comfortable coming off the end
of<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> rail<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.230> want<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> be<00:00:22.500> going<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
of the rail you want to be going a

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.160 
of the rail you want to be going a
medium<00:00:23.699> speed<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.060> don't<00:00:24.359> like<00:00:24.480> going<00:00:24.689> too<00:00:24.869> slow

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
medium speed I don't like going too slow

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.800 
medium speed I don't like going too slow
obviously<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:26.310> nice<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.699> just<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:27.330> cruising

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
obviously it's nice to just be cruising

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.830 
obviously it's nice to just be cruising
like<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> nice<00:00:28.439> comfortable<00:00:28.800> speed<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.840> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
like a nice comfortable speed and the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.080 
like a nice comfortable speed and the
faster<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.289> go<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> feel<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.460> easier<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
faster you go I feel the easier it is to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.200 
faster you go I feel the easier it is to
just<00:00:33.449> you<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.750> more<00:00:34.019> time<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:34.769> 180<00:00:35.210> if

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
just you have more time for the 180 if

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.539 
just you have more time for the 180 if
you're<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.600> too<00:00:36.780> slow<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.530> lot<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.220> times<00:00:38.400> you

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:38.549 
you're going too slow a lot of times you

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:41.299 
you're going too slow a lot of times you
can<00:00:38.699> do<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.970> 180<00:00:39.150> and<00:00:39.680> your<00:00:40.680> bikes<00:00:40.890> gonna<00:00:41.100> want

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
can do the 180 and your bikes gonna want

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.219 
can do the 180 and your bikes gonna want
to<00:00:41.370> drop<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:42.570> side<00:00:42.780> because

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:43.229 
to drop to the to the side because

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:44.390 
to drop to the to the side because
you're<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.440> gonna<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.650> that<00:00:43.949> much<00:00:44.100> time

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
you're not gonna have that much time

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.430 
you're not gonna have that much time
it's<00:00:45.089> better<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.780> some<00:00:46.019> distance

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
it's better if you have some distance

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.990 
it's better if you have some distance
between<00:00:46.589> yourself<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.339> the<00:00:47.460> rail<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.850> it's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
between yourself and the rail so it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.060 
between yourself and the rail so it's
more<00:00:48.150> comfortable<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> cab<00:00:49.080> out<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.710> good

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
more comfortable to cab out it a good

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.430 
more comfortable to cab out it a good
way<00:00:50.220> to<00:00:50.280> start<00:00:50.850> off<00:00:50.970> practicing<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.629> trick<00:00:51.869> is

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
way to start off practicing the trick is

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.140 
way to start off practicing the trick is
actually<00:00:52.710> doing<00:00:53.159> opposite<00:00:53.519> 180s<00:00:54.030> you're

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
actually doing opposite 180s you're

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.670 
actually doing opposite 180s you're
gonna<00:00:54.239> want<00:00:54.540> to<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.690> comfortable<00:00:55.110> doing

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
gonna want to be comfortable doing

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.969 
gonna want to be comfortable doing
opposite<00:00:56.040> 180s<00:00:56.580> and<00:00:57.049> spinning<00:00:58.049> out<00:00:58.199> your

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
opposite 180s and spinning out your

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.469 
opposite 180s and spinning out your
switch<00:00:59.220> way<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> obviously<00:01:00.089> don't<00:01:00.239> want<00:01:00.330> to

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
switch way you obviously don't want to

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.570 
switch way you obviously don't want to
Indian<00:01:00.780> giver<00:01:01.019> out<00:01:01.769> of<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.979> grind<00:01:02.220> it's<00:01:02.430> not

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
Indian giver out of the grind it's not

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.579 
Indian giver out of the grind it's not
good<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.119> basically<00:01:03.720> do<00:01:03.839> that<00:01:04.019> practice<00:01:04.500> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
good just basically do that practice a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.469 
good just basically do that practice a
lot<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.830> switch<00:01:05.040> 180s<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.850> comfortable<00:01:06.270> on

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
lot of switch 180s and be comfortable on

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.180 
lot of switch 180s and be comfortable on
the<00:01:06.630> rail<00:01:06.810> doing<00:01:07.200> double<00:01:07.470> peg<00:01:07.650> grinds<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
the rail doing double peg grinds and

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.800 
the rail doing double peg grinds and
then<00:01:08.730> everything<00:01:09.060> kind<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.330> falls<00:01:09.570> together

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
then everything kind of falls together

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.900 
then everything kind of falls together
one<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> main<00:01:10.950> things<00:01:11.220> about<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> trick

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
one of the main things about the trick

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.300 
one of the main things about the trick
is<00:01:12.120> that<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.360> want<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.440> be<00:01:13.560> over<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> top<00:01:14.160> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
is that you want to be over the top of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.830 
is that you want to be over the top of
the<00:01:14.370> rail<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.700> quite<00:01:14.910> a<00:01:14.940> bit<00:01:15.150> balanced<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.780> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the rail and quite a bit balanced so you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.680 
the rail and quite a bit balanced so you
can<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.320> an<00:01:16.770> easier<00:01:17.280> spin<00:01:17.700> off<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.210> rail<00:01:18.390> if

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
can get an easier spin off the rail if

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.660 
can get an easier spin off the rail if
you're<00:01:19.320> leaned<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:19.980> a<00:01:20.040> little<00:01:20.280> bit<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you're leaned out a little bit to the

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
you're leaned out a little bit to the
side<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.510> gonna<00:01:21.660> be<00:01:21.810> harder<00:01:22.050> to<00:01:22.230> do<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> 180

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
side it's gonna be harder to do the 180

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620 
side it's gonna be harder to do the 180
and<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.250> you're<00:01:23.400> leaned<00:01:23.580> over<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.510> bit

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
and if you're leaned over a little bit

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.150 
and if you're leaned over a little bit
too<00:01:24.780> much<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.350> also<00:01:25.500> gonna<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.800> a<00:01:25.950> little

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
too much and it's also gonna be a little

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.590 
too much and it's also gonna be a little
hard<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.760> 180<00:01:26.880> but<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.300> you're<00:01:27.450> right

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
hard to do the 180 but if you're right

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
hard to do the 180 but if you're right
in<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.840> middle<00:01:28.140> area<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:29.070> gonna<00:01:29.190> be<00:01:29.370> really

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
in that middle area it's gonna be really

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.810 
in that middle area it's gonna be really
easy<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.970> pop<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.300> up<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.800> cap<00:01:31.800> out<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.640> not

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
easy to pop it up and cap out what not

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.090

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
one of the main reasons it's best to be

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.310 
one of the main reasons it's best to be
centered<00:01:35.850> over<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.210> rail<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.690> not<00:01:36.900> even<00:01:37.110> a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
centered over the rail if not even a

centered over the rail if not even a

little bit more over to the inside of
the<00:01:39.750> rail<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.800> when<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.190> go<00:01:41.370> to<00:01:41.400> swing

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the rail is that when you go to swing

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.790 
the rail is that when you go to swing
the<00:01:41.970> 180<00:01:42.300> off<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.780> lot<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> motion<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.650> the

the 180 off a lot of the motion in the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.770 
the 180 off a lot of the motion in the
180<00:01:44.130> comes<00:01:44.460> from<00:01:44.730> your<00:01:44.880> pits<00:01:45.090> because<00:01:45.390> you're

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
180 comes from your pits because you're

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.140 
180 comes from your pits because you're
like<00:01:45.960> settled<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.010> rail<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.610> when

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
like settled down on the rail and when

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.969 
like settled down on the rail and when
you're<00:01:48.300> over<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> top<00:01:49.020> its<00:01:49.320> way<00:01:49.500> easier<00:01:49.680> to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
you're over the top its way easier to

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.910 
you're over the top its way easier to
get<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.190> nice<00:01:50.550> swing<00:01:50.970> out<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.300> the<00:01:51.510> rail<00:01:51.920> unlike

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
get a nice swing out of the rail unlike

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
get a nice swing out of the rail unlike
when<00:01:53.190> your<00:01:53.340> leaned<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.909> rail<00:01:54.210> your

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
when your leaned out of the rail your

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.390 
when your leaned out of the rail your
body<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.170> already<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.650> that<00:01:55.680> outside<00:01:56.220> position

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
body is already in that outside position

and<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:56.970> not<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.420> want<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.690> adjust<00:01:57.810> as

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and it's not going to want to adjust as

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.860 
and it's not going to want to adjust as
well<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.400> swing<00:01:59.670> over<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.210> side<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.690> do

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
well to swing over to the side and do

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.980 
well to swing over to the side and do
the<00:02:01.020> 180<00:02:01.200> is

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
the 180 is

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.110 
the 180 is
it's<00:02:02.680> definitely<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:03.100> trick<00:02:03.370> that's<00:02:03.550> nice<00:02:03.820> to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
it's definitely a trick that's nice to

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.360 
it's definitely a trick that's nice to
learn<00:02:04.300> on<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:04.690> rail<00:02:04.990> that's<00:02:05.710> a<00:02:05.890> little<00:02:06.160> bit

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
learn on a rail that's a little bit

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.910 
learn on a rail that's a little bit
taller<00:02:06.610> but<00:02:06.760> not<00:02:07.090> super<00:02:08.050> high<00:02:08.200> obviously<00:02:08.410> not

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
taller but not super high obviously not

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.070 
taller but not super high obviously not
super<00:02:09.310> low<00:02:09.430> because<00:02:09.910> when<00:02:10.630> you're<00:02:10.720> doing<00:02:10.869> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
super low because when you're doing the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.230 
super low because when you're doing the
switch<00:02:11.290> 180<00:02:11.530> out<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.040> rail<00:02:12.250> it's<00:02:12.670> nice<00:02:12.970> to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
switch 180 out of the rail it's nice to

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.300 
switch 180 out of the rail it's nice to
have<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.420> little<00:02:13.690> bit<00:02:13.750> more<00:02:13.960> time<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.950> do<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
have a little bit more time to do the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.580 
have a little bit more time to do the
180<00:02:15.490> personally<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.320> bar

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
180 personally I like to have like a bar

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.260 
180 personally I like to have like a bar
height<00:02:17.830> rail<00:02:18.070> to<00:02:18.370> do<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.610> pegs<00:02:18.790> 180<00:02:19.090> because

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
height rail to do the pegs 180 because

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.820 
height rail to do the pegs 180 because
you<00:02:19.480> have<00:02:19.570> plenty<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.930> time<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.350> do<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> switch

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
you have plenty of time to do the switch

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.620 
you have plenty of time to do the switch
180<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.460> everything<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:22.270> feels<00:02:22.450> a<00:02:22.600> little

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
180 and everything just feels a little

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.240 
180 and everything just feels a little
bit<00:02:22.930> more<00:02:23.080> comfortable<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.800> can<00:02:23.920> obviously

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
bit more comfortable you can obviously

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.180 
bit more comfortable you can obviously
do<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:24.910> little<00:02:25.540> rails<00:02:25.930> but<00:02:26.380> it's<00:02:26.860> gonna<00:02:26.980> be

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
do it on little rails but it's gonna be

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.470 
do it on little rails but it's gonna be
a<00:02:27.220> bit<00:02:27.460> more<00:02:27.490> rush<00:02:27.880> you're<00:02:28.090> gonna<00:02:28.210> have<00:02:28.360> to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
a bit more rush you're gonna have to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.990 
a bit more rush you're gonna have to
fling<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.050> 180<00:02:29.380> out<00:02:29.620> more<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.070> personally<00:02:30.940> I

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
fling the 180 out more and personally I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.910 
fling the 180 out more and personally I
don't<00:02:31.090> think<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.420> feels<00:02:31.630> as<00:02:31.930> good<00:02:32.230> but<00:02:32.500> it's

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
don't think it feels as good but it's

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.170 
don't think it feels as good but it's
definitely<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.430> know<00:02:33.550> it's<00:02:33.850> just<00:02:34.000> personal

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
definitely you know it's just personal

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.520 
definitely you know it's just personal
preference<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:34.900> what<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.140> want<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.350> learn<00:02:35.500> on

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
preference and what you want to learn on

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.980 
preference and what you want to learn on
are<00:02:35.860> what<00:02:36.520> you<00:02:36.640> have<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.120> ride<00:02:37.300> in<00:02:37.570> your<00:02:37.690> area

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
are what you have to ride in your area

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.200 
are what you have to ride in your area
so<00:02:38.070> it's<00:02:39.070> not<00:02:39.190> just<00:02:39.250> a<00:02:39.550> trick<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.880> can<00:02:40.000> do<00:02:40.120> on

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
so it's not just a trick you can do on

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.820 
so it's not just a trick you can do on
flat<00:02:40.450> rails<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:40.900> can<00:02:41.020> do<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.200> up<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.620> down

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
flat rails you can do it up and down

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.430 
flat rails you can do it up and down
rails<00:02:42.160> as<00:02:42.370> well<00:02:42.720> one<00:02:43.720> thing<00:02:43.900> about<00:02:44.080> doing<00:02:44.350> them

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
rails as well one thing about doing them

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.260 
rails as well one thing about doing them
down<00:02:44.650> rails<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.310> feel<00:02:45.670> it's<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.910> little<00:02:45.940> bit

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
down rails I feel it's a little bit

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.720 
down rails I feel it's a little bit
harder<00:02:46.540> because<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.770> don't<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.130> as<00:02:48.460> much

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
harder because you don't have as much

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.030 
harder because you don't have as much
time<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.090> spin<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.720> 180<00:02:50.110> you're<00:02:50.740> gonna<00:02:50.830> have<00:02:51.010> a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
time to spin the 180 you're gonna have a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.380 
time to spin the 180 you're gonna have a
little<00:02:51.340> less<00:02:51.580> time<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.000> you're<00:02:52.120> gonna<00:02:52.210> have

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
little less time and you're gonna have

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.380 
little less time and you're gonna have
to<00:02:52.450> spend<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> 180<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.170> little<00:02:53.560> bit<00:02:53.680> faster

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
to spend the 180 a little bit faster

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.760 
to spend the 180 a little bit faster
personally<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.450> feel<00:02:55.750> like<00:02:55.810> you're<00:02:56.380> going<00:02:56.620> up

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
personally I feel like you're going up

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.590 
personally I feel like you're going up
rails<00:02:57.070> is<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.460> little<00:02:57.760> bit<00:02:57.850> easier<00:02:58.210> to<00:02:58.240> do<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
rails is a little bit easier to do the

you'll<00:03:29.980> probably<00:03:30.250> roll<00:03:30.400> over<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.210> go<00:03:31.330> a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
you'll probably roll over it so go a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.480 
you'll probably roll over it so go a
little<00:03:31.540> bit<00:03:31.690> faster<00:03:32.170> and<00:03:32.320> pretty<00:03:33.010> much<00:03:33.160> over

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
and and lean your bike your pegs will
