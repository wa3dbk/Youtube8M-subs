I've been massaging it trying to get

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.290 
I've been massaging it trying to get
some<00:03:28.930> stimulate<00:03:29.560> stimuli<00:03:30.340> like<00:03:30.370> stimulation

some stimulate stimuli like stimulation

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.480 
some stimulate stimuli like stimulation
back<00:03:31.510> there<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.590> it's<00:03:32.770> like<00:03:32.860> a<00:03:32.980> little<00:03:33.250> bit

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
back there so it's like a little bit

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.390 
back there so it's like a little bit
thin<00:03:33.940> so<00:03:34.390> that's<00:03:35.320> why<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.560> side<00:03:35.950> of<00:03:36.070> my<00:03:36.220> hair

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
thin so that's why this side of my hair

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.770 
thin so that's why this side of my hair
is<00:03:36.490> a<00:03:36.520> little<00:03:36.670> bit<00:03:36.910> thinner<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.450> like<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.720> said

thinning hair here that's falling out

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.900 
thinning hair here that's falling out
and<00:04:52.510> my<00:04:52.600> hair<00:04:52.780> is<00:04:52.810> not<00:04:53.020> breaking<00:04:53.080> at<00:04:53.950> all<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:54.850> I

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
and my hair is not breaking at all so I

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.350 
and my hair is not breaking at all so I
know<00:04:55.000> my<00:04:55.990> actual<00:04:56.410> hair<00:04:56.620> strands<00:04:57.070> is<00:04:57.430> healthy

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
know my actual hair strands is healthy

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.330 
know my actual hair strands is healthy
but<00:04:58.630> I<00:04:58.810> don't<00:04:58.990> know<00:04:59.140> what<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.740> do<00:04:59.890> about<00:05:00.010> the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
but I don't know what to do about the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.190 
but I don't know what to do about the
shedding<00:05:00.610> I'm<00:05:00.880> thinking<00:05:01.510> it<00:05:01.660> might<00:05:01.720> be<00:05:01.870> the

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
shedding I'm thinking it might be the

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.530 
shedding I'm thinking it might be the
chemical<00:05:02.650> processing<00:05:03.400> maybe<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.090> should<00:05:04.390> take

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
chemical processing maybe I should take

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.010 
chemical processing maybe I should take
a<00:05:04.750> longer<00:05:05.110> time<00:05:05.140> to<00:05:06.000> before<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.240> perm<00:05:07.810> my<00:05:07.990> hair

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
a longer time to before I perm my hair

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.140 
a longer time to before I perm my hair
but<00:05:08.620> I'm<00:05:08.740> just<00:05:08.920> scared<00:05:09.130> it's<00:05:09.550> gonna<00:05:09.610> break<00:05:09.940> off

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.120 
but I'm just scared it's gonna break off
at<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.540> demarcation<00:05:10.900> line<00:05:11.410> I<00:05:11.590> don't<00:05:11.950> want<00:05:12.070> it

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
to break off where my new growth meets

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.490 
to break off where my new growth meets
