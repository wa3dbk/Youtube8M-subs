00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
try and put them in there I kind of put

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.189 
try and put them in there I kind of put
one<00:03:51.150> there<00:03:51.180> last<00:03:51.449> night<00:03:51.569> just<00:03:51.870> see<00:03:51.959> out<00:03:52.079> with

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
one there last night just see out with

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.020 
one there last night just see out with
hold<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.799> they<00:03:52.859> come<00:03:53.099> right<00:03:53.310> out<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.760> I<00:03:53.790> figure

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
hold and they come right out so I figure

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.220 
hold and they come right out so I figure
if<00:03:54.090> there's<00:03:54.209> any<00:03:54.389> kind<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.569> pressure<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:55.079> there

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
if there's any kind of pressure in there

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.170 
if there's any kind of pressure in there
once<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.530> sit<00:03:55.799> down<00:03:55.919> on<00:03:56.069> these<00:03:56.160> things<00:03:56.430> it's

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
once you sit down on these things it's

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.750 
once you sit down on these things it's
probably<00:03:57.480> won't<00:03:57.599> pop<00:03:57.750> right<00:03:57.900> back<00:03:58.109> out<00:03:58.730> but<00:03:59.730> I

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
probably won't pop right back out but I

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.479 
probably won't pop right back out but I
wanna<00:04:00.150> see<00:04:00.299> if<00:04:00.389> I<00:04:00.480> can't<00:04:00.720> kind<00:04:00.930> of<00:04:01.340> put<00:04:02.340> them<00:04:02.430> in

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
wanna see if I can't kind of put them in

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.800 
wanna see if I can't kind of put them in
there<00:04:02.609> really<00:04:02.730> good<00:04:02.849> we're<00:04:03.419> talking<00:04:03.629> mine
