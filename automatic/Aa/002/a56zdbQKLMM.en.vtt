00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.410
 slowdown but good let's go 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.880
 start with the hairstyle first 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.280
 convince them in some water in this 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.860
 part of my hair 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:37.210
 and those who take a tooth comb what 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.210
 what I'm going to do is make 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.760
 above 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:52.140
 then this I am going to divide my hair 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.680
 of this part and this I'm going to leave here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.680
 in front 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.820
 then I'm going to take strand by 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.020
 medium 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.020
 of stones 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.490
 I'm going to spray this 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.610
 and I'm going to make a crepe 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.950
 and then to pass by and I'm going to 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.289
 go doing so 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.220
 until it looks like I like it already 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.330
 meditate return 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.110
 cause 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.360
 once we have our chest 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.240
 I'm going to take it all this way 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.100
 I'm going to divide this part back 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.960
 I'm going to take out 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.040
 a part of this side 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.040
 and the other 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.060
 from this other 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.240
 more or less that they are equal 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.490
 so that our garments remain 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.490
 Well, more or less balanced 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.880
 I'm going to take these strands and I'm going to 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.080
 bitter while I go to work with the d 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.080
 I have done a half 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:21.200
 it was a little girl if this 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.390
 we want or we have some clamp 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.390
 but then let's hold it 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.680
 so as long as I do not make makeup 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.400
 but it is 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.170
 the time I'm going to put some spring 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.980
 in this part crest if you have it 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.980
 cut like them 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.310
 with the same 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.400
 comb or much we have any not 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.870

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.130
 I'm going to share it 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.190
 and same one tagline down here 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.790
 in this way bulging I am here in 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.790
 different 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.540
 the show 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.890
 in the part that we want area of the 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.890
 mine levites of these 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.630
 here 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:43.340
 I'm going to lend 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.340
 and here we are a past because we put it 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.599
 and then we are going to make a braid in 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.599
 this same ponytail 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.830
 of three trips 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.540
 and so I will do with us nothing more 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.540
 what are I going to do without turning off 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.060
 good since we have our braids and 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.180
 what we are going to do is make them a little 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.320
 aguaditas are very relaxed 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.320
 and I do not see myself 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.879
 in addition and very very watery very disheveled 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.940
 and I will do the same with the 3 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.270
 and now that we have just started 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.360
 roll up 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.289
 thus 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.289
 I'm going 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.379
 pointing him 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.580
 let's do the same with this way 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.900
 that are stuck 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.900
 one other press 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.680
 and it will be this way of nothing 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.280
 we are going to 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.550
 understand our crest 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:37.630
 so that it is not known that any use 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.630
 no little horse 

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:47.390
 very relaxed I'm going to cut a few 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.390
 little horses here opposite 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.150
 and then we are already nothing more if 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:57.290
 we want with a flower or good 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.290
 we can put it 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.460
 and something like that remains 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.580
 and good now we go with the smell and you 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:15.470
 came back 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.610
 who really loves 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:23.330
 this 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.330
 and what I like 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:34.370
 then you do not need to take a mine 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.900
 and these shoes 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:51.970
 I know that he has taught and therefore 

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:57.040
 nothing of construction delivered this 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:08:02.310
 necklace bracelet and these earrings 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.310
 and that's why I hope you like it
