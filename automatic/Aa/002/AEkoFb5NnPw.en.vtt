00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
door properly and usually of course you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.539 
door properly and usually of course you
have<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> door<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.970> some<00:01:06.150> saw<00:01:06.390> horses<00:01:06.750> right

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
have the door on some saw horses right

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.250 
have the door on some saw horses right
so<00:01:08.549> well<00:01:08.850> we've<00:01:09.060> already<00:01:09.210> cut<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.630> door<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.869> saw

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
so well we've already cut the door I saw

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
so well we've already cut the door I saw
horses<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.070> when<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.549> install<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> right

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
horses but when you install it right

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.700 
horses but when you install it right
into<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.600> door<00:01:12.720> itself<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.229> better<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.560> have

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
into the door itself is better to have

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.520 
into the door itself is better to have
the<00:01:13.860> door<00:01:14.040> mounted<00:01:16.909> on<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.150> door<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.780> I'll

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the door mounted on the door so I'll

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.330 
the door mounted on the door so I'll
mount<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> frame<00:01:20.520> image<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:22.340> all

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
mount it up on the frame image so all

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.679 
mount it up on the frame image so all
that<00:01:23.460> way<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.759> sets<00:01:23.970> into<00:01:24.119> place<00:01:24.360> properly

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
that way it sets into place properly

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.010 
that way it sets into place properly
okay<00:01:25.380> yeah<00:01:25.830> grab<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.759> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> seats<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
okay yeah grab the kind of seats it a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
okay yeah grab the kind of seats it a
little<00:01:28.350> bit<00:01:28.500> better<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.579> that's<00:01:29.700> why<00:01:29.820> you're

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
little bit better so that's why you're

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.240 
little bit better so that's why you're
the<00:01:30.060> expert

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.130 

these<00:01:38.759> frames<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.180> come<00:01:39.390> from<00:01:39.570> Beechcraft

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
these frames they come from Beechcraft

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.990 
these frames they come from Beechcraft
and<00:01:40.439> they're<00:01:40.560> actually<00:01:41.340> designed<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.820> hold

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and they're actually designed to hold

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.280 
and they're actually designed to hold
glass<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.659> later<00:01:43.009> we<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.040> built<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.549> pet<00:01:44.729> door

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
glass and later we just built a pet door

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.130 
glass and later we just built a pet door
simulating<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> thickness<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.890> glass

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.289 

assuming<00:01:51.140> it's<00:01:51.229> almost<00:01:51.380> like<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.590> window<00:01:51.920> frame

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
assuming it's almost like a window frame

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.789 
assuming it's almost like a window frame
right<00:01:53.299> yeah<00:01:53.720> it's<00:01:54.049> a<00:01:54.650> window<00:01:54.920> frame<00:01:55.130> for<00:01:55.369> doors

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
right yeah it's a window frame for doors

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.170 
right yeah it's a window frame for doors
now<00:01:57.799> when<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:57.950> install<00:01:58.250> my<00:01:58.400> pet<00:01:58.610> door<00:01:58.790> I<00:01:58.820> didn't

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
doesn't leak at all is it absolutely

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.210 
doesn't leak at all is it absolutely
necessary<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:03.890> seal<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:04.430> outside<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.890> part
