00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:08.500 

and<00:00:04.799> we<00:00:04.890> chose<00:00:05.160> this<00:00:05.609> particular<00:00:05.819> molding<00:00:07.370> for

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
and we chose this particular molding for

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.049 
and we chose this particular molding for
the<00:00:09.510> course<00:00:09.780> because<00:00:10.650> actually<00:00:11.219> it's<00:00:11.400> quite<00:00:11.639> a

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
the course because actually it's quite a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.109 
the course because actually it's quite a
difficult<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.019> guild<00:00:13.820> overall<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:17.119> here

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
difficult one to guild overall and here

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.769 
difficult one to guild overall and here
is<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.690> little<00:00:19.560> piece<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.070> hopefully

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
is a little piece of it and hopefully

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.500 
is a little piece of it and hopefully
you<00:00:21.779> can<00:00:21.960> see<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> profile<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.240> reason

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
you can see the profile and the reason

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.390 
you can see the profile and the reason
it's<00:00:24.630> difficult<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.080> go<00:00:25.230> guild<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:26.070> if<00:00:26.220> we

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
it's difficult to go guild is if we

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400 
it's difficult to go guild is if we
tried<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.699> put<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:27.029> leaf<00:00:27.269> right<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.050> way<00:00:28.170> across

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
tried to put a leaf right the way across

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.830 
tried to put a leaf right the way across
the<00:00:28.680> whole<00:00:28.710> thing<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.970> would<00:00:30.210> what's<00:00:30.570> called

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the whole thing it would what's called

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.220 
the whole thing it would what's called
bridge<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.980> would<00:00:32.130> stick<00:00:32.520> there<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:34.110> would

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
bridge it would stick there and it would

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.920 
bridge it would stick there and it would
stick<00:00:34.530> there<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.579> then<00:00:35.820> as<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.239> tried<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.690> suck

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
stick there and then as it tried to suck

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
stick there and then as it tried to suck
itself<00:00:37.200> down<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> gilding<00:00:38.399> water<00:00:38.640> it

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
itself down on to the gilding water it

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.940 
itself down on to the gilding water it
would<00:00:39.390> just<00:00:39.570> break<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.440> way<00:00:40.559> along<00:00:40.890> here

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
would just break all the way along here

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.209 
would just break all the way along here
and<00:00:41.489> that's<00:00:41.879> called<00:00:42.120> bridging<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.829> way<00:00:43.980> we

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
and that's called bridging so the way we

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.670 
and that's called bridging so the way we
need<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.149> inlays<00:00:45.660> what<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.469> call

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
need to do this is inlays what they call

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.100 
need to do this is inlays what they call
leis<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.210> we're<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.629> gild<00:00:48.930> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
leis and we're going to gild this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.740 
leis and we're going to gild this
molding<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.620> three<00:00:49.950> different<00:00:50.190> sections<00:00:51.030> war

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
molding in three different sections war

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.430 
molding in three different sections war
lays<00:00:52.050> three<00:00:52.920> different<00:00:53.280> layers<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.440> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
lays three different layers and the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
lays three different layers and the
first<00:00:55.710> will<00:00:56.070> be<00:00:56.100> from<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:57.260> point<00:00:59.420> just<00:01:00.420> over

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
first will be from that point just over

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.950 
first will be from that point just over
the<00:01:01.020> domed<00:01:01.289> top<00:01:01.879> down<00:01:02.879> over<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> site<00:01:03.690> edge

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the domed top down over the site edge

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.830 
the domed top down over the site edge
and<00:01:04.610> into<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> inside<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.390> site<00:01:06.600> edge

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and into the inside of the site edge

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.960 
and into the inside of the site edge
there<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.890> second<00:01:08.340> will<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.610> large

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
there the second will be the large

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.899 
there the second will be the large
central<00:01:09.630> section<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> dome<00:01:10.680> into<00:01:11.520> this

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
central section of the dome into this

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.350 
central section of the dome into this
groove<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:14.220> then<00:01:14.430> finally<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> back

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
groove here and then finally the back

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.109 
groove here and then finally the back
and<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:16.140> bead<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> back<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.250> over<00:01:17.939> down

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and that bead on the back and over down

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.780 
and that bead on the back and over down
to<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> base<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> molding<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:20.310> what<00:01:20.640> we

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
to the base of the molding so what we

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.230 
to the base of the molding so what we
need<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:22.080> we<00:01:22.350> need<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.650> estimate<00:01:23.240> how

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
need to do is we need to estimate how

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.990 
need to do is we need to estimate how
much<00:01:24.540> leaf<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:26.040> use<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.759> each<00:01:26.939> leg<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.229> I

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
much leaf to use on each leg and I

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.080 
much leaf to use on each leg and I
reckon<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.810> central<00:01:31.380> lay<00:01:32.159> will<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.790> half

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
reckon that the central lay will be half

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.870 
reckon that the central lay will be half
a<00:01:33.329> leaf<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.040> each<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> others<00:01:35.610> will<00:01:35.820> be

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
a leaf and each of the others will be

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.670 
a leaf and each of the others will be
about<00:01:36.180> quarter

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
about quarter

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.360 
about quarter
so<00:01:38.340> what<00:01:38.760> I'm<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.120> to<00:01:39.180> show<00:01:39.480> you<00:01:40.670> is

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
so what I'm going to show you is

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.150 
so what I'm going to show you is
splitting<00:01:44.370> our<00:01:44.700> leaf<00:01:45.000> into<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.810> half<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.560> two

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
splitting our leaf into a half and two

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.140 
splitting our leaf into a half and two
quarters<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:50.610> now<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.750> our<00:01:52.050> cushion<00:01:52.530> I

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
quarters and so now on our cushion I

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.850 
quarters and so now on our cushion I
mean<00:01:54.150> it<00:01:54.330> first<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:55.050> lay<00:01:55.440> my<00:01:55.680> knife

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
mean it first of all lay my knife

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.390 
mean it first of all lay my knife
straight<00:01:56.520> across<00:01:56.940> flat<00:01:57.980> flat<00:01:58.980> across<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
straight across flat flat across the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.030 
straight across flat flat across the
leaf<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.940> halfway<00:02:00.150> point<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.380> then<00:02:01.710> in

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
leaf at halfway point and then in

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.770 
leaf at halfway point and then in
contact<00:02:02.640> with<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.910> leaf<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> cushion

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
contact with the leaf and the cushion

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.410 
contact with the leaf and the cushion
all<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.650> way<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.190> reasonable<00:02:06.120> amount<00:02:06.270> of

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
all the way and a reasonable amount of

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.480 
all the way and a reasonable amount of
pressure<00:02:06.690> I'm<00:02:07.620> just<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.190> soar

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
pressure I'm just going to soar

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.040 
pressure I'm just going to soar
backwards<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.420> forwards<00:02:09.869> few<00:02:10.649> times

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
backwards and forwards few times

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.320 
backwards and forwards few times
carefully<00:02:13.050> lift<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.380> knife<00:02:13.620> off<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.330> then

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
carefully lift the knife off and then

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:27.770 
carefully lift the knife off and then
repeat<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:19.080> my<00:02:19.670> two<00:02:20.670> quarter<00:02:21.300> leaves<00:02:21.510> there

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.380 

and<00:02:28.290> I've<00:02:28.410> now<00:02:28.620> cut<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.190> leaf<00:02:29.610> in<00:02:29.910> two<00:02:30.120> places

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
and I've now cut the leaf in two places

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.590 
and I've now cut the leaf in two places
giving<00:02:30.780> me<00:02:31.380> three<00:02:31.710> different<00:02:33.200> bits<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.380> God
