00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 you've always dreamed of playing your 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.350
 ps4 with your friends online without ever 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.629
 nothing paid 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.460
 well today it is possible and me 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.230
 greet everyone it's 97 and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.860
 today we meet for a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.330
 new video 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.620
 and yes as you could see in 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.880
 the small feature but also with the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.289
 little introduction that comes from 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.340
 precede today I'm going to you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.920
 show how you are going to play in 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.320
 online for free on ps4 and also 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.779
 also enjoy ps games more 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.039
 available during the month you go 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.750
 carry out the manipulation that I'm going 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.949
 show you today so everything 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.570
 first you are on your account 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.579
 main you will go in 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.870
 the settings of your ps4 console 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.600
 when I come back quickly enough 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.620
 because the tutorial and earlier he is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.270
 fast so I will try to make a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.300
 pretty fast video so you go in 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.860
 your playstation settings on your 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.340
 main account the tale with which 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.780
 you will play 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.030
 then you go on playstation 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.680
 network account management then you 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.140
 go click activate as 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.449
 main psk is normally your 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.340
 account should should be disabled 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.000
 so you leave it disabled it's 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.309
 complitly normal 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.530
 you put if it's not done your 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.100
 account in a secondary like what the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.000
 ps4 is not principal for this account 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.950
 Then once this servier 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.659
 manipulation you will disconnect 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.670
 of the ps4 so by holding the button 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.010
 in the middle you will do 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.470
 disconnect to avoid problems 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.170
 possible account problems 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.450
 you will then reconnect on 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.340
 a new user this time and 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.759
 you will proceed to the creation of a 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.409
 cause 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.520
 so I know this trick is already 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.430
 appeared a little while ago already 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.079
 on youtube and other forums so 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.640
 that's why I'm doing it a little late 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.020
 but hey I said to myself I'll do 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.130
 an update because people 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.290
 may think they are walking more and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.579
 if they still work there today 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.560
 is June 12 and she still walks 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.060
 very well so at their rock this video 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.189
 it's still working very well and you're going 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.240
 see him there just after so once 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.189
 you are here you click on 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.930
 register now and you go 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.610
 proceed to create an account 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.729
 selecting the country 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.689
 how to say japan so here on 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.770
 five there you 're not going very well 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.930
 understand what will happen so he 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.140
 I need you a little bit 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.000
 go severed a date of birth 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.130
 so that you are already 18 years old 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.250
 to avoid having any 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.700
 problems of a guardian's rights over 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.380
 the account 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.910
 there you just change just the date 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.500
 birth on this page where 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.230
 then click on next which is so 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.810
 the bottom logo next here so you 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.920
 go select a postal code in I 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.510
 think that's it so you have 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.290
 selected numbers you put a 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.630
 little anything 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.720
 job like me sees where to complete 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.770
 with seven digits 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.140
 here so you're going to select the 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.390
 third option here and finally you 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.130
 go fill with two three characters 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.600
 story of filling the hole and that this 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.690
 be validated then you do 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.860
 continue you have here then very step 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.320
 very important as you can the 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.540
 see bottom right on your screen is 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.760
 appeared an image of the creation of a 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.120
 gmail account yes because indeed for 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.560
 validate the how to say the fact that you 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.320
 have four days because yes this 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.120
 will be 14 days of ps subscription plus he 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.769
 you will have to go through a gmail address 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.110
 obligatorily or another address 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.060
 but an address recognized for example a 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.010
 york mail will not work where all 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.329
 other dummy the dummy addresses do not 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.079
 will not walk unfortunately so 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.670
 as you could see it downstairs at 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.500
 right I created an email address 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.280
 that I will go back now so 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.970
 free psn free bardon psn free free 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.579
 so here I tried to do something 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.930
 a relatively simple thing to remember 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.920
 because this account obviously you 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.170
 you can put it in the trash 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.430
 once the 14 days are exhausted 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.950
 you 're not going to have fun keeping a 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.200
 story that will serve us for nothing 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.910
 dot com then you go down 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:36.049
 enter a password here 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.489
 that you have returned so the word of 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.260
 doubles because obviously you have to 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.180
 type them 1 as you know the 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.470
 procedure usually you have 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.640
 then check this box to avoid 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.680
 to have to give back the password and 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.450
 the email address in this case you 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.190
 will you reconnect right after 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.510
 but normally you would not have you 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.540
 did not sign back in this account 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.459
 big next on next here you have 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.480
 so selected your username 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.980
 connection of you put what you 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.770
 want it's an account that finish at the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.050
 trash can 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.750
 tell me it's something that 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.370
 does not exist history of not having 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.260
 I really like anything and by 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.060
 luck that does not exist here you 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.860
 fill with 2.3 character that's enough 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.870
 his name and surname you tell me that you 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.950
 want a mason like you said everything 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.420
 this is a tale that will end in 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.400
 trash can 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.840
 arrived here which you will do as 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.970
 I do from the beginning you click on 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.370
 next down on all the pages that 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.890
 are going to follow so next 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.630
 still following normally we will arrive 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.670
 here you go on the right one and 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.220
 so who how to say valid that you 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.050
 accept the charters of de sony douce 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.790
 before you know what I'm talking about 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.560
 you wait then during the 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.540
 loading the sending of the mail 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.070
 then you will then go back on 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.190
 your e-mail box that you have 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.480
 previously created so as you the 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.980
 see at the bottom right of your screen 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.900
 like and as I could do it all at 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.580
 the time on gmail so now you 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.470
 see a playstation network mail 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.860
 so from the one led then click 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.840
 above 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.310
 it will redirect you here you click 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.560
 on the blue button here central you 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.700
 can not miss it that validates your 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.110
 count once you clicked 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.850
 above you'll see this is your 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.290
 Saturday it clearly tells you 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.100
 account is now connected a psn 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.600
 fruit trick stuff 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.150
 you then have to be able to close this 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.370
 page and so we go back to the ps4 you 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.770
 go click on the bottom tab which 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.630
 says I validate that I have attested well the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.070
 account verification you wait 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.510
 while his load 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.050
 so you see you have an envelope 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.370
 who certifies that you have 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.780
 validate the account we still make you 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.910
 next to change to not change 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.230
 here so you refuse to connect 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.110
 to facebook you do not have that to do 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.850
 we do not know the purpose of the video so 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.230
 you can of course after 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.430
 delete your email address you 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.710
 are not where he kept one's even 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.570
 a tip you have not keep a 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.190
 dummy address once you are here 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.840
 you click again on next 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.919
 because it's not good it's not this 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.290
 page there that will interest us 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.970
 it's really this one will not have you 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.230
 miss here one you click on the one who 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.510
 appeared roughly in the middle you 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.030
 can not miss the 14th so it's the 14th 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.720
 to read 14- year trial an essay or 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.520
 simply click on it 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.200
 here you click on the right one 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.640
 so you do not do anything you just have 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.410
 to click on x once you're there 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.150
 so it's to proceed to the payment 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.060
 when you see it's an excess of zero 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.080
 in the yen so it costs us nothing here 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.670
 so that's okay it tells you that you are 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.530
 now ps more so you go 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.260
 enjoy the benefits or click 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:16.090
 on okay and the very important then 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.620
 this is the step do not miss 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.250
 tutorial because otherwise you have you are 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.830
 good to redo everything 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.570

 activate your account with which you 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.580
 did the manipulation for this
