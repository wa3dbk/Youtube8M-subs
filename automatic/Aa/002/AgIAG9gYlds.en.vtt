00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.349 
file server HTTP seeing at one and this
is<00:00:19.859> like<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> BMC<00:00:20.430> as<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.939> see<00:00:21.119> here

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.990 

you<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.380> at<00:00:25.529> first<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.830> was<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.820> run

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
you know at first I was going to run

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.820 
you know at first I was going to run
openSUSE<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:27.900> which<00:00:28.109> didn't<00:00:28.500> quite<00:00:28.650> work

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
openSUSE on here which didn't quite work

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.890 
openSUSE on here which didn't quite work
out<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.640> mentioned<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> previous<00:00:30.449> video

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
out as I mentioned in the previous video

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.709 
out as I mentioned in the previous video
and<00:00:31.399> then<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.430> tried<00:00:32.730> Linux<00:00:33.059> Mint<00:00:33.210> which<00:00:33.480> works

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
and then I tried Linux Mint which works

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.139 
and then I tried Linux Mint which works
pretty<00:00:33.989> much<00:00:34.190> perfectly<00:00:35.190> aside<00:00:35.880> from<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
pretty much perfectly aside from the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.740 
pretty much perfectly aside from the
fact<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.450> XBMC<00:00:37.290> was<00:00:37.680> very<00:00:37.980> laggy<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.750> slow

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
fact that XBMC was very laggy and slow

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.650 
fact that XBMC was very laggy and slow
and<00:00:40.050> stuff<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.489> decided<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.940> give<00:00:42.270> open<00:00:42.570> e

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and stuff so I decided to give open e

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.180 
and stuff so I decided to give open e
like<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> shot<00:00:43.140> which<00:00:43.350> stands<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:44.040> open

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
like a shot which stands for open

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.439 
like a shot which stands for open
embedded<00:00:47.190> Linux<00:00:47.960> entertainment<00:00:48.960> center<00:00:49.230> so

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
embedded Linux entertainment center so

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.369 
embedded Linux entertainment center so
this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.600> distribution<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.230> running

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
this is distribution that I'm running

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.049 
this is distribution that I'm running
right<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> latest<00:00:53.370> version<00:00:53.489> which

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
right now it's the latest version which

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.430 
right now it's the latest version which
has<00:00:54.420> XBMC<00:00:54.870> 13.1<00:00:55.620> Gotham<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
has XBMC 13.1 Gotham on it and that is

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.990 
has XBMC 13.1 Gotham on it and that is
what<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.620> looks<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.070> regular<00:00:59.460> XBMC

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
what it looks like just regular XBMC

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.810 
what it looks like just regular XBMC
really<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:01.559> doesn't<00:01:01.710> boot<00:01:01.890> into<00:01:02.129> your<00:01:02.250> next<00:01:02.399> 11

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
really it doesn't boot into your next 11

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.899 
really it doesn't boot into your next 11
desktop<00:01:03.739> for<00:01:04.739> instance<00:01:05.040> KDE<00:01:05.489> or<00:01:05.790> no<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.860> xfce

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
desktop for instance KDE or no more xfce

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.410 
desktop for instance KDE or no more xfce
lxd<00:01:08.939> whatever<00:01:09.500> just<00:01:10.500> boots<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:11.040> -<00:01:11.159> no<00:01:11.880> XBMC

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
lxd whatever just boots in - no XBMC

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.510 
lxd whatever just boots in - no XBMC
here<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.049> doesn't<00:01:13.080> need<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> load<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.040> x11

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
here so it doesn't need to load the x11

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
here so it doesn't need to load the x11
stuff<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> background<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.380> can<00:01:16.500> boot

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
stuff on the background so it can boot

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.370 
stuff on the background so it can boot
immediately<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.880> XBMC<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:18.990> means<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> have

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
immediately to XBMC which means you have

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.620 
immediately to XBMC which means you have
a<00:01:19.409> lot<00:01:19.590> more<00:01:19.619> resources<00:01:20.210> left<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.509> can

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
a lot more resources left so it can

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.350 
a lot more resources left so it can
actually<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.200> stuff<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.680> here<00:01:22.909> it's<00:01:23.909> perfectly

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
actually do stuff on here it's perfectly

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.730 
actually do stuff on here it's perfectly
smooth<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.020> fast<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.409> I've<00:01:25.530> ever<00:01:25.650> seen

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
smooth it's as fast as I've ever seen

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.920 
smooth it's as fast as I've ever seen
XBMC<00:01:26.340> on<00:01:27.290> Linux<00:01:28.290> at<00:01:28.380> least<00:01:29.450> it's<00:01:30.450> very<00:01:30.630> easy<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
XBMC on Linux at least it's very easy to

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.890 
XBMC on Linux at least it's very easy to
set<00:01:31.110> up<00:01:31.670> make<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> separate<00:01:33.060> video<00:01:33.210> on<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.659> but

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
set up make a separate video on that but

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.660 
set up make a separate video on that but
you<00:01:33.960> know<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.350> gonna<00:01:34.530> take<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.189> really

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
you know I'm just gonna take a really

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
you know I'm just gonna take a really
quick<00:01:35.880> tour<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.150> my<00:01:36.659> settings<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:39.439> it's

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
quick tour of my settings here so it's

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.990 
quick tour of my settings here so it's
hooked<00:01:40.799> up<00:01:40.920> through<00:01:41.009> Ethernet<00:01:41.460> Gigabit<00:01:41.490> of

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
hooked up through Ethernet Gigabit of

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.100 
hooked up through Ethernet Gigabit of
course<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:44.240> have<00:01:45.240> somebody<00:01:45.479> named<00:01:45.810> second

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
course I have somebody named second

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.300 
course I have somebody named second
actually<00:01:46.229> shared<00:01:46.560> files<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
actually shared files that are on the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.010 
actually shared files that are on the
one<00:01:47.430> terabyte<00:01:47.700> drive<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.210> there<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.899> my

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
one terabyte drive in there to my

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.450 
one terabyte drive in there to my
network<00:01:49.200> so<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> could<00:01:49.649> actually<00:01:49.710> open<00:01:50.009> some<00:01:50.340> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
network so I could actually open some of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.550 
network so I could actually open some of
my<00:01:50.579> files<00:01:50.820> because<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.079> media<00:01:52.259> that's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560

is<00:02:23.700> really<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.060> good<00:02:24.330> way<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:25.500> show<00:02:25.709> it's<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.459> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
is really a good way to show it's just a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.119 
is really a good way to show it's just a
matter<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.420> minutes<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:28.080> get<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.650> thing<00:02:28.890> set

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
matter of minutes to get this thing set

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.920 
matter of minutes to get this thing set
up<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.519> get<00:02:30.090> open<00:02:30.180> you're<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.540> running<00:02:30.690> on

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
up and get open you're like running on

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.080 
up and get open you're like running on
pretty<00:02:31.110> much<00:02:31.200> any<00:02:31.380> PC<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.400> then<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.880> some

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
pretty much any PC and then I have some

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.880 
pretty much any PC and then I have some
very<00:02:33.330> exotic<00:02:33.569> hardware<00:02:34.170> laying<00:02:34.349> around<00:02:34.500> here

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
very exotic hardware laying around here

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.380 
very exotic hardware laying around here
with<00:02:35.780> uli<00:02:36.780> chipsets<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.670> Ally<00:02:38.940> Ethernet

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
with uli chipsets and you Ally Ethernet

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.880 
with uli chipsets and you Ally Ethernet
and<00:02:39.720> stuff<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.049> other<00:02:40.200> work<00:02:40.440> this<00:02:40.680> stuff

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
and stuff in other work this stuff

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.229 
and stuff in other work this stuff
worked<00:02:41.130> out<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.519> box<00:02:41.700> with<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.000> open<00:02:42.180> e

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
worked out of the box with the open e

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.580 
worked out of the box with the open e
like<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.450> said<00:02:42.569> it<00:02:42.660> was<00:02:42.780> really<00:02:43.049> really<00:02:43.260> amazing

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
like I said it was really really amazing

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.759 
like I said it was really really amazing
I<00:02:43.950> never<00:02:44.430> expected<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:44.879> to<00:02:45.060> work<00:02:45.209> because

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
I never expected that to work because

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.050 
I never expected that to work because
Windows<00:02:46.769> has<00:02:46.950> difficulties<00:02:47.489> with<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.790> and

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
Windows has difficulties with that and

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.430 
Windows has difficulties with that and
most<00:02:48.330> other<00:02:48.569> Linux<00:02:48.780> distributions<00:02:49.260> with<00:02:49.349> you

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
most other Linux distributions with you

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.970 
most other Linux distributions with you
as<00:02:49.560> well

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
as well

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.600 
as well
so<00:02:50.880> no<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.660> pretty<00:02:51.870> cool<00:02:52.400> let's<00:02:53.400> say<00:02:53.489> you

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
so no it's pretty cool let's say you

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.589 
so no it's pretty cool let's say you
might<00:02:53.730> want<00:02:53.880> to<00:02:53.910> see<00:02:54.030> this<00:02:54.120> stuff<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.450> action

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
might want to see this stuff in action

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.309 
might want to see this stuff in action
here<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.739> if<00:02:55.860> my<00:02:56.010> weather<00:02:56.190> set<00:02:56.489> up<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:57.319> actually

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
here so if my weather set up so actually

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.870 
here so if my weather set up so actually
see<00:02:58.530> what<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.099> weather<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.370> like<00:02:59.489> what's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
see what the weather is like what's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.020 
see what the weather is like what's
going<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.180> be<00:03:00.950> it<00:03:01.950> says<00:03:02.160> it's<00:03:02.340> 22<00:03:02.730> degrees

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
going to be it says it's 22 degrees

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.940 
going to be it says it's 22 degrees
outside<00:03:03.260> well<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.349> guess<00:03:04.500> that's<00:03:04.709> fairly

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
outside well I guess that's fairly

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.069 
outside well I guess that's fairly
accurate<00:03:05.160> that's<00:03:05.610> about<00:03:05.880> it<00:03:06.120> eighty-eight

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
accurate that's about it eighty-eight

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.039 
accurate that's about it eighty-eight
percent<00:03:07.230> humidity<00:03:07.650> yep<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.970> have<00:03:09.060> some<00:03:09.299> quite

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
percent humidity yep we have some quite

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.020 
percent humidity yep we have some quite
some<00:03:10.230> well<00:03:11.040> we've<00:03:11.190> had<00:03:11.340> some<00:03:11.400> thunderstorms

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
some well we've had some thunderstorms

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.229 
some well we've had some thunderstorms
around<00:03:12.209> here<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:13.880> clock<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.030> set

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
around here so a clock is set

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.150 
around here so a clock is set
incorrectly<00:03:15.660> have<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.410> change<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.769> timezone

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
incorrectly have to change the timezone

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.330 
incorrectly have to change the timezone
but<00:03:17.430> because<00:03:18.420> it's<00:03:18.569> in<00:03:18.720> fact<00:03:18.930> not<00:03:19.190> 1847<00:03:20.190> with

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
but because it's in fact not 1847 with

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.080 
but because it's in fact not 1847 with
these<00:03:20.549> 20:47<00:03:22.340> that's<00:03:23.340> all<00:03:23.489> fine<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:23.760> dandy<00:03:24.859> so

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
these 20:47 that's all fine and dandy so

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.979 
these 20:47 that's all fine and dandy so
let's<00:03:27.090> just<00:03:27.299> get<00:03:28.109> some<00:03:28.319> stuff<00:03:28.560> rolling<00:03:28.859> here<00:03:29.160> I

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
let's just get some stuff rolling here I

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.660 
let's just get some stuff rolling here I
have<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.049> music<00:03:31.380> library<00:03:31.560> I<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.549> to

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
have a music library I just have to

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.690 
have a music library I just have to
browse<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.239> my<00:03:33.269> discs<00:03:33.959> here<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:35.100> then<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.489> go<00:03:35.670> to

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
browse to my discs here and then I go to

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.670 
browse to my discs here and then I go to
my<00:03:36.329> music<00:03:37.319> folder

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
my music folder

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.460 
my music folder
I<00:03:41.299> haven't<00:03:42.299> actually<00:03:42.480> opened<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:43.019> music<00:03:43.200> folder

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
I haven't actually opened a music folder

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.819 
I haven't actually opened a music folder
yet<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.160> just<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:45.620> get<00:03:46.620> all<00:03:46.739> the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
yet so it's just going to get all the

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:54.140 
yet so it's just going to get all the
media<00:03:47.160> in<00:03:47.790> there<00:03:51.829> as<00:03:52.829> you<00:03:52.920> can<00:03:52.980> see<00:03:53.069> smooth<00:03:54.030> as

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
media in there as you can see smooth as

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.890 
media in there as you can see smooth as
butter

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.290 

it<00:04:02.900> all<00:04:03.050> works<00:04:03.320> as<00:04:03.530> well<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:07.030> believe<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.240> don't

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
it all works as well I believe I don't

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.330 
it all works as well I believe I don't
have<00:04:08.630> a<00:04:08.660> sound<00:04:09.200> hooked<00:04:09.500> up<00:04:09.650> at<00:04:09.800> the<00:04:09.830> moment<00:04:10.250> so

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
have a sound hooked up at the moment so

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.520 
have a sound hooked up at the moment so
I'll<00:04:10.460> just<00:04:10.640> hit<00:04:11.120> pause<00:04:13.030> and<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.660> have<00:04:15.110> in<00:04:15.290> fact

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
I'll just hit pause and I have in fact

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.590 
I'll just hit pause and I have in fact
not<00:04:15.800> plugged<00:04:16.160> in<00:04:16.310> the<00:04:16.640> three<00:04:16.970> nine<00:04:17.150> millimeter

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
not plugged in the three nine millimeter

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.490 
not plugged in the three nine millimeter
jack<00:04:17.870> I<00:04:19.120> am<00:04:20.120> very<00:04:20.359> smart<00:04:20.450> sometimes<00:04:20.900> yeah

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500
