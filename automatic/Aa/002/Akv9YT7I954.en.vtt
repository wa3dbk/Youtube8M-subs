 Thank you all for having me 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.410

 2014 to wish you a happy year 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.970
 new and to be able to exchange an idea like 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.160
 It was my year as things changed to 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.990
 me and to do a retrospective of 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.970
 everything that happened this year in 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.800
 sony channel play but my personal life 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.869
 goal like that in my life 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.669
 in total with the channel I have some 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.160
 Good things to talk to you. 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.989
 guys it's last year 2013 I made one 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.550
 video similar to this including everything 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.739
 same room I recorded that video 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.739
 and at the end of 2013 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.410
 in the new year 2013 to 2014 I had 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.809
 little more than 28 thousand subscribers did not have 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.190
 nor have 30 thousand registered students and I 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.960
 had this goal of having closed the year 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.640
 passed with 30 subscribers unfortunately 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.039
 I could not keep up, I got a little 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.320
 bored at the time by that but things 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.949
 they improved very much, I thought. 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.239
 that in 2014 I got to know there 50,000 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.060
 subscribed was very 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.250
 today we are there with 330 thousand subscribers 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.060
 each more than 330 thousand registered 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.220
 and it is an absurd number of absurd cases 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.100
 never grow 300 thousand enrolled 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.619
 It's a lot now a lot of people who 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.200
 deposited their trust depositing 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.210

 I would like to follow because I know that

 there are a lot of people that follow in the channel 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.049
 but the inscribed then from the moment 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.640
 that you click the subscribe button if 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.140
 it means that you enjoy a channel and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.420
 wants to continue following 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.740
 it is clear that some deficiencies in the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.360
 youtube system 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.040
 not everyone can receive my 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.170
 videos in the box even so we 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.390
 He managed to build this year a base 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.170
 very cool that the guys from the brand new 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.399
 play series 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.259
 the guys who will always watch the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.630

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.270
 If you want to see the hyacinth video click on the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.409
 give this support that is essential for me 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.570
 It's a lot of work to do this here. 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.670
 It's really only for you, it's very 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.920
 gratifying in that toss of the valley to 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.689
 Worth it or not and everything else you throw 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.580
 a video that has been there and fucking that 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.750
 has many comments now supports you 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.460
 worth it 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.230
 worth any effort 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.460
 It is dawn that you stayed awake by editing 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.440
 videos for you 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.600
 It's like when you hurt yourself 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.610
 fucking but it has a good purpose in 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.200
 end is you start ignoring the parts 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.060
 So that's why I'm very 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.790
 Thank you all for joining me. 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.790
 This year, as I told you, you see in the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.710
 end of 2013 I had 28 thousand subscribers 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.200
 I left my job to focus on 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.420
 Youtube did not have a job, did you 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.280
 a fixed monthly income was sure to 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.710
 at the end of the month that payment will 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.050
 fall for me and it was a solid mess right 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.490
 my solid memory job was badly received 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.560
 but I was sure that money 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.030
 at the end of the month and I bet youtube 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.870
 and I do not even want $ 20 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.880
 a month 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.100
 played very little and all the people who 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.290
 gay when investing in the channel has always been 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.420
 so it's always good that youtube does not 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.330
 they invested in the channel and it was very 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.890
 guys gave me some kind of gimmick I was not 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.230
 a bad bank would be that he did not know 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.240
 certain but not certain I would always prefer 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.340
 I had this philosophy that I'd better 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.080
 to regret something that I did is not for 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.000
 The less I tried to make it work. 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.650
 than to regret not having done 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.260
 alignment was to have failed to achieve 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.180
 seek what you crave so much and I 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.340
 I came back old all I could in my 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.080
 channel I invested all my time and all 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.000
 My dedication to leaving my job 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.250
 So I can make a video for you here. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.930
 on youtube and it worked very well if it is 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.730
 very sure I did not regret this moment 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.010
 some of you have done it if I could 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.470
 I would do it all again, because today in 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.570
 youtube day the job was that I 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.940
 Like fucking turned reality into 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.040
 youtube nowadays it's my job I 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.020
 I grew a lot as a person during this 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.210
 time the public call does not go down much 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.560
 People, everyone, everyone. 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.420
 changed I'm going to change 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.550
 of course we assemble the diploma 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.960
 good aspects others not so much just that I 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.450
 I believe that in 2014 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.100
 mature a lot and I think for the better 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.900
 I changed for the better my life changed 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.940
 for the best I am very happy with 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.400
 that was all I got this year 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.010
 the index increased my work is me 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.320
 live for my work 24 hours 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.850
 day and another dedicated to my channel in 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.920
 All I do is everything I think 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.750
 every moment of my day I am 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.370
 focused on the n play channel forever 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.870
 better for you, I always want to 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.609
 also 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.930
 for those enrolled I believe that 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.940
 I'm getting it but it's not 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.280
 alone it was thanks to all the support that 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.790
 you give me was there are over 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.220
 330 thousand subscribers is a very high number 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.620
 in my goal was to close 2014 with 100 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.680
 A thousand I could triple this I 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.380
 I hope that in 2015 it will be much more 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.270
 Because I thought I could not here 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.669
 reaching 15 thousand subscribers is a goal that 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.960
 I had I managed to overcome this and the 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.820
 from the moment that it exceeds this 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.040
 mark of the subscribers I was sure 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.750
 that I can conquer much lighter 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.460
 and that's what I'm going to work I have 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.020
 goals in my life I chase after 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.600
 that they go right but we always 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.160
 focus on something and not back then runs 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.289
 always chasing afterwards to win the 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.240
