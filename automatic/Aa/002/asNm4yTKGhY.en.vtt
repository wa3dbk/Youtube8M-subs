00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.100
 Hello everyone guys with you I'm an angel killer 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.390
 and we have another release of the program 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.280
 Brothers in Arms 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.620
 today I would like to show you the fight 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.730
 which we played in platoon consisting 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.770
 from two bulldogs and 1 ru 251 platoon from 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.710
 These machines are very fast causes a lot 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.590
 damage and very fun we hit the map 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.410
 nsk to eighth ninth level and start 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.960
 the battle before us there was a question where are we 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.750
 go on lt not to merge and drag 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.550
 fight in the city of course you will not go there 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.340
 will fight tt tank these 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.780
 shooting with them is not the best ideas 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 could go to Zelenka 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.399
 it's 8 0 vertical but then we could 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.930
 run into the devils and another 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.510
 some non-top machines 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.820
 so our choice fell on the railway. and partially 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.190
 the city namely play through the fourth and 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.500
 the sixth line is very often in the random 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.960
 there empty pay little attention and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.520
 underestimate these positions and because from there 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.520
 can be good to drag battles 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.460
 quickly drove up to the g5 square I tried 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.960
 highlight the passing tanks to 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.300
 someone shot them boards 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.000
 I saw the virginity riding on Zelenka but 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.420
 did not have time to make a shot lit up in 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.550
 for zhku 111 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.350
 here we have it now and made 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.150
 a small mistake got damage from 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.880
 enemy rigging and did not give anything in return 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.940
 but my sovlezvodny on bulldog 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.270
 We managed to punch him a couple of times that that's 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.820
 stand to the left just the same from me here 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.550
 datura tried to give damage to t 34 but 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.350
 I realized that it was to no avail noted that 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.140
 no one shines the very first d platforms 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.660
 which is very important and moved to saw her 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.850
 him and decided that to fight him forehead forehead 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.700
 this is not the best idea and no longer became 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.460
 leave him here my sovzvvodnye 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.640
 who were partially in the city further 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.130
 Eun su that enemy tanks are being forced 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.950
 diagonally d2 d3 and we decided to help 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.380
 our towers and began their constriction 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.170
 I moved forward a little and occupied the bushes 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.180
 started shooting at t 34 and chery 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.080
 Kurupt my sovzvvodnyh became for me and 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.849
 also tried to give damage right now you 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.860
 see how we target them but not 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.080
 We fall because in the center of the area 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.630
 there is a fountain through which not always 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:28.390
 shells fly here we saw 9 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.610
 sneaker and drove off because u so very 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.330
 big alpha shoot with it this 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.640
 silly at least spend your hepe here 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.850
 it did not cost us therefore kurupt on the bulldog 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.310
 left and i started killing the skull now 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.540
 dear viewers can you notice which 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.299
 positions we took 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.340
 that is, two bulldogs that are occupied 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.989
 they did not give the first platform 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.000
 move to 29 and the lion on the greens of tyazh 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.420
 the enemy cords wanted to help their arte 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.850
 apparently but bulldogs on them completely 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.580
 cut off and I in turn helped 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.610
 our allies who are 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.769
 I shoot in the city here these here 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.040
 positions we have taken now you will see everything 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.560
 and at this moment to 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.849
 experience and fights my sovzvodnye further info 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.329
 that the enemy 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:23.629
 tt which stand on its base at all 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:27.920
 without support they meant just 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:30.790
 yet in the 111 tons 29 and the lions and we 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.769
 decided to kill them to come close to him 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:38.000
 Bulldogs went to break into their foreheads and 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:42.560
 I decided to go more arrogantly by 29 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.230
 once gave without damage the art gets to 25 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:49.370
 and here I have spotted the drying which 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.700
 stood in the defa jump immediately set 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:57.109
 me on the harp and killed and mehvod in general 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.720
 immediately you can see the pros a little commanding back and 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:04.100
 forward I still managed to call 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.140
 drying in the side and slowly shoot her 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.890
 at that moment she looked quite 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.890
 helpless 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.989
 further the bulldogs have gone on g d a l and 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.609
 I remembered that the enemy still had that 29 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.370
 who glowed most recently in 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.410
 square b1 began to move him to 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:30.710
 I got to go 2 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:32.720
 149 that very pleased saw something 29 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.850
 may well get on me and decided 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.320
 wait for the sazons on the bulldog so he 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.070
 first broke into him to distract him 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.669
 attention here you see like a bulldog 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:47.960
 our my sovzvodny breaks in to him and we 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.970
 just 1 trillion tons 29 through the loophole with 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.500
 two sides 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.280
 a long time it was not enough and soon the 20 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.289
 years and went to the hangar and the enemy 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.070
 there was still a couple of cars left and we 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:04.849
 guys rushed to them quickly 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.220
 drove up he remained them heel 49 75 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.090
 I did not break because 75 turned 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.770
 stones forehead blessing and and quickly dismantled and 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.660
 we 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.840
 focusing 9 pair distributed 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.620
 our bulldogs and I got it let's 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.870
 now let's go to the results of this battle here 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.840
 You may notice a medal of support and 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.540
 a couple of smaller awards if we open 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.910
 tab command result who notice 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.580
 that our platoon takes the top 3 and then 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.710
 as rushka one bulldog shot 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.270
 most damage on city map 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.480
 another bulldog is a little bit 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.910
 lower if you draw any conclusions on the battle 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.800
 I think it is worth noting that at the beginning of the battle 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.380
 our platoon competently chose the direction 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.900
 attacks we also pushed through 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:53.500
 enemy base and then helped our 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.480
 heavy city already finish enemy machines 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.400
