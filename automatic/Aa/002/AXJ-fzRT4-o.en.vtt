00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it up to town hall sevens as well but

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.910 
it up to town hall sevens as well but
our<00:00:41.610> goal<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.150> to<00:00:42.330> try<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.780> win<00:00:42.989> every<00:00:43.230> clan<00:00:43.650> war

0 so that's why we're at 20 verses 20

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.860 
0 so that's why we're at 20 verses 20

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
matched up against a clan that has looks

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.620 
matched up against a clan that has looks
like<00:00:58.649> nine<00:00:59.160> town<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.640> tens<00:01:01.310> eight<00:01:02.390> Town<00:01:03.390> Hall

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
might think it's a little bit of a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.460 
might think it's a little bit of a
mismatch<00:01:08.130> but<00:01:09.000> actually<00:01:09.570> let's<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.440> check

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
mismatch but actually let's go and check

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.190 
mismatch but actually let's go and check
out<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> enemy<00:01:11.100> clan<00:01:11.280> they<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.970> 117<00:01:12.960> clan

war winds that must mean they're really

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880 
war winds that must mean they're really
coordinated<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:16.140> good<00:01:16.320> attackers

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.719 
remember kind of 2 starring a base sort
of<00:01:45.690> similar<00:01:45.929> but<00:01:46.770> he<00:01:47.100> had<00:01:47.220> actually<00:01:47.369> higher

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
of similar but he had actually higher

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.370

level heroes at that time in the last
war<00:01:49.679> so<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.789> still<00:01:51.030> doable<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.200> have

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
war so it's still doable you just have

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.169 
war so it's still doable you just have
to<00:01:52.349> be<00:01:52.500> really<00:01:52.679> careful<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.399> plan<00:01:54.000> out<00:01:54.149> our

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
to be really careful be plan out our

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.210 
to be really careful be plan out our
attacks<00:01:54.660> and<00:01:54.959> you<00:01:55.679> know<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.950> where<00:01:56.069> we<00:01:56.190> go

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
attacks and you know see where we go

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.469 
attacks and you know see where we go
from<00:01:56.369> there<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.789> here's<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.090> number<00:01:57.300> two<00:01:57.450> guy

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
from there so here's the number two guy

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.900 
from there so here's the number two guy
again<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.440> heroes<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.039> to<00:01:59.280> level<00:01:59.490> 35

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
again the heroes I have to level 35

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.600 
again the heroes I have to level 35
heroes<00:02:00.330> so<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.410> theory<00:02:01.800> we<00:02:01.979> should<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.340> able<00:02:02.429> to

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
heroes so in theory we should be able to

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.910 
heroes so in theory we should be able to
get<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> two-star<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.539> as<00:02:03.720> well<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.590> just

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
get a two-star on this as well so just

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.430 
get a two-star on this as well so just
you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:05.940> when<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.509> against<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.869> clan<00:02:07.110> that

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
you know when you up against a clan that

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.430 
you know when you up against a clan that
looks<00:02:08.369> sort<00:02:09.240> of<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> mismatch<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.319> have

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
looks sort of like a mismatch you have

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.140 
looks sort of like a mismatch you have
to<00:02:10.530> really<00:02:10.679> look<00:02:10.800> at<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> bases<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.790> plan<00:02:12.030> out

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to really look at the bases and plan out

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.449 
to really look at the bases and plan out
your<00:02:12.180> attacks<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.840> just<00:02:13.680> trying<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.340> get

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
your attacks and just trying to get

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.250 
your attacks and just trying to get
overwhelmed<00:02:15.030> by<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.330> fact<00:02:15.569> that<00:02:15.840> they<00:02:15.989> want

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
overwhelmed by the fact that they want

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.050 
overwhelmed by the fact that they want
so<00:02:16.500> many<00:02:16.590> clan<00:02:16.890> wars<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.220> wish<00:02:17.370> us<00:02:17.520> luck<00:02:17.580> and

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
minion first might be out of range

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.280 
minion first might be out of range
already<00:02:54.000> but<00:02:54.330> alright<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.580> any<00:02:56.580> case<00:02:57.080> we<00:02:58.080> drop

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
already but alright in any case we drop

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.770 
already but alright in any case we drop
the<00:02:58.410> Hound<00:02:58.970> drop<00:02:59.970> some<00:03:00.180> balloons<00:03:00.600> here<00:03:02.780> here

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
the Hound drop some balloons here here

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:14.800 
the Hound drop some balloons here here
and<00:03:04.670> then<00:03:08.480> gonna<00:03:10.730> drop<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.760> rage<00:03:12.150> spell

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.050 

alright<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.140> ideally<00:03:17.040> what<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.280> want<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:17.730> that

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
alright so ideally what I want is that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.540 
alright so ideally what I want is that
dark<00:03:18.450> elixir<00:03:18.810> storage<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:20.570> then<00:03:22.010> any<00:03:23.010> gold

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
dark elixir storage and then any gold

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.730 
dark elixir storage and then any gold
storages<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.180> get<00:03:24.360> extra<00:03:25.020> would<00:03:25.200> be<00:03:25.350> great

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
storages that I get extra would be great

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.620 
storages that I get extra would be great
then<00:03:26.250> we<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.340> probably<00:03:26.640> hopefully<00:03:27.120> take<00:03:27.510> the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
then we can probably hopefully take the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.210 
then we can probably hopefully take the
Town<00:03:27.840> Hall<00:03:27.870> if<00:03:28.440> we<00:03:28.560> clear<00:03:28.830> out<00:03:28.920> all<00:03:28.950> those

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
Town Hall if we clear out all those

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.320 
Town Hall if we clear out all those
surrounding<00:03:29.580> structures<00:03:29.760> but<00:03:30.030> we<00:03:30.120> need<00:03:30.240> to

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
surrounding structures but we need to

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.760 
surrounding structures but we need to
take<00:03:30.420> out<00:03:30.570> that<00:03:30.660> single<00:03:31.050> targeting<00:03:31.440> inferno

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
take out that single targeting inferno

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.920 
take out that single targeting inferno
because<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.670> will<00:03:32.850> take<00:03:33.420> out<00:03:33.540> my<00:03:33.660> heroes

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
because that will take out my heroes

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
because that will take out my heroes
pretty<00:03:34.410> easily<00:03:34.820> let's<00:03:35.820> drop<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:37.440> archer

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
pretty easily let's drop that the archer

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.470 
pretty easily let's drop that the archer
tower<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.400> focused<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.030> ground<00:03:39.240> troops

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
tower is focused on the ground troops

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.450 
tower is focused on the ground troops
now<00:03:39.660> i<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.930> drop<00:03:40.050> my<00:03:40.230> balloons<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.890> then

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
now i can drop my balloons and then

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.130 
now i can drop my balloons and then
looks<00:03:41.730> like<00:03:41.850> we<00:03:41.940> have<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.090> clear<00:03:42.300> path<00:03:42.540> i'm

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
looks like we have a clear path i'm

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.620 
looks like we have a clear path i'm
going<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.500> drop<00:03:43.710> my<00:03:44.250> heroes<00:03:44.940> there<00:03:45.270> see<00:03:45.600> if

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
going to drop my heroes there see if

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.660 
going to drop my heroes there see if
they<00:03:45.780> run<00:03:45.930> straight<00:03:46.200> king<00:03:46.440> goes<00:03:46.590> first<00:03:46.890> Queen

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
goes next and then can hopefully get

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.590 
goes next and then can hopefully get
most<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.030> dark<00:03:51.330> elixir<00:03:53.360> alright<00:03:54.360> haven't

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
most of that dark elixir alright haven't

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.060 
most of that dark elixir alright haven't
used<00:03:54.720> my<00:03:54.810> lightning<00:03:55.140> spell<00:03:55.350> yet<00:03:55.470> luckily<00:03:55.890> he

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
used my lightning spell yet luckily he

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.380 
used my lightning spell yet luckily he
did<00:03:56.220> not<00:03:56.370> have<00:03:56.580> clan<00:03:56.940> castle<00:03:57.150> troops<00:03:59.390> there

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
did not have clan castle troops there

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.930 
did not have clan castle troops there
there<00:04:01.230> goes<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.410> dark<00:04:01.740> elixir<00:04:01.920> storage<00:04:02.460> some

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
there goes the dark elixir storage some

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.120 
there goes the dark elixir storage some
of<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.180> might<00:04:03.330> be<00:04:03.540> in<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:04.050> collectors<00:04:04.680> as<00:04:04.890> well

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
of it might be in the collectors as well

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.520 
of it might be in the collectors as well
but<00:04:05.760> hopefully<00:04:06.030> we<00:04:06.300> can<00:04:06.450> get<00:04:06.510> those<00:04:06.720> storages

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
but hopefully we can get those storages

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.750 
but hopefully we can get those storages
on<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.740> top<00:04:07.950> right<00:04:08.160> side<00:04:08.370> of<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:08.580> base

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
on the top right side of the base

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.390 
on the top right side of the base
waiting<00:04:09.510> till<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:10.110> little<00:04:10.800> bit<00:04:10.980> longer<00:04:11.160> so<00:04:11.370> I

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
waiting till a little bit longer so I

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.390 
waiting till a little bit longer so I
can<00:04:11.550> rage<00:04:11.760> my<00:04:11.970> king<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:13.770> only<00:04:13.980> reason<00:04:14.130> why<00:04:14.370> I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
can rage my king the only reason why I

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.130 
can rage my king the only reason why I
don't<00:04:14.700> reach<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.090> king<00:04:15.270> is<00:04:15.420> if<00:04:15.660> there<00:04:16.049> are

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
don't reach the king is if there are

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.470 
don't reach the king is if there are
still<00:04:16.230> Splash<00:04:16.680> Damage<00:04:16.940> defenses<00:04:17.940> or<00:04:18.090> multi

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
still Splash Damage defenses or multi

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.420 
still Splash Damage defenses or multi
targeting<00:04:18.870> infernos<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.500> know<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.950> barbarians

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
targeting infernos I know the barbarians

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.890 
targeting infernos I know the barbarians
are<00:04:20.460> going<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.670> go<00:04:20.760> down<00:04:20.910> really<00:04:21.180> quickly<00:04:21.630> so

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
are going to go down really quickly so

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.170 
are going to go down really quickly so
that's<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.410> only<00:04:22.740> reason<00:04:22.920> why<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.220> try<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:23.970> wait

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
that's the only reason why I try to wait

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.510 
that's the only reason why I try to wait
to<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.330> last<00:04:24.450> second<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.140> rage<00:04:25.890> up<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.280> king

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
to the last second to rage up the king

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.730 
to the last second to rage up the king
but<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.080> case<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.410> doesn't<00:04:28.650> really

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
but in this case it doesn't really

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.160 
but in this case it doesn't really
matter<00:04:28.890> let's<00:04:29.370> go<00:04:29.490> ahead<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.780> rage<00:04:30.780> up<00:04:30.990> the

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
matter let's go ahead and rage up the

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.280 
matter let's go ahead and rage up the
Queen<00:04:31.560> activate<00:04:32.370> her<00:04:32.520> ability<00:04:33.290> hopefully
