00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it so is it worth it well you can see

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.930 
it so is it worth it well you can see
here<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.219> speed<00:00:59.609> trigger

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
here that I have the speed trigger

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.510 
here that I have the speed trigger
although<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:00.840> isn't<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.500> useful<00:01:01.770> it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
although it really isn't that useful it

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.280 
although it really isn't that useful it
helps<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.969> little<00:01:03.210> bit<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> feel<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
helps a little bit in the feel of the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.170 
helps a little bit in the feel of the
weapon<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.830> you'll<00:01:05.010> see<00:01:05.250> how<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.549> works<00:01:05.790> when

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
weapon but you'll see how it works when

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.670 
weapon but you'll see how it works when
we<00:01:06.270> actually<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:06.720> into<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.049> gameplay<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
we actually get into the gameplay and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.000 
we actually get into the gameplay and
nothing<00:01:08.549> else<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.470> it<00:01:10.470> really<00:01:10.680> kind<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
nothing else and it really kind of

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.130 
nothing else and it really kind of
doesn't<00:01:11.220> need<00:01:11.580> very<00:01:12.060> much<00:01:12.240> else<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.840> ready

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
doesn't need very much else it's ready

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
doesn't need very much else it's ready
to<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.650> out<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> box<00:01:14.360> although<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
to go right out of the box although it

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.920 
to go right out of the box although it
could<00:01:15.630> use<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.110> little<00:01:16.259> bit<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.799> boost<00:01:17.070> but

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
could use a little bit more boost but

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.270 
could use a little bit more boost but
well<00:01:18.930> you'll<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.439> when<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:19.950> into<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
well you'll see when we get into the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.020 
well you'll see when we get into the
gameplay<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.640> here<00:01:23.640> we<00:01:23.790> are

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gameplay right now and here we are

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.690 
gameplay right now and here we are
fighting<00:01:24.810> against<00:01:25.320> low<00:01:25.500> level<00:01:25.920> infested<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
fighting against low level infested and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340 
fighting against low level infested and
the<00:01:26.909> reason<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.110> really

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the reason for this is because I really

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.539 
the reason for this is because I really
want<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> show<00:01:28.650> off<00:01:28.860> some<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> properties

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
want to show off some of the properties

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.190 
want to show off some of the properties
of<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.970> weapon<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> easiest<00:01:30.960> way

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
of this weapon this is the easiest way

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.190 
of this weapon this is the easiest way
to<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.390> there's<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.479> reason<00:01:33.780> why<00:01:33.900> i<00:01:33.930> chose

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to do it so there's a reason why i chose

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.840 
to do it so there's a reason why i chose
low<00:01:34.470> key<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:34.950> because<00:01:35.130> you'll<00:01:35.610> notice

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
low key and that's because you'll notice

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.819 
low key and that's because you'll notice
that<00:01:35.880> there's<00:01:36.150> an<00:01:36.299> enemy<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:36.780> there<00:01:36.990> i'm

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that there's an enemy right there i'm

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.690 
that there's an enemy right there i'm
going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> fire<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.400> off<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.700> now<00:01:40.700> nobody

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
going to fire it off right now nobody

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.399 
going to fire it off right now nobody
else<00:01:42.090> cared<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:43.439> didn't<00:01:43.680> hear<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> thing<00:01:45.409> you

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
else cared they didn't hear a thing you

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.469 
else cared they didn't hear a thing you

itself<00:02:01.680> only<00:02:02.219> does<00:02:02.610> 150<00:02:03.329> which<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.659> pretty

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
itself only does 150 which is pretty

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.700 
itself only does 150 which is pretty
good<00:02:04.049> but<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.130> explosion<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.469> have<00:02:07.469> no<00:02:07.680> idea

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
good but the explosion I have no idea

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.760 
good but the explosion I have no idea
how<00:02:08.009> much<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.459> does<00:02:08.640> because<00:02:09.530> there<00:02:10.530> are<00:02:10.649> no

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
how much it does because there are no

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.100 
how much it does because there are no
numbers<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.340> describe<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.420> just<00:02:12.599> see<00:02:12.840> what

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
numbers to describe it you just see what

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.670 
numbers to describe it you just see what
the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.630 
the
show<00:02:13.969> projectile<00:02:14.969> hits<00:02:15.359> for<00:02:15.689> and<00:02:15.959> so<00:02:16.640> who

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
show projectile hits for and so who

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.610 
show projectile hits for and so who
knows<00:02:17.819> it's<00:02:18.480> pretty<00:02:18.750> strong<00:02:19.019> though<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.290> can

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
knows it's pretty strong though you can

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.679 
knows it's pretty strong though you can
see<00:02:19.769> that<00:02:19.950> it's<00:02:20.099> taking<00:02:20.430> things<00:02:20.670> out<00:02:20.969> pretty

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
see that it's taking things out pretty

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.679 
see that it's taking things out pretty
regularly<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.069> let's<00:02:23.849> see<00:02:24.090> we<00:02:24.299> have<00:02:24.450> an<00:02:24.569> enemy

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
regularly so let's see we have an enemy

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.149 
regularly so let's see we have an enemy
down<00:02:24.989> there<00:02:25.260> it's<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.310> wrong<00:02:26.489> kind<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:27.060> need

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
down there it's the wrong kind I need

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:33.050 
down there it's the wrong kind I need
quite<00:02:29.159> a<00:02:29.189> few<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:31.010> chase<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.609> give<00:02:32.760> chase

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
quite a few to chase to give chase

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.490 
quite a few to chase to give chase
there's<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.769> two<00:02:35.639> chargers<00:02:36.230> if<00:02:37.230> we<00:02:37.319> could

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
there's one to two chargers if we could

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.979 
there's one to two chargers if we could
get<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:38.069> get<00:02:38.609> another<00:02:38.879> one<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.090> here<00:02:39.239> will<00:02:39.840> be

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
get it I get another one in here will be

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:51.610 
get it I get another one in here will be
useful<00:02:40.409> let's<00:02:41.310> try<00:02:41.489> not<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.849> killed

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.670 

there<00:02:52.620> we<00:02:52.800> go<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:54.540> I'm<00:02:54.840> going<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.230> place<00:02:55.440> this

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
there we go so I'm going to place this

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.810 
there we go so I'm going to place this
here<00:02:55.950> I'm<00:02:56.130> going<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.760> do<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:58.520> so<00:02:59.520> now<00:02:59.670> they're

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
here I'm going to do this so now they're

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.600 
here I'm going to do this so now they're
all<00:03:00.000> there<00:03:00.980> now<00:03:01.980> they're<00:03:02.250> not<00:03:04.610> pretty

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
all there now they're not pretty

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.880 
all there now they're not pretty
impressive<00:03:08.570> yes<00:03:09.570> there<00:03:09.900> are<00:03:10.050> some<00:03:10.320> fun<00:03:10.560> tricks

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
impressive yes there are some fun tricks

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.230 
impressive yes there are some fun tricks
that<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.070> can<00:03:11.160> do<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:11.580> if<00:03:11.670> you're<00:03:11.760> low<00:03:11.940> key<00:03:12.090> you

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
that you can do so if you're low key you

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.630 
that you can do so if you're low key you
can<00:03:12.270> use<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.810> or<00:03:13.080> if<00:03:13.710> you're<00:03:13.860> like<00:03:14.070> nicks<00:03:14.430> and

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
can use that or if you're like nicks and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.720 
can use that or if you're like nicks and
you<00:03:14.790> do<00:03:14.970> crowd<00:03:15.540> control<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:17.220> is<00:03:17.430> something

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
you do crowd control that is something

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.430 
you do crowd control that is something
else<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.150> gets<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.570> lot<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.750> enemies<00:03:19.140> all

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
else that gets a lot of enemies all

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.410 
else that gets a lot of enemies all
grouped<00:03:19.860> up<00:03:20.010> together<00:03:20.160> now<00:03:21.090> there<00:03:21.270> is<00:03:21.390> another

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
grouped up together now there is another

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.240 
grouped up together now there is another
scenario<00:03:22.050> where<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:22.440> lot<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.650> enemies<00:03:23.040> are

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
scenario where a lot of enemies are

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.160 
scenario where a lot of enemies are
grouped<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.210> in<00:03:24.450> defense<00:03:24.720> mission

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
grouped and that is in defense mission

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.930 
grouped and that is in defense mission
so<00:03:25.410> if<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.620> have<00:03:25.800> that<00:03:25.950> stasis<00:03:26.280> pod<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.850> you

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
so if you have that stasis pod and you

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.260 
so if you have that stasis pod and you
want<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.180> protect<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:28.340> you<00:03:29.340> might<00:03:29.580> think<00:03:29.880> about

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
want to protect it you might think about

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.720 
want to protect it you might think about
using<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:31.020> to<00:03:31.980> protect<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.400> using<00:03:32.700> the

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
using that to protect it using the

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.020 
using that to protect it using the
organs<00:03:33.510> but<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.080> will<00:03:34.980> say<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.160> i<00:03:35.550> think<00:03:35.880> that

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
organs but I will say this i think that

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.600 
organs but I will say this i think that
the<00:03:36.120> fire<00:03:36.330> rate<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:37.170> too<00:03:37.350> slow<00:03:37.710> now<00:03:38.550> you

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
the fire rate is just too slow now you

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.240 
the fire rate is just too slow now you
saw<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.180> had<00:03:39.270> fire<00:03:39.630> rate<00:03:39.840> increase<00:03:40.350> that

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
saw that I had fire rate increase that

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.410 
saw that I had fire rate increase that
really<00:03:41.550> is<00:03:41.820> not<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.450> main<00:03:43.290> problem<00:03:43.740> if<00:03:44.420> you

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
really is not the main problem if you

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.400 
really is not the main problem if you
listen<00:03:45.840> closely<00:03:47.660> you'll<00:03:48.660> hear<00:03:48.990> that<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.260> makes

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
listen closely you'll hear that it makes

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.580 
listen closely you'll hear that it makes
a<00:03:49.560> noise<00:03:50.780> telling<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.170> it's<00:03:52.320> it's

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
a noise telling you that it's it's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.670 
a noise telling you that it's it's
powered<00:03:53.400> up<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:55.440> noise<00:03:57.140> takes<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.350> while

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
powered up and that noise takes a while

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.880 
powered up and that noise takes a while
and<00:03:58.980> cannot<00:03:59.370> be<00:03:59.430> sped<00:03:59.850> up<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.480> is<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.960> time

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
and cannot be sped up that is the time

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.040 
and cannot be sped up that is the time
it<00:04:02.190> takes<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:04.460> in<00:04:05.460> other<00:04:05.880> words<00:04:06.180> it<00:04:06.540> just

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
it takes and so in other words it just

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.440 
it takes and so in other words it just
is<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.350> long<00:04:07.740> time<00:04:08.070> between<00:04:08.340> each<00:04:08.880> round<00:04:09.210> I'm

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
is a long time between each round I'm

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.760 
is a long time between each round I'm
firing<00:04:09.750> I'll<00:04:10.320> fire<00:04:10.620> as<00:04:10.800> fast<00:04:11.040> as<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.280> can<00:04:15.770> that

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
firing I'll fire as fast as I can that

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.800 
firing I'll fire as fast as I can that
is<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.400> speed<00:04:17.700> that<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.940> can<00:04:18.090> expect<00:04:18.420> that<00:04:18.660> is

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
is the speed that you can expect that is

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.650 
is the speed that you can expect that is
the<00:04:19.080> fastest<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.830> it<00:04:20.070> can<00:04:20.220> be<00:04:20.340> fired<00:04:20.600> now<00:04:21.600> the

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
the fastest that it can be fired now the

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.360 
the fastest that it can be fired now the
reason<00:04:21.960> why<00:04:22.170> I<00:04:22.200> have<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.590> speed<00:04:22.830> increase<00:04:23.190> on

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
reason why I have the speed increase on

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.110 
reason why I have the speed increase on
there<00:04:23.520> is<00:04:23.670> because<00:04:23.880> if<00:04:24.770> you<00:04:25.770> click<00:04:26.450> too<00:04:27.450> soon

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
there is because if you click too soon

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.190 
there is because if you click too soon

useful<00:06:40.259> I<00:06:40.499> think<00:06:41.159> that<00:06:41.490> I<00:06:42.740> think<00:06:43.740> that<00:06:44.039> it<00:06:44.309> has

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
useful I think that I think that it has

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.269 
useful I think that I think that it has
potential<00:06:44.990> although<00:06:45.990> the<00:06:46.289> slow<00:06:46.620> firing<00:06:47.069> rate

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:47.279 
potential although the slow firing rate

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:49.699 
potential although the slow firing rate
that<00:06:47.639> cannot<00:06:48.029> be<00:06:48.089> sped<00:06:48.479> up<00:06:48.509> is<00:06:49.169> going<00:06:49.529> to<00:06:49.620> be

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:49.709 
that cannot be sped up is going to be

00:06:49.709 --> 00:06:51.049 
that cannot be sped up is going to be
the<00:06:49.830> biggest<00:06:50.009> drawback<00:06:50.490> but<00:06:50.729> when<00:06:50.909> you're<00:06:51.029> in

00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:51.059 
the biggest drawback but when you're in

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:54.139 
the biggest drawback but when you're in
a<00:06:51.209> group<00:06:51.509> of<00:06:51.719> people<00:06:52.229> I<00:06:52.639> think<00:06:53.639> that<00:06:53.789> it<00:06:53.879> can<00:06:54.029> be

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:54.149 
a group of people I think that it can be

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:57.100 
a group of people I think that it can be
a<00:06:54.180> good<00:06:54.539> support<00:06:54.990> weapon<00:06:55.169> so<00:06:55.680> it<00:06:55.979> is<00:06:56.580> expensive

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:57.110 
a good support weapon so it is expensive

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.449 
a good support weapon so it is expensive
it<00:06:58.110> will<00:06:58.349> take<00:06:58.559> a<00:06:58.589> lot<00:06:58.889> of<00:06:58.949> time<00:06:59.219> and<00:06:59.399> resources

00:06:59.449 --> 00:06:59.459 
it will take a lot of time and resources

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.089 
it will take a lot of time and resources
to<00:06:59.939> make<00:07:00.269> but<00:07:00.629> let<00:07:00.959> me<00:07:00.990> know<00:07:01.289> what<00:07:01.709> you<00:07:01.860> think

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:02.099 
to make but let me know what you think

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:15.250 
to make but let me know what you think
so<00:07:02.430> this<00:07:02.610> is<00:07:02.639> kaze<00:07:02.909> oku<00:07:03.269> saying<00:07:03.569> goodbye

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.260 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.320
