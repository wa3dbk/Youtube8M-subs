00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.560
 How about youtube's friends in the 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.860
 previous video I taught them how to convert 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.960
 the color of black clothes to hue 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.600
 white here you can see it 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 Anyway, you can click here 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.510
 about the link this I'm going to leave you 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.939
 here for you to see it ok and I have been 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.029
 asking to teach them how to change the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.270
 tonality to other colors and for this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.189
 example let's use the same model 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.380
 in the description of the video I'm going to 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.930
 leave the link of the image so that the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.649
 download that is the same as I go back to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.360
 repeat of the previous video well by 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.579
 example here we already have our 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.579
 selection made of what is the blouse 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 and to change the hue to another color 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.129
 that is not white we're going to go this 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.090
 icon down here and we're going to create a 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.310
 cap 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.310
 Adjustment of hue and saturation 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:12.050
 let's create your clipping mask 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.050
 by clicking on this icon 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.290
 and it is very simple we will give click here 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.290
 about this coloring box 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.570
 let's raise the saturation 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.530
 and here as you can see it already has a color 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:34.130
 red as red better said and the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:38.289
 luminosity you can move it 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.289
 and find the tone that you like the most 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.140
 for example I'm going to leave it here in 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.840
 this blue tone 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.250
 I also made a selection of what 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.250
 it's been the pants 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.540
 I do not have in layer 2 and we're going to do the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.820
 same operation we are going to create the 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.690
 capable of adjustment 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.660
 this there is no saturation and here the color 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.300
 as red does not give as much trouble as 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.450
 the black here the need to put 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.450
 simply color the scrolls 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.780
 the color that you like remember 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.000
 press this icon to create the mask 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.790
 of clipping because if it is not going to take you 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.010
 the whole image and we just want that 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.330
 act on the layer where I have the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.330
 pant clipping 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.750
 so we click and here you can 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.750
 move the color you want 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.090
 for example, that yellow color 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.140
 you can also click to color and 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.330
 do the same thing ok then with this 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.510
