00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.799
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.139
 of trail running review puntocom 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.750
 we are in Munich expo and we are in the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.600
 stand of the sportive where we are going to 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.090
 present the new model the cu light 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.910
 The q light is a model that mixes 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.320
 little two previous models we are 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.860
 talking about who is mixing the upper 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.410
 the area above the quantum and 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.410
 sole as you can see from the cee 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.580
 Light 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.940
 let's analyze the sole a little 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.410
 as you can see is a sole 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.170
 with 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.720
 multi taco and with multidirectional cue 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.920
 it is also to say in this central area the 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.920
 taco has an address 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.850
 where the traction grip is going to be 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.500
 important you see the drawing here you have 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.120
 more superstitions in this area here 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.700
 therefore the grip is on this 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.630
 direction is going to be going to be greater has 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.330
 a whole grid of perimeter tacos that 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.570
 creates endow stability and how you can 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.120
 see in the back in the taco tour 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.190
 symmetric according to the zones 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.340
 of descent have more support surface 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.190
 therefore it will work a lot 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.600
 best 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.730
 profile a profile a half profile let's say 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.100
 that has a drop an average drop of 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.390
 agreement has this part of the material 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.240
 here that is softer therefore not 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.270
 we have tried it yet but well we are going to 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.340
 surely it's going to be a shoe that 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.740
 give us quite enough cushioning 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.110
 we see in this area here in this area 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.360
 here and in this area here a 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.120
 stabilizer agree let's have 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:56.200
 a shoe that will be stable in the 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.910
 tread analyze the flexibility then 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.470
 already spoke and you see him inside 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.370
 too much rebound has a flexibility 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:07.030
 a pretty good good flexibility the 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.440
 upper good as we said the upper is 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.430
 the quantum is worth 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.780
 with a mesh here a mesh a bit a 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:21.020
 more metallic touch with a cell with a 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.880
 open hexagonal cell you see here 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.720
 that gives a look like that a little 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.720
 good 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.129
 gives it a certain minimalist look when 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.420
 when we see it that good, it gives us the 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.000
 feeling that it can be a sneaker 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.859
 minimalist because it is also quite 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.140
 narrow of this area here so 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:39.519
 So surely we have to try 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.489
 surely it's going to be a shoe that 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.680
 go pretty tight in this area here 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.319
 as you can see 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.579
 some tensioners in this part of here and 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.170
 other sensors in the part of here that 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.250
 what they do is that when you strain the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.550
 cord let's say all the upper goes 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.490
 and it's going to close has a protection 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.870
 here a kind of rib rather than 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.210
 rib protection here to avoid 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.450
 to avoid 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.170
 that the heel go looser structure 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.730
 heel 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.090
 It has a certain bead structure but 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.920
 neither is it a wonder 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.900
 According shoe is very light 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.390
 light then let's analyze the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.490
 inner tongue we see a tongue 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.830
 let's undo it a little bit like that 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.230
 we will be able to see better because if not 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.209
 see if it can be perfect vale 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.850
 we have here a tongue a tongue 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.530
 wide I remember a wide tongue and the 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.960
 and another feature of this model is 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.480
 what 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.890
 the protection that they often have 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.350
 the interior slippers to avoid 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.510
 that enter into objects this has it 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.490
 outside as you can see is a kind of 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.370
 half leg in this area here that 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.240
 will prevent us from entering things that 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:54.620
 us in things inside 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.890
 inside it is quite comfortable 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.690
 does not have too many seams has not 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.360
 has too many seams in agreement 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.090
 has a template 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.710
 have a mean template let's say here 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.330
 it picks up very well what is the area of the 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.370
 heel is worth this micro bored vale 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.590
 but it's a template that does not have going 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.299
 that does not have too much cushioning of 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.609
 agreement is a template that will collect 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.460
 well the foot and you're 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.419
 well, here from the stand of the 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.490
 sportiva presenting the light in agreement 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.880
 a very light bomb a bomb that we 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.980
 Will serve 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.330
 will serve us to train and 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.230
 surely it will also be useful for 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.700
 compete because it really is a bomb 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.980
 technically very very very developed 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.690
 up here friends one more analysis of 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.200
 will bring in review dotcom see you in 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.200
 the next
