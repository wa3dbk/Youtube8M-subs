want during the gameplay so I am on the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.830 
want during the gameplay so I am on the
Decepticon<00:01:06.790> side<00:01:07.090> I<00:01:07.119> believe<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.689> this

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
Decepticon side I believe in this

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.020 
Decepticon side I believe in this
gameplay<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.649> this<00:01:09.280> is<00:01:09.399> one<00:01:09.579> of<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:09.790> more

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
gameplay and this is one of the more

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.969 
gameplay and this is one of the more
full<00:01:10.420> gameplays<00:01:10.960> I've<00:01:11.170> been<00:01:11.320> into<00:01:11.649> and<00:01:11.799> it<00:01:11.890> was

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
full gameplays I've been into and it was

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.219 
full gameplays I've been into and it was
a<00:01:12.009> very<00:01:12.340> competitive<00:01:12.760> series<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.570> think<00:01:13.810> this

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
a very competitive series I think this

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.230 
a very competitive series I think this
is<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.500> last<00:01:14.740> game<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:15.520> came<00:01:15.700> down<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.150> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
is the last game and it came down to the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.630 
is the last game and it came down to the
wire<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:16.780> it's<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.560> pretty<00:01:17.830> good<00:01:18.070> gameplay<00:01:18.460> and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
wire so it's a pretty good gameplay and

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.950 
wire so it's a pretty good gameplay and
I<00:01:18.670> think<00:01:18.880> Edward<00:01:19.120> trigger<00:01:19.390> hands<00:01:19.659> is<00:01:19.750> on<00:01:19.870> the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
I think Edward trigger hands is on the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.420 
I think Edward trigger hands is on the
other<00:01:20.080> team<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.530> he<00:01:20.620> does<00:01:20.800> some<00:01:20.979> work<00:01:21.190> with

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
other team and he does some work with

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.760 
other team and he does some work with

jumping up into buildings a lot and

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.150 
jumping up into buildings a lot and
that's<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.810> very<00:02:34.020> good<00:02:34.170> strategy<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.710> use<00:02:34.860> in

more ground and you can get away a lot
easier<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.730> it's<00:02:39.210> also<00:02:39.390> important<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:39.930> use

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
easier and it's also important to use

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.960 
easier and it's also important to use
your<00:02:40.170> evade<00:02:40.620> button<00:02:40.980> some<00:02:41.280> characters<00:02:41.730> will

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
evade left and right some will roll and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.460 
evade left and right some will roll and
you<00:02:44.730> can<00:02:44.880> evade<00:02:45.150> left-right<00:02:45.780> back<00:02:46.140> and

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
you can evade left-right back and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.860 
you can evade left-right back and
forward<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.850> also<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.210> good<00:02:48.390> strategy

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
forward and that is also a good strategy

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.210 
forward and that is also a good strategy
to<00:02:49.020> use<00:02:49.200> especially<00:02:49.500> if<00:02:49.950> you're<00:02:50.070> in<00:02:50.160> a

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
got a little crazy on the melee but

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.500 
got a little crazy on the melee but
there<00:03:20.070> I'm<00:03:20.160> not<00:03:20.310> used<00:03:20.550> to<00:03:20.640> mailing<00:03:20.910> people<00:03:21.330> too

guns<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.560> here<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:25.980> see<00:03:26.160> me<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.430> one<00:03:26.459> of<00:03:26.730> these

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
guns and here you see me in one of these

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.810 
guns and here you see me in one of these
driving<00:03:27.840> transforming<00:03:28.680> flying<00:03:29.220> across<00:03:29.610> some

driving transforming flying across some
map<00:03:30.000> battles<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.660> jazz<00:03:31.380> a<00:03:31.709> lot<00:03:32.100> faster<00:03:32.550> than

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
map battles and jazz a lot faster than

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.430 
map battles and jazz a lot faster than
ratchet<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.239> he<00:03:33.510> is<00:03:33.660> going<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.019> get<00:03:34.260> away

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
ratchet so he is going to get away

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.229 
ratchet so he is going to get away
cleanly<00:03:34.860> but<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.430> don't<00:03:35.640> think<00:03:35.790> he's<00:03:35.910> gonna<00:03:36.030> get

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
cleanly but I don't think he's gonna get

cleanly but I don't think he's gonna get
away<00:03:36.300> clean<00:03:36.989> enough<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.380> think<00:03:37.769> somebody<00:03:38.250> will

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
away clean enough I think somebody will

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.220 
away clean enough I think somebody will
help<00:03:38.519> me<00:03:38.700> out<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.030> pick<00:03:39.269> him<00:03:39.480> up<00:03:39.510> for<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.900> kill

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
maneuvers and you can fly pretty quickly

across<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.590> map<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.400> then<00:04:15.550> you<00:04:15.640> see<00:04:15.790> me

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
across the map and then you see me

across the map and then you see me
picking<00:04:16.090> up<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.269> jump<00:04:16.630> shot<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:16.930> match<00:04:17.650> it<00:04:17.919> so

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
picking up a jump shot to match it so

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.520 
picking up a jump shot to match it so
using<00:04:18.940> my<00:04:18.970> land<00:04:19.299> mines<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.720> my<00:04:19.870> advantage<00:04:20.230> and

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
using my land mines to my advantage and

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.530 
using my land mines to my advantage and
here<00:04:21.040> is<00:04:21.160> where<00:04:21.340> they<00:04:21.519> spawn<00:04:21.910> so<00:04:22.210> we<00:04:22.330> are<00:04:22.450> about

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
here is where they spawn so we are about

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.080 
here is where they spawn so we are about
to<00:04:22.750> put<00:04:22.960> on<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.410> spawn<00:04:24.010> trap<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.610> apply<00:04:25.060> some

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
to put on a spawn trap and apply some

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.300 
to put on a spawn trap and apply some
pressure<00:04:25.480> to<00:04:25.810> these<00:04:25.930> guys<00:04:26.200> but<00:04:26.680> we<00:04:26.800> do<00:04:26.980> have<00:04:27.130> to

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
pressure to these guys but we do have to

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.370 
pressure to these guys but we do have to
be<00:04:27.400> careful<00:04:27.610> with<00:04:27.940> this<00:04:28.210> because<00:04:28.660> they<00:04:29.080> do<00:04:29.260> get

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
be careful with this because they do get

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.620 
be careful with this because they do get
invincibility<00:04:30.040> off<00:04:30.400> their<00:04:30.669> spawn<00:04:31.060> for<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.330> few

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
invincibility off their spawn for a few

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.810 
invincibility off their spawn for a few
seconds<00:04:32.110> so<00:04:32.530> I'm<00:04:32.590> gonna<00:04:32.680> do<00:04:32.830> my<00:04:32.889> best<00:04:32.979> job<00:04:33.580> to

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
seconds so I'm gonna do my best job to

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.940 
seconds so I'm gonna do my best job to
put<00:04:34.240> landmines<00:04:34.720> all<00:04:35.020> over<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.410> ground<00:04:35.710> here

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
put landmines all over the ground here

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.080 
put landmines all over the ground here
and<00:04:36.040> hopefully<00:04:36.220> that<00:04:36.490> they<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.760> just<00:04:36.910> run

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
and hopefully that they can just run

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.790 
and hopefully that they can just run
into<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.540> a<00:04:37.690> little<00:04:38.110> bit<00:04:38.229> and<00:04:38.380> caused<00:04:38.590> some

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
into it a little bit and caused some

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.890 
into it a little bit and caused some
damage<00:04:39.010> but<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.639> will<00:04:39.910> also<00:04:40.090> be<00:04:40.389> in<00:04:40.510> trouble

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
damage but I will also be in trouble

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.200 
damage but I will also be in trouble
because<00:04:40.990> my<00:04:41.350> weapons<00:04:41.740> are<00:04:41.950> overheating<00:04:42.760> but<00:04:43.150> I

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
because my weapons are overheating but I
