00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:11.439 
I really don't put anything on it and

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.420 
I really don't put anything on it and
yet<00:03:11.650> it's<00:03:11.889> synthetic<00:03:12.879> hair<00:03:13.319> so<00:03:14.319> you<00:03:14.889> have<00:03:15.189> to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
yet it's synthetic hair so you have to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.720 
yet it's synthetic hair so you have to
be<00:03:16.180> mindful<00:03:16.419> that<00:03:16.720> it's<00:03:17.230> not<00:03:17.439> you<00:03:18.159> know<00:03:18.280> human

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
be mindful that it's not you know human

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.030 
be mindful that it's not you know human
hair<00:03:18.939> and<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.269> have<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.750> remember<00:03:20.379> is<00:03:20.620> just<00:03:20.799> a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
hair and you have to remember is just a

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.259 
hair and you have to remember is just a
fiber<00:03:21.359> so<00:03:23.159> if<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:24.459> hair<00:03:24.639> it<00:03:24.729> does<00:03:24.909> get<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.209> bit

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
fiber so if the hair it does get a bit

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.309 
fiber so if the hair it does get a bit
crazy<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:26.650> out<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.400> control<00:03:27.519> like<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.239> go<00:03:29.109> back

sitting my Clyde right the hair does

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.700

rather<00:04:54.850> good<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.420> see<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:55.960> it's<00:04:56.110> kind<00:04:56.410> of<00:04:56.470> hard

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
rather good to see so it's kind of hard

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.240 
rather good to see so it's kind of hard
to<00:04:56.920> keep<00:04:57.130> your<00:04:58.030> synthetic<00:04:58.300> hair<00:05:00.570> I'm<00:05:01.570> getting

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
to keep your synthetic hair I'm getting

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.010 
to keep your synthetic hair I'm getting
completely<00:05:03.250> not<00:05:03.640> frizzy<00:05:03.940> it's<00:05:04.390> going<00:05:04.840> to

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
completely not frizzy it's going to

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.580 
completely not frizzy it's going to
happen<00:05:05.470> but<00:05:06.430> as<00:05:06.940> it<00:05:07.240> does<00:05:07.510> if<00:05:07.900> we<00:05:08.110> see<00:05:08.290> over

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
happen but as it does if we see over

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.080 
happen but as it does if we see over
time<00:05:08.770> I<00:05:08.980> feel<00:05:09.220> like<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.520> looks<00:05:09.730> a<00:05:09.880> bit<00:05:09.910> more

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
time I feel like it looks a bit more

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.850 
time I feel like it looks a bit more
natural<00:05:10.420> because<00:05:11.020> the<00:05:11.320> first<00:05:11.560> one<00:05:11.740> you

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
natural because the first one you

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.070 
natural because the first one you
install<00:05:12.250> it<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:13.210> hair<00:05:13.420> kind<00:05:13.660> of<00:05:13.780> looks<00:05:13.930> a<00:05:14.050> bit

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
install it the hair kind of looks a bit

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.700 
install it the hair kind of looks a bit
plasticky<00:05:15.030> which<00:05:16.030> is<00:05:16.300> but<00:05:16.690> is<00:05:16.900> what<00:05:17.140> that<00:05:17.680> I

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
plasticky which is but is what that I

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.980 
plasticky which is but is what that I
carry<00:05:18.010> as<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:18.310> looks<00:05:18.460> like<00:05:18.550> so<00:05:19.510> every<00:05:19.780> time

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
carry as it looks like so every time

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
carry as it looks like so every time
when<00:05:20.140> it<00:05:20.290> starts<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:21.990> lose<00:05:22.990> that<00:05:23.260> shine

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
when it starts to lose that shine

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.270 
when it starts to lose that shine
I<00:05:24.040> feel<00:05:24.490> like<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.910> hair<00:05:25.120> looks<00:05:25.390> a<00:05:25.510> little<00:05:25.630> bit

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
I feel like the hair looks a little bit

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.230 
I feel like the hair looks a little bit
more<00:05:27.280> natural<00:05:27.520> and<00:05:28.360> um<00:05:29.670> some<00:05:30.670> people<00:05:30.700> believe

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
more natural and um some people believe

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.910 
more natural and um some people believe
it<00:05:31.390> is<00:05:31.510> my<00:05:31.720> hair<00:05:31.960> some<00:05:32.320> people<00:05:32.590> don't

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
it is my hair some people don't

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.440 
it is my hair some people don't
so<00:05:35.130> really<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.190> doesn't<00:05:36.370> matter<00:05:36.550> I<00:05:37.090> mean<00:05:37.240> I

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
so really it doesn't matter I mean I

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.689 
so really it doesn't matter I mean I
love<00:05:37.900> it<00:05:38.050> either<00:05:38.230> way<00:05:38.530> but

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
love it either way but

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:46.580
