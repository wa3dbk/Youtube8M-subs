00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.179
 Why not eat at the beginning is never 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.080

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.360
 determination 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.150
 no, this dedication is going to do a lot 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.100
 in Manaus every year about 60 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.790
 nutritionists entered the market of 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.980
 job 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.380

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.590
 very large proportion but in the area 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.630
 clinic it can act in several areas 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.650

 diabetic with hypertension then in 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.090
 this clinical area is very important to 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.970
 performance of the nutritionist because 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.030
 diseases that are diseases that 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.280
 are not acquired are not 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.860
 transmitted but which are acquired in the 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.200
 truth through food 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.209
 eating behaviors and then the 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.010
 the professional in this area he or she is 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.200
 of fundamental importance because it 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.650
 will be in regulating power it 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.510
 will also be helping is this the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.370
 chronic diseases as we are 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.290
 speaking a disease that you are going to take 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.330
 for the rest of life then the 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.150
 professional nutritionist testing 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.000
 this area is going to be helping you 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.470
 a life with more quality even though 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.180
 a community of 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.790
 the professional speaks one of the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.160
 dangers of inadequate food 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.140
 are the miracle diets that promise 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.060
 to lose weight in a short period without 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.370
 accompanying the professional is a 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.440
 very large risk as well as the person 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.630
 she does not medicate herself, she suddenly has 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.110
 a headache goes there and they treat 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.750
 symptom and does not treat what is 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.150
 of that then obesity 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.120
 nowadays it is an alarming situation 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.430
 the people they are always in the gerund 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.040
 ie right fatter 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.989
 if you see a person she starts the year 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.540
 with weight at the end of the year she will weigh 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:19.769
 she is much heavier and during this 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.539
 she starts a diet of her own 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.669
 This is not cool because we talk 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.830
 in the beginning that nutrition is a science 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.629
 then a person to make a diet 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.300
 it has to be evaluated 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:33.090
 have to see that each individual is a 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.180
 guy then there is no such guy 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.509
 I lost weight taking this, I lost weight 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.849
 I'm going to lose weight, you're finished. 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:44.129
 modifying and altering the 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:45.870
 work your metabolism because it 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.389
 slows down every time you 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.370
 begins to fight against it to reduce 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.110
 weight how many years you spent with 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.880
 time you're at that weight then 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.449

 weight of the night pro day it will react more 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.659
 sooner or later you will have a 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.819
 rebound will abstinence 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.190
 will be higher then it has all the 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:07.740
 care a whole technique so that 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.009

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.229

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.750
