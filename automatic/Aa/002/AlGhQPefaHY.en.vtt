I mean we don't really worry about the
future<00:02:12.630> we<00:02:12.960> were<00:02:13.140> either<00:02:13.290> in<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.650> back<00:02:13.830> hand

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.940 
but we worry about this year's team we
didn't<00:02:15.960> think<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.230> year's<00:02:16.500> teams<00:02:16.740> good

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950

didn't think this year's teams good
enough<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.220> win<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.700> would<00:02:17.850> have

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
enough to win then we would have

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.610 
enough to win then we would have
addressed<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:18.900> would<00:02:19.350> feel<00:02:19.590> very

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
addressed it but we would feel very

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.140 
addressed it but we would feel very
confident<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.340> their<00:02:20.490> players<00:02:20.790> on<00:02:21.000> our<00:02:21.090> team
