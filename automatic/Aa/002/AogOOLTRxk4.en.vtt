00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.320 
to come back tomorrow as an improved
player<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.989> think<00:02:38.989> I<00:02:39.170> provide<00:02:39.650> at<00:02:40.400> least<00:02:40.459> some

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
player I think I provide at least some

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.510 
player I think I provide at least some
sort<00:02:41.540> of<00:02:41.570> guidance<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:42.050> not<00:02:42.320> only<00:02:42.560> how<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.830> play

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
sort of guidance is not only how to play

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.890 
sort of guidance is not only how to play
the<00:02:43.700> music<00:02:44.380> correctly<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.620> mean<00:02:46.220> and<00:02:46.580> some<00:02:46.900> sort

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
the music correctly I mean and some sort

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.420 
the music correctly I mean and some sort
of<00:02:47.959> methods<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.530> we<00:02:48.650> can<00:02:48.800> go<00:02:48.950> through<00:02:49.160> to<00:02:49.280> get

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
of methods that we can go through to get

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.880 
of methods that we can go through to get
to<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.700> point<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.320> think<00:02:51.320> I'm<00:02:51.440> also

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
to that point I think I'm also

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.610 
to that point I think I'm also
giving<00:02:53.460> them<00:02:53.550> a<00:02:53.700> broader<00:02:54.060> sense<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.690> what

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
giving them a broader sense of what

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.320 
giving them a broader sense of what
they're<00:02:55.800> doing<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.430> how<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.970> sort<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.209> fits

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
they're doing and how it sort of fits

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.480 
they're doing and how it sort of fits
into<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.720> world<00:02:58.050> you<00:02:58.709> really<00:02:58.980> get<00:02:59.069> to<00:02:59.130> grow
