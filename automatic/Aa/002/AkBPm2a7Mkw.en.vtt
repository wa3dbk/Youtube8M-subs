00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
was 15 megabits down and 2 megabits up

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.539 
was 15 megabits down and 2 megabits up
and<00:01:45.570> now<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.869> 50<00:01:46.200> megabits<00:01:46.619> down<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.189> five

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and now it's 50 megabits down and five

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.460 
and now it's 50 megabits down and five
mega<00:01:47.820> discuss<00:01:48.180> which<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.509> awesome<00:01:48.659> however

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
mega discuss which is awesome however

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.179 
mega discuss which is awesome however
megabits<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.280> different<00:01:50.670> than<00:01:50.820> megabytes<00:01:52.189> 15

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
megabits is different than megabytes 15

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.260 
megabits is different than megabytes 15
mega<00:01:53.460> bits<00:01:53.790> before<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.689> actually<00:01:55.159> 1.875

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
mega bits before is actually 1.875

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.230 
mega bits before is actually 1.875
megabytes<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:58.189> then<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> 2<00:01:59.549> megabits<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.180> i

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
megabytes and then the 2 megabits that i

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120 
megabytes and then the 2 megabits that i
have<00:02:00.390> before<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.990> actually<00:02:01.350> point<00:02:01.680> 25

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
have before is actually point 25

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.429 
have before is actually point 25
megabytes<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.540> that's<00:02:03.659> what<00:02:03.810> my<00:02:03.960> old<00:02:04.110> one<00:02:04.229> was

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
megabytes so that's what my old one was

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.660 
megabytes so that's what my old one was
now<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.130> actually<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> 50<00:02:06.509> megabits<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.670> 6.25

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
now it is actually a 50 megabits is 6.25

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.290 
now it is actually a 50 megabits is 6.25
megabyte<00:02:09.239> download<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.500> i'm<00:02:10.560> downloading<00:02:10.800> at

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
megabyte download so i'm downloading at

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.730 
megabyte download so i'm downloading at
6.25<00:02:12.300> megabytes

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
6.25 megabytes

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.170 
6.25 megabytes
not<00:02:13.950> really<00:02:14.280> because<00:02:14.430> I'm<00:02:14.790> actually<00:02:14.940> only

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
not really because I'm actually only

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.290 
not really because I'm actually only
getting<00:02:15.660> with<00:02:16.170> my<00:02:16.610> with<00:02:17.610> my<00:02:17.760> router<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.210> I

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
getting with my with my router that I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.360 
getting with my with my router that I
have<00:02:18.450> I'm<00:02:18.630> only<00:02:18.840> getting<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.140> 38<00:02:19.710> down<00:02:20.040> and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
have I'm only getting like 38 down and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.980 
have I'm only getting like 38 down and
then<00:02:21.150> my<00:02:21.270> upload<00:02:21.660> which<00:02:21.990> is<00:02:22.170> five<00:02:22.410> megabits<00:02:22.980> is

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
then my upload which is five megabits is

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.290 
then my upload which is five megabits is
165<00:02:24.990> so<00:02:25.260> I'm<00:02:25.350> uploading<00:02:25.700> 625<00:02:26.700> kilobytes<00:02:27.180> per

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
165 so I'm uploading 625 kilobytes per

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.150 
165 so I'm uploading 625 kilobytes per
second<00:02:27.890> in<00:02:28.890> this<00:02:29.100> yes<00:02:30.050> 26<00:02:31.050> all<00:02:31.800> right<00:02:31.980> we'll

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
second in this yes 26 all right we'll

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.460 
second in this yes 26 all right we'll
just<00:02:32.190> save<00:02:32.520> point<00:02:32.790> 6<00:02:33.000> 25<00:02:33.330> megabytes<00:02:33.750> per

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
just save point 6 25 megabytes per

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.290 
just save point 6 25 megabytes per
second<00:02:34.890> which<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.220> awesome<00:02:35.460> pretty<00:02:36.030> quicker

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
second which is awesome pretty quicker

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.950 
second which is awesome pretty quicker
to<00:02:37.290> put<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.770> non<00:02:37.980> nerd<00:02:38.340> turn<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.970> 10<00:02:39.750> minute

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
to put that in non nerd turn a 10 minute

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.380 
to put that in non nerd turn a 10 minute
video<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.500> used<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.190> take<00:02:41.220> 30<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.850> 40<00:02:42.210> minutes

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
video that used to take 30 to 40 minutes

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.250 
video that used to take 30 to 40 minutes
now<00:02:42.720> takes<00:02:43.080> about<00:02:43.320> 13<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> have<00:02:45.600> my<00:02:45.720> AC<00:02:45.930> on

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
now takes about 13 so I have my AC on

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.920 
now takes about 13 so I have my AC on
and<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:47.100> outside<00:02:47.700> my<00:02:47.820> family<00:02:48.180> was<00:02:48.420> really<00:02:48.750> hot

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
and I outside my family was really hot

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.070 
and I outside my family was really hot
hate<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:50.190> it's<00:02:50.340> hot<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.670> my<00:02:50.760> house<00:02:50.970> I'm<00:02:51.510> he

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
hate that it's hot in my house I'm he

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.280 
hate that it's hot in my house I'm he
being<00:02:52.290> hot<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.100> actually<00:02:53.370> I'm<00:02:53.850> going<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.330> try

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
being hot so I actually I'm going to try

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.110 
being hot so I actually I'm going to try
to<00:02:55.320> use<00:02:55.530> audacity<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.460> get<00:02:56.640> rid<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:56.910> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
to use audacity to get rid of the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.060 
to use audacity to get rid of the
background<00:02:57.330> noise<00:02:57.810> so<00:02:58.050> if<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.380> sound<00:02:58.680> kind<00:02:58.980> of

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
background noise so if I sound kind of

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.100 
background noise so if I sound kind of
weird<00:02:59.130> that's<00:02:59.580> why<00:02:59.820> I'm<00:03:00.180> not<00:03:00.480> gonna<00:03:00.660> record<00:03:00.990> it

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
weird that's why I'm not gonna record it

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.630 
weird that's why I'm not gonna record it
without<00:03:01.320> me<00:03:01.500> easy<00:03:01.770> on<00:03:01.890> me<00:03:02.040> because<00:03:02.130> I'm

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
without me easy on me because I'm

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.670 
without me easy on me because I'm
calling<00:03:03.270> up<00:03:03.390> dying<00:03:03.660> during<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.230> commentary

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
calling up dying during a commentary

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.440 
calling up dying during a commentary
that<00:03:05.340> would<00:03:05.490> be<00:03:05.610> sad<00:03:05.820> because<00:03:06.120> when<00:03:06.360> I

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
that would be sad because when I

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.990 
that would be sad because when I
couldn't<00:03:06.720> upload<00:03:06.900> it<00:03:07.080> um<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:08.220> want<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.880> talk

6pm so I'm gonna try to do that again
however<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.240> time<00:03:21.420> I'm<00:03:21.600> actually<00:03:21.750> just

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
however this time I'm actually just

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.410 
however this time I'm actually just
going<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.440> around<00:03:22.860> 4pm<00:03:23.280> maybe<00:03:23.550> quarter<00:03:23.970> top<00:03:24.150> or

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
going to around 4pm maybe quarter top or

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.900 
going to around 4pm maybe quarter top or
I'll<00:03:24.810> upload<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.950> won't<00:03:26.160> schedule<00:03:26.400> but<00:03:26.760> i'll

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
I'll upload I won't schedule but i'll

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.190 
I'll upload I won't schedule but i'll
just<00:03:27.090> upload<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.600> video<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.960> then<00:03:28.020> whatever

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
just upload the video and then whatever

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.320 
just upload the video and then whatever
gets<00:03:28.560> boosted<00:03:29.010> that's<00:03:29.250> when<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:29.670> will<00:03:29.700> go<00:03:29.970> and

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
gets boosted that's when it will go and

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.020 
gets boosted that's when it will go and
then<00:03:31.260> i'll<00:03:31.530> do<00:03:31.740> the<00:03:31.830> same<00:03:32.040> for<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.580> coming<00:03:32.820> to

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
then i'll do the same for this coming to

the<00:03:45.510> description<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.080> used<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.040> do<00:03:47.160> annotations

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
the description I used to do annotations

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.060 
the description I used to do annotations
at<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.120> end<00:03:48.240> but<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.510> kind<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.870> annoying<00:03:49.440> to

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
at the end but the kind of annoying to

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.280 
at the end but the kind of annoying to
do<00:03:50.220> because<00:03:50.460> then<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:51.270> know<00:03:51.300> if<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.930> don't<00:03:52.170> do

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
do because then you know if I don't do

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.630 
do because then you know if I don't do
them<00:03:52.470> before<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.070> know<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.190> can't<00:03:53.460> really

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
them before the you know I can't really

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.680 
them before the you know I can't really
do<00:03:53.760> them<00:03:53.910> before<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.240> videos<00:03:54.510> actually

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
do them before the videos actually

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.360 
do them before the videos actually
happen<00:03:55.140> less<00:03:55.230> like<00:03:55.410> scheduled<00:03:55.890> upload<00:03:56.130> and

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
happen less like scheduled upload and

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.550 
happen less like scheduled upload and
then<00:03:57.240> it<00:03:57.390> just<00:03:57.540> gets<00:03:57.720> confusing<00:03:58.200> after<00:03:58.530> a

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
then it just gets confusing after a

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.140 
then it just gets confusing after a
while<00:03:58.710> and<00:03:58.950> most<00:03:59.280> people<00:03:59.370> don't<00:03:59.760> click<00:03:59.970> them

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
while and most people don't click them

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.640 
while and most people don't click them
so<00:04:00.330> it's<00:04:00.450> kind<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.720> just<00:04:00.840> away<00:04:01.110> so<00:04:01.140> I'm<00:04:01.470> just

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
so it's kind of just away so I'm just

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.320 
so it's kind of just away so I'm just
going<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:01.890> put<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.070> link<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.490> my<00:04:02.520> two<00:04:02.970> recent
