ending here the best dry axles took over
of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.390> MultiJet<00:01:21.869> even<00:01:22.170> with<00:01:22.290> all<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
of the MultiJet even with all the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.749 
of the MultiJet even with all the
knowledge<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.799> jet<00:01:23.009> they'd<00:01:23.220> actually<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
knowledge in jet they'd actually get a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.399 
knowledge in jet they'd actually get a
bit<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.150> head<00:01:24.299> start<00:01:24.450> which<00:01:24.990> was<00:01:25.200> about

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
bit of a head start which was about

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.530 
bit of a head start which was about
unfair<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.280> still<00:01:26.549> after<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.030> head<00:01:27.360> start

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
unfair but still after that head start

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
unfair but still after that head start
the<00:01:28.049> best<00:01:28.290> shot<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.530> actually<00:01:29.009> take<00:01:29.159> over

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
the best shot that actually take over

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.120 
the best shot that actually take over
the<00:01:29.909> Monchichi<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.990> here<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> final<00:01:31.770> one

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the Monchichi so here is a final one

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.440 
the Monchichi so here is a final one
with<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> deduction<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.850> freedom<00:01:33.180> respect

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
with the deduction of freedom respect

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.179 
with the deduction of freedom respect
averages<00:01:33.990> off<00:01:34.140> each<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.530> three<00:01:34.650> races<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
averages off each of three races and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.950 
averages off each of three races and
this<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.909> actual<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.479> does<00:01:36.600> kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
this is actual it just does kind of a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.010 
this is actual it just does kind of a
straight<00:01:37.259> line<00:01:37.290> no<00:01:38.130> exact<00:01:38.820> flavor<00:01:39.119> we're<00:01:39.810> just

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
straight line no exact flavor we're just

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.359 
straight line no exact flavor we're just
going<00:01:40.259> from<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.530> runway<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.040> were<00:01:41.100> setting

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
going from this runway that were setting

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.830 
going from this runway that were setting
out<00:01:41.460> right<00:01:41.610> now<00:01:41.759> all<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.210> way<00:01:42.240> over<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
out right now all the way over to the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.330 
out right now all the way over to the
maze<00:01:43.020> bank<00:01:43.229> folding<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.220> you're

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
maze bank folding and what you're

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.370 
maze bank folding and what you're
actually<00:01:44.520> saying<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.990> start<00:01:46.229> off

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
actually saying to you is just start off

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.440 
actually saying to you is just start off
by<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.920> best<00:01:47.189> or<00:01:47.399> after<00:01:47.640> takes<00:01:47.880> off<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.090> bit

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
by the best or after takes off that bit

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.300 
by the best or after takes off that bit
faster<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> acceleration<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:50.009> it's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
faster because the acceleration and it's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.609 
faster because the acceleration and it's
just<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.610> over<00:01:50.790> more<00:01:51.149> than<00:01:51.180> amount<00:01:51.600> GJ<00:01:51.960> as<00:01:52.170> you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
just all over more than amount GJ as you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.410 
just all over more than amount GJ as you
can<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:52.829> as<00:01:53.009> smaller<00:01:53.430> than<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> melt<00:01:54.060> jetting

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
can see as smaller than the melt jetting

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.300 
can see as smaller than the melt jetting
all<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.689> kind<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:54.930> stuff<00:01:55.049> as<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.799> see<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.159> mean

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
all that kind of stuff as you see I mean

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.740 
all that kind of stuff as you see I mean
it's<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> air<00:01:56.820> once<00:01:57.390> you've<00:01:57.509> got<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
it's in the air once you've got the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.969 
it's in the air once you've got the
landing<00:01:58.079> gear<00:01:58.290> off<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.590> all<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.710> kind<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
landing gear off and all that kind of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.410 
landing gear off and all that kind of
stuff<00:01:59.070> we're<00:01:59.399> actually<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.759> full<00:01:59.969> speed<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
stuff we're actually at full speed the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.539 
stuff we're actually at full speed the
bear<00:02:00.869> stroke<00:02:01.140> once<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.530> at<00:02:01.649> full<00:02:01.860> speed<00:02:02.100> it's

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
bear stroke once it's at full speed it's

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.249 
bear stroke once it's at full speed it's
actually<00:02:02.939> smaller<00:02:03.270> than<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> multi<00:02:03.990> jet<00:02:04.170> you

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
actually smaller than the multi jet you

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.020 
actually smaller than the multi jet you
won't<00:02:04.409> see<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:05.130> once<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.610> best<00:02:05.820> shot

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
won't see that that once the best shot

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.550 
won't see that that once the best shot
is<00:02:06.149> actual<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:06.540> full<00:02:06.750> speed<00:02:06.990> as<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:07.500> now

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
is actual at full speed as of right now

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.559 
is actual at full speed as of right now
actually<00:02:08.340> see<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.819> mulch<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.420> just

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
actually see the mulch it is just

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.930 
actually see the mulch it is just
overtaking<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.319> right<00:02:10.530> now<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.250> as<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.640> little

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
overtaking that right now so as a little

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.020 
overtaking that right now so as a little
bit<00:02:12.030> faster

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
bit faster

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.790 
bit faster
at<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.180> end<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.900> adventure<00:02:13.959> does<00:02:14.590> actually

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
at the end the adventure does actually

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.100 
at the end the adventure does actually
end<00:02:15.160> up<00:02:15.310> at<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.580> tail<00:02:15.940> end<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.900> Mount<00:02:17.050> of

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
end up at the tail end of the Mount of

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.480 
end up at the tail end of the Mount of
Gaea<00:02:17.350> at<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.680> end<00:02:17.860> of<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.160> race

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
Gaea at the end of the race

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.390 
Gaea at the end of the race
so<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.970> MultiJet<00:02:19.480> as<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.720> faster<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.620> heir<00:02:20.890> to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
so the MultiJet as a faster and heir to

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.210 
so the MultiJet as a faster and heir to
have<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> higher<00:02:22.030> top<00:02:22.450> speed<00:02:22.720> but<00:02:23.560> online<00:02:23.740> tend

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
have a higher top speed but online tend

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.040 
have a higher top speed but online tend
to<00:02:24.340> start<00:02:24.640> rough<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.360> best<00:02:25.600> is<00:02:25.900> actually

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
to start rough the best is actually

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.290 
to start rough the best is actually
faster<00:02:26.620> due<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.130> high<00:02:27.280> acceleration<00:02:28.150> on

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
faster due to the high acceleration on

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.240 
faster due to the high acceleration on
it<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.569> also<00:02:28.990> as<00:02:29.319> a<00:02:29.350> bit<00:02:29.530> small<00:02:29.770> so<00:02:29.800> little

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
it and also as a bit small so little

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.590 
it and also as a bit small so little
that<00:02:30.430> will<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.760> anything<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.270> do<00:02:31.390> with<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
that will have anything to do with the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.020 
that will have anything to do with the
mechanics<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.470> Splane<00:02:32.739> but<00:02:33.370> definitely<00:02:33.880> I

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
mechanics of the Splane but definitely I

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.580 
mechanics of the Splane but definitely I
would<00:02:34.150> recommend<00:02:34.300> just<00:02:34.959> going<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.410> mulch

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
would recommend just going to the mulch

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.620 
would recommend just going to the mulch
base<00:02:35.830> because<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.700> think<00:02:37.000> it's<00:02:37.300> don't<00:02:37.480> floor

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
base because I think it's don't floor

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.530 
base because I think it's don't floor
1.15<00:02:38.590> Moeen<00:02:39.160> for<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.910> best<00:02:40.090> shot<00:02:40.330> when<00:02:40.450> you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
1.15 Moeen for the best shot when you

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.910 
1.15 Moeen for the best shot when you
could<00:02:40.660> easily<00:02:40.840> destroy<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.380> mallet<00:02:41.650> appears

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
could easily destroy it mallet appears

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.340 
could easily destroy it mallet appears
then<00:02:42.370> get<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.640> MultiJet<00:02:43.450> from<00:02:43.780> there<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.170> as<00:02:44.319> I

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
then get a MultiJet from there and as I
