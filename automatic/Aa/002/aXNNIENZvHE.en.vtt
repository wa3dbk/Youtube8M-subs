00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:15.639
 that you are nobody 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.639
 I want to find you 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.470
 or the girls now I bring this video 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.510
 well dramatic I hope you like it and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.510
 follow me as I did keep seeing 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.260
 although this we will think with a base 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.630
 for the eyes and this is the fate of 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.760
 that gift aleix and I loved this 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.250
 base a lot to apply before applying 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.110
 my shadows and I'll put the link below 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.610
 so that you can get the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.780
 yours and the good thing is that it's cheap as 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.520
 thank you very much to the seen that they are very 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.470
 faces and I love this for what 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.600
 it's good, so let's start with 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.940
 a light dry paddle and this one is 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.070
 120 colors and let's see this green and 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.370
 we are going to apply it on the entire eyelid 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.370
 mobile 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.940
 and there we will go with this blue of the 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.120
 palette and it's a strong blue and we're going to 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.640
 apply in the eye socket and we're going 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.530
 to blur upwards as you can see 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.760
 and it does not matter if you look a little 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.470
 heavy to ss oppositely is the all the 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.320
 point of what has to be fine 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.880
 dramatic and we will blur it with 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.910
 other color 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.080
 of and grab a lazy sedona brush 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:38.560
 to blur the color and try 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.780
 blur it as little as I could and then 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.120
 let's go with this green and let's 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.770
 blur the line with another brush 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.630
 cedrÃ³n aleix and it does not matter if they are 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.470
 Smudges have to reach a color 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:57.400
 blue short and what mixteco in the green and 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.070
 define them in points if you do not 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.810
 like to climb the color very high they do not have 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.060
 than upload it 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.740
 and you accumulate it there as you 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.259
 they like it but you know that to me 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.080
 like the color well up to the 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.450
 almost lake east of the eyebrow and as they saw 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.069
 I grabbed this blue and the black ones 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.830
 two mistianos together to make them a 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.740
 little bit stronger the color a little bit 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.470
 darker 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.260
 in the eye socket of and I'll go with 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.510
 the palette of nx had that color and what 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.510
 I'm going to apply on the little bone of the eyebrow 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.940
 and there I went with a delineator called 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.770
 galactic the company and it's a pen and I 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.490
 love this because I feel it is more 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.760
 easy to make it 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.130
 the eyeliner of the eyes and how can 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.080
 see the three in a little thick not 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.340
 it matters because since we apply the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.890
 eyelashes are not going to look so thick 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.350
 the line to get to these that you 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.780
 that come with the liquid to remove 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.569
 makeup and clean the line a little 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.990
 as you can see and this is not for 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.940
 perfect the line that we have that 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.420
 We made the eyeliner or anything 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.420
 that we have fallen and grab this 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:36.170
 but it's mac the truth I did not like what 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.880
 I know it's to go through eyeliner but I'll 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.800
 I know to apply the twitter but the 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.260
 I really did not like it because when it dried 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.870
 the poster of the eyes began to fall 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.940
 but then you think it is that 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.200
 andy will put the name in the link work 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.200
 so that you can 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.470
 they can get it and how they see grip 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.180
 that blue again and I bust it down almost 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.840
 close to the water line of the eyes 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:08.099
 and then apply the green to 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.610
 blur that line as you can see 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.500
 I like to go a little bit down but 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.130
 if it 's too much for you 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.359
 they have to go down so much to leave the feed 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:25.080
 of in why ex in me and delineating I came to 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.840
 German senator andy ni in the line of 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.540
 water from the eyes and then from it itches 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.050
 mmm is to want my favorite the amp of 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.410
 his face and this is the look of the 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:42.290
 lips use a tongue color ex is one 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.290

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.870
 and I hope you liked it if I 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:54.379
 I love them very much and this next
