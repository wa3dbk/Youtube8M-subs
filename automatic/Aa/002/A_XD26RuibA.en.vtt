00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.910
 we continue with the procedure and 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.980
 let's see how to mount the 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.570
 upholstery 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.820
 this is a very delicate phase because 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.160
 the first thing to do is go to 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.800
 position bea upholstery otherwise 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.650
 it will not be installed 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.789
 correctly as you see the colleague is 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.070
 in a sense caressing the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.769
 upholstery to iron all the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.640
 pleats is to make make to adhere 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:42.690
 the upholstery correctly 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.000
 when stuffing this process 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.820
 continue to all parties but did 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.190
 from all sides and you pull especially 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.650
 the back because once 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.420
 match the back side 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:02.129
 side with the one with the padding 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.559
 it is the side one the upholstery is the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.380
 base we say the session can be said almost 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.360
 mounted it heats up in this 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.780
 how the colleague does with a stove 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.490
 a source of heat or let's say if one 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.380
 hot day even if a day 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.320
 hot like today because we are 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.120
 in summer, however, the heat source 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.920
 helps to iron the folds better then 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.050
 it takes a bit of dexterity you go to 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.510
 pull as the colleague does in the phase of 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.680
 drafting it is important to remove creases 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:38.210
 it then goes on to attach to the hook that already 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.210
 on the seat frame 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.409
 continue the same procedure from 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.780
 all sides on the other side 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:53.770
 in the case of whites or transformable 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.200
 which has the bezel in the paste in the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.689
 lower back of the seat 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.719
 one must take the measure as it has 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.390
 made the colleague with the m to make sure 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:11.310
 that both on one side and on the other 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.310
 border distance is the same 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.000
 this 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.120
 must be sending just does not have to 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.120
 speak
