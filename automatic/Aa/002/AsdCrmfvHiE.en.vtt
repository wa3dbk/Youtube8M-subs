00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.670
 EKLANTS ONE: Only when the man feels 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.640
 The caress of your hands Realizes that being someone 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.610
 For someone is not human Captivated by the mantle 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.200
 Of selfish beauty We change all the internal value 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.380
 By materialist 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.180
 And naked your universe When I feel dissatisfied 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.750
 Waiting for my body With yours one conforming 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.620
 In your black melodies Now I feel that I am free 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.350
 And I attach myself to your presence So that it balances me 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.800
 Talk to me When your purity falls 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.680
 And the clarity profane Every part of your soul 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.270
 Come closer If the darkness plagiarizes you 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.960
 Each instinct seduces me by wrapping me in your magic 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.840
 Beautiful lady You presence in my bed 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.540
 When fear accompanies me It makes me feel the dagger 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.890
 Of love when he stabs It's the security of not getting lost 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.410
 Who speaks to me like a mouth To another when at odd distance 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.900
 NAFTA: It's been good 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:20.119
 What I have shared with you and complex has been the relationship 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.360
 What have we taken? I've noticed 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.040
 That in your absence Everything is different 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.570
 But really I've been almost 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.570
 Always the absent 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.630
 That's why sometimes I feel like loving It's running away 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.380
 And tell you my truth But you go 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.530
 What else does Happiness comes after 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.890
 And again everything is forgotten 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.630
 Sometimes I just wish I had you Find you, inspire me 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.409
 Do not let go and define you In a thousand words 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.329
 Because I never think to get away from you And miss the nuance 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.810
 That you always leave when you leave 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.721
 The way we express ourselves Face to face 

00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:51.770
 It was always better You faithful friend 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.890
 How to keep a secret From maintaining life 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.210
 In a hidden dream of seeing you every night 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.679
 Sheltered under the cold. 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.759
 NOSP: Never leave my life 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.990
 Thanks for supporting All those broken dreams 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.590
 That at night cloudy I think By celebrating every sentence I write 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.250
 For advice in situations Where I find only one truth 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.760
 Live this reality 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.230
 Thank you for waking This unhappy soul 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.980
 That never stops talking That always seeks answers 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.510
 Regardless of consequences 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.400
 How to help me understand That the meaning of life 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.210
 You find it in yourself (Yeah) Without egoism without self-centeredness 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.720
 Always looking for greatness Exceeding your goals 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.099
 With loyalty and firmness 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.799
 I hope you never forget about this your server 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.390
 With your advice write on top of any paper 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.400
 Releasing your being To be able to understand in order to understand 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:51.110
 MAYCRO J: Today you talk to us at night 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.780
 With the fear of awakening More bitter is the council 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.150
 When you are not here 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.790
 Your silence is so perfect We can not even think 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.290
 We forget the smiles We digress while talking 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.680
 Our space is darker Where are you? Where will you be? 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.900
 We forget what we do Because you arrive without thinking 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.500
 Your presence is transparent You will always be here 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.560
 Because you're melody This lyrics is for you ... 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.140
 My beautiful where will you be? Do not leave us anymore 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.680
 Just clarify the doubt Liberate us even more 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.400
 You are the one who has understood us You have been in the experience 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.720
 You have calmed our body Of exile produced 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.950
 Hey tell me come to me ... Help us to live ... 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.299
 If the nights are longer It's because I take you in me 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.230
 Or my beautiful come here Strengthen us even more 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.909
 You are what complements You are my loneliness.
