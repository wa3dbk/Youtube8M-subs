00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 Hello everyone in this video I will talk to you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 of my study method 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.809
 then I finished the first year of 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.200
 primary education sciences and ho 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.940
 finished the exams on June 17th two 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.910
 weeks ago and I noticed a method of 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.580
 study that I think is something in between 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.539
 between a method maybe in quotes 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.849
 very slow and between a method maybe a lot 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.969
 fast because anyway I don't have one 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.700
 fast memory that is not me 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.450
 I see a pattern in my head I have 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.430
 need to stay a lot on the books 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.940
 also because in my university there 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.370
 there are many subjects we say just about 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.039
 study not like I don't know chemist 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.079
 mathematics other faculties in which maybe 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.800
 there are more things to understand exercises from 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.510
 do 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.820
 there are many books and a lot of subject matter 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.359
 study for this reason almost adopted 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.430
 my strategy for all the exams 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.610
 personal then the method of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.320
 I study a very personal thing but it can 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.930
 maybe help someone who feels 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.510
 confused or unclear can 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.280
 be a help to hear study methods 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.990
 of others when inside for 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.200
 I usually start with books 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.100
 photocopied and bound in some 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.570
 copy shops only once or rarely there 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.689
 I take new this video will be divided 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.740
 however in two or three parts why 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.270
 however the computer is very slow a 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.610
 upload videos and my car 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.509
 photo is not and you and many minutes 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.670
 so I will scan then myself 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.250
 I also use a lot of notes ad 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.710
 example this notebook of history of the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.079
 contemporary society was a professor 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.790
 which explained a lot will explain a lot 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.830
 well 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.660
 but the notes but the notes are one 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.790
 what part compared to the books there is is not 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.190
 that these notes take a thing 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.060
 of a book therefore as the skin for 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.860
 well so let's say I write 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.080
 there are not many in full 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.150
 schematizations were game of 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.370
 foglio.it 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:20.090
 then let's start with the method of the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:21.740
 I presently have a non exam 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.480
 I know with this book that I always do 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:30.200
 of history and the book an exercise is 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.360
 read everything ie all the books all 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.370
 what's next was the subjects 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.770
 this subject does not seem to me 45 books 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.370
 so I read all then after having 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.030
 read this book at length and reading 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.550
 we say I apply the 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:53.270
 underlining with highlighters 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.310
 colored and I write in pen or pencil between 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.260
 I make double circles 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.190
 underlining pencil pen writing 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.640
 of things near the edge of the page is the 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.700
 kind of quick scrim because why 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.670
 to make the schemes at least me 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.100
 takes too long initially I will have to 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.750
 making patterns I wrote so fast 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.940
 I almost didn't even realize it 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.350
 of what I was writing then 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.560
 in the end I realized that maybe 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.030
 the patterns don't do much for me either 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.890
 they do for me is once I already have 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.500
 studied everything, that is, do a kind 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.900
 of keywords so it's more for me 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.620
 describe little things in a first 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:39.670
 read here in the page column e 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:44.209
 maybe here you can history that is 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:48.080
 arrows things here circle the dates it seems 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.989
 pin and highlighter pass then 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.780
 the first is part of its own reading of 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.710
 all of all the books that are there 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.430
 this is 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:02.240
 even here, however, this is the part that 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.100
 at least I can do a little 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.810
 any situation 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.540
 I usually try to read aloud 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:12.050
 because things remain more in me 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.480
 head I remain more engraved on my head 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.870
 but I also managed to do it in 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.660
 train to places where there are others 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.310
 faculty people that is I have to find the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.290
 right concentration however in the end 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.290
 since I must not repeat aloud 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.270
 etc. I can pretty well clear 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.900
 that you try to understand what you are 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.580
 however, reading in a book is also 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.460
 difficult to understand every single thing 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.130
 so let's say if there is a whole chapter 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.830
 which I do n't understand is an account but if there is one 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.620
 word a sentence I go forward I see if 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.830
 I can understand it with context 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.950
 in short, then this is the 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.900
 my first part the second part after 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.310
 collar all over the first book 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.620
 that I had read and was sort of 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.830
 repeating it however is not a real one 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.670
 repeat in the sense that I open and I have to 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.960
 start saying what I should 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.420
 start repeating but having read it 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.250
 only once maybe I can't 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.250
 I repeat fluidly so maybe 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.800
 throw the eye and fall on 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.110
 underlines so it is the second part 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.050
 a kind of loose repeat from the 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.870
 reading the underlines and things 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.240
 that I see that they are struggling to enter the head 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.230
 I rewrite them again to your page 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.930
 so I do more schematization 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:39.130
 this reading is hard faster 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.470
 compared to the first because it is more 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:45.380
 browse it will tell here and then I try to 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.620
 repeating yourself, however, always also 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.170
 turning an eye to things 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.630
 stress because after reading that 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:57.050
 I know four books when you return to 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.090
 first you had read maybe I don't know a 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.610
 some time earlier a month earlier 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.169
 I don't know how much more 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.909
 don't you remember then everything comes 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:07.550
 clearly I help myself by reading the 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.259
 underlines and this is my second 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.939
 phase 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.560
 this ends my first part here 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.750
 of the video 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.189
 then the second part that I will do will follow 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.189
 immediately after
