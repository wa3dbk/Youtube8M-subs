00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.750

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.600
 here you have an easy creative option and 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.520
 delicious and two to the guys how are they 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.099
 today we are going to do this course 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.689
 It's because Valentine came and I 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.310
 I know that many of you want to give 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.689
 something that is beautiful that is not very 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.880
 expensive but the truth more than anything 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.040
 because it is with love and it is this little box of 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.260
 Look, it's super nice, I love it 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.059
 says the ocu can be customized as 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.290
 you really want to have these 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.480
 small bottles for example this one has 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.579
 chocolates you can put a message 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.680
 who wants it can be for a friend to 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.690
 a boyfriend or for you to want in 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.520
 reality and this is what it has 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.800
 candice and they are very many about the day 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.410
 you have little what you want you can even 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.820
 do several of these for example today is 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.230
 my birthday then I will not put 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.920
 there for everyone to do what 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.510
 want 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.980
 so if I'm recording this video 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.510
 today same day as my birthday so 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.360
 this is a little bit the usual I'm waiting for 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.339
 the people that come but if I want to 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.009
 my channel and I am so committed to 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.820
 what if then if we are going to start 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.100
 with what we need 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.990
 if you subscribe here below me 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.700
 it seems that it is in this part of here and of 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.320
 those comments but especially 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.880
 subscribe so they can get more 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.740
 of these videos and below facebook and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.180
 twitter on the bottom and so 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.070
 we start with what we need 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.840
 we will need bond sheets or if 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.840
 prefer cardboard wrapping paper 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.350
 audit colors like these scissors 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.090
 glue and tempera or white enamel a 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.220
 marker or black down synths 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.170
 colors and I'm using pink and red 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.580
 a six pack of bottles in this case 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.710
 I'm using these bottles of 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.479
 beer but they could also be from that 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.460
 natural juice that also have these 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.050
 little bottles and candies cookies or 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.000
 chocolates to fill our 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.250
 little bottles or whatever you like to that 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.380
 person let's start by vacating the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.060
 pack when we have already vacated 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.979
 our pack what we are going to do is 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.810
 cover it with pretty leaves and what 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.890
 let's do is start measuring and doing 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.890
 everything agrees 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.599
 we have to cover all our box and 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.890
 make it white and 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.890
 we started to paste it 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.290
 go more slowly 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.099
 is to place the gift paper but what 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.349
 What we have to do is see the 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.599
 edge then let's cut some 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.040
 rectangles of the same size and then they 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.540
 let's cut some centimeters 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.540
 simply with the box 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.209
 how they see what they have cut are two 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.620
 rectangles a little smaller not 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.209
 I give them the measurements because that depends 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.010
 of the box that you have then 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.900
 something like that has to be left to us when 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.190
 let's try now the only thing we're going to 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.030
 to do is to paste it we focus it well and what 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.069
 we paste like this 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.069
 and now we do the same on each side 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.250
 the day 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.110
 that has printed some letters that I'm going to 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.200
 put in the part of the box 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.150
 then I'm going to start trimming the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.520
 placed to see how they look in this 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.710
 position and now we're just going to 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.990
 paste 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.580
 and ready and we have almost finished our 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.350
 Now let's continue with the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.970
 bottles now what we have to do 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.830
 is to clean the content of the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.780
 little bottles what they see is to wash it for 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.550
 that does not leave the taste of beer or 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.260
 of the juice that you are using we have to 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.790
 remove the covers very carefully to 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.680
 that do not get messed up because this is going to 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.360
 serve then as you can see I have 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.460
 to give them little boats and these washes 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.620
 while they start to dry what I'm going 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.900
 to do is take the badges and go to 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.320
 painting they ate Maltese or with tempera 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.320
 white 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.370
 list the caps have almost already 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.230
 stayed and now we're going to leave this for 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.090
 the end now what we are going to do is 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.490
 put some message in this little bottle 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.860
 like for example sweet then what 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.360
 we put the lie like that now we're going to 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.130
 put with the same paper that we have 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.930
 used as for example with these 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.790
 Let's put the message 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.260
 over and then we're going to create a 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.260
 Larger and prettier label 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.480
 I 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.290
 and there it is 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:29.020
 but 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.020
 who does 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.920
 6 am new distance and now we just 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.510
 it is necessary to paste the labels covering the 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.510
 part where the brand says 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.970
 remember to press a little so you do not 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.980
 is going to take off 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.980
 take this turn 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.500
 and more vivid sights 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.040
 Now came the most fun moment 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.230
 is fill more I think so we're going to 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.420
 choose the sweets the sweets that you 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.640
 you want me I have more cookies 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.290
 and I'm going to fill in that and that one here 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.670
 example put him more or less in the part 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.620
 from below and since above I'm going to put 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.060
 chocolate so they can mix and give you 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.690
 ideas of whatever and me 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.690
 no no 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.700
 that is not 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.360
 ready as you can see we have finished 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.060
 of filling the bottles then what 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.460
 let's do now is close it well 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.590
 then I'm going to take a pebble or a 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.819
 hammer I have a pebble and what 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.639
 only thing that we are going to do is press 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.530
 so that this is not going to get wet 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.870
 we put it well and we tap it 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.910
 look, it's not going to leave now 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.069
 for the final details I have these 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.050
 colorful ribbons what I'm going to do is 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:01.110
 make little bows on top 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.740
 then I'm just going to place like this and 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.740
 make my little god 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.830
 kashmiri 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.050
 three days 6 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.729
 ah 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.530
 and, as you can see, it has 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.870
 can not put a bow can not 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.150
 to put the truth to him this is an idea that 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.699
 gypsies ended up staying like this and now what 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.970
 only thing I'm going to do is place my 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:28.680
 sweet milestones and we would have something like 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.250
 this a super gift for someone who 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.250
