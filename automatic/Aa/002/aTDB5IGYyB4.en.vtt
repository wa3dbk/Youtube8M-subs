00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.839 
alright so this is a shooting test for
these<00:02:21.840> two<00:02:22.019> guns<00:02:22.200> let's<00:02:22.980> start<00:02:23.340> off<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
these two guns let's start off with the

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.420 
these two guns let's start off with the
black<00:02:24.030> one<00:02:24.239> where<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.599> intended<00:02:25.430> given

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
black one where is it intended given

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.839 
black one where is it intended given
you're<00:02:26.549> going<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.879> hold<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:28.579> don't<00:02:29.579> drop<00:02:29.819> it

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
you're going to hold this don't drop it

you're going to hold this don't drop it
don't<00:02:30.030> drop<00:02:30.269> it<00:02:31.340> alright<00:02:32.340> so<00:02:32.400> there's<00:02:32.879> three

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
don't drop it alright so there's three

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.180 
don't drop it alright so there's three
bullets<00:02:33.480> in<00:02:33.599> this<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:34.349> three<00:02:34.620> not<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.040> waste

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
bullets in this just three not to waste

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.630 
bullets in this just three not to waste
anything<00:02:39.709> so<00:02:40.709> as<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:40.950> see<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.430> pretty

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
anything so as you can see it's pretty

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.460 
anything so as you can see it's pretty
it's<00:02:42.329> pretty<00:02:42.440> accurate<00:02:48.019> right<00:02:49.019> that<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.319> for

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
it's pretty accurate right that was for

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.620 
it's pretty accurate right that was for
the<00:02:49.530> black<00:02:49.709> one

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
the black one

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.160 
the black one
can<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.650> though<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:54.060> black<00:02:54.270> one<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.870> did

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
can you though the black one it did

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.010 
can you though the black one it did
those<00:02:56.100> three<00:02:56.430> holes<00:02:56.730> I'm<00:02:57.450> not<00:02:57.630> sure<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:57.930> they

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
those three holes I'm not sure if they

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.070 
those three holes I'm not sure if they
are<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.770> holes<00:02:59.330> but<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.390> think<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.810> middle<00:03:00.990> one

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
are the holes but I think the middle one

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.950 
are the holes but I think the middle one
is<00:03:01.140> probably<00:03:01.290> dent<00:03:01.680> but<00:03:02.340> anyways<00:03:02.670> let's<00:03:03.630> go

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
is probably dent but anyways let's go

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.260 
is probably dent but anyways let's go
with<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.500> silver<00:03:05.130> one<00:03:05.280> hold<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.270> again

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
with the silver one hold this again

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:15.320 
with the silver one hold this again
there's<00:03:09.270> three<00:03:09.540> bullets<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:09.960> this<00:03:10.080> -<00:03:13.640> I<00:03:14.640> was

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
there's three bullets in this - I was

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:26.240 
there's three bullets in this - I was
pretty<00:03:15.540> United<00:03:16.140> Wow

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.170 

so<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.730> new<00:03:27.910> holes<00:03:28.210> I<00:03:28.660> think<00:03:29.470> it's<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.760> one

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
so the new holes I think it's this one

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.510 
so the new holes I think it's this one
this<00:03:31.750> one<00:03:32.050> and<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.350> one<00:03:32.380> all<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.680> way<00:03:32.860> up<00:03:32.950> here

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
this one and the one all the way up here

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.600 
this one and the one all the way up here
that's<00:03:34.150> pretty<00:03:34.420> inaccurate<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:36.160> I<00:03:36.280> think

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
that's pretty inaccurate but I think

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.760 
that's pretty inaccurate but I think
it's<00:03:36.790> just<00:03:37.110> might<00:03:38.110> have<00:03:38.230> been<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.380> misfire<00:03:38.740> or

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
it's just might have been a misfire or

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.150 
it's just might have been a misfire or
something<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:39.400> I'm<00:03:39.550> not<00:03:39.670> happen<00:03:40.030> but<00:03:41.160> it's

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160
