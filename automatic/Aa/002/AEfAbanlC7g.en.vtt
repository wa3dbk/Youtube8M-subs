00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
all right and here is the video

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:34.189 
all right and here is the video
go

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:34.199 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.910 

moving<00:00:34.710> back<00:00:34.859> a<00:00:34.890> little<00:00:35.160> bit

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
moving back a little bit

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.069 
moving back a little bit
but<00:00:37.550> anyway<00:00:37.850> after<00:00:38.210> installing<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.719> headers

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
but anyway after installing the headers

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.979 
but anyway after installing the headers
the<00:00:39.230> car<00:00:39.410> is<00:00:39.559> much<00:00:39.769> much<00:00:40.489> louder<00:00:41.000> than<00:00:41.690> it<00:00:41.719> used

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
the car is much much louder than it used

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.670 
the car is much much louder than it used
to<00:00:42.109> be<00:00:42.170> which<00:00:42.649> is<00:00:42.679> fine

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.020 

that<00:00:48.129> was<00:00:48.280> feels<00:00:48.550> a<00:00:48.730> little<00:00:48.820> bit<00:00:49.059> faster<00:00:49.930> but

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that was feels a little bit faster but

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:11.360 
that was feels a little bit faster but
maybe<00:00:52.030> not

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.970 

hope<00:01:11.910> you<00:01:12.030> guys<00:01:12.150> can<00:01:12.390> hear<00:01:12.450> me<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.770> most

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
hope you guys can hear me but the most

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.520 
hope you guys can hear me but the most
recent<00:01:14.460> work<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.970> we've<00:01:15.180> done<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.170> car

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
recent work that we've done on this car

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.270 
recent work that we've done on this car
is<00:01:17.090> I'll<00:01:18.090> show<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.420> really<00:01:18.540> quick<00:01:19.280> that

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
is I'll show you really quick that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.030 
is I'll show you really quick that
temperature<00:01:20.970> gauge<00:01:21.150> right<00:01:21.480> there<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.650> notice

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
temperature gauge right there you notice

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.880 
temperature gauge right there you notice
how<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.490> only<00:01:23.670> goes<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.120> 250<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.680> was

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
how it only goes to 250 the one that was

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.910 
how it only goes to 250 the one that was
in<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.280> car

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
in this car

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.750 
in this car
went<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.010> 280<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.300> apparently<00:01:30.600> from<00:01:31.560> 74<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.370> 76

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
went to 280 so apparently from 74 to 76

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.480 
went to 280 so apparently from 74 to 76
they<00:01:33.180> had<00:01:33.270> engaged<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.660> went<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.870> 280<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.890> 72

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
they had engaged I went to 280 from 72

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.420 
they had engaged I went to 280 from 72
to<00:01:35.700> 73<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.540> had<00:01:36.660> one<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.930> went<00:01:37.080> to<00:01:37.110> 250<00:01:37.650> so

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
to 73 they had one that went to 250 so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.250 
to 73 they had one that went to 250 so
the<00:01:38.790> issue<00:01:38.910> I<00:01:39.060> was<00:01:39.150> having<00:01:39.570> with<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
the issue I was having with the one that

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.630 
the issue I was having with the one that
the<00:01:40.350> previous<00:01:40.710> owner<00:01:40.890> put<00:01:40.980> in<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.430> was

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the previous owner put in which was

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.030 
the previous owner put in which was
wrong<00:01:41.970> was<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:43.020> fact<00:01:43.260> that<00:01:43.350> would<00:01:43.530> only<00:01:43.650> read

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
wrong was the fact that would only read

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.330 
wrong was the fact that would only read
up<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:45.170> 150<00:01:46.170> degrees<00:01:46.200> when<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.740> car<00:01:47.010> was<00:01:47.160> hot

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
up to 150 degrees when the car was hot

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
up to 150 degrees when the car was hot
and<00:01:47.520> obviously<00:01:48.000> especially<00:01:48.690> if<00:01:49.080> you're

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and obviously especially if you're

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.170 
and obviously especially if you're
driving<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.590> big-block<00:01:49.890> Chevy<00:01:50.370> there's<00:01:50.850> no<00:01:51.030> way

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
driving a big-block Chevy there's no way

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.260 
driving a big-block Chevy there's no way
that<00:01:51.420> your<00:01:51.600> car<00:01:51.810> runs<00:01:52.080> at<00:01:52.680> 150<00:01:53.280> degrees<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:54.060> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that your car runs at 150 degrees so I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.990 
that your car runs at 150 degrees so I
threw<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.810> gauge<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.490> still<00:01:56.790> runs

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
threw that gauge in and it still runs

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.230 
threw that gauge in and it still runs
the<00:01:57.090> same<00:01:57.360> which<00:01:58.400> makes<00:01:59.400> me<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.910> that<00:02:00.000> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the same which makes me think that the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.820 
the same which makes me think that the
gauge<00:02:00.420> wasn't<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.870> problem<00:02:01.230> at<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.470> the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
gauge wasn't the problem at all the

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.190 
gauge wasn't the problem at all the
gauges<00:02:02.010> are<00:02:02.310> probably<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.760> same<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.750> problem

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
gauges are probably the same the problem

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.740 
gauges are probably the same the problem
is<00:02:04.350> actually<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.040> sending<00:02:05.460> unit<00:02:05.820> that's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
is actually with the sending unit that's

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.919 
is actually with the sending unit that's
stuck<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.350> side<00:02:07.560> of<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.770> head<00:02:08.600> on<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.780> big

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
stuck in the side of the head on the big

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.200 
stuck in the side of the head on the big
block<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.030> mail

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
block so that is now in the mail

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.700 
block so that is now in the mail
hopefully<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.900> correct<00:02:13.200> one<00:02:13.410> which<00:02:13.560> will

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
hopefully the correct one which will

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.970 
hopefully the correct one which will
make<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:15.300> gauge<00:02:15.540> read<00:02:15.930> right<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.470> problem

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
make the gauge read right the problem

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.010 
make the gauge read right the problem
I've<00:02:17.130> been<00:02:17.160> having<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.450> don't<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.780> what

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
I've been having is I don't know what

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
I've been having is I don't know what
year<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:20.130> 454<00:02:20.820> came<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.780> what<00:02:21.870> your<00:02:22.110> car<00:02:22.620> truck

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
year the 454 came or what your car truck

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.950 
year the 454 came or what your car truck
or<00:02:23.070> who<00:02:23.370> knows<00:02:23.550> what

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
or who knows what

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.670 
or who knows what
my<00:02:25.500> 454<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.240> could<00:02:27.390> be<00:02:27.540> 60<00:02:28.290> something

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
my 454 is so it could be 60 something

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.150 
my 454 is so it could be 60 something
Chevy<00:02:29.010> all<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> way<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.540> late<00:02:30.540> 70s<00:02:31.260> Chevy<00:02:31.950> who

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
Chevy all the way to late 70s Chevy who

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.760 
Chevy all the way to late 70s Chevy who
knows<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:35.640> let's<00:02:35.820> forget<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.120> fixed

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
knows but let's forget that fixed

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.440 
knows but let's forget that fixed
hopefully<00:02:37.770> we'll<00:02:38.220> rewrite<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.880> reason<00:02:39.240> why<00:02:39.420> I

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
hopefully we'll rewrite the reason why I

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.930 
hopefully we'll rewrite the reason why I
want<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> fixed<00:02:40.170> now<00:02:40.320> is<00:02:40.770> because<00:02:41.010> everybody

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
want it fixed now is because everybody

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.360 
want it fixed now is because everybody
knows<00:02:42.150> Texas<00:02:42.660> summers<00:02:42.990> are<00:02:43.140> hot<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.340> don't

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
knows Texas summers are hot and I don't

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.940 
knows Texas summers are hot and I don't
want<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.700> overheat<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.870> also<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.410> electric

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
want to overheat we also have electric

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.300 
want to overheat we also have electric
fans<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.520> install

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.280 

sometime<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.300> summer<00:02:51.510> we're<00:02:51.959> going<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.170> get

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
sometime this summer we're going to get

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.230 
sometime this summer we're going to get
to<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.610> way<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:53.850> believe<00:02:54.060> my

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
to it and that way I can believe my

one more thing this right here is a 2014

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.420 
one more thing this right here is a 2014
Camaro<00:05:38.360> and<00:05:39.230> if<00:05:39.440> you<00:05:39.560> notice<00:05:39.890> the<00:05:40.010> taillights

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
Camaro and if you notice the taillights

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.070 
Camaro and if you notice the taillights
they're<00:05:41.000> a<00:05:41.030> little<00:05:41.300> bit<00:05:41.600> different<00:05:41.930> than<00:05:42.020> the

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 
they're a little bit different than the

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.200 
they're a little bit different than the
one<00:05:42.200> that<00:05:42.230> used<00:05:42.470> to<00:05:42.530> be<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:43.250> reason<00:05:43.430> being<00:05:43.880> I

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
one that used to be the reason being I

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.200 
one that used to be the reason being I
think<00:05:44.720> is<00:05:45.710> that<00:05:46.010> they<00:05:46.190> were<00:05:46.250> way<00:05:46.490> too<00:05:46.520> close<00:05:46.970> to

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
think is that they were way too close to

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.110 
think is that they were way too close to
what<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.450> 2014<00:05:48.110> Corvette<00:05:48.290> looked<00:05:48.740> like<00:05:49.120> and

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
what the 2014 Corvette looked like and

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.340 
what the 2014 Corvette looked like and
so<00:05:50.150> they<00:05:50.390> changed<00:05:50.690> them<00:05:50.840> because<00:05:51.050> people<00:05:51.080> were

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
so they changed them because people were

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.200 
so they changed them because people were
complaining<00:05:51.650> so<00:05:52.520> instead<00:05:52.730> of<00:05:52.790> changing<00:05:53.030> the

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
complaining so instead of changing the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.720 
complaining so instead of changing the
Corvettes<00:05:53.570> taillights<00:05:54.280> they<00:05:55.280> change<00:05:55.610> the

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
Corvettes taillights they change the

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.670 
Corvettes taillights they change the
camara<00:05:56.210> light<00:05:56.300> so<00:05:56.450> people<00:05:56.600> stop<00:05:56.870> complaining

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
camara light so people stop complaining

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.740 
camara light so people stop complaining
about<00:05:57.740> it<00:05:58.040> I<00:05:58.250> think<00:05:59.150> they<00:05:59.420> looked<00:05:59.600> the<00:05:59.720> same

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
about it I think they looked the same

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.350 
about it I think they looked the same
before<00:06:00.410> but<00:06:00.830> now<00:06:01.460> nobody<00:06:01.790> has<00:06:01.970> nothing<00:06:02.300> to

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
before but now nobody has nothing to

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.590 
before but now nobody has nothing to
complain<00:06:02.420> about<00:06:02.780> because<00:06:03.110> they<00:06:03.740> change<00:06:04.040> them

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
complain about because they change them

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.370 
complain about because they change them
so<00:06:05.600> just<00:06:06.560> thought<00:06:06.710> I'd<00:06:06.830> point<00:06:07.040> that<00:06:07.220> out
