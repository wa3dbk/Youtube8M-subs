this<00:00:05.430> is<00:00:05.700> SST<00:00:06.600> versus<00:00:07.470> SST<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.990> have<00:00:09.990> Samsung

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
this is SST versus SST I have Samsung

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.580 
this is SST versus SST I have Samsung
SSD<00:00:11.870> 840<00:00:12.870> series<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.790> I<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:14.940> SanDisk<00:00:15.590> SDS

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590

sdtv<00:00:18.109> 2800<00:00:19.109> bytes<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.100> one<00:00:20.430> that's

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
sdtv 2800 bytes which is this one that's

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.109 
sdtv 2800 bytes which is this one that's
the<00:00:20.910> Samsung<00:00:21.330> one<00:00:21.510> some<00:00:22.500> someone<00:00:22.830> is

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
the Samsung one some someone is

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.120 
the Samsung one some someone is
encrypted<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.720> will<00:00:24.930> be<00:00:25.109> slightly<00:00:25.439> slower

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
encrypted so it will be slightly slower

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.519 
encrypted so it will be slightly slower
than<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.550> actually<00:00:26.760> is

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
than it actually is

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.919 
than it actually is
I<00:00:28.560> mean<00:00:29.160> my<00:00:29.340> windows<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.910> encrypting<00:00:30.660> stuff

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
I mean my windows is encrypting stuff

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.799 
I mean my windows is encrypting stuff
but<00:00:31.500> nevertheless<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.300> real<00:00:33.510> speeds

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
but nevertheless I know the real speeds

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.530 
but nevertheless I know the real speeds
anyway<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.260> I'm<00:00:34.590> going<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.950> tell<00:00:35.880> how<00:00:36.120> fast<00:00:36.329> it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
anyway so I'm going to tell how fast it

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.470 
anyway so I'm going to tell how fast it
actually<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.820> let's<00:00:38.820> start<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.180> I'm<00:00:39.300> going

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
actually is but let's start it I'm going

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
actually is but let's start it I'm going
to<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.899> by<00:00:39.930> one<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
to do it one by one I have to do the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.139 
to do it one by one I have to do the
tools<00:00:42.390> open<00:00:43.079> just<00:00:43.920> side<00:00:44.160> by<00:00:44.340> side<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.879> can

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
tools open just side by side so you can

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.869 
tools open just side by side so you can
see<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.629> results<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.379> don't<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.980> reset

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
see it results and I don't have to reset

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.990 
see it results and I don't have to reset
them<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.950> let's<00:00:49.950> start<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> SSD

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
them and let's start with the SSD

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.299 
them and let's start with the SSD
benchmark<00:00:51.660> tool<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.110> I'm<00:00:52.739> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.980> only<00:00:53.100> do

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
benchmark tool and I'm going to only do

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.840 
benchmark tool and I'm going to only do
the<00:00:53.550> sequential<00:00:54.420> one<00:00:54.559> not<00:00:55.559> any<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.100> these<00:00:56.309> so

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the sequential one not any of these so

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.849 
the sequential one not any of these so
let's<00:00:57.090> start<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.170> samsung<00:00:58.620> SSD

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
let's start this is the samsung SSD

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:18.679 
let's start this is the samsung SSD
first

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.980 

well<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.499> some<00:01:19.740> reason<00:01:20.159> my<00:01:20.280> screen<00:01:20.670> recorder

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
well on some reason my screen recorder

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.200 
well on some reason my screen recorder
seriously<00:01:21.990> messing<00:01:22.469> with<00:01:22.499> the<00:01:23.030> results<00:01:24.030> as

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
seriously messing with the results as

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090 
seriously messing with the results as
you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.659> it's<00:01:24.810> different<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.649> I<00:01:25.679> stop

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you can see it's different when I stop

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.219 
you can see it's different when I stop
the<00:01:26.130> screen<00:01:26.520> recording<00:01:26.969> and<00:01:27.179> no<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.020> not

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the screen recording and no it's not

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.990 
the screen recording and no it's not
recording<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.250> s/t<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.670> don't<00:01:29.909> know

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
recording on to this s/t I don't know

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.569 
recording on to this s/t I don't know
why<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.659> doing<00:01:30.899> that<00:01:31.079> but<00:01:31.950> I'm<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.459> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
why it's doing that but I'm going to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.139 
why it's doing that but I'm going to
stop<00:01:32.819> it<00:01:33.000> again<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> then<00:01:34.079> run<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.799> test<00:01:36.170> and

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
stop it again and then run this test and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.449 
stop it again and then run this test and
here<00:01:39.149> you<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.539> it<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:40.349> Sun<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.859> is<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
here you have it the Sun this is the

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:44.240 
here you have it the Sun this is the
winner<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.420> then<00:01:42.630> that's<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.020> group<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.469> it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
winner but then that's in group that it

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.719 
winner but then that's in group that it
goes<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.849> 400<00:01:45.539> that<00:01:45.780> read<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.319> up<00:01:46.709> to<00:01:46.859> 250

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
goes up to 400 that read and up to 250

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.749 
goes up to 400 that read and up to 250
right<00:01:47.969> actually<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:49.069> this<00:01:50.069> is<00:01:50.250> why<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.579> have

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
right actually and this is why we have

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.580 
right actually and this is why we have
another<00:01:51.090> tool<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.599> here<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.989> I'm<00:01:52.319> going<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
another tool in here and I'm going to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.949 
another tool in here and I'm going to
run<00:01:52.739> the<00:01:53.250> tests<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:53.969> then<00:01:54.450> I'm<00:01:54.569> gonna<00:01:54.719> shoot

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
run the tests and then I'm gonna shoot

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.899 
run the tests and then I'm gonna shoot
results<00:01:55.469> as<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.799> said<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> screen<00:01:56.369> recorder

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
results as I said the screen recorder

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.969 
results as I said the screen recorder
it's<00:01:57.149> seriously<00:01:57.599> message<00:01:57.989> two<00:01:58.110> results<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.649> so

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it's seriously message two results up so

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.190 
it's seriously message two results up so
I'm<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.399> pause<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.450> wallow<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.959> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
I'm going to pause it to wallow to the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.460 
I'm going to pause it to wallow to the
distance<00:02:07.970> area<00:02:08.970> has<00:02:09.149> results<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:10.079> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
distance area has results for the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.509 
distance area has results for the
Samsung<00:02:11.220> SSD<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:12.750> does<00:02:13.019> go<00:02:13.260> up<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.650> like<00:02:13.799> 250

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
Samsung SSD it does go up to like 250

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.150 
Samsung SSD it does go up to like 250
I'm<00:02:15.239> wrong<00:02:15.540> about<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.170> think<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.769> actually

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
I'm wrong about that I think it actually

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.599 
I'm wrong about that I think it actually
said<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.430> them<00:02:18.090> read<00:02:19.049> speed<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.590> 500<00:02:19.920> and

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
said that them read speed is 500 and

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.449 
said that them read speed is 500 and
right<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.359> 300<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.440> think<00:02:22.859> that's<00:02:23.040> what<00:02:23.250> they

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
right is 300 I think that's what they

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.900 
right is 300 I think that's what they
advertised<00:02:24.230> but<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.650> think<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.400> encryption

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
advertised but I think the encryption

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.300 
advertised but I think the encryption
has<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.090> lot<00:02:27.359> to<00:02:27.389> do<00:02:27.630> with<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.930> even<00:02:28.859> though<00:02:29.099> it

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
has a lot to do with it even though it

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.910 
has a lot to do with it even though it
shouldn't<00:02:29.639> go<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.329> much<00:02:30.750> down<00:02:31.139> maybe<00:02:31.650> it's

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
shouldn't go that much down maybe it's

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.620 
shouldn't go that much down maybe it's
because<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.340> windows<00:02:32.639> installed<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.420> then

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
because the windows installed on it then

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.259 
because the windows installed on it then
maybe<00:02:34.169> it's<00:02:34.380> doing<00:02:34.650> something<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.040> know<00:02:35.269> but

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
maybe it's doing something I know but

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.089 
maybe it's doing something I know but
let's<00:02:36.569> move<00:02:36.750> on<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.349> SanDisk

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
let's move on to the SanDisk

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.020 
let's move on to the SanDisk
on<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:39.410> crystal<00:02:40.410> disk<00:02:40.650> mark<00:02:40.950> let's<00:02:41.819> see<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
on the crystal disk mark let's see the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.849 
on the crystal disk mark let's see the
results<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.630> should<00:02:42.900> get<00:02:43.169> a<00:02:43.230> little<00:02:43.470> bit

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
results it should get a little bit

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.860 
results it should get a little bit
better<00:02:44.099> than<00:02:44.370> these<00:02:44.549> but<00:02:45.090> let's<00:02:45.419> see<00:02:47.720> here<00:02:48.720> you

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
better than these but let's see here you

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.199 
better than these but let's see here you
have<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.230> final<00:02:49.560> results<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.760> sound<00:02:51.000> is

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
have the final results so the sound is

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.259 
have the final results so the sound is
well<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.829> lot<00:02:52.980> faster<00:02:53.280> than<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.030> Samsung

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
well it's a lot faster than the Samsung

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.530 
well it's a lot faster than the Samsung
one<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:55.099> made<00:02:56.099> these<00:02:56.310> beats<00:02:56.639> they<00:02:56.970> are<00:02:57.090> really

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
one I made these beats they are really

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.710 
one I made these beats they are really
good<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.959> could<00:02:58.530> actually<00:02:58.709> crypt<00:02:59.609> it<00:02:59.910> or<00:03:00.150> try<00:03:00.660> it

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
good I could actually crypt it or try it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.180 
good I could actually crypt it or try it
in<00:03:00.959> true<00:03:01.230> crypt<00:03:01.940> right<00:03:02.940> great<00:03:03.419> I<00:03:04.319> really<00:03:04.530> feel

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
in true crypt right great I really feel

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.650 
in true crypt right great I really feel
like

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
like

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.900 
like
to<00:03:05.780> get<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.260> know<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:07.070> doesn't<00:03:07.250> have<00:03:07.490> that<00:03:07.640> much

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
to get I know it doesn't have that much

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.820 
to get I know it doesn't have that much
difference<00:03:08.360> it's<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.780> start<00:03:09.230> maybe<00:03:09.410> like<00:03:09.620> 10

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
difference it's a start maybe like 10

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.720 
difference it's a start maybe like 10
percent<00:03:09.950> maximum<00:03:11.710> but<00:03:12.710> yeah<00:03:12.980> this<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:13.520> tool

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
percent maximum but yeah this this tool

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.550 
percent maximum but yeah this this tool
has<00:03:13.940> different<00:03:14.300> results<00:03:14.690> but<00:03:14.930> there<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.410> it

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
has different results but there is it

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.180 
has different results but there is it
both<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.580> drives<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:18.650> is<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:18.890> little<00:03:19.070> bit

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
both of the drives this is a little bit

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.650 
both of the drives this is a little bit
slow<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.550> what's<00:03:19.940> wrong<00:03:20.150> with<00:03:20.210> it

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
slow and what's wrong with it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.810 
slow and what's wrong with it
I<00:03:20.690> mean<00:03:21.110> my<00:03:21.260> external<00:03:21.890> USB<00:03:22.040> hard<00:03:22.280> drive<00:03:22.700> is

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
I mean my external USB hard drive is

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
I mean my external USB hard drive is
about<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.180> same<00:03:23.360> speed<00:03:25.210> but<00:03:26.210> there<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.750> have

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
about the same speed but there you have

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.580 
about the same speed but there you have
it<00:03:26.990> two<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.800> SSDs
