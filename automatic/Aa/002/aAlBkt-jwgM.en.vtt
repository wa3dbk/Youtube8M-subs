00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040
 although it costs and although late I am a 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.900
 man of word but has Christmas 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.210
 I want to start buying less books 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.549
 but then it turns out that it has not been like that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.980
 This month I finally got I 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.160
 managed to buy very few books like this 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.130
 I'm going to do both the inm 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.130
 as in April rapa in the same video 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.010
 I start with the books that I bought and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.470
 the first is one that I saw in the uis 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.809
 adsense list I'll leave your twitter for 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.540
 here and good is that it says that always 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.750
 I named in my videos to check out books 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.969
 but I'm sorry it 's what it's about 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.399
 Clay fucking 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.030
 I do not remember what is going on but when 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.309
 I asked because it interested me so I hope that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.610
 I like the following book is the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.629
 Clearly then profile and you 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.730
 I talked about him in a previous video and it 's 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.530
 that the edition is different this is top 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.480
 hard and on cover 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.010
 too tiny to be a book 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.510
 hard cover but hey I think it's a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.040
 very beautiful cover and the first book 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.229
 although it is not wonderful I liked it 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.880
 quite so I hope to read soon 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.890
 the next one I had already bought it 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.960
 two months but the line when putting the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.850
 address in book and how it goes out automatically 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.340
 I sent it to my parents' house so I did not 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.580
 I could get it until I went in the week 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.229
 santa 'pies funk the rainbow is a book 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.090
 I wanted to read for a long time 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.890
 when it became so fashionable eleanor and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.170
 back at the beginning it called my attention 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.369
 but I ended up so saturated that I said no 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.840
 I 'm not going to read it in a 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.640
 time but instead fun game me 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.140
 it called a lot of attention so I 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.940
 what I bought I hope to read it very soon and 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.860

 Sincerely, total whim because 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 I saw the price you see and well I had 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.149

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.159
 loved it they already had ten negritos in one 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.380
 very old and very ugly daughter but I have not 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.970

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.860

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.860
 resist and I've bought them I've finished 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.759

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.960

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.140

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.860
 of that and I had no adventure 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.280
 interesting this time but well then I 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.310
 I bought two movies the first one is the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.440
 great paulo I saw her a day like that 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.900
 the time with crisis and I loved it and the 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.110
 I found in amazon second hand super 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.180
 cheap in 3d so do not hesitate and I the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.190
 I bought the next movie download 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.319
 the new adaptation starring 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.570
 chloë grace moretz I love the 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.310
 old movie but I love this 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.500
 book I love clore I love 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.750
 sciolismo and I loved the movie well 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.519
 that he could not not have it and finally 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.290
 I bought the third and fourth 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.690
 dr season 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.840
 the fourth has such a strange effect 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.569
 chuli 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.830
 and well I've already seen the third one I'm 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.860
 the fourth and for the moment I'm liking 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.170
 I bought a lot also this afternoon is 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.300
 little girl, it's good if you 've seen my 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.550
 video with javier del poplar you will already 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.650
 seen out there very well located and now 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.959
 we went to the part of europe the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.670
 first books we can teach them 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.530
 because I do not have them here so I'll go 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.900
 putting in here the first one is while 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.180
 I write of Steven King is a book that 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.099
 I thought it would be more manual type of 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.400
 writing but instead that has been 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.200
 more like his opinion and he had his part more 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.790
 manual type but in general it has 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.400
 liked it a lot because that's been its 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.530
 opinion does not force you to anything or tell you 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.510
 this is fine if he does not talk to you about his 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.940
 method and tells you how they do things 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.920
 and I liked the next book is the 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.810
 end of gabriela campbell's dreams and 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.170
 jose antonio cotrina is a book that I 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.840
 I liked it a lot and well, it does not seem like either 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.239
 the great wonderful work but from 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.739
 then I was not disappointed you have the review 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.629
 in the blog I know that I will put the link 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.120
 down here the next one yes I 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:59.959
 disappointed a little bit and it was 10 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.810
 adm and the one that I put a 6 of 10 and well 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.489
 this book is a kind of retailing 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.959
 modern ten of agatha negritos 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.519
 christie book that I had not read 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.470
 but good 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.690
 I read it with much desire and the truth 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.670
 is that it seems a little loose to me you have 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.230
 again the review on the blog so 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.810
 the one below and click on the next one 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.910
 is what the boy next to me reads 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.510
 novel since it came out but had not 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.530
 could of its paris version I fell in love and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.690
 I expected it to do so too and 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.460
 I think I liked it even more because I 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.110
 I think apart from the story of lola and 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.120
 cricket that I found wonderful and 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.949
 precious the fact that to anyone who 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.900
 come out throughout the novel and 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.789
 besides, much more than I thought 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.320
 is given to many points good has me 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.210
 delighted and I'm looking forward to what we 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.669
 has prepared the author with the third 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.280
 book the next book is legacy 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.229
 fourth part of the cycle the legacy is 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.030
 say the saga of aragon and good or the 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.100
 saga that I have a bit crossed the 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.220
 true because I read the book in its day and 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.289
 I fell in love if that book for me was what 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.289
 bigger but then the second one came and 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.060
 I was a little disappointed then I read a 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.510
 third and I liked a little more than the 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.730
 second 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.440
 but between that I'm not enthusiastic either 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.720
 that the author lengthened the saga of three 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.030
 books to four when there was only one 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.680
 and it was a bit disappointing because I 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.110
 they gave away the room two years ago in 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.940
 kings and had stayed there without making him 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.190
 I do not have any case but he gave me 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:21.170
 read it at Easter and at the beginning I 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.030
 cost the first 100 pages like this 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.370
 they did as very heavy but after 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.530
 I loved it and I think it's a great ending 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.380
 for the saga I would have liked maybe 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.390
 a little bit more of a happy ending but I do not know 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.060
 loved the next book I read is 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.790
 strong gene pointing in the monthly 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.860
 which is the fourth part of the saga looks 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.900
 I already told you about it in some video and 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.760
 Well, I have been reading this 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.560
 book and I will tell you because it has 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.330
 delighted I think it's the best of the 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.310
 saga this moment although the third one was 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.680
 a tad weaker this seems to me 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.600
 undoubtedly surpasses the previous ones and good 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.700
 I'm wishing you read it will come out in 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.070
 Spanish in a little bit so it's 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.860
 and finally leigh anne abundance of 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.560
 catherine is from yong lim is the third 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.510
 Book of Jon I think is also the one that 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.400
 least I liked everything has been said 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.090
 but that does not mean that I have not 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.290
 liked 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.940
 the way of writing actually very well 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.800
 it's wonderful your characters are 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.020
 cool again I have many pages 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.460
 marked although perhaps not as many as 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.680
 the previous ones but I liked it 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.419
 much and even if it is the one that has least 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.300
 I liked the author without a doubt I recommend it 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:27.290
 because it is very good it is wonderful and 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.090
 up to here the April raptor inm 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:32.530
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.530
 in the next video goodbye 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.979
 and you
