00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.510
 then girls I did one before 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:33.720
 passed by enamel cover right for not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.030
 stay the type let's say white me and then 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.090
 I'm going to prepare in black 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:43.090
 home effect taking of the builder 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.620
 white monophasic what you have e 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.000
 mixing it with the black gel will 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.860
 I recommend mixing a little at a time 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.510
 the color to make you realize 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.399
 to do it neither too dark nor too much 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.300
 clear 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.219
 I'm going to do the first glaze 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:16.180
 trying to distribute the product in 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:18.070
 homogeneous way and not leave lines after 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.710
 having done the first pass I do 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.619
 catalyze 30 seconds and then I'll do the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:34.860
 second to give the effect stocking roof 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:37.539
 veiled the right color after doing 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.000
 catalyze begins to prepare pounds 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.000
 shingo of the black bild that is that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.100
 which in a dispersion and therefore a 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.880
 that point once the type has been catalyzed 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.880
 I'm going to degrease it 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.980
 so that later I will not have to put 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:08.259
 final polish and thus have a design of 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:12.460
 relief with the brush precisely at 0 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:16.870
 I go around the whole nail only 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.900
 contours trying to be more precise 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.900
 possible 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:47.120
 I catalyze thirty seconds later e 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:51.270
 then we can proceed with the dots 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.060
 in case we would like to do something 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.790
 stronger in particular as it does go to 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:02.360
 make me doodles something more 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.360
 nice let's say instead of the classics can 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.890
 hybrid bild brushing and you can do 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.810
 quietly all the nail art without 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.340
 need to catalyze because it remains 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:24.020
 where it is highly pigmented and after not 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.020
 no need to put the polish 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.910
 once the nail art is yours 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.430
 liking put on catalyzing and the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.070
 final result this I hope the 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.590
 video you enjoyed that I can 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.100
 a kiss to all be useful thanks 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.100
