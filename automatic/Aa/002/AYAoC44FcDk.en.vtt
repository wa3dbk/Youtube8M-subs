again I mean I'm in a lot of season-long

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.650 
again I mean I'm in a lot of season-long
drafts<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:30.610> year<00:02:30.910> especially<00:02:31.090> with<00:02:31.540> the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
drafts and this year especially with the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.990 
drafts and this year especially with the
injuries<00:02:32.110> both<00:02:32.980> my<00:02:33.220> teams<00:02:33.280> are<00:02:33.610> done<00:02:33.790> already
