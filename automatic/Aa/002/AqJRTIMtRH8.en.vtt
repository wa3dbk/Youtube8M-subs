back<00:01:07.110> quite<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.090> doesn't<00:01:09.360> look

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
back quite a bit so it doesn't look

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.190 
back quite a bit so it doesn't look
quite<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.950> as<00:01:11.030> saturated<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.240> color<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.900> this

does<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:15.890> now<00:01:16.890> I've<00:01:17.009> chosen<00:01:17.250> where<00:01:17.520> I

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
does right here now I've chosen where I

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.980 
does right here now I've chosen where I
want<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.880> lighting<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.330> come<00:01:18.360> from<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:20.960> drew<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
want the lighting to come from I drew a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.300 
want the lighting to come from I drew a
little<00:01:22.080> arrow<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.710> myself<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.220> could

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
little arrow for myself so I could

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.160 
little arrow for myself so I could
remember<00:01:23.580> where<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.030> light<00:01:24.330> comes<00:01:24.600> from

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.510 

since<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> light<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> left<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
since the light is on the left all the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160 
since the light is on the left all the
shadows<00:01:30.060> are<00:01:30.090> gonna<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> right<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
shadows are gonna be on the right and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.990

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.780 
lightly just flicking the marker across
the<00:02:11.959> windows<00:02:14.470> I'm<00:02:15.470> lightly<00:02:15.830> tacking<00:02:16.459> down<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
the windows I'm lightly tacking down the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.809 
the windows I'm lightly tacking down the
background<00:02:17.209> papers<00:02:17.660> from<00:02:18.019> authentique<00:02:18.819> and

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
background papers from authentique and

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:20.949 
background papers from authentique and
the<00:02:19.910> reason<00:02:20.180> is<00:02:20.269> because<00:02:20.299> I'm<00:02:20.540> going<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.720> sew

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
the reason is because I'm going to sew

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.390 
the reason is because I'm going to sew
around<00:02:21.140> them<00:02:21.530> so<00:02:21.560> I'm<00:02:21.709> barely<00:02:21.920> putting<00:02:22.220> any

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
around them so I'm barely putting any

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.890 
around them so I'm barely putting any
adhesive<00:02:22.760> on<00:02:23.090> because<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.360> don't<00:02:23.540> really<00:02:23.660> need

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
adhesive on because I don't really need

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.039 
adhesive on because I don't really need
much<00:02:24.140> these<00:02:25.100> hand<00:02:25.489> cuts<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.299> pieces<00:02:26.810> are

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
much these hand cuts and pieces are

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.380 
much these hand cuts and pieces are
basil<00:02:27.319> that<00:02:27.769> is<00:02:28.130> just<00:02:28.459> edged<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:29.000> little<00:02:29.239> bit

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390

with<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.810> slight<00:02:30.350> bit<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.590> ink<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.190> you'll<00:02:32.000> see

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
with a slight bit of ink and you'll see

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.780 
with a slight bit of ink and you'll see
why<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.480> wanted<00:02:33.110> these<00:02:33.350> particular<00:02:34.220> layers<00:02:34.430> to

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
why I wanted these particular layers to

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.520 
why I wanted these particular layers to
be<00:02:34.880> lightly<00:02:35.209> tacked<00:02:35.630> down<00:02:35.750> in<00:02:36.080> just<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.380> minute
