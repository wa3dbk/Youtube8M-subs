00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.699
 in two laboratories using 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.490
 serum that comes from south america which 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.050
 has no particularity is that they 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.849
 could easily be used for 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.660
 most of the cells we use 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.660
 in the research laboratory 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.680
 I have been using serum since I 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.570
 works on cells 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.820
 that is to say for eight years but in 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.489
 this lab the serum we have 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.079
 put in place is used by the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.440
 people since the month of january 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.440
 this year 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.480
 the application for the sera and the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.969
 cell culture our unit develops 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.320
 approaches combining physical 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.120
 chemistry and biology 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.789
 to study the mechanisms 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.039
 cell it goes from the molecule 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.690
 unique to cellular functions in 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:08.539
 going through the collective behavior 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.100
 cells in the tissues 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.440
 so we work with cells 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.090
 human and an animal cell so 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.090
 to study these different approaches 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.630
 serum brings nutrients from 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.550
 growth factors and vitamins 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.650
 to the cells that allows them to exercise 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.540
 their primary functions like the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.790
 growth the proliferation and the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.920
 differentiation the serum is so 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.090
 essential to the cells to be able 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.090
 perform our experiments 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.550
 without serum the cells can not 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.170
 perform their primary duties if 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.870
 we do not compensate the middle 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.710
 with serum will not be able to perform 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.710
 our experiences 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.270
 before using the serum for the 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.310
 cell culture we have to test 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.630
 different lots to make sure that the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.850
 lot of these Roma we will choose 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:08.060
 is not toxic to cells that 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.410
 we use in the lab if the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.970
 serum was not available 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.860
 should be supplemented the mid 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.019
 cells with proteins factors 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.370
 of amino acid growth and 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.099
 find the right dosage would be enough 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.140
 complicated some companies provide 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.430
 already complete backgrounds but 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.810
 unfortunately we will not be able to 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.849
 be aware of the exact composition 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.769
 of these circles what can be 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.769
 problematic for our experiments 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.270
 the best reasons why 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.610
 we use serum for culture 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.930
 cellular are that it's a product that 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.330
 is effective for the cultivation of 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.740
 cells of our laboratory 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.260
 it can be kept at a very low temperature 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.540
 for a long time that he is good 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.400
 quality and that it has been tested by the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.400
 provider before we use it
