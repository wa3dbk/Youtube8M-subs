they're known as triploid grass carp so
I<00:01:42.030> jumped<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:42.960> opportunity<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.490> them

I did some research and I figured out

I did some research and I figured out
the<00:02:34.239> problem<00:02:34.890> because<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:36.159> my<00:02:36.459> impatience<00:02:37.329> I

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
the problem because of my impatience I

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.679 
the problem because of my impatience I
had<00:02:37.780> ordered<00:02:38.170> too<00:02:38.680> many<00:02:38.829> grass<00:02:39.280> carp<00:02:39.640> they<00:02:40.450> ate
