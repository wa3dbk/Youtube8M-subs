00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:48.979 
just a design it's 3d which i think is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:52.000 
just a design it's 3d which i think is
really<00:00:49.129> cool<00:00:49.460> um<00:00:49.729> and<00:00:50.479> then<00:00:50.690> once<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:51.860> know

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010

each<00:00:52.309> colors<00:00:52.760> John<00:00:53.000> just<00:00:53.239> move<00:00:53.420> on<00:00:53.540> to<00:00:53.750> the

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
each colors John just move on to the

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.380 
each colors John just move on to the
next<00:00:53.900> one<00:00:54.229> I<00:00:54.559> got<00:00:55.159> my<00:00:55.309> puffy<00:00:55.670> paint<00:00:55.909> at<00:00:56.119> the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
next one I got my puffy paint at the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.140 
next one I got my puffy paint at the
dollar<00:00:56.659> store<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:58.309> it<00:00:58.430> was<00:00:58.580> a<00:00:58.610> packed<00:00:58.820> three

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
dollar store and it was a packed three

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.000 
dollar store and it was a packed three
for<00:00:59.420> a<00:00:59.449> dollar<00:00:59.540> so<00:01:00.110> you<00:01:00.170> don't<00:01:00.470> have<00:01:00.680> to<00:01:00.830> like

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
for a dollar so you don't have to like

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.890 
for a dollar so you don't have to like
going<00:01:01.220> by<00:01:01.460> really<00:01:01.670> expensive<00:01:02.180> puffy<00:01:02.690> paint

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
going by really expensive puffy paint

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.450 
going by really expensive puffy paint
for<00:01:03.049> this<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.320> can<00:01:03.470> just<00:01:03.619> find<00:01:03.769> normal<00:01:04.309> old

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
for this you can just find normal old

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.030 
for this you can just find normal old
paint<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.269> it<00:01:05.449> probably<00:01:05.479> takes<00:01:06.200> about<00:01:06.409> you

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
paint and it probably takes about you

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.639 
paint and it probably takes about you
know<00:01:07.539> four<00:01:08.539> to<00:01:08.570> six<00:01:08.899> hours<00:01:09.049> I<00:01:09.350> would<00:01:09.469> say<00:01:09.590> to

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
know four to six hours I would say to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.910 
know four to six hours I would say to
completely<00:01:10.310> dry<00:01:11.049> but<00:01:12.049> it's<00:01:12.320> really<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:12.890> easy

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
completely dry but it's really that easy

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.249 
completely dry but it's really that easy
so<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.640> next<00:01:13.820> step<00:01:13.969> is<00:01:14.299> if<00:01:14.539> you<00:01:14.719> want<00:01:14.990> them<00:01:15.229> to

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
so the next step is if you want them to

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.620 
so the next step is if you want them to
blow<00:01:15.859> so<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:16.700> just<00:01:16.880> want<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.180> buy<00:01:17.299> some

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.010 
back in and add some of the purple
anyways<00:01:34.490> because<00:01:34.850> I'd<00:01:35.090> like<00:01:35.299> how<00:01:35.479> it<00:01:35.630> looks

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
anyways because I'd like how it looks

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.139 
anyways because I'd like how it looks
when<00:01:36.259> it's<00:01:36.320> glowing<00:01:36.859> and<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.369> just<00:01:37.609> painted<00:01:37.789> it
