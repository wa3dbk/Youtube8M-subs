00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
should I actually get a workstation

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.590 
should I actually get a workstation
specific<00:00:19.170> card<00:00:20.119> what<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> difference

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
specific card what is the difference

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.759 
specific card what is the difference
between<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.900> workstation<00:00:22.199> card<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.710> a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
between a workstation card and a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.410 
between a workstation card and a
graphics<00:00:23.130> card<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:23.699> justifies<00:00:24.210> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
graphics card and what justifies the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.050 
graphics card and what justifies the
extreme<00:00:24.840> price<00:00:25.199> difference<00:00:25.949> well<00:00:26.640> that's<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
extreme price difference well that's a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.670 
extreme price difference well that's a
really<00:00:27.269> good<00:00:27.359> question<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.349> will<00:00:28.560> actually

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
really good question and I will actually

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.529 
really good question and I will actually
throw<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.460> my<00:00:29.609> good<00:00:29.820> buddy<00:00:29.849> Linus<00:00:30.420> as

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
throw this one to my good buddy Linus as

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.849 
throw this one to my good buddy Linus as
I<00:00:30.630> said<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> would<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.260> take<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.619> one<00:00:31.769> this

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
I said I would here take this one this

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.360 
I said I would here take this one this
was<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.009> perfect<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.430> for<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:33.710> well<00:00:34.710> basically

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
was a perfect one for you well basically

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.010 
was a perfect one for you well basically
the<00:00:35.910> difference<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:36.690> you're<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.930> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
the difference is that you're going to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.889 
the difference is that you're going to
have<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.910> rendering<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.570> you're<00:00:39.750> doing

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
have the rendering that you're doing

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.270 
have the rendering that you're doing
when<00:00:40.140> you're<00:00:40.230> doing<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.440> digital<00:00:40.829> content

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
when you're doing your digital content

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.459 
when you're doing your digital content
creation<00:00:41.309> your<00:00:41.850> CAD<00:00:42.090> work<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.629> it's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
creation your CAD work like that it's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.200 
creation your CAD work like that it's
just<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.770> completely<00:00:44.160> different<00:00:44.370> type<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.820> math

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
just a completely different type of math

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.110 
just a completely different type of math
basically<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.260> you've<00:00:46.410> got<00:00:46.559> there

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
basically what you've got there

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.010 
basically what you've got there
because<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.300> difference<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.780> gaming

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
because of the difference your gaming

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.229 
because of the difference your gaming
cards<00:00:49.469> can<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:50.070> do<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> work<00:00:50.520> yet<00:00:50.850> they<00:00:51.030> can

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
cards can they do the work yet they can

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.189 
cards can they do the work yet they can
do<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> work<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:52.649> do<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.949> very<00:00:52.980> well<00:00:54.199> not

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
do the work can they do it very well not

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.959 
do the work can they do it very well not
really<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.800> takes<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:56.340> bit<00:00:56.489> longer<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
really it takes a little bit longer it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
really it takes a little bit longer it
doesn't<00:00:57.300> run<00:00:57.449> all<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.750> fast<00:00:58.109> with<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
doesn't run all that fast with the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.340 
doesn't run all that fast with the
workstation<00:00:59.699> cards<00:01:00.210> themselves<00:01:00.359> you

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
workstation cards themselves you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.319 
workstation cards themselves you
actually<00:01:01.770> get<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.190> because<00:01:03.149> they're

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
actually get there because they're

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329 
actually get there because they're
designed<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.989> very<00:01:04.589> specific<00:01:05.100> tasks

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
designed to do is very specific tasks

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.219 
designed to do is very specific tasks
they<00:01:05.939> actually<00:01:06.270> do<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.540> lot<00:01:06.750> quicker<00:01:06.990> than

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
they actually do it a lot quicker than

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.810 
they actually do it a lot quicker than
your<00:01:07.320> gaming<00:01:07.560> cards<00:01:07.950> despite<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> fact<00:01:08.760> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
your gaming cards despite the fact that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.100 
your gaming cards despite the fact that
your<00:01:09.000> gaming<00:01:09.210> cards<00:01:09.540> typically<00:01:09.810> are<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
your gaming cards typically are going to

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.210 
your gaming cards typically are going to
have<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:10.380> memory<00:01:10.740> they're<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> have

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
have more memory they're going to have

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.609 
have more memory they're going to have
faster<00:01:11.640> clocks<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.150> them<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
faster clocks on them and all that the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
faster clocks on them and all that the
big<00:01:13.950> thing<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.310> all<00:01:14.729> those<00:01:15.030> different

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
big thing is all those different

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.420 
big thing is all those different
algorithms<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.590> there<00:01:16.830> it's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
algorithms that are in there it's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
algorithms that are in there it's
designed<00:01:18.150> specifically<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> type<00:01:19.530> of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
designed specifically for the type of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.980 
designed specifically for the type of
math<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.130> type<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.460> processing<00:01:21.390> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
math and the type of processing that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
math and the type of processing that
you're<00:01:22.140> going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.409> using<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> lot<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.310> your

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
you're going to be using a lot in your

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.210 
you're going to be using a lot in your
digital<00:01:23.759> content<00:01:23.939> creation<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:24.930> CAD
