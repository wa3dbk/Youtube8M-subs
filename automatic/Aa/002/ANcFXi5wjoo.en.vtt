views and it's super easy to use the
first<00:00:25.050> thing<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.350> did<00:00:25.560> was<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.980> preheated<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
first thing I did was I preheated the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.670 
first thing I did was I preheated the
oven<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:27.000> 100<00:00:27.720> degrees<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.320> that's<00:00:28.439> gonna

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
oven to 100 degrees and that's gonna

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.550 
oven to 100 degrees and that's gonna
activate<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.670> enzymes<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.660> get<00:00:31.380> them

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
activate the enzymes and get them

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.930 
activate the enzymes and get them
working<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.009> little<00:00:32.130> bit<00:00:32.340> better<00:00:32.520> now<00:00:32.880> you

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
working a little bit better now you

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
don't have to preheat the oven so if

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.760 
don't have to preheat the oven so if
you're<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> time<00:00:36.360> crunch<00:00:36.540> that's<00:00:37.350> easy
