between reflective and transmissive

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:30.719 
between reflective and transmissive
there's<00:01:28.209> still<00:01:28.389> some<00:01:28.600> color<00:01:28.840> there<00:01:29.729> the

it's entity display is not glossy so the

into the wrecked bright sunlight and see
what<00:01:46.749> happens<00:01:47.079> there<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:49.270> we're<00:01:49.569> looking<00:01:49.659> at

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
what happens there now we're looking at

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.440 
what happens there now we're looking at
the<00:01:50.049> two<00:01:50.229> machines<00:01:50.619> in<00:01:50.979> the<00:01:51.340> wrecked<00:01:51.759> bright

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
difference now

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.209

it's<00:01:55.200> very<00:01:55.439> traumatic<00:01:56.960> essentially<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.219> acer

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
it's very traumatic essentially the acer
