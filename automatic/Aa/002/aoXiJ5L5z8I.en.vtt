00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 and some nice guys, some welcome 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.420
 on this new video 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.670
 today I will show you a little trick 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.450
 to make money on steam 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.330
 meanwhile to make money on steam ci 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.970
 need games games that you can 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.779
 play online especially that they give 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.750
 rewards that are either weapons or 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.449
 or let's say trading cards 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.310
 then the games that give these things 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 above all they are with sistri that give a 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.469
 mess of weapons and never end of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.260
 rear view this game because you 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.030
 keep playing and despite everything 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.629
 sails damage however you have 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.800
 completed then one of the games 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.280
 main and will consist of what 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 you are seeing now and then guys a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.430
 end of game they will give you weapons like 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.530
 I think they will do here 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.590
 here for example they gave nothing to 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.210
 none but ok but at the end of the game I was 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.000
 saying they give me weapons or must 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.659
 treating hard than those posed power tv 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.810
 and sell them on steam this and reading 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.939
 hard once you sell them receive the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.650
 money or on the steam wallet 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.470
 in fact now we're going to see about steam 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.040
 how to buy something or how 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.040
 sell something 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.500
 and here we are on our desktop indeed 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.570
 on our steam we therefore already find i 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.740
 our games or have me details 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.830
 anyway let's go up here above 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.470
 we have one euro and 26 cents these 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.600
 here they are part of the bridge of the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.450
 our portfolio and hostile I to do 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.350
 I made this money through conce 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.570
 strike only with ecstatic as and 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.350
 so guys 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.110
 these are part of ours here 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.850
 wallet steam that thanks to this 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.010
 we can buy some games or 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.130
 maybe to sell some items 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.800
 however, to see our objects 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.490
 which we took anyway during 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.650
 games 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.160
 you have to go on our name here in 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.900
 high and then go on inventory this is 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.090
 our inventory where anyway 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.870
 we have weapons we can sell 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.150
 on steam in fact we go to the point on 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.210
 part sell and we can sell any 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.130
 weapon not only of piedimonte strike 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.890
 because we also have team fortresses that is 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.050
 a free to play game so thanks to 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.070
 some free games you could do 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.750
 some game there is also dota 2 e 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.970
 various games is now tempting me 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.760
 the ones that I played then it is me 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.780
 adding various sections 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.820
 these here for example can't 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.270
 sell because they are basic parts 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.390
 standard that from youtube and that from sting 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.160
 sorry sorry here instead we have i 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.960
 our profiles that we can always 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.940
 sell on steam 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.060
 but that mind therefore also depends 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.260
 of the object from the as the object 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.600
 we can sell for so much per capita price 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.880
 in fact here we have a 26 cents that 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.090
 we can spend as we wish on 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.250
 steam looks at three guys 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.490
 these are all the games I have 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.410
 purchased we say that I purchased 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.690
 if you go by now canada guys 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.240
 find how to understand games 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.550
 created on steam and don't take luigi da 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.500
 here then save the wallet and a 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.860
 euro and 26 adds the funds we can 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.800
 do it quietly as we want 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.160
 so guys in fact if we go 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.330
 here for example but we are looking for a game a 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:45.200
 fuck to buy but obviously not 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.580
 purchase because it seems a bit like me 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.850
 This 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.390
 this one we can come down to below 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.390
 add cart 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.840
 and indeed 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.840
 then we buy for me 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.870
 we can do with information from 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.240
 payment we will surely find the names e 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.890
 wallet of steam that game for 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.420
 example this year 4 euros that I do not have 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.209
 however, if it cost one euro 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.190
 maybe I could get it on steam 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.890
 so by paying with the wallet I could 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.829
 obviously pay to buy the game 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.669
 so guys this is for this guide 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.010
 all 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.990
 I recommend this method because it is 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.210
 very simple and easy 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.190
 buy big games that 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.400
 anyway, I don't make a euro first 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.350
 and twenty no of top ganassi nonsense 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.120
 black at 20 or I'll put your life 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.380
 but no I found weapons on 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.070
 rai contest asking you could 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.440
 sell assets up to sixteen euros 70 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.330
 a vp you could tend to 70 euros wind 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.130
 girls is something you can 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.870
 buy type call of duty cost can 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.970
 buy with a weapon of a game of 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.220
 shit just says so the boys 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.050
 however, both boys hope this 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.060
