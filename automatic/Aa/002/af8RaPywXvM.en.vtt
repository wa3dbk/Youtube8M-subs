like you saw there a brute spicer i
believe<00:00:32.529> and<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:34.500> alpha<00:00:35.500> daddy

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.010 

it's<00:00:47.500> really<00:00:47.970> not<00:00:48.970> that<00:00:49.030> hard<00:00:49.270> of<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.630> fight<00:00:49.840> I

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
it's really not that hard of a fight I

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.390 
it's really not that hard of a fight I
think<00:00:50.260> they<00:00:50.380> just<00:00:50.530> got<00:00:50.770> to<00:00:50.860> put<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.010> in<00:00:51.190> to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
think they just got to put it in to

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.990 
think they just got to put it in to
extend<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.000> game<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:54.340> have<00:00:54.520> whatever

extend the game you have whatever

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.970 
extend the game you have whatever
supplies<00:00:55.390> knee<00:00:55.750> there<00:00:55.990> and<00:00:56.200> then<00:00:56.320> it's<00:00:56.860> all

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
supplies knee there and then it's all

Bell

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.850 

so<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.659> think<00:01:18.750> by<00:01:18.899> this<00:01:19.140> point<00:01:19.320> Eleanor<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
so I think by this point Eleanor is

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.289 
so I think by this point Eleanor is
actually<00:01:20.189> gone<00:01:20.399> so<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> deal<00:01:21.270> with

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
actually gone so I just got to deal with

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.230 
actually gone so I just got to deal with
this<00:01:21.539> one<00:01:21.810> guy<00:01:21.990> myself<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:23.850> isn't<00:01:24.030> any
