seventh day he rested his plan seems to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.669 
seventh day he rested his plan seems to
be<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.140> seven-day<00:02:07.860> plan<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.420> if<00:02:09.570> God's<00:02:09.840> timeline

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679

is seven days long and each day is a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.190 
is seven days long and each day is a
thousand<00:02:14.310> years<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.850> means<00:02:15.330> God's<00:02:15.780> whole

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
thousand years that means God's whole
