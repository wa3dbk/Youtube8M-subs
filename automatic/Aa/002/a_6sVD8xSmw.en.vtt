gets one shot people majority of the
time<00:02:05.430> that's<00:02:05.640> why<00:02:05.790> they<00:02:05.939> had<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> nerf<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.509> at

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
the very beginning of the game this gun

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.210 
the very beginning of the game this gun
is<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.539> good<00:02:09.899> when<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.259> comes<00:02:10.470> up<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.709> like

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
is so good when it comes up to like

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.660 
is so good when it comes up to like
close<00:02:11.550> quarter<00:02:12.030> engaged

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
I mean I be shotguns get up close but

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.589 
I mean I be shotguns get up close but
this<00:02:15.040> gun<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.459> really<00:02:15.730> does<00:02:15.880> kill<00:02:16.090> people<00:02:16.420> in

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599

really does shoot one shot one kill so
yeah<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.870> r870<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.950> best<00:02:42.160> one<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.519> my

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
yeah the r870 is the best one in my

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.930 
yeah the r870 is the best one in my
opinion<00:02:42.910> now<00:02:43.390> next<00:02:43.660> one<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:44.050> KSG<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.760> one

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
opinion now next one the KSG the one

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.340 
opinion now next one the KSG the one
thing<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.209> have<00:02:46.360> for<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.569> case<00:02:46.720> she<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.170> that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
thing I have for the case she is that

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.559 
thing I have for the case she is that
shoots<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.890> farthest<00:02:48.370> which<00:02:48.580> means<00:02:48.819> you<00:02:49.360> have

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
shoots the farthest which means you have

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.990 
shoots the farthest which means you have
like<00:02:49.840> in<00:02:49.959> a<00:02:50.050> limited<00:02:50.470> range<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:51.000> that

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
like in a limited range of that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.490 
like in a limited range of that
unlimited<00:02:52.269> range<00:02:52.600> let's<00:02:53.019> say<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.470> a

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
unlimited range let's say you have a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.280 
unlimited range let's say you have a
more<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.370> variety<00:02:54.580> of<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:55.090> gunfight<00:02:55.569> when<00:02:56.230> you

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
more of a variety of a gunfight when you

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.750 
more of a variety of a gunfight when you
use<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.590> case<00:02:56.769> she<00:02:57.040> compared<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.640> other

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
use the case she compared to the other

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.729 
use the case she compared to the other
shotguns<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:58.569> because<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.049> shoots<00:02:59.260> so<00:02:59.440> far

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
shotguns just because it shoots so far

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.550 
shotguns just because it shoots so far

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
I can see this gun being a viable option

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.270 
I can see this gun being a viable option
now<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:42.070> last<00:04:42.220> one<00:04:42.580> dm<00:04:43.270> 126<00:04:44.050> this<00:04:44.590> gun<00:04:44.860> is<00:04:44.890> an

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
now the last one dm 126 this gun is an

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.100 
now the last one dm 126 this gun is an
amazing<00:04:45.700> gun<00:04:45.910> it's<00:04:46.180> the<00:04:46.270> second<00:04:46.630> best<00:04:46.720> one<00:04:46.990> in

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
amazing gun it's the second best one in

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.220 
amazing gun it's the second best one in
my<00:04:47.200> opinion<00:04:47.500> just<00:04:47.800> because<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.670> 870<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.510> can

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
my opinion just because the 870 I can

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.810 
my opinion just because the 870 I can
shoot<00:04:50.440> people<00:04:50.800> in<00:04:51.010> like<00:04:51.220> one<00:04:51.400> shot<00:04:51.610> one<00:04:51.790> kill

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
shoot people in like one shot one kill

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.230 
shoot people in like one shot one kill
why<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.390> end<00:04:52.810> 126<00:04:53.350> it<00:04:54.100> can<00:04:54.430> kill<00:04:54.640> people<00:04:54.670> fast

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
why the end 126 it can kill people fast

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.000 
why the end 126 it can kill people fast
