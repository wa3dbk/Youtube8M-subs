00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
mushrooms you actually don't need that

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960 
mushrooms you actually don't need that
much<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.830> way<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.220> cook<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.820> you

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
much because the way you cook it is you

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.940 
much because the way you cook it is you
cover<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.510> with<00:01:27.659> foil<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.650> put<00:01:28.830> these

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
cover it with foil and you can put these

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.039 
cover it with foil and you can put these
on<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.310> grill<00:01:29.520> too<00:01:29.850> by<00:01:30.030> making<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.510> foil

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
on the grill too by making like a foil

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.800 
on the grill too by making like a foil
pack<00:01:31.260> it<00:01:31.470> steams<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:32.880> well<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.659> just

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
pack it steams up so well and just

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.810 
pack it steams up so well and just
everything<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.350> comes<00:01:34.830> together<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.580> you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
everything just comes together so you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.310 
everything just comes together so you
don't<00:01:36.060> need<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.479> much<00:01:36.750> even<00:01:37.080> though<00:01:37.200> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
don't need that much even though it

don't need that much even though it
looks<00:01:37.470> like<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.650> need<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> little<00:01:38.189> bit<00:01:38.369> more

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
looks like you need a little bit more

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.399
