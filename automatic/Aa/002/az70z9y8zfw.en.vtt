00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
not be next in line to host a today's

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.530 
not be next in line to host a today's
show<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:52.470> here's<00:01:52.950> what<00:01:53.130> he<00:01:53.220> says<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.090> i<00:01:54.270> think

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
show and here's what he says but i think

show and here's what he says but i think
it<00:01:54.840> does<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.439> without<00:01:55.770> saying<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.939> this

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
it does go without saying but if this

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.819 
it does go without saying but if this

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
a national outrage and would be made

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.840 
a national outrage and would be made
into<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.380> larger<00:02:01.740> point<00:02:01.920> about<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.310> Republican

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
into a larger point about the Republican

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.490 
into a larger point about the Republican
Party<00:02:03.210> being<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.450> party<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.810> only<00:02:04.049> white<00:02:04.259> men
