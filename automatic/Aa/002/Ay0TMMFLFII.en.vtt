00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.230
 hello everyone my name is ark and here 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.309
 I bring you the guide of level 126 of 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.309
 tomb raider 4 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.570
 welcome to level number 26 that 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:27.489
 we started thinking we're going to be about 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.919
 how many days live miles that nobody 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:33.480
 will miss because nobody wants them that way 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.480
 that the mercenaries 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:39.129
 let's grab the key to open this 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.040
 door where we will leave another author 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.589
 of quotes that nobody will miss 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.140
 the world knows that children do not have 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:49.659
 family and that maybe and not for nothing 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.300
 they are working good 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.670
 let's move forward we're in the complex 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.720
 of the sphinx or as it is called in English 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.390
 with flex 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.250
 and we are going to give you what is the purpose 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.100
 here good first we have to 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.660
 enter the sphinx but it's all 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.720
 closed so we have to put together a 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.310
 millennial artifact and that has been used 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.880
 for millennia to do his thing for 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.880
 art invoice 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.080
 so let's go through it really fast 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.360
 because I do not have no I do not have time to 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.229
 your little cheating ninja blades 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.810
 red so let's move forward these 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.900
 small line you already know how they are leave 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.000
 to shoot these white people for 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.710
 another side only kill with two good three 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.670
 Shotgun shots are not usually 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.770
 12 because it was very far and why not 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.080
 good one used the blue cartridges those 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.810
 that they give us that are expansive bullets 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.380
 according to this when it is very far from the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.079
 enemy I want to think 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.030
 the lazy change of positions in addition 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.939
 that I have many doubts first of all so 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.299
 I put today we are going to grab these 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.459
 doubts of the abuse and to push is accused 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.290
 also at this level we will find 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.599
 a secret which is in the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.590
 next room but to be able to enter 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.019
 we have books a here down ok ok a 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.640
 curious thing of this level because as 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:27.190
 you will know there is a sphinx and said sphinx 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.910
 it is that it does not have the nose 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.220
 as long as they put us in egypt or 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.720
 small in it 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.060
 perfect here we are going to destroy this box 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.400
 we will find one of the parts of the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.610
 object that I have told you and we are going to 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.220
 start pulling these things well and then 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.470
 well, it's strange for me to see the sphinx 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.770
 I'm doing this to get this 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.660
 here is this is that I've already 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.550
 seen three times in the tomb raider the 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.400
 well the tomb raider one in the part of 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.980
 Egypt I saw her in the tomb raider 3 in 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.990
 london in the museum and now I'm 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.750
 coming back to see again in Egypt I do not know 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.150
 if it is the same as the 1 but is 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.720
 weird and it smells the bell of 3 if it was a 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:16.790
 Replica I come back if I was too 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:19.480
 giant let's kill and dirty come 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.480
 here dreams 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.180
 they fall like flies yes sir call themselves a girl 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.080
 it will take to call 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.100
 jazz mosquito 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:37.620
 because then you fly with him and 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.570
 but but good, let's go ahead and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.100
 we have already achieved a part of the object 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.590
 that will help us to progress 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.000
 we have to get another one that we're going to 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.650
 pass just in front of the 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.930
 sphinx that we have found both in the 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.940
 most of the traders this saying is 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.280
 It looks a lot like the 1 or the level 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.690
 itself as it is formed only that the 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.470
 student we were in a cave like that 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.860
 enclosed 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.020
 but well let's go ahead let's kill 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.260
