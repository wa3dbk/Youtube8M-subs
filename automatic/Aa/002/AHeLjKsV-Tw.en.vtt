one problem with many of the green

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.429 
one problem with many of the green
shakes<00:00:21.330> though<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.750> they<00:00:21.960> don't<00:00:22.230> have

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
shakes though is that they don't have

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.679 
shakes though is that they don't have
any<00:00:22.650> protein<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> thought<00:00:23.789> why<00:00:24.449> not<00:00:24.480> put

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
any protein so I thought why not put

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.990 
any protein so I thought why not put
some<00:00:25.050> greens<00:00:25.320> right<00:00:25.769> into<00:00:26.220> our<00:00:26.490> regular

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
already shook it up and I'm just gonna

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.560 
already shook it up and I'm just gonna
go<00:00:55.649> ahead<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.070> put<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.309> 2<00:00:56.579> scoops<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.120> vanilla

go ahead and put in 2 scoops of vanilla
and<00:00:58.100> then<00:00:59.100> for<00:00:59.489> my<00:00:59.640> green<00:00:59.969> fruit<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.690> decided<00:01:01.050> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and then for my green fruit I decided to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.680 
and then for my green fruit I decided to
use<00:01:01.350> Kiwi<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.280> tart<00:01:02.699> fruits<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.539> the

use Kiwi I like tart fruits with the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
greens I think it kind of offsets the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.390 
greens I think it kind of offsets the
green<00:01:05.750> flavor<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.560> leafy<00:01:07.830> greens<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.280> I'm
