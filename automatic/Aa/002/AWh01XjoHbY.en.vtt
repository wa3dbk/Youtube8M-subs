00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.780
 very good everything goes up here as always 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.360
 that more but i feel harland and in this 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.010
 I bring you the complete list of 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.810
 weapons with which the game will come out 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.670
 for now they are divided into 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.110
 categories that have on screen and already 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.240
 let's talk a little more about how it is 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.949
 made this division but this is all 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.240
 that is known so far not only of 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.160
 the weapons that they will do with the game 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.619
 but how are they going to be accommodated by 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.390
 the different classes the categories that 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.610
 they will be able to use each one and so on 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.590
 etcetera and we will be seeing them 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.180
 by one with their names here on screen 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.100
 I'll be going through all of them 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.690
 I thought about stopping and talking a bit about 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.309
 each weapon even if of which 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.200
 I know do a little research 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.059
 et cetera etcetera and the video is me 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.010
 ended up going to what the 20-25 were 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.230
 minutes so I better show you 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.730
 one by one all weapons starting 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.739
 by the guns on this occasion and 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.660
 you can go investigate if you want 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.160
 more on your own or own the video and 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.840
 look at some more of the details that 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.789
 there is no screen but as I say 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.410
 we're starting with the guns and in 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.720
 this case I started with the most common 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.660
 we could tell them the semiautomatic that 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.119
 we have and there is a special detail with 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.780
 the pistols are divided by classes 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.460
 there is no more that d 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.100
 I go with my class and the son any 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.900
 pistol that I want I am not rich or 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.090
 I have a revolver or I am rich or have 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.100
 a semi-automatic pistol that by 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.900
 now it is not implemented like this in 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.310
 different classes have different 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.380
 types of guns for example the 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.180
 engineer has the revolvers the em 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.200
 forster that would be the kind of support 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.240
 has what are guns 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.740
 semiautomatic of greater damage the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.110
 professional that would come to be in the corner 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.790
 has the automatic pistols and the 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.930
 assault or the operator as it is called in 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.840
 gown set in has the guns 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.880
 semiautomatic damage more standard or 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.420
 average but tell me how the 9 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.860
 millimeters the p 226 for example and in 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.420
 this occasion right now on screen 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.460
 we are seeing the ones in fort cellular 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.380
 the kind of support you use as you already 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.759
 I tell you those pistols that are between 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.619
 which are revolvers and pistols 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.360
 semi-automatic are not guns 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.190
 semi-automatic that have a little less 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.679
 of bullets but be a little more damage to 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.659
 turn and we have the return of the desert 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:09.550
 well-known eagle so loved by all 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.620
 but this time it comes back in caliber 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.030
 50 that is, he has only seven bullets 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.250
 per charger but it would have to be a 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.350
 little more damage if we go to everything 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.329
 that is the issue of realism not because 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.470
 has a larger bullet caliber and in 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.510
 this occasion now 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.880
 going on to see what the weapons of the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.230
 king with the professional how to beat 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.120
 fix the cndh that as I said 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.060
 has what are guns their weapons 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.220
 automatic secondary like for example 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.360
 the dim view or the ma-10 that we will be 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.610
 watching here at any time in 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.620
 battle there is the majority is like a 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.240
 mini usi we could say what we can 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.040
 see it that way not in addition to that 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.560
 we have special guns like the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.050
 taser that is non-lethal and serves us to 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.670
 leave people on the floor that way 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.710
 we can question how they were the time in 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.120
 the alpha in the alpha I think and we also have 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.160
 the dart that serves to mark 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.170
 helicopters as it was in bad company 2 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.810
 if I'm not wrong and to mark people 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.459
 through the walls also in addition to 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.870
 that we have the kind of operator or the 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.750
 class of assault which to use 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.670
 triplet assault and carbines did not stay 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.130
 completely clear because they put a reference 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.470
 alto and carbine in the same category yo 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.820
 I think I would like to think that it is 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.920
 because some carbines are going to have a 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.959
 little more than firing rate no but 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.730
 there also carbines with cadence 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.120
 shoot a little slower so I do not know 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.790
 how they are going to balance is that difference 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.290
 because from always since pad feel 324 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.160
 what happened with the carbines is that a 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.100
 long distance 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.350
 less damage has he less aim not 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.270
 but well that was to balance 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.190
 some way of how good the class 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.080
 assault used assault rifles and to 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.450
 try to give other classes some 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.370
 chance of something like a jump rifle 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.990
 they were given the carbines but now 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.880
 are only available for 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.150
 class of assault and at the beginning when 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.560
 one sees maybe good the rom 990 933 that 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.530
 we saw at the beginning that a field of 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.480
 unemployment higher than the m 10 6 to 3 makes it 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.570
 w too but we also have carbines 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.400
 as lage 36 they have cadence shot 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.370
 slower I do not see why someone 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.750
 would use and here is at my point a 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.460
 carbine with a firing rate 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.500
 slow if you can be at the same time with the 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.420
 same class using an assault rifle 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.680
 but as I say, this is part of 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.630
 the whole beta can get to change 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.120
 we are seeing some jumping rifles 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.830
 some well-known weapons very called 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.959
 for the community and that gives me great pleasure 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.060
 that we see them again as well 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.920
 I was there in the caem in a rifle 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.440
 assault of the variants version of 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.240
 he takes it out with more damage but going on 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.010
 which is the mechanic or the engineer as 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.990
 we usually know that it comes back once 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.210
 more to use both defense weapons 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.510
 staff but this time we have 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.490
 a 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.120
 very pro very special that is the hector 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.280
 vector every 10 is a second version of 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.670
 what is the variants of the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.920
 vector that shoots at 1200 rounds per 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.770
 minute I do not know how they are going to do 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.090
 hit something more than 20 30 meters with 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.370
 this but it 's close it's going to be 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.470
 completely lethal if you already fame in 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.750
 another in other titles of the game with a thousand 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.820
 rounds per minute is a machine 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.310
 destroy people to close combat with 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.320
 1200 rounds per minute the only thing that 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.830
 is going to be able to stop is probably a 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:11.530
 rpg to the face or a shotgun to combat 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.110
 very close but I do not like the idea of 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.330
 that they are adding new weapons that 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.020
 go adding weapons that are so rare 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.670
 example in this case the fmg 9 never the 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.320
 we saw before a very, very rare weapon 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.630
 I recommend you go to google and 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.660
 search by name to investigate a 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.920
 little more to know the truth is that 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.620
 as I tell you, weapons are buried 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.030
 quite striking and I calculate that it 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.950
 the details are running out of ideas 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.139
 because obviously they can not invent 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.629
 weapons and out of the blue 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.129
 before I finish this, we're 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.469
 with the weapons of what is the kind of 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.969
 enforcer or the support class which does not 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.830
 has light machine gun so 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.930
 we can see by now it has shotguns and 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.999
 battle rifles but as I say 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.340
 are trying to bring new weapons to 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:55.749
 everything is the saga and good from time to time 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.969
 when they are going to begin to be left without 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:59.439
 ideas and do not want to repeat that much but it's 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.689
 very good that they always try 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.889
 put some new weapon here she and for 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:05.379
 those who do not know what rifles are 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.449
 of battle are like assault rifles a 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.129
 little bigger before there was 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.919
 the assault rifle was created the rifle of 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:14.289
 battle one of the first was to wash or 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.479
 The automatic browning rail was created 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.789
 for the us there for the second first 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.590
 world war I think something like that but as 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.389
 I'm telling you, they're like assault rifles, 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.879
 little bigger is a little heavier 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.620
 not like for example the last one that 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.469
 we can see in the class support is a 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.150
 smaller version of lage 3 to 3 but 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:32.560
 which is equal to the category of 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.529
 battle rifles and to finish 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.389
 We have the kind of corner or professional 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:39.370
 as they are called but fixed line that uses 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.620
 as always the sniper rifles 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.599
 and the shooter rifles designated as 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.650
 You can see the categories and how they are 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.600
 divided weapons 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.630
 but very different from how we saw it in 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.759
 butterfield 4 and we'll see how it works 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.130
 this obviously I repeat once more 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.630
 this is part of a beta everything can be 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.160
 changed is very likely that many of 

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.080
 these things are going to change by the time 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.090
 leave the game and let's hope that if 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.070
 they change be for the best not to create 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.810
 more balance to the classes add more 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.270
 balance to the game in general but that 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.440
 we are seeing the latest in the category 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.780
 of the weapons that are the rifles of 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.520
 designated shooter some we saw some 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.650
 variants but many of them do not 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.479
 we saw and some I also do not know 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.639
 me so as I told you before 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.050
 can go and look for them in google read a 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.970
 little more if you want to find out a little 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.800
 more about how those weapons are going to work 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.180
 how they work in real life are not 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.729
 a little curious with the subject of what 

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.289
 is armament in real life but as 

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:31.060
 I always hope you liked this 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:33.160
 video the truth is that I do not have gameplay 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.660
 unfortunately to attract them the only thing 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.550
 what I was able to do was compiled this 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.650
 it took a long time to do 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.150
 but hey if I have a little more 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.650
 gameplay if I get something else you 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.810
 They know that in this channel they will be able to 

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.950
 find it as fast as possible and as 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:49.390
 I already tell you, I hope you liked it 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.390
 the video see you next
