you have a chance of getting the pure

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.299 
you have a chance of getting the pure

00:05:32.299 --> 00:05:32.309 
dragon from breeding those two but you

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.269 
dragon from breeding those two but you
have<00:05:32.520> a<00:05:32.550> chance<00:05:32.969> of<00:05:33.209> getting<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.990> Nairobi<00:05:34.589> the

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.419 
Draconis the mirror the crystal the wind

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:41.429 
dragon and the regular legendary dragon

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:44.089 
dragon and the regular legendary dragon
I<00:05:41.550> think<00:05:41.819> before<00:05:42.259> you<00:05:43.259> had<00:05:43.439> a<00:05:43.469> different<00:05:43.679> setup

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
I think before you had a different setup

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:45.499 
I think before you had a different setup
with<00:05:44.339> legendary<00:05:44.699> dragons<00:05:45.209> it<00:05:45.269> had<00:05:45.389> to<00:05:45.479> be

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
with legendary dragons it had to be

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.089 
with legendary dragons it had to be
really<00:05:45.929> really<00:05:45.990> rare<00:05:46.349> dragons<00:05:46.830> and<00:05:46.949> it<00:05:47.009> was

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
really really rare dragons and it was

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.949 
really really rare dragons and it was
very<00:05:47.219> rare<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:48.089> chances<00:05:48.539> of<00:05:48.569> you<00:05:48.779> getting

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:48.959 
very rare the chances of you getting

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:51.379 
very rare the chances of you getting
legendaries<00:05:49.709> but<00:05:50.219> now<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.879> can<00:05:51.059> only<00:05:51.209> get

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
legendaries but now you can only get

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.509 
legendaries but now you can only get
legendaries<00:05:51.959> from<00:05:52.169> breeding<00:05:52.529> pures<00:05:52.889> together

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:53.519 
legendaries from breeding pures together

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.689 
legendaries from breeding pures together
you<00:05:53.819> look<00:05:53.969> at<00:05:54.149> the<00:05:54.330> odds<00:05:54.599> of<00:05:55.080> getting<00:05:55.139> it<00:05:55.699> the

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
you look at the odds of getting it the

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.790 
you look at the odds of getting it the
highest<00:05:57.089> odd<00:05:57.269> is<00:05:57.539> getting<00:05:57.959> the<00:05:58.319> pure<00:05:58.529> dragon

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
highest odd is getting the pure dragon

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.189 
highest odd is getting the pure dragon
but<00:05:59.550> if<00:05:59.699> you<00:05:59.819> don't<00:06:00.209> get<00:06:00.389> the<00:06:00.539> pure<00:06:00.779> drag<00:06:01.019> we

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
but if you don't get the pure drag we

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.719 
but if you don't get the pure drag we
just<00:06:01.379> keep<00:06:01.559> reading<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.009> viewers<00:06:02.430> together

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:02.729 
just keep reading to viewers together

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:04.489 
just keep reading to viewers together
even<00:06:03.569> though<00:06:03.659> we<00:06:03.779> have<00:06:03.869> a<00:06:03.959> ninety-four

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:04.499 
even though we have a ninety-four

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.139 
even though we have a ninety-four
percent<00:06:04.529> chance<00:06:04.979> of<00:06:05.159> getting<00:06:05.430> that<00:06:05.550> if<00:06:05.909> you

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:06.149 
percent chance of getting that if you

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:07.909 
percent chance of getting that if you
don't<00:06:06.389> get<00:06:06.599> it<00:06:06.719> anything<00:06:07.289> else<00:06:07.439> that<00:06:07.589> you<00:06:07.709> get

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
don't get it anything else that you get

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.469 
don't get it anything else that you get
is<00:06:08.099> going<00:06:08.249> to<00:06:08.309> be<00:06:08.399> a<00:06:08.430> legendary<00:06:08.909> dragon<00:06:09.360> and

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
is going to be a legendary dragon and

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.319 
is going to be a legendary dragon and
that's<00:06:09.839> just<00:06:10.050> using<00:06:10.439> no<00:06:10.559> sanctuary<00:06:10.979> level<00:06:11.969> 49

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:12.329 
that's just using no sanctuary level 49

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:14.629 
that's just using no sanctuary level 49
now<00:06:13.079> if<00:06:13.229> you<00:06:13.349> use<00:06:13.529> like<00:06:13.740> level<00:06:14.039> 20<00:06:14.369> or<00:06:14.459> just

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
now if you use like level 20 or just

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.159 
now if you use like level 20 or just
let's<00:06:14.789> beat<00:06:14.969> let's<00:06:15.180> be<00:06:15.269> reasonable<00:06:15.479> and<00:06:15.959> use

let's beat let's be reasonable and use
level<00:06:16.559> 15<00:06:17.039> and<00:06:17.399> put<00:06:18.180> in<00:06:18.329> sanctuary<00:06:19.169> like<00:06:19.349> the

level 15 and put in sanctuary like the

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:24.269 
sanctuary this is the breeding train and

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:28.710 
sanctuary this is the breeding train and
you<00:06:24.749> put<00:06:25.019> in<00:06:25.229> sanctuary<00:06:25.889> like<00:06:26.579> for<00:06:26.819> example<00:06:26.879> 8

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 
you put in sanctuary like for example 8

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.200 
you put in sanctuary like for example 8
just<00:06:28.930> use<00:06:29.050> the<00:06:29.140> highest<00:06:29.470> one<00:06:29.620> and<00:06:30.280> breed<00:06:30.550> you

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
just use the highest one and breed you

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.780 
just use the highest one and breed you
still<00:06:31.480> have<00:06:31.660> the<00:06:31.810> same<00:06:31.990> thing<00:06:32.350> but<00:06:32.590> I<00:06:33.280> find

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
still have the same thing but I find

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.700 
still have the same thing but I find
that<00:06:34.000> when<00:06:34.120> you<00:06:34.330> upgrade<00:06:34.540> your<00:06:34.840> breeding<00:06:35.290> tree

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
that when you upgrade your breeding tree

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.470 
that when you upgrade your breeding tree
and<00:06:36.040> your<00:06:36.280> breeding<00:06:36.550> mountain<00:06:37.090> you<00:06:37.270> have<00:06:37.450> a

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
and your breeding mountain you have a

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.290 
and your breeding mountain you have a
higher<00:06:37.900> chance<00:06:37.930> of<00:06:38.560> getting<00:06:39.280> the<00:06:39.760> dragon<00:06:40.270> that

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
higher chance of getting the dragon that

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.510 
higher chance of getting the dragon that
you<00:06:40.570> want<00:06:40.840> the<00:06:41.140> rare<00:06:41.380> dragons<00:06:41.980> and<00:06:42.220> I've<00:06:42.310> been

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 
you want the rare dragons and I've been

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.370 
you want the rare dragons and I've been
getting<00:06:42.790> nothing<00:06:43.270> but<00:06:43.390> rare<00:06:43.630> dragons<00:06:44.170> since

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
getting nothing but rare dragons since

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.710 
getting nothing but rare dragons since
i've<00:06:44.530> been<00:06:44.680> reading<00:06:44.920> with<00:06:45.340> those<00:06:45.490> things<00:06:45.720> so

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 
i've been reading with those things so

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.720 
i've been reading with those things so
let's<00:06:46.990> try<00:06:47.170> to<00:06:47.230> sanctuary<00:06:47.890> too<00:06:48.130> and<00:06:48.460> of<00:06:48.700> course

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
let's try to sanctuary too and of course

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.760 
let's try to sanctuary too and of course
the<00:06:49.150> higher<00:06:49.360> your<00:06:49.570> dragons<00:06:50.140> the<00:06:50.290> easier<00:06:50.590> it<00:06:50.710> is

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
the higher your dragons the easier it is

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.280 
the higher your dragons the easier it is
also<00:06:51.010> to<00:06:51.250> get<00:06:51.400> the<00:06:51.520> likelihood<00:06:52.000> of<00:06:52.030> getting

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
also to get the likelihood of getting

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.140 
also to get the likelihood of getting
see<00:06:53.290> the<00:06:53.380> odds<00:06:53.560> don't<00:06:53.890> change<00:06:54.250> here<00:06:54.700> but<00:06:55.090> the

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
see the odds don't change here but the

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.970 
see the odds don't change here but the
fact<00:06:55.330> of<00:06:55.510> the<00:06:55.570> matter<00:06:55.630> is<00:06:55.900> even<00:06:56.830> though<00:06:56.920> you

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
fact of the matter is even though you

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.000 
fact of the matter is even though you
can't<00:06:57.280> see<00:06:57.370> the<00:06:57.670> change<00:06:58.030> visibly<00:06:58.900> on<00:06:59.140> here<00:06:59.590> you

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
can't see the change visibly on here you

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.980 
can't see the change visibly on here you
still<00:07:00.280> have<00:07:00.520> a<00:07:00.550> chance<00:07:00.820> a<00:07:01.060> higher<00:07:01.270> chance<00:07:01.300> or<00:07:01.960> a

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
still have a chance a higher chance or a

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.890 
still have a chance a higher chance or a
higher<00:07:02.500> probability<00:07:02.830> of<00:07:03.520> getting<00:07:04.090> the<00:07:04.690> rare

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900 
higher probability of getting the rare

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.320 
higher probability of getting the rare
dragons<00:07:05.500> if<00:07:05.710> you<00:07:05.920> breed<00:07:06.220> with<00:07:06.850> a<00:07:06.880> sanctuary

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
dragons if you breed with a sanctuary

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330 
dragons if you breed with a sanctuary
that<00:07:07.630> is<00:07:07.810> higher<00:07:08.050> than<00:07:08.320> just<00:07:08.470> a<00:07:08.530> normal<00:07:08.710> one<00:07:09.010> or
