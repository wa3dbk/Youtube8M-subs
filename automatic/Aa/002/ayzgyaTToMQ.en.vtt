00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
pv system fatshark credited to of course

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.119 
pv system fatshark credited to of course
now<00:05:47.699> what<00:05:47.999> happened<00:05:48.360> that<00:05:48.479> before<00:05:48.930> I<00:05:49.199> used

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:50.129 
now what happened that before I used

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.719 
now what happened that before I used
4400<00:05:51.120> milliamp<00:05:51.449> 3s<00:05:51.960> so<00:05:52.349> that<00:05:52.499> was<00:05:52.729> 8800

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
4400 milliamp 3s so that was 8800

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.329 
4400 milliamp 3s so that was 8800
milliamp<00:05:54.120> I<00:05:54.270> was<00:05:54.449> giving<00:05:54.779> to<00:05:54.899> my<00:05:55.620> older<00:05:55.979> setup

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:56.339 
milliamp I was giving to my older setup

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.269 
milliamp I was giving to my older setup
of<00:05:56.459> seeker<00:05:56.819> this<00:05:57.509> time<00:05:57.719> I<00:05:57.749> gave<00:05:58.169> seeker<00:05:58.620> six

00:05:59.269 --> 00:05:59.279 
of seeker this time I gave seeker six

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.510 
of seeker this time I gave seeker six
thousand<00:05:59.729> six<00:05:59.939> hundred<00:05:59.999> milliamps<00:06:00.479> only<00:06:01.520> 3s

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
thousand six hundred milliamps only 3s

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.089 
thousand six hundred milliamps only 3s
and<00:06:02.849> it<00:06:02.999> flew<00:06:03.270> for<00:06:03.629> 23<00:06:04.529> minutes<00:06:04.680> so<00:06:04.979> it

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
and it flew for 23 minutes so it

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.980 
and it flew for 23 minutes so it
actually<00:06:05.309> broke<00:06:05.729> the<00:06:05.879> record<00:06:05.999> of<00:06:06.209> that<00:06:06.449> now

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
actually broke the record of that now

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.219 
actually broke the record of that now
imagine<00:06:07.199> for<00:06:07.529> t<00:06:08.309> 400<00:06:08.520> milliamps<00:06:09.059> or<00:06:09.449> 5000

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
imagine for t 400 milliamps or 5000

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.799 
imagine for t 400 milliamps or 5000
milliamp<00:06:10.559> two<00:06:10.770> batteries<00:06:11.270> this<00:06:12.270> can<00:06:12.509> give<00:06:12.689> you

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:12.809 
milliamp two batteries this can give you

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.439 
milliamp two batteries this can give you
some<00:06:13.110> serious<00:06:13.620> flight<00:06:13.889> time<00:06:14.159> now<00:06:15.120> what<00:06:15.300> is

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
some serious flight time now what is

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.100 
some serious flight time now what is
making<00:06:15.870> this<00:06:16.379> series<00:06:16.860> flight<00:06:17.009> time<00:06:17.309> is<00:06:18.110> these

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
making this series flight time is these

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.809 
making this series flight time is these
very<00:06:20.039> high<00:06:20.309> efficiency<00:06:22.249> very<00:06:23.249> efficient

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
very high efficiency very efficient
