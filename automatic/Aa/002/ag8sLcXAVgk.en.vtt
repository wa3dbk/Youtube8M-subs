00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:16.449 
they're all coming up here I don't know

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.830 
they're all coming up here I don't know
why<00:00:16.660> I<00:00:16.960> can<00:00:17.380> make<00:00:17.500> it<00:00:17.619> down<00:00:17.789> so<00:00:18.789> this<00:00:19.480> is<00:00:19.539> a

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
why I can make it down so this is a

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.589 
why I can make it down so this is a
normal<00:00:19.990> conquest<00:00:20.710> mission<00:00:21.039> we're<00:00:21.220> not<00:00:21.400> on<00:00:21.699> the

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
normal conquest mission we're not on the

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.980 
normal conquest mission we're not on the
very<00:00:23.500> common<00:00:23.980> assault<00:00:24.430> mode<00:00:24.880> which<00:00:25.570> is<00:00:25.779> all

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
very common assault mode which is all

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.230 
very common assault mode which is all
heroes<00:00:26.529> and<00:00:26.740> villains<00:00:26.890> that<00:00:27.520> mode<00:00:27.849> can<00:00:28.119> be

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
heroes and villains that mode can be

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.929 
heroes and villains that mode can be
very<00:00:28.509> fun<00:00:28.869> I<00:00:29.079> will<00:00:29.320> probably<00:00:29.560> do<00:00:29.919> a<00:00:30.220> video

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
very fun I will probably do a video

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.200 
very fun I will probably do a video
later<00:00:31.269> actually<00:00:32.199> did<00:00:32.980> I<00:00:33.129> already<00:00:33.309> I<00:00:33.910> don't

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
later actually did I already I don't

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.380 
later actually did I already I don't
really<00:00:34.390> remember<00:00:34.629> I<00:00:35.760> remember<00:00:36.760> I<00:00:36.790> recorded

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
really remember I remember I recorded

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.950 
really remember I remember I recorded
one<00:00:37.570> for<00:00:37.809> something<00:00:38.350> I'm<00:00:38.589> not<00:00:38.739> sure<00:00:38.800> if<00:00:39.960> it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
one for something I'm not sure if it

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.329 
one for something I'm not sure if it
ever<00:00:41.620> made<00:00:42.010> it<00:00:42.190> out<00:00:42.339> of<00:00:42.580> production<00:00:43.300> or<00:00:43.449> not

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
ever made it out of production or not

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:47.160 
ever made it out of production or not
yeah<00:00:45.339> I<00:00:45.370> don't<00:00:45.670> really<00:00:46.000> remember<00:00:46.180> if<00:00:46.869> I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
yeah I don't really remember if I

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.680 
yeah I don't really remember if I
haven't<00:00:47.580> how<00:00:48.580> do<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.760> get<00:00:48.909> to<00:00:49.089> this<00:00:49.299> command

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
haven't how do I get to this command

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.469 
haven't how do I get to this command
post<00:00:49.869> if<00:00:50.500> I<00:00:50.710> haven't<00:00:51.220> I<00:00:51.339> will<00:00:51.519> probably<00:00:52.089> do<00:00:52.299> one

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
post if I haven't I will probably do one

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.850 
post if I haven't I will probably do one
in<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.690> future<00:00:54.659> because<00:00:55.659> it<00:00:55.869> can<00:00:56.110> be<00:00:56.260> very<00:00:56.470> fun

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
in the future because it can be very fun

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.549 
in the future because it can be very fun
and<00:00:57.070> it's<00:00:57.940> really<00:00:58.000> fun<00:00:58.420> on<00:00:58.570> multiplayer<00:00:58.989> too

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
and it's really fun on multiplayer too

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.310 
and it's really fun on multiplayer too
except<00:01:00.430> when<00:01:00.699> you<00:01:00.879> have<00:01:01.210> internet<00:01:01.780> such<00:01:02.290> as

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
except when you have internet such as

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.100 
except when you have internet such as
mine<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.269> my<00:01:04.269> latency<00:01:05.260> is<00:01:05.409> pretty<00:01:06.040> high<00:01:06.340> and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
mine and my latency is pretty high and

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.010 
mine and my latency is pretty high and
so<00:01:08.110> it's<00:01:08.590> really<00:01:09.040> kind<00:01:09.400> of<00:01:09.549> hard<00:01:09.790> to<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.990> that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
so it's really kind of hard to do that

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.980 
so it's really kind of hard to do that
especially<00:01:11.590> when<00:01:12.040> you<00:01:13.000> can<00:01:13.180> get<00:01:13.390> killed<00:01:13.659> in<00:01:13.900> a

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
especially when you can get killed in a

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.469 
especially when you can get killed in a
moment's<00:01:14.380> notice<00:01:14.439> and<00:01:15.159> especially<00:01:15.970> when

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
moment's notice and especially when

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.539 
moment's notice and especially when
you're<00:01:16.810> fighting<00:01:17.229> with<00:01:17.350> Jedi<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.189> other

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
you're fighting with Jedi and other

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.910 
you're fighting with Jedi and other
heroes<00:01:19.410> it's<00:01:20.410> very<00:01:20.680> difficult<00:01:22.740> joints<00:01:23.740> get

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
heroes it's very difficult joints get

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.950 
heroes it's very difficult joints get
out<00:01:24.040> of<00:01:24.130> here<00:01:24.360> everything<00:01:25.360> I<00:01:25.510> just<00:01:25.540> said

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
out of here everything I just said

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.390 
out of here everything I just said
probably<00:01:26.740> didn't<00:01:27.160> really<00:01:27.670> make<00:01:27.850> sense<00:01:27.910> I

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
probably didn't really make sense I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.649 
probably didn't really make sense I
didn't<00:01:30.400> really<00:01:30.610> think<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:30.909> statement<00:01:31.300> come

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
didn't really think that statement come

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.760 
didn't really think that statement come
completely<00:01:32.320> through<00:01:32.650> before<00:01:33.100> I<00:01:33.130> said<00:01:33.370> it

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
completely through before I said it

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.880 
completely through before I said it
which<00:01:35.770> is<00:01:35.920> a<00:01:35.950> problem<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.720> hey<00:01:37.990> it's<00:01:38.260> hard<00:01:38.590> to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
which is a problem but hey it's hard to

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.330 
which is a problem but hey it's hard to
it's<00:01:39.820> hard<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.330> make<00:01:40.510> sense<00:01:40.980> complete<00:01:41.980> sense

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
it's hard to make sense complete sense

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.950 
it's hard to make sense complete sense

hoping it would continue to capture the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.570 
hoping it would continue to capture the
command<00:02:40.140> post<00:02:40.380> while<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:40.860> was<00:02:43.250> using<00:02:44.250> the

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
command post while I was using the

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.150 
command post while I was using the
turret<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.150> did<00:02:45.390> not<00:02:45.600> though<00:02:45.860> so<00:02:46.860> that's<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
turret it did not though so that's a

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.949 
turret it did not though so that's a
good<00:02:47.280> thing<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.610> know<00:02:47.790> when<00:02:48.569> you're<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
good thing to know when you're in the

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.870 
good thing to know when you're in the
turret<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.470> doesn't<00:02:49.830> continue<00:02:50.100> capturing<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
turret it doesn't continue capturing the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.630 
turret it doesn't continue capturing the
command<00:02:51.209> post<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:55.530> looks<00:02:55.920> like<00:02:56.280> there's

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
command post and it looks like there's

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.640 
command post and it looks like there's
only<00:02:57.030> one<00:02:57.209> command<00:02:57.660> post<00:02:57.870> left<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.440> this

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
only one command post left so this

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.240 
only one command post left so this
actually<00:02:59.040> might<00:02:59.190> be<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.340> short<00:02:59.610> episode<00:02:59.700> too

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250
