00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
as an outer shell jacket and the reason

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.080 
as an outer shell jacket and the reason

I did that as I really wanted to put it
through<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.330> paces<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.810> test<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.830> reason

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
through the paces and test it the reason

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.370 
through the paces and test it the reason
that<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.340> wore<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.820> as<00:01:33.000> an<00:01:33.149> outer<00:01:33.330> shell<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:34.050> I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that I wore this as an outer shell is I

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.020 
that I wore this as an outer shell is I
really<00:01:34.619> wanted<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.979> test<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.399> fabric<00:01:35.789> in<00:01:35.910> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
really wanted to test the fabric in the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.340 
really wanted to test the fabric in the
material<00:01:36.539> because<00:01:36.840> that's<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
material because that's one of the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.810 
material because that's one of the
reasons<00:01:37.649> that<00:01:37.740> you're<00:01:38.009> wearing<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.399> Prima<00:01:38.670> life

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
reasons that you're wearing a Prima life

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.219 
reasons that you're wearing a Prima life
jacket<00:01:39.300> is<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:39.990> little<00:01:40.080> more

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
jacket is that it's a little more

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.320 
jacket is that it's a little more
impervious<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.340> elements<00:01:41.729> versus<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> down

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
impervious to the elements versus a down

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.650 
impervious to the elements versus a down
so<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.950> particular<00:01:44.280> jacket<00:01:44.789> has<00:01:45.330> a<00:01:45.479> per

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
so this particular jacket has a per
