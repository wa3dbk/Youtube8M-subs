00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
charge that - if you don't have a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.630 
charge that - if you don't have a
battery<00:00:24.750> pack<00:00:24.960> at<00:00:25.140> all<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.039> two<00:00:26.400> options

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
battery pack at all you have two options

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.089 
battery pack at all you have two options
the<00:00:27.480> first<00:00:27.510> option<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.349> use<00:00:28.380> regular

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
the first option is to use regular

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.510 
the first option is to use regular
batteries<00:00:30.560> considering<00:00:31.560> you're<00:00:31.679> missing<00:00:32.099> one

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
batteries considering you're missing one

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.380 
batteries considering you're missing one
of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.969> cartridges<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.760> you<00:00:35.760> can<00:00:35.910> plug<00:00:36.180> in

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
of the cartridges and you can plug in

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.660 
of the cartridges and you can plug in
these<00:00:36.540> two<00:00:36.719> batteries<00:00:40.309> right<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.489> back

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
these two batteries right in the back

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.819 
these two batteries right in the back
now<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.239> inside<00:00:42.420> it's<00:00:43.050> kind<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> hard<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
now on the inside it's kind of hard to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.420 
now on the inside it's kind of hard to
see<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.270> there's<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.360> positive<00:00:45.629> sign<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
see but there's a positive sign and a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.740 
see but there's a positive sign and a
negative<00:00:47.879> sign<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.760> positive<00:00:50.940> side<00:00:51.420> of

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
negative sign so the positive side of

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.910 
negative sign so the positive side of
this<00:00:52.440> battery<00:00:53.309> goes<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.829> and<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
this battery goes here like that and the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.760 
this battery goes here like that and the
negative<00:00:56.280> side<00:00:56.460> goes<00:00:56.760> right<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.710> after<00:00:58.710> you

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
negative side goes right here after you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.580 
negative side goes right here after you
had<00:00:59.039> your<00:00:59.250> positive<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.789> your<00:00:59.850> negative<00:01:00.590> take

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
had your positive and your negative take

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.700 
had your positive and your negative take
some<00:01:02.250> pennies<00:01:02.930> put<00:01:03.930> them<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.260> top<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
some pennies put them in on top to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.880 
some pennies put them in on top to
bridge<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> connection<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.740> once<00:01:07.740> you've

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
bridge the connection and once you've

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.219 
bridge the connection and once you've
done<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.479> considering<00:01:09.479> your<00:01:09.750> batteries<00:01:10.200> are

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
done that considering your batteries are

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.480 
done that considering your batteries are
actually<00:01:10.650> full<00:01:10.860> energy<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.869> useful<00:01:13.400> pick<00:01:14.400> up

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
actually full energy and useful pick up

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.920 
actually full energy and useful pick up
your<00:01:14.640> controller<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:16.140> it'll<00:01:16.409> turn<00:01:16.560> right<00:01:16.770> on

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
your controller and it'll turn right on

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.499 
your controller and it'll turn right on
your<00:01:18.930> next<00:01:19.200> option<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.270> a

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
your next option is you can use a

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.749 
your next option is you can use a
charging<00:01:22.110> cable<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> USB<00:01:23.040> port<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
charging cable with a USB port on the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.859 
charging cable with a USB port on the
opposite<00:01:24.210> end<00:01:25.880> this<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.240> kind<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> charger

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
opposite end this is the kind of charger

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.690 
opposite end this is the kind of charger
I'm<00:01:28.049> going<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.500> be<00:01:28.590> taking<00:01:28.890> apart<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.430> show<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
I'm going to be taking apart to show you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.300 
I'm going to be taking apart to show you
how<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:31.350> charge<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.710> controller<00:01:32.040> or

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
how it can charge your controller or

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.260 
how it can charge your controller or
turn<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.790> controller<00:01:33.119> without

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
turn on your controller without

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990 
turn on your controller without
batteries<00:01:34.100> make<00:01:35.100> sure<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> USB<00:01:35.400> port<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:35.909> on

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
batteries make sure the USB port is on

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.710 
batteries make sure the USB port is on
one<00:01:36.180> end<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:37.380> part<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.920> also<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:38.909> we

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
one end and this part is also there we

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.910 
one end and this part is also there we
don't<00:01:39.900> actually<00:01:40.020> need<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.470> part<00:01:40.740> because

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
don't actually need that part because

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.960 
don't actually need that part because
you're<00:01:41.040> probably<00:01:41.430> cutting<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.729> off<00:01:41.820> anyway

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you're probably cutting it off anyway

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.399 
you're probably cutting it off anyway
and<00:01:43.729> you<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.939> need<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> cord<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.990> made

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
and you just need a cord that is made

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.590 
and you just need a cord that is made
for<00:01:46.860> charging<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.700> be<00:01:47.759> made<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.090> data<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
for charging it can be made for data and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.020 
for charging it can be made for data and
charging<00:01:48.930> transfers<00:01:49.500> but<00:01:49.920> mostly<00:01:50.579> charging

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
charging transfers but mostly charging

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.139 
charging transfers but mostly charging
so<00:01:51.240> what<00:01:51.600> I've<00:01:51.689> done<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.170> I've<00:01:52.380> taken<00:01:52.409> apart

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
so what I've done is I've taken apart

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.300 
so what I've done is I've taken apart
another<00:01:54.149> charger<00:01:54.860> exactly<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> same<00:01:56.100> as<00:01:56.280> that

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
another charger exactly the same as that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.670 
another charger exactly the same as that
one<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.659> exposed<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.259> wires<00:01:58.469> on<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
one and I exposed on the wires on the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.130 
one and I exposed on the wires on the
inside<00:01:58.710> now<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.790> white<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.719> green<00:02:00.869> wires

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
inside now I got white and green wires

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.260 
inside now I got white and green wires
which<00:02:01.469> are<00:02:01.560> for<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> data<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.880> got<00:02:03.030> red<00:02:03.240> and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
