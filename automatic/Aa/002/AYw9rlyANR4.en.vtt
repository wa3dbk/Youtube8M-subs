00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.730
 yes 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.020
 hello very good to all of us today we are here 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.459
 in chipiona as we promised today we are going to 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.180
 to train 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:19.070
 this time with my brother yes 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.500
 wants to get in shape is going to be a 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:25.189
 exercise today of art intensity in the 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:30.200
 that we have here designed a 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:33.050
 training in which we are going to do 9 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.680
 repetitions of 30 seconds with 2 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.680
 minutes of rest 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.320
 ok and then we will have to 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.929
 run to sprint for 30 seconds the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.999
 recovery would go back and 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.710
 I would have two minutes to rest a 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:52.249
 Once I got here back by door 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.840
 start and so for nine times is 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:01:00.600
 prepared to die to give everything 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.600
 it's something for subscribers to subscribe 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:14.060
 at the moment that I tell you that we are going to 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.270
 do a progressive is say 10 seconds 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.330
 I'm going to hit a voice squeeze 10 seconds 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.250
 it tightens and until the end it's worth remembering 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.780
 that when I get to the end you do the 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.020
 brand 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.070
 one and that nobody always stopped ready already 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.070
 with greater dedication 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:48.360
 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.119
 two 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.979
 or not 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.569
 all the evils 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.100
 and now you have two minutes to 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.610
 rest here we have it at the moment 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.610
 come here 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.080
 there are 56 seconds left how you feel 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.080
 born 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.099
 one more 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.800
 3 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.000
 Start 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.909
 OK 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.570
 and now as we said that two 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.570
 minutes to recover 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.940
 the video that organized 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:10.490
 at the top we will try to come up with this 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.490
 I know 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.770
 the present is the 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.090
 in 5 seconds 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:45.789
 what we have done before 

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:48.219
 start this we have not heated or not 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.229
 we have warmed a rhythm a kilometer 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:52.599
 Very short career but very short 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:56.510
 so that it activates that indicates of knowing 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:05:01.730
 that stay 12 seconds 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:07.690
 10 987 will sprint from the first hour 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.690
 I already progressed 3 2 1 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.750
 for me 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.139
 It's worth after five sessions as 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.139
 debÃ³n ftr 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:40.050
 because here so he does not want me not 

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.050
 you can take it 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.110
 5 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:06:00.069
 normal leaves your brother 15 seconds 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:18.890
 I had 31 heart 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.379
 is this module that does not have 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.850
 no no 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:35.540
 but then if you can not anymore we're going to 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:35.540
 run a kilometer some words 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:41.650
 wants to say goodbye to people 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.070
 per day 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:47.880
 that what happens bursts that a lot 

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.880
 imagine in the little one 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.900
 What do you feel 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:07:03.440
 what does brother feel 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:08.830
 good has not finished dead has not 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.830
 finished but the decisions
