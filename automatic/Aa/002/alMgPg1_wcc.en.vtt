00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.820
 let's get the parts to do the headphones themselves 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:34.179
 First of all, consider the cover case 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.470
 let's say so with the engraving written here 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.340
 heart beats lady gaga beats by dre 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.880
 monster 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.190
 as the headphones from the monster beats by dre 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.289
 here is naturally such a trinket 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.710
 which we have on the headphones themselves 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:55.350
 Also the case is the same as on aerobics 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:02:00.360
 iobit that is such a cute 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.890
 comfortable leather case let's start further 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:08.530
 open the box in the set u grow 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.369
 replaceable nozzles round replaceable nozzles 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.540

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.090
 sets 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.890
 frets any size of ear farther from us 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.299
 will start 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:32.380
 documentation is in my opinion a guarantee 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:34.170
 here is still this little book who will 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.980
 you can read interesting 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.980
 again what is that monster 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.500
 Here then the little book Torm stage is 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.010
 video with all the headphones from the monster 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.010
 bits bye dre 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:59.400
 Here is such a little chubby little book for 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:03.140
 her big ohh monster in different languages tom 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.390
 among them there is a Russian as they could notice 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.730
 so but this is all the paper we are interested in 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.410
 I will install the headphones themselves 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.980
 here we are the headphones ourselves let's us 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.980
 get it 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:30.640
 yes they are very dense here not 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.640
 glued 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:39.440
 so we will remove to the side now 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:45.650
 We will consider the headphones themselves so 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:49.989
 a lot of the box we remove see what have 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.989
 we are headphones with you 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:04:00.260
 here are such cute bel 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:08.290
 do not want them dead in plastic white 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.290
 gold quality headphones are excellent 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:17.370
 really you still not as if they 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:20.430
 really gold but here in my here 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.300
 Exactly plastic, this is also plastic, since I 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:30.919
 so it's not even metal like this 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:34.650
 look from this side here we see 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:43.260
 small muse tipchiki some kind 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:47.479
 beats above described hero bets left and 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:51.169
 right ear signed from the inside they 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.169
 look like this 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.180
 so but let's go on night white 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.480
 flat cable 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:12.050
 it is natural for them that helps if not 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.870
 getting confused by headphones there are squares for 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.830

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.350

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.030

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.010

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:27.020

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.360
 which can be moved she 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.840
 moves further than a sheet of eggs nose 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.770

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.680

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.539
 gilded itself, too, that the game necessarily 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.690
 Gerd-shaped plug that is convenient 

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:13.820
 accordingly the cable will not break 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:19.160
