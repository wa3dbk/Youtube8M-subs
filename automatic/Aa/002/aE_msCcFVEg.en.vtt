00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
I could I could see these Indians

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.619 
I could I could see these Indians
sitting<00:00:42.220> the<00:00:42.339> foreground<00:00:42.820> among<00:00:43.180> these<00:00:43.360> rocks

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
sitting the foreground among these rocks

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.610 
sitting the foreground among these rocks
and<00:00:44.729> in<00:00:45.729> the<00:00:46.120> back<00:00:46.330> of<00:00:46.570> this<00:00:46.720> scene<00:00:47.199> there's<00:00:47.530> a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
and in the back of this scene there's a

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.880 
and in the back of this scene there's a
raised<00:00:47.979> area<00:00:48.869> with<00:00:49.869> some<00:00:50.110> trees<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:50.799> I

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
raised area with some trees and I

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.100 
raised area with some trees and I
thought<00:00:51.129> if<00:00:51.430> I<00:00:51.580> expand<00:00:52.089> that<00:00:52.299> area<00:00:52.720> and<00:00:52.839> push

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
thought if I expand that area and push

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.740 
thought if I expand that area and push
it<00:00:53.260> back<00:00:53.500> I<00:00:53.830> can<00:00:54.430> put<00:00:54.640> some<00:00:54.850> ponies<00:00:55.269> up<00:00:55.479> there

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
it back I can put some ponies up there

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.539 
it back I can put some ponies up there
and<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:57.460> can<00:00:57.970> create<00:00:58.299> a<00:00:58.449> story<00:00:58.979> out<00:00:59.979> of<00:01:00.040> the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:00.549 
and I can create a story out of the

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:03.840 
and I can create a story out of the
scene<00:01:00.850> it<00:01:01.059> just<00:01:01.299> little<00:01:01.689> and<00:01:02.110> lend<00:01:03.040> itself<00:01:03.519> to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
scene it just little and lend itself to

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.200 
scene it just little and lend itself to
a<00:01:04.330> story<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.340> so<00:01:06.340> I<00:01:06.369> came<00:01:06.520> up<00:01:06.909> with<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.180> idea

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210
