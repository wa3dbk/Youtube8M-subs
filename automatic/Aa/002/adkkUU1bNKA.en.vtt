00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.819 
he allowed it to get settled for a while
like<00:04:15.310> 10-15<00:04:15.910> minutes<00:04:16.180> maximum<00:04:16.620> after<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.799> I

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
like 10-15 minutes maximum after that I

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.500 
like 10-15 minutes maximum after that I
went<00:04:18.039> for<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.310> hair<00:04:18.519> wash<00:04:18.760> then<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.239> came<00:04:19.450> back

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
went for a hair wash then I came back

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.100 
went for a hair wash then I came back
and<00:04:20.169> my<00:04:20.560> hair<00:04:21.210> then<00:04:22.210> you<00:04:22.240> put<00:04:22.449> a<00:04:22.479> neutralizer

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
and my hair then you put a neutralizer

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.529 
and my hair then you put a neutralizer
onto<00:04:23.590> my<00:04:23.710> hair<00:04:23.979> then<00:04:24.789> again<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.090> went<00:04:25.330> for<00:04:25.510> a

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
onto my hair then again I went for a

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.990 
onto my hair then again I went for a
wash<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.110> then<00:04:26.380> after<00:04:27.160> that<00:04:27.280> he<00:04:27.580> blow<00:04:27.760> dried

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
wash and then after that he blow dried

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.909 
wash and then after that he blow dried
and<00:04:28.210> this<00:04:28.389> is<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.810> result<00:04:29.110> as<00:04:29.289> you<00:04:29.320> can<00:04:29.650> see

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
and this is the result as you can see

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.110 
and this is the result as you can see
and<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.460> lasts<00:04:30.820> for<00:04:31.120> I<00:04:31.780> guess<00:04:32.260> 8<00:04:32.830> to<00:04:33.220> 9<00:04:33.430> months

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
and it lasts for I guess 8 to 9 months

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.390 
and it lasts for I guess 8 to 9 months
and<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.810> growth<00:04:35.320> you'll<00:04:35.530> get<00:04:35.800> obviously<00:04:36.340> is

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
and the growth you'll get obviously is

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.040 
and the growth you'll get obviously is
