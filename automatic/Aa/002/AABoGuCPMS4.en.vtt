00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
okay so what we're looking at is a Frodo

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.650 
okay so what we're looking at is a Frodo

I<00:01:45.600> never<00:01:46.600> accept<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.079> role<00:01:47.229> of<00:01:47.259> victim<00:01:47.560> so<00:01:48.460> we

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
I never accept the role of victim so we

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.789 
I never accept the role of victim so we
train<00:01:49.149> people<00:01:49.329> program<00:01:49.719> oversee<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.319> bag<00:01:50.530> and

this fro system isn't to be confused

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.109 
this fro system isn't to be confused
with<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.469> river<00:01:53.710> system<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.609> does<00:01:54.850> have

with a river system it does have
attachments<00:01:55.749> either<00:01:55.899> end<00:01:56.229> so<00:01:56.439> once<00:01:57.249> they

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
attachments either end so once they

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.899 
attachments either end so once they
receive<00:01:57.729> Bank<00:01:58.600> they<00:01:59.170> clip<00:01:59.560> in<00:01:59.799> to<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.609> and

deck<00:02:01.450> lines<00:02:01.719> themselves<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.590> then<00:02:02.859> we<00:02:02.950> can

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
deck lines themselves and then we can

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.639 
deck lines themselves and then we can
pull<00:02:03.310> them<00:02:03.490> out<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:04.569> system<00:02:04.960> also<00:02:05.079> doubles<00:02:05.590> up

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
pull them out the system also doubles up

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:06.590 
pull them out the system also doubles up
as<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.829> sea<00:02:06.100> anchor

as a sea anchor

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.450 
as a sea anchor
we've<00:02:07.600> used<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:07.929> effectively<00:02:08.020> in<00:02:08.560> about<00:02:08.800> 3<00:02:09.280> to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
we've used it effectively in about 3 to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810

but<00:02:16.090> basically<00:02:16.240> you<00:02:16.570> take<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.810> bite<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.500> rope

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190
