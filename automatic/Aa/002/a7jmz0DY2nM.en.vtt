00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.360
 and colleagues here that this video was going to 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.830
 be a little short but it will be 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.520
 very interesting for those who have 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.710
 a nintendo 3ds since I'm going to put my 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.390
 friend code in the description and you can 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.760
 put my friends codes for 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.539
 add them I am going to add them to all 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.399
 until it reaches 100 because it's that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.380
 is the only thing that allows the ability to 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.390
 Friends code is a shame because 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.829
 they should put at least 200 or 300 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.219
 to register as a friend but they are a 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.309
 little more tight and as a person other 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.620
 time when I had the previous 3ds that was 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.420
 it bothered me that it was the one that had 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.679
 the capturing 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.659
 it is what I have now another and I 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.479
 never erase it all the code friends and 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.390
 everything so that's why I make this video 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:06.270
 because I'm going to put a lot of cane 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 3ds because now that I have left a 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.770
 new 3ds where they can but it allows you 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.549
 read Japanese games or be a pass 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.360
 because you know how many games 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:24.060
 Japanese who do not come here and could 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.420
 play with them and others and bring it 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.270
 I do not have a catcher, but I could 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.610
 record it as serious as he is the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.100
 last of pokemon with good image with 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.700
 of master's program people who look 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.850
 bad but for those who do not have 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.549
 opportunity or from the games of the 3ds 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.590
 Well, it's great, not at least to see a 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.740
 little the games that do not arrive until here 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.420
 I think I would make a section if I had 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.770
 a captor that's why I'm waiting 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.500
 to leave now or at least be 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:00.110
 official the announcement of when it will come out 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.640
 and 3ds because that's how I'm going to 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.210
 buy and I'll put the capture 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.240
 and be possible to do some work 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.250
 so you can also read the games 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.470
 Japanese and bring a lot of content about 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.720
 because the truth is that my mother 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.310
 my mother one of those very games 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.760
 interesting is what I'm playing 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.430
 it's the zinc equine boeing of the 3ds and it's 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.020
 a game pass be like that is so 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.270
 Japanese do not try anything but 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.070
 simply with knowing the controls already 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.989
 it's not necessary because in story mode 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.600
 you just already know it by the anime 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.100
 and the controls and just know them and 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:40.130
 already then you do it and it's very very very 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.570
 intuitive or it tells you everything exactly 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.760
 How do you have to do it? 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.790
 pointing out which buttons you have to press 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.650
 and other so it is not very difficult of 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.380
 language another game is also the monster 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.959
 hunter that until spring of this year 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.150
 Well, it's not going to come out and it's in Japanese and 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.980
 in fact already uploaded a video to see if 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.190
 I start to upload more about monster hunter 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.440
 and I teach you more 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.570
 and about those things, well, it 's 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.360
 I just made this video 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.120
 to announce you not about the 3ds that you 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.150
 there was suddenly a bit of poof and 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.860
 disappeared on my channel and it's just 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.140
 that I do not have a captor and it gives me a 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.450
 little that for uploading those those videos 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.710
 of such poor quality but good I think 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:27.520
 What forgives is because they are 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:31.930
 videos that are games that do not arrive 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:34.920
 here aa latin america or a spain 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.900
 so that is why I do 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.060
 they stay because you do not buy 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.569
 Capturing is that I do not have that much money 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.080
 like to buy me now a capture 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:48.720
 3ds with capturing and in ones in ones 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.060
 months buy me again the new 3ds with 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.350
 the other catcher I do not have a bit 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.080
 money so I'll wait already 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.860
 directly to the 3ds to put it 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.870
 to the new 3ds the capturer so 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.670
 I hope you understand and well 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.310
 basically this video like I said what 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:10.019
 I have done so that if you want to add me 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.600
 to the 3ds that did warn before I 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.730
 ask me to add you to add you 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.500
 to me since many times I decided to 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.090
 add I got bigger but you do not 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.900
 you do 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:25.080
 and I'm staying with him because it is that if not 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.150
 remove the site from people and so on and it 's 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.550
 a mess is better that you add me 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.040
 first since this is not a system of 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.410
 accept but simply you add me 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.900
 I add and then it's already joined is one thing 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.260
 rare but good is like that and well then 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.330
 we could play mario carlos I'm not going 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.100
 to record that or that is simply to 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.260
 play with me at 3ds whatever 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.110
 pokemon that have not yet passed the 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.470
 red pokemon of my mother so it is not 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.090
 I also have time for faults and 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.150
 faults without the ftc i also have to 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.070
 be a game pass or if I had 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.690
 if I had the captor I would bring it 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.840
 but it 's relative 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.380
 I do not have go fuck but it's a game 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.539
 that I think is one of the best 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.570
 3ds games and it is not valued or 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.729
 almost nothing and should be valued more that 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.610
 game and I make it a lot of games 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:19.260
 cooperatives that are in the 3ds so 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.389
 just that is what I wanted to say 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.130
 there you have my code friends if you want 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.880
 add me you know, you tell me in the 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.480
 comments 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.430
 I hope that 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.990
 liked this little news so 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.990
 until the next jabour
