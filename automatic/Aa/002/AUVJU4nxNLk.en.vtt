00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.899 

I<00:01:47.880> don't<00:01:48.880> know

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.550 

I<00:01:51.999> don't<00:01:52.630> think<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.899> this<00:01:53.049> was<00:01:53.229> probably<00:01:53.469> not

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
I don't think that this was probably not

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.749 
I don't think that this was probably not
going<00:01:53.679> to<00:01:53.740> be<00:01:53.829> very<00:01:54.039> interesting<00:01:54.549> because

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
going to be very interesting because

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.819 
going to be very interesting because
it's<00:01:55.030> just<00:01:55.149> cardboard<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.869> I'm<00:01:56.560> not<00:01:56.710> gonna

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
it's just cardboard and I'm not gonna

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:14.070 
it's just cardboard and I'm not gonna
stay<00:01:57.009> up<00:01:57.100> anyway<00:02:01.259> safety<00:02:02.259> first<00:02:02.789> let's<00:02:03.789> hit<00:02:04.090> it

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.930 

so<00:02:14.950> I<00:02:14.980> guess<00:02:15.280> we're<00:02:15.460> trying<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.730> get<00:02:15.790> these

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940
