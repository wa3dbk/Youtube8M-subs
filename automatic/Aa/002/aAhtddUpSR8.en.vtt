from what I've read it's got a pretty

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.340 
from what I've read it's got a pretty
sturdy<00:00:44.340> stand<00:00:44.700> as<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.450> there<00:00:45.660> from

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
sturdy stand as you can see there from

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.910 
sturdy stand as you can see there from
whatever<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> reviews<00:00:48.020> it<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.320> 720p

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
whatever and the reviews it is at 720p

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.310 
whatever and the reviews it is at 720p
so<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.309> not<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> full<00:00:50.670> 1080p<00:00:50.910> however<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.840> 42

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
so it's not a full 1080p however at 42

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.720 
so it's not a full 1080p however at 42
inches<00:00:52.620> you're<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:52.980> going<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> notice<00:00:53.399> too

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
inches you're not going to notice too

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.930 
inches you're not going to notice too
much<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.090> difference<00:00:54.180> between<00:00:54.750> 720p<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
much of a difference between 720p and

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.010 
much of a difference between 720p and
1080p<00:00:56.940> usually<00:00:57.600> you're<00:00:57.719> only<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
1080p usually you're only going to

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.810 
1080p usually you're only going to
notice<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.440> once<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> get<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> about<00:00:59.399> 50

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
notice that once you get up to about 50

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.630 
notice that once you get up to about 50
inches<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> what<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.890> means<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.340> if<00:01:02.520> you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
inches so what that means is that if you

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.479 
inches so what that means is that if you
were<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.879> take<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.210> TV<00:01:03.629> at<00:01:04.199> 42<00:01:04.799> inches<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
have one the exact same model with 1080p

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.140 
have one the exact same model with 1080p
resolution<00:01:09.710> they're<00:01:10.710> gonna<00:01:10.799> look<00:01:11.150> basically

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
resolution they're gonna look basically

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
resolution they're gonna look basically
identical<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.990> there's<00:01:13.170> any<00:01:13.320> difference<00:01:13.710> it's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
identical if there's any difference it's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.730 
identical if there's any difference it's
gonna<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.700> slight<00:01:15.320> that's<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
gonna be so slight that's not going to

a lot more fluid picture especially with
action<00:04:32.139> movies<00:04:32.410> like<00:04:32.650> if<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.830> were<00:04:32.889> to<00:04:32.950> watch

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
action movies like if you were to watch

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.010 
action movies like if you were to watch
transformers<00:04:33.460> on<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.090> there's<00:04:34.720> a<00:04:34.780> major

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
transformers on it there's a major

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.560 
transformers on it there's a major
difference<00:04:35.530> between<00:04:35.620> sixty<00:04:36.220> Hertz<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.639> 120

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
difference between sixty Hertz and 120

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.110 
difference between sixty Hertz and 120
Hertz<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:38.470> imagine<00:04:38.800> it<00:04:38.889> at<00:04:38.980> 600<00:04:39.460> Hertz<00:04:39.610> it's

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
Hertz so imagine it at 600 Hertz it's

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.860 
Hertz so imagine it at 600 Hertz it's
gonna<00:04:40.960> be<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.139> lot<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.710> lot<00:04:42.400> smoother<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.090> just

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
gonna be a lot a lot smoother and just

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.840 
gonna be a lot a lot smoother and just
judging<00:04:44.350> from<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.710> reviews<00:04:45.480> it's<00:04:47.669> it's<00:04:48.669> gonna

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
judging from the reviews it's it's gonna

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.110 
judging from the reviews it's it's gonna
be<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.030> great<00:04:49.210> picture<00:04:50.730> let's<00:04:51.730> see<00:04:51.880> if<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.000> can

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
be a great picture let's see if I can

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.460 
be a great picture let's see if I can
see<00:04:52.270> if<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.419> can<00:04:52.630> answer<00:04:52.780> any<00:04:52.990> questions<00:04:53.380> that

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
see if I can answer any questions that

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
see if I can answer any questions that
are<00:04:53.590> on<00:04:53.620> here<00:04:55.260> it<00:04:56.260> does<00:04:56.440> only<00:04:56.620> have<00:04:56.770> two<00:04:57.100> HDMI

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
are on here it does only have two HDMI

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.440 
are on here it does only have two HDMI
ports<00:04:57.970> and<00:04:58.210> one<00:04:59.169> USB<00:04:59.410> port<00:05:00.090> so<00:05:01.090> keep<00:05:01.270> that<00:05:01.389> in

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
ports and one USB port so keep that in

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.360 
ports and one USB port so keep that in
mind<00:05:01.720> it<00:05:01.930> is<00:05:01.960> 21<00:05:02.500> pounds<00:05:02.919> so<00:05:03.040> it's<00:05:03.160> not<00:05:03.220> the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
mind it is 21 pounds so it's not the

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.340 
mind it is 21 pounds so it's not the
lightest<00:05:03.700> TV<00:05:03.970> in<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.120> world<00:05:04.300> but<00:05:04.750> it's<00:05:05.139> not

lightest TV in the world but it's not

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.110 
lightest TV in the world but it's not
heavy<00:05:05.979> you<00:05:06.100> should<00:05:06.400> be<00:05:06.490> able<00:05:06.550> to<00:05:06.669> carry<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:06.940> by

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
heavy you should be able to carry it by

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.320 
heavy you should be able to carry it by
yourself<00:05:07.919> if<00:05:08.919> you're<00:05:09.540> fit<00:05:10.540> enough<00:05:10.780> to<00:05:10.810> do<00:05:11.020> so

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
yourself if you're fit enough to do so

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.670 
yourself if you're fit enough to do so
I'm<00:05:13.330> just<00:05:13.479> going<00:05:13.630> with<00:05:13.720> a<00:05:13.780> 1<00:05:13.930> year<00:05:14.110> warranty<00:05:14.139> as

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680

well

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.810 

so<00:05:23.110> again<00:05:23.290> I<00:05:23.320> just<00:05:23.410> can<00:05:23.650> only<00:05:23.740> have<00:05:23.860> two<00:05:24.010> HDMI

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
so again I just can only have two HDMI

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.050 
so again I just can only have two HDMI
ports<00:05:25.860> I<00:05:26.860> know<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.550> lot<00:05:27.670> of<00:05:27.700> people<00:05:27.970> probably

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
ports I know a lot of people probably

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.760 
ports I know a lot of people probably
look<00:05:28.330> for<00:05:28.510> more<00:05:28.690> than<00:05:28.840> that<00:05:28.990> but<00:05:29.290> you<00:05:29.470> figure

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
look for more than that but you figure

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.650
