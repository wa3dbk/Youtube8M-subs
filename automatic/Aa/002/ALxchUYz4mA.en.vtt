00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.890
 your distances 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.580
 we dragged the bag outside and we 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.570

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.400
 saw nothing he had to do really 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.570
 watch out because the snake could 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.880
 arise at any time 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.130
 but impossible to find it can not 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.020
 however be very far very slowly 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.180
 if I see it I feel I will try 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.910
 to act quickly did not move anymore 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.860
 really very aggressive if they are 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.729
 cornered believe he's here I see him 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.880
 in the bag 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:39.690

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.570
 meters nadine you can lift the bag 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.000

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.649
 I tried to lift the back you have 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.780
 saw the tip however bob I know this 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.130
 that it's a cobra of the forests you have 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.040
 reported a cobra from the forests in your 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.670
 baggage 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.020
 it may not be a mamba but this 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.630
 is not it not to be taken lightly? 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.140
 for as much the cobra of the forests is very 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.360
 quick 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.310
 luckily they do not spit he can 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.940
 to be aggressive and measured around 3 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.170
 meters are coming and neurotoxic and 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.060
 he can stop the heart of a man in 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.380
 less than an hour you have to handle it 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.910
 with care he is very very 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.310
 dangerous if you die you risk 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.480
 big it does not look convenient 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.050
 worry you big I do not want you 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.720
 hurt 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.050
 I let he grabbed that the other side 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.660
 wait a little 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.300
 ok it's good here that I'm going to bring it 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.920
 to you agree 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:44.220
 a cobra of the forests ace of the magnificent 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.910
 beautiful beast he is rather tall near a 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.260
 meter fifty 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.570
 you see the tip at the end of the tail 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.080
 that's what I saw 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.390
 guys do it's a defense 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.250
 look he's going to prick saimone you see 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.080
 as the tip of the tail curls it 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.420
 gets ready to apply when you expect it 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.220
 not at the end of the reception there is 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.480
 like a needle she does not fit 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.680
 in the skin but it does enough 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.110
 badly for us to loose price if we get there 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.360
 do not wait and then the snake profits 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.800
 to disappear in nature 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.780
 so this is not where the 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.100
 danger is gone 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.420
 you are ready to empty it will be fast 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.750
 close the lid be careful 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.019
 he must call it attention danger 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.019
 danger
