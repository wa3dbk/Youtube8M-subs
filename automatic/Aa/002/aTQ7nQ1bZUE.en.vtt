00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
directly to the frame 0

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.170 
directly to the frame 0
but<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:12.129> mean<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.519> won't<00:02:12.700> work<00:02:12.819> during<00:02:13.120> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
but I mean it won't work during the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.699 
but I mean it won't work during the
night<00:02:13.329> you<00:02:13.480> do<00:02:13.659> directly<00:02:14.049> to<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> frame<00:02:14.409> motor

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
night you do directly to the frame motor

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.789 
night you do directly to the frame motor
so<00:02:15.430> don't<00:02:15.670> recommend<00:02:16.030> that<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.650> too<00:02:17.769> can

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
so don't recommend that and you too can

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.850 
so don't recommend that and you too can
enjoy<00:02:18.069> frame<00:02:18.430> motors<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.530> need<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:20.769> have

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
enjoy frame motors and you need to have

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.720 
enjoy frame motors and you need to have
a<00:02:20.890> redstone<00:02:21.189> pulse<00:02:21.730> or<00:02:22.120> like<00:02:22.799> wiring<00:02:23.799> and<00:02:24.010> when

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
a redstone pulse or like wiring and when

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.420 
a redstone pulse or like wiring and when
you<00:02:24.849> click<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.959> will<00:02:26.170> do<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.560> I'm<00:02:27.189> just

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
you click it to it will do that I'm just

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.339 
you click it to it will do that I'm just
going<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.790> delete<00:02:27.909> that<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> second

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
going to delete that for a second

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.349 
going to delete that for a second
because<00:02:29.379> it<00:02:29.650> ruins<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:31.060> surprise<00:02:31.180> for<00:02:31.540> later

meet<00:03:13.480> in<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.549> frame<00:03:15.549> were<00:03:15.760> two<00:03:16.060> criteria<00:03:16.810> is

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
meet in the frame were two criteria is

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.740 
meet in the frame were two criteria is
that<00:03:17.579> they<00:03:18.579> have<00:03:18.819> to<00:03:18.940> have<00:03:19.030> space<00:03:19.239> around<00:03:19.540> them

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
that they have to have space around them

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.470 
that they have to have space around them
this<00:03:20.620> would<00:03:20.859> work<00:03:21.010> if<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.699> had<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.000> registering

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
this would work if I had a registering

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.000 
this would work if I had a registering
come<00:03:22.629> to<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.019> electricity<00:03:23.500> supplies<00:03:23.769> of

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
come to it and electricity supplies of

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.409 
come to it and electricity supplies of
work<00:03:24.190> because<00:03:24.370> it's<00:03:24.579> got<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.879> lot<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.150> space

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
work because it's got a lot of space

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:29.399 
work because it's got a lot of space
around<00:03:25.660> it<00:03:25.840> if<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.650> just<00:03:26.889> did<00:03:27.069> this<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:28.409> then

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
around it if I just did this and then

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.689 
around it if I just did this and then
did<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.639> wouldn't<00:03:31.000> work<00:03:31.180> because<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:32.109> has

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:32.699 
did that it wouldn't work because it has

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:37.020 
did that it wouldn't work because it has
these<00:03:34.620> three<00:03:35.620> blocks<00:03:35.919> here<00:03:36.129> I<00:03:36.159> connected<00:03:36.760> and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
these three blocks here I connected and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.180 
these three blocks here I connected and
it<00:03:37.540> would<00:03:37.690> basically<00:03:37.930> try<00:03:38.470> to<00:03:38.530> move<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:39.040> whole

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
it would basically try to move the whole

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.009 
it would basically try to move the whole
in<00:03:39.310> time<00:03:39.489> minecraft<00:03:40.239> world<00:03:40.540> because<00:03:40.870> it's

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
in time minecraft world because it's

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.509 
in time minecraft world because it's
connected<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.650> but<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:42.010> hasn't<00:03:42.400> got<00:03:42.489> enough

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
connected to it but it hasn't got enough

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.849 
connected to it but it hasn't got enough
power<00:03:42.790> to<00:03:42.849> do<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.120> so<00:03:44.079> it's<00:03:44.199> not<00:03:44.290> possible<00:03:44.440> so

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
power to do that so it's not possible so

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.759 
power to do that so it's not possible so
you<00:03:44.919> need<00:03:45.069> to<00:03:45.159> do<00:03:45.549> this<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.500> then<00:03:47.500> create

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
you need to do this and then create

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.860 
you need to do this and then create
space<00:03:48.069> here<00:03:48.400> for<00:03:48.639> it<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.060> run<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.479> it<00:03:49.690> likes

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
space here for it to run to it likes

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.960 
space here for it to run to it likes
lots<00:03:50.109> of<00:03:50.229> space<00:03:50.470> and<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:51.129> would<00:03:51.250> work<00:03:51.280> and

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.250 

there<00:03:54.970> is<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> way<00:03:55.269> to<00:03:55.299> make<00:03:55.569> your<00:03:55.720> frames<00:03:56.049> look

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
there is a way to make your frames look

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.189 
there is a way to make your frames look
pretty<00:03:56.590> and<00:03:56.919> to<00:03:57.280> save<00:03:57.549> on<00:03:57.849> blocks<00:03:58.239> instead<00:03:59.049> of

00:03:59.189 --> 00:03:59.199 
pretty and to save on blocks instead of

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.460 
pretty and to save on blocks instead of
placing<00:03:59.500> lots<00:03:59.829> of<00:04:00.010> blocks<00:04:00.340> down<00:04:00.729> here<00:04:01.290> we<00:04:02.290> can

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
placing lots of blocks down here we can

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.860 
placing lots of blocks down here we can
use<00:04:02.500> covers<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.519> you<00:04:03.549> can<00:04:03.970> get<00:04:04.120> one<00:04:04.359> cub<00:04:04.629> from

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
use covers and you can get one cub from

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.420 
use covers and you can get one cub from
one<00:04:05.079> block<00:04:05.290> so<00:04:05.590> it's<00:04:05.799> not<00:04:05.949> more<00:04:06.099> efficient

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
one block so it's not more efficient

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.210 
one block so it's not more efficient
firstly<00:04:07.329> you<00:04:07.419> need<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.750> make<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:07.930> slab<00:04:08.290> here

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220
