00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
plan to wear it maybe for costuming and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.290

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.809 
clothing I'm not using it for waist
training<00:02:28.890> then<00:02:29.459> this<00:02:29.580> would<00:02:29.700> actually

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
training then this would actually

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.759 
training then this would actually
probably<00:02:30.239> be<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.360> really<00:02:30.420> good<00:02:30.720> size<00:02:30.989> because

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
probably be a really good size because

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.500 
probably be a really good size because
you<00:02:31.860> don't<00:02:32.010> want<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.489> real<00:02:32.940> snug<00:02:33.269> then

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
you don't want it to be real snug then

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.059 
you don't want it to be real snug then
if<00:02:33.630> you're<00:02:33.780> using<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:34.140> for<00:02:34.170> a<00:02:34.470> purpose<00:02:34.769> other

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
if you're using it for a purpose other

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.280 
if you're using it for a purpose other
than<00:02:35.160> waist<00:02:35.700> training<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.209> for<00:02:36.780> me<00:02:36.930> this

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
than waist training but for me this

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.750 
than waist training but for me this
would<00:02:37.500> be<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.950> would<00:02:38.010> definitely<00:02:38.250> be<00:02:38.489> too

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
would be this would definitely be too

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.030

because you can work this boning in the
front<00:03:47.620> but<00:03:48.400> because<00:03:48.609> it's<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:49.030> much<00:03:49.659> easier<00:03:50.760> to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
front but because it's so much easier to

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.979

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
torque on it they pop in much much nicer

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.140

tight and it feels tight in a weird way

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.450
