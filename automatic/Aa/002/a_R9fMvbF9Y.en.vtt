00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.990 
the very realistic human story that i
thought<00:02:56.060> was<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.570> most<00:02:56.710> human<00:02:57.710> halo<00:02:58.460> ever<00:02:58.700> and

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
thought was the most human halo ever and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.060 
thought was the most human halo ever and
what<00:02:59.120> i<00:02:59.150> mean<00:02:59.210> by<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.690> we<00:03:00.080> had<00:03:00.350> halo<00:03:00.560> 1<00:03:00.860> 2

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.670 
what i mean by that is we had halo 1 2
and<00:03:01.220> 3<00:03:01.280> which<00:03:01.760> was<00:03:01.880> very<00:03:02.090> sci-fi<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:03.140> totally

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.290 
and 3 which was very sci-fi and totally
out<00:03:03.830> there<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.190> I'm<00:03:04.520> not<00:03:04.640> trying<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:04.940> harp<00:03:05.150> on

problem<00:03:11.300> with<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.660> halo<00:03:12.260> 4<00:03:12.290> was<00:03:12.850> extremely

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
problem with that halo 4 was extremely

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.730 
problem with that halo 4 was extremely
sci-fi<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.750> that's<00:03:14.870> okay<00:03:15.230> because<00:03:15.470> that's

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
sci-fi and that's okay because that's

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.830 
sci-fi and that's okay because that's
what<00:03:15.950> they<00:03:16.040> wanted<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.520> do<00:03:16.700> ODST<00:03:17.300> was<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
what they wanted to do ODST was the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.480 
what they wanted to do ODST was the
first<00:03:18.080> Halo<00:03:18.350> game<00:03:18.560> made<00:03:18.740> by<00:03:18.770> Bungie<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.460> I

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
first Halo game made by Bungie that I

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.980 
first Halo game made by Bungie that I
thought<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:19.970> they<00:03:20.150> kind<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.510> stepped<00:03:20.810> in<00:03:20.900> a

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
thought that they kind of stepped in a

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.300 
thought that they kind of stepped in a
more<00:03:21.170> human<00:03:21.500> direction<00:03:21.950> because<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.190> weren't

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
more human direction because you weren't

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.010 
more human direction because you weren't
playing<00:03:22.550> as<00:03:22.760> a<00:03:22.790> big<00:03:23.090> super<00:03:23.510> soldier<00:03:23.870> you're

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
playing as a big super soldier you're

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.750 
playing as a big super soldier you're
playing<00:03:24.320> as<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.500> regular<00:03:24.890> human<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:25.460> reach

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
playing as a regular human and reach

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.580 
playing as a regular human and reach
you're<00:03:26.060> playing<00:03:26.420> during<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.930> fall<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.410> reach

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
you're playing during the fall of reach

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.380 
you're playing during the fall of reach
so<00:03:27.830> you<00:03:27.890> know<00:03:28.130> you're<00:03:28.280> not<00:03:28.400> gonna<00:03:28.640> win<00:03:29.000> there's

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
so you know you're not gonna win there's

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.940 
so you know you're not gonna win there's
gonna<00:03:29.540> be<00:03:29.750> deaths<00:03:30.080> and<00:03:30.440> there's<00:03:30.590> gonna<00:03:30.740> be

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
gonna be deaths and there's gonna be

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.620 
gonna be deaths and there's gonna be
sorrow<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:31.790> we're<00:03:31.940> not<00:03:32.060> really<00:03:32.210> used<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.540> that

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
sorrow and we're not really used to that

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.060 
sorrow and we're not really used to that
compared<00:03:33.020> to<00:03:33.050> halo<00:03:33.200> because<00:03:33.500> master<00:03:33.890> chief

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
compared to halo because master chief

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.370 
compared to halo because master chief
always<00:03:34.520> wins<00:03:34.880> but<00:03:35.180> noble<00:03:35.570> team<00:03:35.750> doesn't<00:03:36.320> win

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
always wins but noble team doesn't win

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.680 
always wins but noble team doesn't win
and<00:03:36.920> it's<00:03:37.100> very<00:03:37.340> cool<00:03:37.580> to<00:03:37.640> see<00:03:37.940> their<00:03:38.150> struggle

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
and it's very cool to see their struggle

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.750 
and it's very cool to see their struggle
plus<00:03:38.870> I<00:03:39.110> thought<00:03:39.380> reach<00:03:39.740> was<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.070> much<00:03:40.460> more

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
plus I thought reach was a much more

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.110 
plus I thought reach was a much more
serious<00:03:41.680> professional<00:03:42.680> skillful<00:03:43.670> shooter

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
serious professional skillful shooter

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.020 
serious professional skillful shooter
than<00:03:44.360> halo<00:03:44.720> 3<00:03:45.500> or<00:03:45.770> the<00:03:45.980> other<00:03:46.130> halos<00:03:46.400> not<00:03:46.850> many

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
than halo 3 or the other halos not many

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.490 
than halo 3 or the other halos not many
people<00:03:47.270> like<00:03:47.420> reaches<00:03:47.780> multiplayer<00:03:48.260> that's

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
people like reaches multiplayer that's

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.420 
people like reaches multiplayer that's
one<00:03:48.650> thing<00:03:48.740> i<00:03:48.830> don't<00:03:48.980> really<00:03:49.070> like<00:03:49.190> about

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
one thing i don't really like about

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.190 
one thing i don't really like about
reach<00:03:49.700> itself<00:03:50.090> is<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.330> multiplayer<00:03:50.750> wasn't

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
reach itself is the multiplayer wasn't

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.960 
reach itself is the multiplayer wasn't
that<00:03:51.350> fun<00:03:51.680> but<00:03:51.950> i<00:03:51.980> do<00:03:52.070> think<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.610> reach<00:03:52.940> has

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
that fun but i do think that reach has

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.900 
that fun but i do think that reach has
the<00:03:53.390> most<00:03:53.780> precise<00:03:54.710> because<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.490> bloom<00:03:55.730> was

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
the most precise because the bloom was

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.640 
the most precise because the bloom was
in<00:03:56.090> there<00:03:56.330> like<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:56.720> had<00:03:56.900> to<00:03:56.990> be<00:03:57.110> really<00:03:57.140> good

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
in there like you had to be really good

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.200 
in there like you had to be really good
at<00:03:57.770> reach<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.310> really<00:03:58.550> enjoy<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:58.940> if<00:03:59.090> you

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
at reach to really enjoy it if you

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.030 
at reach to really enjoy it if you
sucked<00:03:59.480> at<00:03:59.630> reach<00:03:59.840> you<00:04:00.170> didn't<00:04:00.620> like<00:04:00.740> it<00:04:00.920> at

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
sucked at reach you didn't like it at

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.680 
sucked at reach you didn't like it at
