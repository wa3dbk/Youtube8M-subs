00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 No 

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:15.049
 Nine people here is the flea market get another damper 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.820
 at 10 50 pm he is actually saying welcome to another one 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.860
 Cross country 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.569
 on the channel of Salzmann vom 7 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.639
 At this point I would like to first of all he does not worry that 

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:28.919
 you do not drive us a counter 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.609
 giving you a chance to get known 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.570
 yes and here has received almost an infinite number of orders 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.500
 with center people with full severity 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.510
 ManU section of the weapon must be the current one 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.050
 also with Monza 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 my practices the typical Skype Roberts so Slider fist cases on the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.160
 text 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.470
 and unanswered yes I do not know now so far English is called 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.560
 what ever 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.860
 In any case, this is yes as I said and gas group e 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.300
 That's why I just imagine it 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.500
 So I'm the Florian brother also fled the shelf the Emsland 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.340
 I'm coming to Terry's since the beginning of January 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.070
 and the Arge I play mainly Modern Warfare 2 now and then again 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.240
 Black Ops 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.680
 and that means if you look at it you can see one of us 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.480
 mainly only on 4 2 Konzell showed videos 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.409
 however, and now and again, blackouts are not 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.750
 outstanding 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.670
 Tagesspiegel 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.270
 not so often with me 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.120
 more catfish she's in 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.340
 well 8 has that's another topic 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.560
 definitely 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.180
 then, of course, the question arises why do I get so close 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.300
 Every day why I'm so alone in the room 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.600
 in front of my PC and contract workers look forward to my screen with any team 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.420
 quite simply I want to get in touch with the users at people like this 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.770
 exchange a bit 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.800
 what's new 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.070
 i just want to be a bit like this i also know her on two dates 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.159
 of course not just a bit in terms of media design of the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.940
 Interior Minister Sarar so a little further 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.060
 form 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.440
 that helped me a lot to Annen the tour a house 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.919
 what I think so too or La but that is 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.199
 I'll do that then I'll say videos 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.449
 then yes synonymous with the same topic 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.449
 about Oberlaa Weichen and the Russian my GPS 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.909
 yes I always think of the beginning of video 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.670
 in the topic off or maybe even two topics about it then so 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:33.359
 But that does not mean that I want to talk that way 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:38.010
 Bela firmly on a topic of money and you just can not deny 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:42.439
 Of course, that does not mean bad luck that is and by nature 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:46.059
 Basic theme and then a few meters Gelabert 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:52.079
 for example, theme Modern Warfare 2 salvation example 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.179
 Of course not only will be around 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.269
 To be on top of that the store is not just the number of two Gelabert but will too 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.700
 for a bit 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.229
 with black boxes so very different so it is now basic theme 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:08.639
 and then there's going to pull off the egg but it's embarrassing now 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.000
 so for not that everywhere so high Â»is the topic 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.480
 sometimes just work on it 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.099
 It also does not really have to be the same as just shooters games the game result 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:20.659
 drain 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.259
 but it can also be so easy if off topic 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:25.569
 and 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.769
 Percent it can also be contrary to other things as I said 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.919
 and of course she was not like that 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.290
 "It's past summer vacation or something so I think that through that 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.769
 Interested 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.459
 and I do not think I really want us to be something like Meier 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.459
 around 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.869
 So I think you know what I mean 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:49.139
 and I am also one of those who would like to have some feedback then 

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:54.169
 that means if I made a video interrupts then choose it is 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.259
 really nice to find next to thumbs up 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.870
 that I'm not horny or anything right now 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.859
 but in 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.729
 that's a big and small incentive to continue doing that helps 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:06.959
 somehow 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.289
 It's a bad feeling when you know it's someone 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.709
 his work liked or liked his work 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.829
 and maybe one or the other can comment on it 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.400
 leave behind or something 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.809
 it would just be superclass 

00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:24.269
 yes and even if you did not like the video so could synonymous 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.680
 Leave a comment and tell me what you did not like but if 

00:04:28.679 --> 00:04:32.039
 I do not know which of course did not like it and partly it does not matter 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.409
 it was perhaps just as approaching that nothing again 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:39.319
 but then he says what you do not like here then I can do that 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.840
 next time 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.099
 I think even better and then maybe you like it 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.800
 I'm around 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.319
 I also think that lives from Gysi that they are a bit like 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.129
 said out of frustration and 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.779
 experienced in it 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.660
 no idea how we all continue to improve 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.659
 I am also one of those who likes to be and has now set off 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.689
 So I do not do it now I did not say it now 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.360
 Task in the head 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.129
 So any video must be in the 5 now, no, not at all 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.660
 in a 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.680
 if we what a field then I say that of one 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.430
 draw the EMA experience and you are interested in something then I can too 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:18.059
 times 

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:21.059
 so and now has to give way 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.300
 that's why I'm the beautiful and others of the community the captain 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.719
 General Sodener was able to do the scene 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.240
 that one stops 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.760
 It always helps each other to be so 16 4 percent 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.580
 has another problem 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.319
 that 's just the cool thing about the instruments that' s supposed to be that way 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.620
 has a possibility 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.879
 do something like that 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:48.289
 and year so i'm holding that's my come her as i hope i could get you guys 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.069
 so 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:50.930
 not clear up yet 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.690
 if the video is coming to you he'll come anyway and then he could 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.350
 maybe still looking at the canal construction a comment but hardly judges 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.680
 leave 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.430
 an isolated case maybe a small thing and was 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.509
 This money is already changed 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:08.349
 I found it 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.069
 Scareware just fine that he says it's just Mama's club too 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:12.730
 Man taken 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.050
 I hope it does not stand proud if some of you look 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.879
 yes and that was it again when such a fall has heard and certainly times 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:20.849
 again 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:22.109
 that almost a traffic jam
