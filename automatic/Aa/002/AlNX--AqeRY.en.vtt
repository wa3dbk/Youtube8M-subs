nothing too complicated maybe the roof

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.330 
nothing too complicated maybe the roof
and<00:00:15.590> recent<00:00:16.590> baiting<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.920> came<00:00:17.100> up<00:00:17.190> with<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
and recent baiting I came up with the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.429 
and recent baiting I came up with the
design<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.420> started<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> new<00:00:18.960> survival<00:00:19.230> world

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
design is I started a new survival world

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.349 
design is I started a new survival world
it's<00:00:19.770> just<00:00:19.949> thought<00:00:20.130> something<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.490> do<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.880> I

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
it's just thought something to do and I

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.529 
it's just thought something to do and I
wanted<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.020> come<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.199> with<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.380> house<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:23.010> was

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
wanted to come up with a house that was

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.920 
wanted to come up with a house that was
relatively<00:00:24.539> cheap<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.050> make<00:00:26.480> yeah<00:00:27.480> thinking

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
relatively cheap to make yeah thinking

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.140 
relatively cheap to make yeah thinking
back<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.529> probably<00:00:29.250> not<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> cheapest<00:00:29.910> but

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
back it's probably not the cheapest but

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.200 
back it's probably not the cheapest but
I<00:00:30.859> think<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.279> think<00:00:32.430> it's<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> nice<00:00:32.940> house

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
and it's something that's not going to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.350

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
take too long not too difficult and also

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.250 
life and in game as well I think it
looks<00:02:02.190> really<00:02:02.310> nice<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.900> thought<00:02:03.900> what<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.170> is

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
looks really nice I thought what it is

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.860 
looks really nice I thought what it is
about<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.650> it's<00:02:04.800> just<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.630> what's

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
about it it's just it's just what's

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.900 
about it it's just it's just what's
right<00:02:07.080> if<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.620> know<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> mean<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.429> as<00:02:08.550> well<00:02:08.729> of

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
right if you know I mean and as well of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.160 
right if you know I mean and as well of
I<00:02:09.000> haven't<00:02:09.300> liked<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.540> overhanging<00:02:09.929> roof

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
I haven't liked the overhanging roof

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.010 
I haven't liked the overhanging roof
connected<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.040> it<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:12.420> doesn't<00:02:12.660> make<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.870> seem

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
connected to it it doesn't make you seem

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.530 
connected to it it doesn't make you seem
out<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.230> place<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.860> seems<00:02:14.190> sort<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.300> roofs

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
out of place it seems sort of the roofs

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.600 
out of place it seems sort of the roofs
being<00:02:15.780> supported<00:02:16.320> by<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.530> balcony<00:02:17.070> if<00:02:17.430> that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
being supported by the balcony if that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.460 
being supported by the balcony if that
makes<00:02:17.790> any<00:02:17.880> sense

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
makes any sense

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.440 
makes any sense
I'll<00:02:19.470> talk<00:02:19.680> more<00:02:19.709> about<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.100> roof<00:02:20.250> later<00:02:20.490> but

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
I'll talk more about the roof later but

I'll talk more about the roof later but
for<00:02:21.570> now<00:02:22.250> it's<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> balcony<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.150> we<00:02:24.420> can<00:02:24.570> get

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
for now it's the balcony so we can get

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.080 
for now it's the balcony so we can get
up<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.580> like<00:02:26.580> so

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
here but you know you can see out maybe

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.590 
here but you know you can see out maybe
some<00:02:31.950> other<00:02:32.220> stuff<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.490> built<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:33.420> glass

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
relatively big room if you're thinking

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.550 
relatively big room if you're thinking
like<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:42.690> first<00:02:42.959> survival

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
like this first survival

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.310 
like this first survival

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
you can fill our chest in here since I

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.720 
you can fill our chest in here since I
wasn't<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.040> was<00:02:47.130> more<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.400> creative

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
wasn't and it was more of a creative

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
wasn't and it was more of a creative
thing<00:02:47.940> I've<00:02:48.300> stuck<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.980> computer<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.600> I<00:02:51.600> was

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
thing I've stuck a computer and I was

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.210 
thing I've stuck a computer and I was
gonna<00:02:51.840> put<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> TV<00:02:52.260> here<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:52.800> I<00:02:52.830> couldn't<00:02:53.160> think

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
gonna put a TV here but I couldn't think

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.540 
gonna put a TV here but I couldn't think
of<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.459> TV<00:02:53.790> zone<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:55.019> big<00:02:55.170> space<00:02:55.550> the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
of a TV zone so it's a big space the

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.640 
of a TV zone so it's a big space the
people<00:02:56.850> living<00:02:57.090> here<00:02:57.120> I'm<00:02:57.300> moving<00:02:57.390> in<00:02:57.690> that's

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
people living here I'm moving in that's

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.120 
people living here I'm moving in that's
no<00:02:58.830> excuse<00:02:59.600> so<00:03:00.600> nothing<00:03:01.230> much<00:03:01.380> inside<00:03:01.830> but

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
no excuse so nothing much inside but

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.120 
no excuse so nothing much inside but
just<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.820> get<00:03:02.940> an<00:03:03.030> idea<00:03:03.090> for<00:03:03.450> space<00:03:03.890> I've<00:03:04.890> used

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
just to get an idea for space I've used

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.970 
just to get an idea for space I've used
the<00:03:05.190> beams<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.760> they<00:03:05.850> didn't<00:03:06.090> seem<00:03:06.269> as<00:03:06.480> open<00:03:07.019> if

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the beams so they didn't seem as open if

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.380 
the beams so they didn't seem as open if
you<00:03:08.130> guys<00:03:08.250> want<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.550> recreate<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.180> then

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
you guys want to recreate this then

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.150 
you guys want to recreate this then
obviously<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:10.290> don't<00:03:10.350> need<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.650> use<00:03:10.830> them<00:03:11.010> I

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
obviously you don't need to use them I

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.750 
obviously you don't need to use them I
just<00:03:11.670> think<00:03:11.820> you<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:13.080> makes<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.650> seem<00:03:13.860> more

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
just think you it makes it seem more

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.390 
just think you it makes it seem more
compact<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.330> cozy<00:03:15.800> if<00:03:16.800> that<00:03:16.950> makes<00:03:17.100> any<00:03:17.190> sense

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
compact and cozy if that makes any sense

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.449 
compact and cozy if that makes any sense
at<00:03:17.610> all<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.110> I<00:03:19.110> shout<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.560> windows<00:03:19.950> the

nice big windows at the back here I
suppose<00:03:29.940> for<00:03:30.180> light<00:03:31.010> doesn't<00:03:32.010> really<00:03:32.130> matter

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
suppose for light doesn't really matter

suppose for light doesn't really matter
in<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.550> computer<00:03:32.880> game<00:03:32.910> but<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:33.870> can<00:03:34.019> see

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
in a computer game but you can see

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.000 
in a computer game but you can see
outside<00:03:34.290> as<00:03:34.560> well<00:03:35.330> so<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.540> nice<00:03:37.110> I<00:03:37.320> was<00:03:37.530> saying

now<00:03:48.030> I've<00:03:48.270> talked<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> bit<00:03:48.750> more<00:03:48.930> about<00:03:49.110> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
now I've talked a bit more about the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.580 
now I've talked a bit more about the
design<00:03:49.730> as<00:03:50.730> with<00:03:50.970> most<00:03:51.120> of<00:03:51.330> my<00:03:51.420> stuff<00:03:51.660> I'll<00:03:52.290> use

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
design as with most of my stuff I'll use

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.290 
design as with most of my stuff I'll use
odd<00:03:52.740> numbers<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.820> get<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:53.970> point

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
odd numbers so that you get a point

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.000 
odd numbers so that you get a point
pointy<00:03:54.810> roof<00:03:54.960> because<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.500> like<00:03:55.620> this<00:03:55.710> kind<00:03:55.890> of

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
pointy roof because I like this kind of

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.770 
pointy roof because I like this kind of
thing<00:03:56.190> I'm<00:03:56.730> actually<00:03:56.940> thinking<00:03:57.240> and<00:03:57.690> I'm

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
thing I'm actually thinking and I'm

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.360 
thing I'm actually thinking and I'm
tempted<00:03:57.960> to<00:03:58.290> maybe<00:03:58.470> do<00:03:58.740> it<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.850> designer<00:04:00.180> used

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
tempted to maybe do it the designer used

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.700 
tempted to maybe do it the designer used
for<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.870> limit<00:04:03.870> evil<00:04:04.140> stuff<00:04:04.320> when<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.620> would

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
for the limit evil stuff when you would

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.500 
for the limit evil stuff when you would
have<00:04:04.860> a<00:04:04.890> roof<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.430> was<00:04:05.520> sort<00:04:05.820> of<00:04:05.880> you<00:04:06.360> just

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
have a roof that was sort of you just

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.430 
have a roof that was sort of you just
visualize<00:04:06.870> this<00:04:07.820> that<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:09.570> then<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.350> you

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
visualize this that and then that if you

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.920 
visualize this that and then that if you
know<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.590> mean<00:04:10.910> rather<00:04:11.910> than<00:04:12.180> this<00:04:12.330> design<00:04:12.690> I

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
know I mean rather than this design I

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.800 
know I mean rather than this design I
think<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.470> looks<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.770> bit<00:04:13.920> strange<00:04:14.570> if<00:04:15.570> I'm

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
think this looks a bit strange if I'm

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.920 
think this looks a bit strange if I'm
honest<00:04:16.140> but<00:04:16.850> I<00:04:17.850> really<00:04:18.360> did<00:04:18.480> like<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.750> way<00:04:18.840> it

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
honest but I really did like the way it

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.920 
honest but I really did like the way it
looks<00:04:19.080> at<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.260> front<00:04:19.470> here<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.600> plus<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.900> have

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
looks at the front here and plus to have

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.710 
looks at the front here and plus to have
one<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.860> those<00:04:22.980> roofs<00:04:23.340> since<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.300> house<00:04:24.420> is<00:04:24.570> so

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
one of those roofs since a house is so

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.430 
one of those roofs since a house is so
wide<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.470> probably<00:04:26.160> wouldn't<00:04:26.340> have<00:04:26.460> worked<00:04:27.440> as

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
wide it probably wouldn't have worked as

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.740 
wide it probably wouldn't have worked as
well<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.430> also<00:04:29.910> because<00:04:30.120> it's<00:04:30.270> quite<00:04:30.450> short

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
well I and also because it's quite short

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
well I and also because it's quite short
so<00:04:31.820> probably<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.940> best<00:04:33.020> but<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.290> ended<00:04:34.650> up

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
so probably the best but I ended up

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.680 
so probably the best but I ended up
going<00:04:34.950> with<00:04:35.070> this<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.460> all<00:04:36.090> this<00:04:36.210> design<00:04:36.540> is

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
going with this and all this design is

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.200 
going with this and all this design is
he's<00:04:36.900> just<00:04:37.160> having<00:04:38.160> stair<00:04:38.490> and<00:04:38.790> upside<00:04:39.090> down

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
he's just having stair and upside down

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.120 
he's just having stair and upside down
stair<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.780> just<00:04:39.960> alternating<00:04:40.380> these<00:04:40.710> going

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
stair and just alternating these going

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.910 
stair and just alternating these going
up<00:04:41.540> and<00:04:42.540> finally<00:04:42.960> coming<00:04:43.110> to<00:04:43.230> a<00:04:43.290> point<00:04:43.590> which

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
up and finally coming to a point which

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.570 
up and finally coming to a point which
sticks<00:04:44.190> out<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:45.890> used<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.010> stone<00:04:47.280> as<00:04:47.430> like<00:04:47.550> a

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
sticks out I used the stone as like a

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.310 
sticks out I used the stone as like a
trim<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:48.000> then<00:04:48.570> he<00:04:48.690> used<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.930> what<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.230> the

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
trim and then he used the what is the

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.680 
trim and then he used the what is the
main<00:04:49.500> body<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:49.920> it<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.610> then<00:04:51.240> finishing<00:04:51.630> up

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
main body of it and then finishing up

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.720 
main body of it and then finishing up
with<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.870> cobble<00:04:52.200> at<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.070> top<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:53.490> it<00:04:53.580> looks

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
with the cobble at the top so it looks

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.260 
with the cobble at the top so it looks
like<00:04:53.790> it's<00:04:54.060> an<00:04:54.510> awesome<00:04:54.690> support<00:04:55.850> now<00:04:56.850> if<00:04:57.120> we

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
like it's an awesome support now if we

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.320 
like it's an awesome support now if we
had<00:04:57.360> around<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.630> back<00:04:57.900> see<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.680> wheat<00:04:58.860> farm

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
had around the back see the wheat farm

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.550 
had around the back see the wheat farm
like<00:05:00.330> I<00:05:00.450> said<00:05:00.630> with<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> survival<00:05:01.470> aspect

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
like I said with the survival aspect

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.940 
like I said with the survival aspect
it's<00:05:02.370> as<00:05:02.550> simple<00:05:02.730> that<00:05:03.030> we<00:05:03.180> farm<00:05:03.480> back<00:05:03.690> here

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
it's as simple that we farm back here

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.110 
it's as simple that we farm back here
it's<00:05:04.950> kind<00:05:05.130> of<00:05:05.190> nice<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.640> then<00:05:05.910> with<00:05:06.060> the

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
it's kind of nice and then with the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.700 
it's kind of nice and then with the
windows<00:05:06.690> there<00:05:07.760> so<00:05:08.760> I<00:05:09.120> guess<00:05:09.750> that's<00:05:09.900> it<00:05:10.140> for

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
windows there so I guess that's it for

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.490 
windows there so I guess that's it for
this<00:05:10.770> video<00:05:10.920> and<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:12.120> hope<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.260> liked<00:05:13.380> the

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
this video and I hope you liked the

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.470 
this video and I hope you liked the
design<00:05:13.770> like<00:05:14.400> I've<00:05:14.520> seen<00:05:14.730> it's<00:05:14.910> just<00:05:15.120> it's

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
design like I've seen it's just it's

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.630 
design like I've seen it's just it's
gonna<00:05:15.600> log<00:05:15.870> cobble<00:05:16.320> cobble<00:05:16.350> cobble<00:05:16.560> log<00:05:17.070> Cove

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
gonna log cobble cobble cobble log Cove

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.630 
gonna log cobble cobble cobble log Cove
cobble<00:05:17.970> and<00:05:18.120> then<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:19.200> same<00:05:20.010> gain<00:05:20.250> this<00:05:20.370> way<00:05:20.580> so

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
cobble and then a same gain this way so

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.430 
cobble and then a same gain this way so
it's<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.120> square<00:05:21.330> building<00:05:21.720> and<00:05:21.900> then<00:05:22.290> what<00:05:22.410> I

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
it's a square building and then what I

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.040 
it's a square building and then what I
did<00:05:22.560> was<00:05:22.970> I'll<00:05:23.970> see<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.240> here<00:05:24.420> where<00:05:24.780> I've<00:05:24.900> got

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
did was I'll see it here where I've got

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.990 
did was I'll see it here where I've got
these<00:05:25.140> main<00:05:25.410> pillars<00:05:25.830> I've<00:05:26.490> just<00:05:26.700> come<00:05:26.880> off

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
these main pillars I've just come off

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.750 
these main pillars I've just come off
with<00:05:27.690> another<00:05:27.930> block<00:05:28.169> and<00:05:28.470> then<00:05:28.740> I<00:05:28.950> had<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:29.669> out

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
with another block and then I had it out

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.650 
with another block and then I had it out
one<00:05:30.560> like<00:05:31.560> so

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
one like so

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.390 
one like so
well<00:05:34.660> I<00:05:34.960> guess<00:05:35.830> that's<00:05:36.070> it<00:05:36.340> for<00:05:37.150> the<00:05:37.240> tour<00:05:37.450> now

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
well I guess that's it for the tour now

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.030 
well I guess that's it for the tour now
oh<00:05:41.790> yeah<00:05:42.790> that's<00:05:43.420> about<00:05:43.660> it<00:05:43.870> I<00:05:44.050> hope<00:05:44.740> you<00:05:44.890> guys
