00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
basically the best is breaking up which

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.650 
basically the best is breaking up which
is<00:02:18.780> going<00:02:19.849> but<00:02:20.849> here<00:02:21.030> that's<00:02:21.870> specially<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.230> am

is going but here that's specially I am

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:34.100 
is going but here that's specially I am
guys<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:33.030> roughly<00:02:33.330> cost<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.660> opponent

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110
