00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.470
 This video here I 'm recording for 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.960
 answer the main questions 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.110
 they came when we released the video 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.389
 today of the giant hexagonal epa 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.980
 I'm recording with cell phone in total 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 of a real one that we recorded 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.160
 today here in the world will probably 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.830
 to launch Saturday we'll see if we can 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.230
 You can prevent it and we will win 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.340
 means the city also because I 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.960
 stress this good business is she does not have 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.189
 here the main doubts have arisen in 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.689
 comments 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.120
 the first thing you're staff 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.540
 losing enough can only turn off 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.149
 left closing the window much dictation is 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.390
 A typical one says play play is when 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.579
 fifa you can pull her she goes 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.410
 coming down and you can do 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.899
 moves with fifa to make maneuvers 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.730
 with the team and I do not think 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.960
 mainly because this fifa is 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.550
 very symmetrical 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.430
 She's almost round so it's a has a 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.410
 good format to do many 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.430
 pirouettes in the sky will not stay longer 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.229
 stop 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.409
 in compensation it is easier to control 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.060
 everything will be much longer there is no 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.040
 I know maybe someone is very good at 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.070
 drop a kite, you can dedicate your 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 team is other people complained that 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.090
 I was missing here asking for rain that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.530
 it was dangerous to fall good ray it was not day 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.180
 of rain where it was only a little cloudy 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.710
 the day was closed but it was not 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.080
 threatening to rain much less who the hell 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.460
 has a detail here the manual of the world to 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.380
 people record video and sometimes delay 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.420
 long to put the city in the air 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.700
 and it was the case I think if people 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.530
 recorded in August and September time of year 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.979
 it was super dry it was up a little 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.970
 cloudy but it was not raining 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.460
 had no chance of lightning 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.759
 now it's super dangerous in summer 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.799
 a little cloudy is already dangerous you take 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.780
 in the head now for example a rain 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.000
 very strong out there that he was 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:56.060
 thinking until I could record because 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.060
 there is still nothing 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.369
 the cell phone can not see right 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.619
 good but the question is this was not 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.710
 looked dangerous fall is not is not drop 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.160
 would never have been at risk of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.039
 fall 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.300
 another thing is a lot of people sang where already 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.690
 bo 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.580
 is a good question do not you think one 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.440
 bo because boss in the city too 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.710
 I find it harder to find bamboo 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.330
 I bought a kite mark on stationery going 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.280
 to have bamboo 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.840
 if you will do with it, you will have to pay 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.050
 Normal may give to one another necklace 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.560
 I do not know if it's good but the hotel 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.190
 person did not grow up on the site with a 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.840
 Bamboo from my side of the house then 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.790
 I do not know, I think I'll have to 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.750
 go out on the road and find a 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.860
 roadside 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.020
 is what most people quite a lot in 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.700
 a person who can not use a type of 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.560
 linen I used good so you do not have 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.110
 an international federation of pipelines 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.410
 forbidden to use this type of line 4 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.450
 works super well super tough and 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.880
 had at my mother's house always gave me 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.680
 using a person told me that it was a good 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.360
 line is a very good line 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.490
 I looked for this line to buy no 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.320
 I think it's not a very easy line, I'll 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.330
 try to buy online 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.610
 I think this line would be ideal and well 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.950
 a super thin nylon-resistant 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.770
 also did not turn out to be very dangerous and 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.709
 can not cut until there will need a 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.630
 more about this is that once 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.150
 person who would make more sense if 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.950
 Brazil had been the sixth champion after all 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.650
 a hexagonal shaped pipe 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.980
 Brazil would do anyway he wanted to do 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.140
 his kite for the canopy but did not have time and 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.480
 Good that Brazil won the Cup I 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.190
 I'm not going to do a lot of people here 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.350
 asking about the biscuit 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:49.560
 Search survival survival're 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:52.800
 here he is here I wrote that open 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.680
 in April of 2015 when it will make a year 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.380
 video then the cookie does not have a 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.480
 year why not open then yet 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.980
 Calm down, coming April in April. 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.870
 opened biscuit or the good wafer here in 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.340
 São Paulo I think the biscuit in each 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.530
 different shape that I want 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.810
 make a map of where ngola is spoken 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.459
 arrives and speaks biscuit indeed runs 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.830
 below please state that the 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.830
 watching the video and if in your 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.570
 state we talk cookie the cookie do 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.100
 this research has the world after 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.460
 put a machine on facebook the biggest 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.009
 of the world 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.030
 see which are the states that have bolatti 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:32.310
 with states it's talk cookie is that more 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.349
 there are several people who gave tips when 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.770
 stretching the role of fifa could have 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:39.419
 placed fire well not on top was the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.030
 fire the victim but placed close to 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:44.940
 fire because there is the old and dry and 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.130
 listen and stretch out on paper and be 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.639
 better esticadinho good tip is very 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.870
 cool 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.370
 someone else said that if I did 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.169
 this would not have required putting the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.900
 ribbons in the corners 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.650
 This is not true because I tested this 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.860
 of fans 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.840
 I did a test before and in the test the 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.759
 very easy ripped paper then I realized 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.400
 it's good to make a ribbon reinforcement 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.740
 adhesive and have strived a lot the team 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.800
 it has been a long time in heaven that 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.660
 I told her in a video of the sheets. 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.909
 tied from others that prisoners use 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.139
 to escape from prison and did not remember the 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.750
 Name one person remembered 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.240
 that is called teresa then teresa is 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.370
 that rope made with a fire in the 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.380
 others who have quite discouraged the 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.530
 person to run away from home and presents 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.229
 Throw that out the window and come down 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.340
 slipping is a bunch of mimimi tá 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.560
 Complaining that I 'm making videos 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.729
 very complicated good will always have 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.590
 someone in charge that everyone in the video 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.570
 very complicated what I 'm doing 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.400
 a very simple video 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.840
 so we are in doubt that people 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.280
 should make a bit more complicated a 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.289
 a bit simpler and try to change a 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.310
 Little do we make a simple video at 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.630
 sometimes it 's complicated 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.639
 the video of Tuesday for example that the 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.830
 experience was black light on the cell phone 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.090
 It was super simple fact of having been a 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.669
 little more complicated 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.259
 the Saturday video that will be the game of 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.759
 Thursday is more complicated than Saturday 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.449
 will be the role of selton mello is well 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.919
 simple 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:03.780
 so we have to switch one 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.370
 few more complicated videos but 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.159
 who is not very nice of the most 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.780
 simple that we always try to 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:12.000
 also has very cool results 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.280
 it is always possible also a little more 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.050
 simple and a lot of people asked if 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.000
 imperious you had there in the cartoon network 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.740
 a television program 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.940
 He even said that we are doing 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.610
 a television program on the menu 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.460
 now also passes into the future and 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.440
 in the future station every morning and 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.219
 night or afternoon I think on a website of 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.050
 future is called experimentalus 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:40.020
 extraordinary people who want to have a 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:43.080
 tim bum and memory of getting old has 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.120
 a behind-the-scenes video 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.569
 program in the manual channel of the 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.770
 world 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.780
 Good, it's been a long time since I've been there. 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.020
 commented a video here of the comments 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:53.190
 I'll try to do this more but it's okay. 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.810
 work then I'll try to make a 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.650
 cell phone that has quality plan 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.599
 it is bad 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.580
 I'm sorry, what can I do here? 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.659
 blog if I'm light camera hand and 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.949
 do not call me 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:03.360
 I will not be able to always respond to the 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:05.340
 video comments that I think are cool 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.199
 to do so, that's it, it's worth having 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.669
 noting that in addition to the video of 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:10.830
 has a video of the reel in which the 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.000
 people are going to make the one that 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.310
 a guarantee you will not make when 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.789
 a child in a very nice house to 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.050
 drop a kite that you can collect 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:20.009
 team much more easily if she 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.599
 fall 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:23.250
 he also had us talk like that 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:25.199
 square attitude that I can do it with 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.569
 the fiscal tour is a glass is ours not 

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:30.990
 You can collect the kite fast 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:32.969
 That primer there is ninja worth it. 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.500
