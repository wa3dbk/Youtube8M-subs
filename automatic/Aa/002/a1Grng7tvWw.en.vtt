 but as for the dark horse and such 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.559
 the team has a place absolutely on any 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.660
 tournament and just the same in this regard 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.850
 Choice Dima attacks team 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.859
 Copenhagen Waltz which had to

 team solomid dyrus which together with 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.750
 their teammates stone unturned 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.729
 left from the new composition of lemondogs in 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.830
 battles for atlantic 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.750
 according to the words dyrus and not worth it 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.090
 underestimate the new composition 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.150
 organizations are no worse 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.810
 previous though after seeing 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.820
 difficult to believe it can be considerable 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.220
 number of people were shocked that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.960
 team ninja son of a page of masses flies by 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.420
 past 4 seasons lc 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.509
 about the game of the Polish team with Kane xi 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.579
 score 0 3 according tabs namely 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.130
 contagion ditch was a key player in 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.360
 part no and it was he who had to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.270
 their own shoulders 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.850
 takes out the team in victory however choice a 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.610
 at the top in the form of Kyle did not let him 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.409
 make note of the fact that the team is not 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.020
 jass'linn paige masses throughout 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.259
 three games were afraid of losing what they are 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.110
 principle and did not deserve wright phreak 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.610
 noticed a very interesting pattern 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.140
 teams that participated on 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.390
 get wet 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.850
 tournament on lcs and won their first 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.819
 the game is then entirely successful 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.920
 lost the whole series of best of five 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.510
 so it was in the confrontation copenhagen 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.330
 Wolski video maker 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.270
 so it was in a match with to gaming and soup move 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.220
 hook and so it should have been according to 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.610
 frick with gmc command 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.100
 however, the ability to play on the mistakes of others 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.420
 passivity is not and other factors 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.200
 violated the pattern derived 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.660
 freak no limit to outrage in 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.580
 next tweet like lemondogs team 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.830
 completely replaced its 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.760
 line-up deserves a place in the fourth 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.580
 season lcs 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.250
 quoted jason caplan suspect 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.470
 what's the answer lies in the next servants on 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.269
 this league belongs to the organization that 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.430
 and allows the newly composed 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.330
 lemondogs perform in the spring season 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.310
 lcs 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.769
 but I have a counter question for you 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.090
 Jason and deserves and then team 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:10.040
 lines place in season four lcs 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.890
 attention be careful bjork dream 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.390
 returns to European member server 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.459
 team solomid 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.980
 plays under a secret account and when 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.680
 this is not in a hurry to share their nickname 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.860
 so that seeing the game's syndrome and forest 300c 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.079
 this or not given with a score of 2000 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.000
 be sure about yorks he gives 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.760
 you treasured victory in rating 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.100
 battles as bjork himself notes to him 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.230
 often not getting the most 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.940
 nice words to your address 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.820
 while people don't even 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.470
 suspect that the honor of shoulder 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.829
 to shoulder fight in summoner's gorge 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.269
 with such a person 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.640
 few words in the next tweet one of 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.320
 the world's best hotels having added which is not 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.610

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.220
 yasuo superiority 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.000

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.670
 league of legends 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.680
 of course yasuo has a very interesting 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.769
 game mechanics but finding it in 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.930
 paws strong player foreshadows trouble yes 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.910
 we go back to the good old ones 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.250
 times when the emergence of a new 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.290
 the character of the official league client yet 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.790
 before the start of the rating battle 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.820
 reserve him a place in the list 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.370
 blocked champions fans 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.810

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.669
 sat jay and coors in 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.340
 felt in the professional league world 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.160
 legends elements stopped playing and became 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.220
 Coach but not his soul to this 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.260
 so the last two months he has been active 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.840
 played and trained with his new 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.600
