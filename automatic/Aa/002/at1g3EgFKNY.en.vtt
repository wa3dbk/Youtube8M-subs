videos in which the focus is on

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.630 
videos in which the focus is on
chemistry<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> periodic<00:00:26.250> table<00:00:26.580> of

elements<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.269> since<00:00:27.779> maths<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.289> metal

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
elements and since maths and metal

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.929 
elements and since maths and metal
worked<00:00:28.800> together<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.369> well<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.670> got<00:00:29.789> me

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
worked together so well it got me

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.089 
worked together so well it got me
thinking<00:00:30.359> what<00:00:31.050> kind<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.650> style<00:00:32.009> could

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
thinking what kind of style could

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.160 
thinking what kind of style could
possibly<00:00:32.700> go<00:00:32.940> well<00:00:33.149> with<00:00:33.300> sounds<00:00:33.690> like<00:00:33.840> this

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.790 

and<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> hit<00:00:37.590> me

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
and then it hit me

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.580 
and then it hit me
explosion<00:00:38.760> core<00:00:39.059> then<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.809> realized<00:00:40.110> explosion

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
explosion core then I realized explosion

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.450 
explosion core then I realized explosion
core<00:00:40.770> wasn't<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.100> genre

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
core wasn't a genre

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.310 
core wasn't a genre
note<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> self<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.090> that<00:00:42.270> explosion<00:00:42.540> core<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.290> I

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
note to self in that explosion core so I

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.600 
note to self in that explosion core so I
went<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.770> next<00:00:43.980> best<00:00:44.100> thing<00:00:44.219> which<00:00:44.430> was

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
went with the next best thing which was

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.880 
went with the next best thing which was
dubstep<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> organized<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.140> day<00:00:46.289> packed<00:00:46.710> my

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
dubstep so I organized the day packed my

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.720 
dubstep so I organized the day packed my
atom<00:00:47.250> into<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> boot<00:00:48.170> okay<00:00:50.270> get<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> car

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
atom into the boot okay get in the car

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.080 
atom into the boot okay get in the car
the<00:00:53.730> cup<00:00:54.199> began<00:00:55.199> driving<00:00:55.440> run<00:00:56.430> forever<00:00:56.730> brady

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
the cup began driving run forever brady

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270 
the cup began driving run forever brady
and<00:00:57.510> after<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.410> important<00:00:58.739> stops<00:00:59.010> along<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and after some important stops along the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.770 
and after some important stops along the
way<00:00:59.370> arrived<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.359> Nottingham<00:01:00.629> University

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
way arrived at Nottingham University

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
way arrived at Nottingham University
where<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> met<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.100> Home<00:01:02.250> Slice<00:01:02.370> Brady

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
where I met up with my Home Slice Brady

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.340 
where I met up with my Home Slice Brady
and<00:01:03.030> basically<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.629> got<00:01:03.719> asking<00:01:04.080> all<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and basically we got asking all the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.050 
and basically we got asking all the
horrendously<00:01:04.769> qualified<00:01:05.280> scientists<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
horrendously qualified scientists to

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.410 
horrendously qualified scientists to
make<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.479> loud<00:01:06.630> noises<00:01:07.310> science<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.820> yeah

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
make really loud noises science and yeah

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120 
make really loud noises science and yeah
I'm<00:01:09.630> not<00:01:09.869> kidding<00:01:10.049> when<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.409> say<00:01:10.619> qualified

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
I'm not kidding when I say qualified

explosion<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.549> didn't<00:01:41.790> really<00:01:41.939> think<00:01:41.970> too<00:01:42.180> hard

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
explosion I didn't really think too hard

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.940 
explosion I didn't really think too hard
about<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.659> one<00:01:42.780> did<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.990> Martin<00:01:43.409> did<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:43.799> into

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
about that one did I Martin did go into

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
about that one did I Martin did go into
more<00:01:44.189> detail<00:01:44.610> however<00:01:45.060> there<00:01:45.479> are<00:01:45.540> two<00:01:45.659> sorts

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
more detail however there are two sorts

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.399 
more detail however there are two sorts
of<00:01:46.110> explosions<00:01:46.740> there's<00:01:47.040> one<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.579> called

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
of explosions there's one that's called

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.249 
of explosions there's one that's called
detonation<00:01:49.409> which<00:01:49.950> goes<00:01:50.310> bang<00:01:51.270> very<00:01:51.750> rapidly

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
detonation which goes bang very rapidly

so<00:01:52.700> phosphorus<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.970> potassium<00:01:54.060> chlorate

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
so phosphorus and potassium chlorate

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.319 
so phosphorus and potassium chlorate
which<00:01:55.320> makes<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:56.040> whole<00:01:56.280> body<00:01:56.579> sort<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.090> safe

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
which makes your whole body sort of safe

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.359 
which makes your whole body sort of safe
when<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.689> goes<00:01:57.840> off<00:01:57.869> but<00:01:58.770> then<00:01:58.950> they're<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
when it goes off but then they're the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.190 
when it goes off but then they're the
ones<00:01:59.790> which<00:02:00.119> are<00:02:00.420> used<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.780> things<00:02:01.079> like

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
ones which are used for things like

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.020 
ones which are used for things like
propellants<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.130> show

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
propellants for show

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.539 
propellants for show
some<00:02:03.240> things<00:02:03.510> like<00:02:03.720> that<00:02:03.780> which<00:02:04.260> are<00:02:05.130> more

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
some things like that which are more

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.640 
some things like that which are more
sort<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.030> pushing<00:02:06.510> explosions<00:02:07.200> they<00:02:07.409> called

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
sort of pushing explosions they called

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.559 
sort of pushing explosions they called
deflagration<00:02:08.090> explosions<00:02:09.090> hold<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.450> there

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
deflagration explosions hold it there

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.210 
deflagration explosions hold it there
defrag<00:02:10.110> grating<00:02:10.560> that's<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> freaking<00:02:11.039> awesome

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220

word meant they also made a bang but
it's<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:26.640> sort<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.030> more<00:02:27.720> prolonged<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.680> not

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
it's a sort of more prolonged and not

quite<00:02:29.430> such<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:29.880> something<00:02:30.390> with<00:02:30.959> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
quite such as something with the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.720 
quite such as something with the
detonations<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> percussion<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
detonations of the percussion and the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
deflagration z' of the melodic we're not

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.610

time<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.900> was<00:03:30.959> kind<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.170> like<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.590> but<00:03:31.920> less

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
time it was kind of like this but less

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.860 
time it was kind of like this but less
attractive<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.940> on<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.269> note<00:03:33.450> I<00:03:33.480> think<00:03:33.690> a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
attractive and on that note I think a

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.539 
attractive and on that note I think a
good<00:03:34.019> way<00:03:34.170> to<00:03:34.230> wrap<00:03:34.590> up<00:03:34.620> would<00:03:34.980> be<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.130> end<00:03:35.400> on

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
good way to wrap up would be to end on

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.949 
good way to wrap up would be to end on
these<00:03:35.640> nice<00:03:35.940> words<00:03:36.239> from<00:03:36.510> dr.<00:03:36.780> Martin

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
these nice words from dr. Martin

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.050 
these nice words from dr. Martin
Polyakov<00:03:37.590> I'd<00:03:37.980> be<00:03:38.250> interested<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.760> see<00:03:38.820> what

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
Polyakov I'd be interested to see what

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.120 
Polyakov I'd be interested to see what
you<00:03:39.180> can<00:03:39.359> produce<00:03:39.510> from<00:03:39.959> chemistry<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.980> will

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
you can produce from chemistry it will

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.650 
you can produce from chemistry it will
also<00:03:41.250> be<00:03:41.519> interested<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.090> see<00:03:42.120> what<00:03:42.420> people

also be interested to see what people
think<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:43.290> your<00:03:44.000> production<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.720> wish<00:03:46.350> you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.380 
hope that it will give people a new view
of<00:03:52.440> chemistry<00:03:53.040> just<00:03:53.670> watching<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.239> have<00:03:54.329> a

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
of chemistry just watching and have a

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:03.690 
of chemistry just watching and have a
nice<00:03:54.510> day<00:03:54.890> science

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700
