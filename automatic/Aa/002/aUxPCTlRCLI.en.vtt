00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:17.520
 we feel in gauchos hospitals 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.770
 the scum of the world's fishermen in 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.220
 first eight days you wanted to 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.099
 when we made 3 points and went up 13 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.260
 home draws and five away defeats 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.210
 I think we knew then how it is 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.099
 being you will be like this 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.440
 we got to a point where we arrived 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.739
 to a questionnaire our quality 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.280
 a team like wolf japan to 56 points 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.680
 in the morning now you guys will be extreme already 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.260
 it's right eight points will only have one more 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.910
 problem in a much colder time and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.910
 there is event when suffered much 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.680
 until we got seven 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.940
 victories and a draw in the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.940
 past nine games 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.439
 At the time I said I did not like it when 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.180
 missing the six days of the end is in 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.700
 second with the same fund points 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.979
 it was a thing in the print nobody nobody 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.330
 I thought you did not like poverty. 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.200
 correct but our first round is 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.960
 more beautiful 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.590
 I no longer remember a team and it is in 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.689
 last place so long 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 only knows it shows that everything is possible in the 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:33.909
 football the 24th 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.130
 we are leaning against the least anyone 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.030
 nobody dies on the 10th journey like nobody else 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.030
 I knew marginal 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.240
 and it's not 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.980
 and if we have division 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.040
 I think it's one in the FMI but it's unstoppable 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:02:01.750
 incomparable is the odor issue was a she 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:06.220
 another was the Querencia hotel went wide 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:10.800
 by daniel ramos guilty nor did we fight 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.800
 told that you do not have to vote is the end 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.080
 Hmm
