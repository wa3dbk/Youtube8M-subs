00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.670
 hello together I welcome you 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.990
 back to a camping kassel special 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.650
 and that we look today 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.230
 winter wonderland during the day to get started as soon as 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.939
 you talked to mpc dÃ¼rnstein 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.699
 The teleport here in this 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.710
 exit area there you will find the 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.260
 three different paths once the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.760
 Once you look at the snowman pepper 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.730
 and once with dredging 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.040
 I personally find the cuboid gone 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.379
 actually a easy life 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.610
 snowman so moderate and 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.739
 peppercake man is up for me 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.180
 closed every case 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.250
 In addition to the hopping, there are in this camp 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.780
 in kassel two more difficulties 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.690
 accompanying you on the way 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.700
 that is once that the 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.170
 snowflakes melt that means we 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.079
 can not last forever on the snowflakes 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.879
 the wastes and waste remain there 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.910
 Here are a cold that was so 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.920
 a harm over time you just 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.890
 life points rob you so you just 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.239
 against time running after some time 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.490
 then you find yourself with one 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.920
 checkpoint again there wait 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.500
 and she gets three options once 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.039
 either by giving it and bathing 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.959
 teleport out or you take the 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.550
 checkpoint then you get but no 

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:22.399
 gift is waiting here but revived 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.560
 as her once dust or the third 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.440
 option you take a present with something 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.630
 Leave her in the end and gets 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.819
 you then have three gifts but you have 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.380
 just this check point there for me one 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.479
 the heaviest ones are the ones 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.789
 bursting right after the gifts 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.069
 check point is your best bet 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.440
 time appears again and then hops 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.599
 directly on the meanwhile concrete 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.179
 then you have enough time anyway 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:48.520
 to arrive at the top that was the gifts 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:50.469
 start to burst 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.850
 in the last section there are 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:54.159
 again a few things to note 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.689
 Once we want balls demir 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.969
 must be sufficient to push you 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.860
 otherwise down there are snowmen 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.860
 blow the wind 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.630
 you could also come across and there are 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.369
 they wanted to circle you pretty much 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.229
 much harm makes them their shopping 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.640
 So just wait until the circles 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.950
 changes and then on 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.110
 yes and then you have the jumping what you 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.940
 Done and your crew is ever 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.590
 after what you did not check before 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.319
 you have chosen option then you get 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.090
 is just more or less gifts there 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.090
 the jumping passe since this year a 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.640
 pvp activity is now considered in the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.410
 countdown in which it expires is over 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.569
 you will become your starting point again 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.630
 understands that you can find in the above 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.630
 center
