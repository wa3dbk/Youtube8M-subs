side<00:01:35.610> up<00:01:35.849> on<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> box<00:01:36.410> you<00:01:37.410> can<00:01:37.619> maintain<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
side up on a box you can maintain the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.889 
side up on a box you can maintain the
same<00:01:38.550> height<00:01:38.819> or<00:01:39.149> go<00:01:39.300> up<00:01:39.840> rail<00:01:40.170> down<00:01:40.380> rail<00:01:41.899> just

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
same height or go up rail down rail just

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.680 
same height or go up rail down rail just
by<00:01:43.020> adjusting<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.619> height<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.869> knobs

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
by adjusting the height as the knobs

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.790 
by adjusting the height as the knobs
that<00:01:48.690> turn<00:01:49.319> in<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.830> out<00:01:50.539> pull<00:01:51.539> them<00:01:51.720> out

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
that turn in and out pull them out

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.309 
that turn in and out pull them out
adjust<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.920> height<00:01:53.959> posts<00:01:54.959> have<00:01:55.310> six<00:01:56.310> holes

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
adjust the height posts have six holes

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.120 
adjust the height posts have six holes
so<00:01:58.319> you<00:01:58.410> can<00:01:58.649> get<00:01:58.979> pretty<00:02:00.380> small<00:02:01.380> adjustments

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
