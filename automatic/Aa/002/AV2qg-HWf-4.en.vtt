00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.650
 Hello everybody 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:16.199
 Today I have a product in the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:19.110
 test though it is these trees culture pm 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.060
 25 is the model was in various 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.880
 test magazine with good excellent that 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.540
 you can see here have last weeks 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.460
 I am increasingly on this topic ip 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.590
 television has concentrated that too 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.969
 really looked like just now 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.100
 works around the file is the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.660
 spring I wanted to come to the door 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.230
 just a new product here 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.450
 test and I also have two a test 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.570
 as I said like this one and look 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.270
 Let's just something the clock so can the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.380
 have been rated super 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.430
 the price officially costs 60 euros 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.250
 Meanwhile, there is already one 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.239
 offer under 30 euro where you can calm me 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.860
 you really can not think wrong 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.399
 Just go into the 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.700
 packaging 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:10.380
 Almost everything is there and the 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:21.259
 overpack is ever good 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:21.259
 apparently sticking to it 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:59.170
 manual is included 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:59.170
 German and English groscurth 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:08.720
 or do not polarize them any differently now 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:11.660
 from the two battery change another 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.350
 German brand product was also available 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.900
 be true to the serious representation 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.580
 the market that always gives what devices 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.780
 the daily work but roll 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.060
 I've heard that's how it looks 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:33.920
 just take a look 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:39.170
 of it all could recognize one 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:43.730
 Giving a bit more feedback but is in 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.989
 order settings start stop to start 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.760
 maybe even look yourself were yes 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.610
 at that time also in the camera recognize 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.610
 What happens here can not do anything 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.489
 kotick advanced male 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.709
 or female and so on 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.150
 weight and the usual issue 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.630
 Just like to speak German 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.630
 adjust 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.130
 But now try the rest yes 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.810
 the language has to be set to German 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.070
 but not really done within 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.170
 of five minutes 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.570
 I do not know how to do that now 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.710
 could stop what the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.630
 functional I guess who are with 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.360
 every clock more or less the same 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.630
 For example, the price segment is still mine 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.800
 personal is that of sigma too 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.260
 at foundation goods test with very good 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.510
 was rated well so just told 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.300
 to the good models and my opinion 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.590
 after looks simply qualitative 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.060
 High quality from the display is better 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.280
 just read during the ride 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.530
 the sigma is still an accessory part 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.320
 really great and for 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.640
 haider there's a bracket here 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.720
 that means you put the clock in 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.250
 end effect just on this 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.140
 bracket on the steering wheel 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.400
 and the holds without problems there must be yes 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.660
 also not fixed binder anything else 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.880
 just plug only this one holder 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.040
 That's it 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.750
 and to the chest strap as I said that me 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.900
 just like the one from the victory was for 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.360
 Also brought me here that one 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.590
 that just has it in comparison 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.660
 does not take care many have problems 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.730
 should get over this connection 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.530
 I can only say really easy 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.360
 quite normal first time briefly and the hand 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.700
 under water keep here behind 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.380
 moisten and then in the end to on 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.840
 hang up the body and then find 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.880
 automatically the connection of our can 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.830
 you do not do anything wrong 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.210
 and yes to the ears as I said because he 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.770
 this sigma is also at the beginning 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.280
 a little trickier the menu by 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.550
 click 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.720
 until you understand this logic but 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.060
 also work without problems one 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.500
 So it really looks easy 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.600
 in that the display is slightly larger 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.419
 is the clock just really a 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.460
 a little clearer and what also 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.530
 you can still really see it 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.640
 Pluspunkt is one can the clock on duration 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.930
 turn off that means if you are now 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.960
 somehow only trained in the summer 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.070
 you seem to need the clock from this data 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.169
 Do not just give one the stay 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.480
 saved and she walks in, so to speak 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.410
 At rest, the battery is displayed 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.750
 Of course much longer than 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.080
 probably at this marriage so me 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.850
 The clock can really be from seed money 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.510
 recommend as this work is 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.430
 probably that too 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.630
 a matter of taste 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.240
 yes if synonymous ask should write 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.530
 Just look at me and I like 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.370
 make normal video or the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.800
 do not ask yet 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.570
 otherwise answer until the next video 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.940
 would be nice if that would subscribe 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.479
 or leave positive feedback 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.479
 would
