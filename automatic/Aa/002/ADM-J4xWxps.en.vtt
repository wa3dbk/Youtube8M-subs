so taking from that under seeing that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.340 
so taking from that under seeing that
you<00:02:13.020> know<00:02:13.110> we're

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
you know we're

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.570 
you know we're
a little<00:02:13.710> bit<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.950> goal<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.160> getting

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
a little bit of a goal of getting

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.280 
a little bit of a goal of getting
between<00:02:14.700> your<00:02:15.030> three<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.300> five<00:02:15.480> meals<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.840> day

between your three to five meals a day

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.230 
between your three to five meals a day
now<00:02:16.950> sometimes<00:02:17.430> some<00:02:17.640> people<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:18.150> that

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
now sometimes some people think that

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.460 
now sometimes some people think that
that<00:02:18.300> means<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:18.750> they've<00:02:18.870> got<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.050> eat<00:02:19.260> more

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
that means that they've got to eat more
