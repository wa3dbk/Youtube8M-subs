always how it works are the caterpillars
and<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.180> butterflies<00:02:11.540> always<00:02:11.840> associated

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
and the butterflies always associated

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.830 
and the butterflies always associated
with<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.650> same<00:02:12.890> plant<00:02:13.220> or<00:02:13.520> are<00:02:14.300> some<00:02:14.599> just

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
with the same plant or are some just

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.170 
with the same plant or are some just
hosts<00:02:15.110> larval<00:02:15.920> food<00:02:16.130> and<00:02:16.489> some<00:02:16.910> are<00:02:17.150> just

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
hosts larval food and some are just

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.070 
hosts larval food and some are just
nectar<00:02:18.050> food<00:02:18.550> actually<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:20.450> milkweed<00:02:20.900> what

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
nectar food actually the milkweed what

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.740 
nectar food actually the milkweed what
you<00:02:21.200> have<00:02:21.349> over<00:02:21.500> here<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:22.099> a<00:02:22.459> host<00:02:22.790> plant<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:23.450> a

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
you have over here is a host plant and a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.830 
you have over here is a host plant and a
nectar<00:02:24.530> plant<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.700> had<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:26.150> one<00:02:26.390> serves

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
nectar plant so it had this one serves

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.610 
nectar plant so it had this one serves
two<00:02:27.020> purposes

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
two purposes

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.160 
two purposes
so<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.050> caterpillar

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
so the caterpillar

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.540 
so the caterpillar
which<00:02:30.500> caterpillar<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.310> or<00:02:31.430> which

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
which caterpillar is it or which

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.650 
which caterpillar is it or which
butterfly<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.930> milkweed<00:02:33.470> attracts<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
butterfly the milkweed attracts the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.900 
butterfly the milkweed attracts the
monarch<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.840> queen<00:02:36.170> butterflies<00:02:36.920> they<00:02:37.700> lay

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
monarch and queen butterflies they lay

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.260 
monarch and queen butterflies they lay
their<00:02:38.090> eggs<00:02:38.300> on<00:02:38.720> this<00:02:39.050> milkweed<00:02:39.940> they'll<00:02:40.940> also

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
their eggs on this milkweed they'll also

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.330 
their eggs on this milkweed they'll also
feed<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.780> flowers<00:02:42.500> as<00:02:42.739> well<00:02:42.770> milkweed

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
feed on the flowers as well milkweed

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.370 
feed on the flowers as well milkweed
flower<00:02:43.580> so<00:02:44.000> every<00:02:44.420> landscape<00:02:44.630> inmate<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.319> know

the ones we have at the office they they

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.170 
the ones we have at the office they they

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
then they get bigger and bigger the

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.820 
then they get bigger and bigger the
caterpillars<00:02:53.989> get<00:02:54.140> bigger<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.500> bigger<00:02:54.620> and

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
caterpillars get bigger and bigger and

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.250

bigger right and all of a sudden you
notice<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.709> Pugh<00:02:57.890> painting<00:02:58.340> their<00:02:58.550> painting

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
notice the Pugh painting their painting

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.820 
notice the Pugh painting their painting
around<00:02:59.180> right<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.290> see<00:03:00.440> they're<00:03:00.590> little

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
around right you see they're little

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.380 
around right you see they're little
they're<00:03:01.099> little<00:03:01.400> chrysalis<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.060> it's

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
they're little chrysalis and it's

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.210 
they're little chrysalis and it's
important<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:02.900> remember<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.530> plant<00:03:03.980> will

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
important to remember that plant will

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.340 
important to remember that plant will
come<00:03:04.550> back<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:05.000> may<00:03:05.239> look<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.510> little<00:03:05.720> bare<00:03:06.080> for

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
come back it may look a little bare for

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.320 
come back it may look a little bare for
a<00:03:06.380> while<00:03:06.590> but<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.310> guarantee<00:03:07.910> it'll<00:03:08.090> come<00:03:08.299> back

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
a while but I guarantee it'll come back

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.360 
a while but I guarantee it'll come back
now<00:03:08.959> do<00:03:09.049> we<00:03:09.260> have<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.739> mean<00:03:09.890> do<00:03:10.010> we<00:03:10.069> have<00:03:10.250> to

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
now do we have to I mean do we have to

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.160 
now do we have to I mean do we have to
be<00:03:10.459> careful<00:03:10.850> about<00:03:11.000> pesticides<00:03:11.660> when<00:03:12.019> we're

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
be careful about pesticides when we're

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.259 
be careful about pesticides when we're
when<00:03:12.530> we're<00:03:12.680> gardening<00:03:13.430> for<00:03:13.610> caterpillars

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
when we're gardening for caterpillars

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.199 
when we're gardening for caterpillars
yes<00:03:14.510> that's<00:03:15.200> an<00:03:15.350> excellent<00:03:15.680> point<00:03:16.209> it's

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
yes that's an excellent point it's

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.420 
yes that's an excellent point it's
important<00:03:17.780> not<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.049> use<00:03:18.290> pesticides<00:03:19.160> in<00:03:19.400> your

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
important not to use pesticides in your

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.270 
important not to use pesticides in your
butterfly<00:03:20.000> garden<00:03:20.390> because<00:03:21.250> they'll<00:03:22.250> be

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
butterfly garden because they'll be

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.620 
butterfly garden because they'll be
detrimental<00:03:22.549> to<00:03:23.000> your<00:03:23.150> butterflies<00:03:25.299> right<00:03:26.299> so

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
detrimental to your butterflies right so

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.750 
detrimental to your butterflies right so
even<00:03:26.870> milkweed<00:03:27.590> again<00:03:27.950> will<00:03:28.160> get<00:03:28.310> covered<00:03:28.549> in

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
even milkweed again will get covered in

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.900 
even milkweed again will get covered in
a<00:03:28.970> fits<00:03:29.269> but<00:03:30.260> really<00:03:30.739> they<00:03:30.980> can<00:03:31.220> be<00:03:31.340> taken<00:03:31.700> care

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
a fits but really they can be taken care

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.030 
a fits but really they can be taken care
of<00:03:31.940> so<00:03:32.420> there's<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.989> simple<00:03:33.170> solution<00:03:33.530> for<00:03:33.739> that

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
of so there's a simple solution for that

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.670 
of so there's a simple solution for that
dough<00:03:34.280> though<00:03:34.670> you<00:03:35.209> can<00:03:35.359> just<00:03:35.540> use<00:03:35.750> some<00:03:35.780> soapy

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
dough though you can just use some soapy

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.979 
dough though you can just use some soapy
water<00:03:36.829> to<00:03:37.370> get<00:03:37.640> rid<00:03:37.790> of<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:38.060> then<00:03:38.359> it<00:03:38.810> won't

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
water to get rid of it then it won't

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.560 
water to get rid of it then it won't
harm<00:03:39.739> your<00:03:39.980> butterfly<00:03:40.340> plants<00:03:40.700> at<00:03:40.790> all<00:03:40.880> and

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
harm your butterfly plants at all and
