needed<00:00:23.860> it<00:00:23.980> you<00:00:24.189> know<00:00:24.279> why<00:00:24.520> because<00:00:25.150> if<00:00:25.720> you

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
needed it you know why because if you

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.260 
needed it you know why because if you
win<00:00:26.140> that's<00:00:26.500> great<00:00:26.829> but<00:00:27.099> if<00:00:27.189> you<00:00:27.340> lose<00:00:27.579> you're

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
win that's great but if you lose you're

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.540 
win that's great but if you lose you're
going<00:00:28.450> to<00:00:28.540> hear<00:00:28.720> it<00:00:28.869> constantly<00:00:29.469> from<00:00:30.040> every

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
going to hear it constantly from every

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.670 
going to hear it constantly from every
gym<00:00:30.849> fan<00:00:31.149> as<00:00:31.329> you<00:00:31.360> walk<00:00:31.689> around<00:00:31.899> New<00:00:32.320> York<00:00:32.349> City

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
gym fan as you walk around New York City

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.280 
gym fan as you walk around New York City
so<00:00:33.370> it<00:00:33.670> does<00:00:33.850> put<00:00:34.059> a<00:00:34.090> little<00:00:34.270> a<00:00:34.719> bigger

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
so it does put a little a bigger

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.200 
so it does put a little a bigger
spotlight<00:00:35.860> I<00:00:36.100> guess<00:00:36.550> you'd<00:00:36.730> say<00:00:36.910> even<00:00:37.180> a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
spotlight I guess you'd say even a

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.000 
spotlight I guess you'd say even a
little<00:00:37.360> more<00:00:37.600> pressure<00:00:37.809> on<00:00:38.020> you<00:00:38.290> and<00:00:38.500> it<00:00:38.829> just

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010
