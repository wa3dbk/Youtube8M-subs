00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
summery to misty I think they should be

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.990 
summery to misty I think they should be
light<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.210> easy<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.380> read<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.039> easy<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.730> get

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
light and easy to read and easy to get

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.150 
light and easy to read and easy to get
through<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.779> should<00:00:27.960> be<00:00:28.050> compelling<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.890> keep

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
through it should be compelling and keep

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.640 
through it should be compelling and keep
you<00:00:29.310> turning<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> pages<00:00:29.990> some<00:00:30.990> genres<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.439> I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
you turning the pages some genres that I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.470 
you turning the pages some genres that I
think<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.340> work<00:00:32.520> well<00:00:32.730> for<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.149> are

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
think really work well for that are

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.630 
think really work well for that are
manga<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.230> graphic<00:00:34.559> novels<00:00:34.980> as<00:00:35.219> well<00:00:35.460> as

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
manga and graphic novels as well as

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.850 
manga and graphic novels as well as
young<00:00:35.850> adult<00:00:36.149> books<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> also<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
young adult books but I also have a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.770 
young adult books but I also have a
couple<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.280> classics<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.030> share<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.510> think

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
couple of classics to share that I think

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.049 
couple of classics to share that I think
would<00:00:39.899> work<00:00:40.050> well<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> two<00:00:41.190> manga<00:00:42.030> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
would work well so the two manga I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.229 
would work well so the two manga I
picked<00:00:42.450> are<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> Sailor<00:00:43.469> Moon<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
picked are a Sailor Moon and

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.720 
picked are a Sailor Moon and
revolutionary<00:00:45.239> girl<00:00:45.480> utena<00:00:46.250> Sailor<00:00:47.250> Moon<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
revolutionary girl utena Sailor Moon I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.010 
revolutionary girl utena Sailor Moon I
know<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.360> bit<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> cheat

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
know it's a little bit of a cheat

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.529 
know it's a little bit of a cheat
because<00:00:49.469> it's<00:00:49.649> not<00:00:49.829> really<00:00:50.610> lesbian<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.420> it

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
because it's not really lesbian but it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.299 
because it's not really lesbian but it
does<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.899> lesbians<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.739> they<00:00:53.010> come<00:00:53.190> in

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
does have lesbians in it they come in

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.580 
does have lesbians in it they come in
later<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.760> series<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.899> they're<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> big

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
later in the series but they're a big

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.340 
later in the series but they're a big
part<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> plot<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.090> know<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.750> Sailor

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
part of the plot and I know the Sailor

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
part of the plot and I know the Sailor
Moon<00:00:58.620> has<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> big<00:00:59.160> lesbian<00:00:59.370> following<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.809> I

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
Moon has a big lesbian following so I

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.779 
Moon has a big lesbian following so I
thought<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> good<00:01:01.800> pick<00:01:02.100> very

about<00:05:52.259> Miller<00:05:52.500> which<00:05:53.099> is<00:05:53.219> also<00:05:53.400> a<00:05:53.550> bit<00:05:53.729> of<00:05:53.789> a

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
about Miller which is also a bit of a

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.719 
about Miller which is also a bit of a
classic<00:05:54.120> it's<00:05:54.719> a<00:05:55.080> historical<00:05:55.889> novel<00:05:56.159> so<00:05:56.699> I

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
classic it's a historical novel so I

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.430 
classic it's a historical novel so I

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
believe it was right now in those 70s or

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.680 
believe it was right now in those 70s or
80s<00:05:58.620> but<00:05:59.039> it<00:05:59.190> takes<00:05:59.430> place<00:05:59.669> in<00:05:59.940> the<00:06:00.029> early<00:06:00.300> 19th

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
80s but it takes place in the early 19th

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.499 
80s but it takes place in the early 19th
century<00:06:00.840> and<00:06:01.560> the<00:06:02.520> thing<00:06:02.759> about<00:06:03.029> reading

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509

lesbian<00:06:04.169> books<00:06:04.469> is<00:06:04.740> but<00:06:05.039> when<00:06:05.159> I<00:06:05.219> first

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
lesbian books is but when I first
