as<00:00:55.030> you<00:00:56.030> can<00:00:56.210> see<00:00:56.510> we<00:00:57.350> are<00:00:57.379> starting<00:00:57.949> an

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
as you can see we are starting an

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.189 
as you can see we are starting an
earthquake<00:00:59.079> with<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.230> earthquake<00:01:00.859> PA<00:01:02.199> 2300

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
earthquake with the earthquake PA 2300

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.070 
earthquake with the earthquake PA 2300
here<00:01:03.440> on<00:01:03.589> the<00:01:03.800> bench<00:01:04.690> we're<00:01:05.690> running<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.050> right

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
here on the bench we're running it right

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.170 
here on the bench we're running it right
now<00:01:06.260> just<00:01:06.440> to<00:01:06.860> warm<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:07.220> up<00:01:07.340> then<00:01:07.910> we're<00:01:08.060> going

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
now just to warm it up then we're going

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.520 
now just to warm it up then we're going
to<00:01:08.270> do<00:01:08.450> a<00:01:08.480> test<00:01:08.900> at<00:01:09.200> 4<00:01:09.800> own<00:01:10.010> stereo<00:01:10.730> and<00:01:11.330> also<00:01:12.170> 4

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
to do a test at 4 own stereo and also 4

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.970 
to do a test at 4 own stereo and also 4
ohms<00:01:12.740> mono<00:01:13.510> so<00:01:14.510> hang<00:01:14.930> around<00:01:15.050> let's<00:01:15.650> see<00:01:15.800> what

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
ohms mono so hang around let's see what

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.480 
ohms mono so hang around let's see what
she<00:01:16.160> does

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.650 

one<00:01:19.490> thing<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:19.700> wanted<00:01:19.910> to<00:01:20.000> say<00:01:20.210> real<00:01:20.420> quick

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
one thing I wanted to say real quick

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.770 
one thing I wanted to say real quick
before<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.170> test<00:01:21.760> these<00:01:22.760> connectors<00:01:23.450> here

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
before the test these connectors here

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.240 
before the test these connectors here
are<00:01:24.550> unbelievably<00:01:25.550> small<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:27.040> believe<00:01:28.040> they're

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
are unbelievably small I believe they're

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.430 
are unbelievably small I believe they're
4<00:01:28.460> 6<00:01:28.730> gauge<00:01:29.030> because<00:01:29.480> the<00:01:29.600> 8<00:01:29.750> gauge<00:01:30.020> fits<00:01:30.320> in

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
4 6 gauge because the 8 gauge fits in

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.870 
4 6 gauge because the 8 gauge fits in
there<00:01:30.560> pretty<00:01:30.710> easily<00:01:30.830> with<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.370> 4<00:01:31.610> gauge

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
there pretty easily with the 4 gauge

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.440 
there pretty easily with the 4 gauge
just<00:01:32.720> I<00:01:33.050> mean<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.740> had<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.400> shave<00:01:34.700> it<00:01:34.880> way<00:01:35.150> down

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
just I mean I had to shave it way down

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.450 
just I mean I had to shave it way down
and<00:01:35.660> fit<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.900> in<00:01:36.020> there<00:01:36.230> and<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:37.310> speaker

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
and fit it in there and the speaker

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.430 
and fit it in there and the speaker
terminals<00:01:37.880> also<00:01:38.540> were<00:01:38.660> very<00:01:38.900> small<00:01:39.260> I<00:01:39.290> don't

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
terminals also were very small I don't

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.810 
terminals also were very small I don't
think<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:39.860> can<00:01:40.010> fit<00:01:40.160> anything<00:01:40.310> larger<00:01:40.790> than

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
think you can fit anything larger than

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.470 
think you can fit anything larger than
12<00:01:41.300> gauge<00:01:41.660> if<00:01:42.170> you're<00:01:42.710> lucky

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
12 gauge if you're lucky

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.550 
12 gauge if you're lucky
so<00:01:44.480> anyway<00:01:44.720> that'll<00:01:44.990> be<00:01:45.080> a<00:01:45.110> little<00:01:45.230> bit<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.500> a

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
so anyway that'll be a little bit of a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.930 
so anyway that'll be a little bit of a
challenge<00:01:45.800> here<00:01:46.130> for<00:01:46.310> our<00:01:46.400> test<00:01:46.670> because<00:01:46.880> I

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
challenge here for our test because I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.880 
challenge here for our test because I
have<00:01:46.970> 8<00:01:47.240> gauge<00:01:47.480> wire<00:01:47.750> for<00:01:48.050> my<00:01:48.140> speakers<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.860> I

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
have 8 gauge wire for my speakers and I

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.620 
have 8 gauge wire for my speakers and I
use<00:01:49.130> 4<00:01:49.400> gauge<00:01:49.640> for<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:51.610> inputs<00:01:52.610> but<00:01:53.000> we<00:01:53.480> made

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
use 4 gauge for the inputs but we made

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.710 
use 4 gauge for the inputs but we made
it<00:01:53.720> work<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:55.150> hopefully<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.510> doesn't

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
it work and hopefully that doesn't

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.680 
it work and hopefully that doesn't
hinder<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.290> test<00:01:57.530> at<00:01:57.740> all<00:01:57.860> but<00:01:58.460> warm<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.570> amp

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
hinder the test at all but warm the amp

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.360 
hinder the test at all but warm the amp
up<00:01:59.870> a<00:01:59.960> little<00:02:00.110> bit<00:02:00.260> more<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.800> we'll<00:02:00.950> come<00:02:01.160> back

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
up a little bit more and we'll come back

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:10.790 
up a little bit more and we'll come back
and<00:02:01.610> we'll<00:02:01.700> see<00:02:01.730> what<00:02:02.030> she<00:02:02.180> does

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.320 

all<00:02:11.800> right<00:02:12.130> we've<00:02:12.340> warmed<00:02:12.580> up<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.910> earthquake

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
all right we've warmed up the earthquake

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.150 
all right we've warmed up the earthquake
with<00:02:13.540> some<00:02:13.690> music<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.380> let's<00:02:14.740> go<00:02:14.950> ahead<00:02:15.040> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
with some music so let's go ahead and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.690 
with some music so let's go ahead and
hit<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.700> forty<00:02:16.120> Hertz<00:02:16.300> test<00:02:16.870> tone<00:02:17.550> with<00:02:18.550> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
hit the forty Hertz test tone with the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.160 
hit the forty Hertz test tone with the
DD<00:02:18.970> 1<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.760> RMS<00:02:22.209> Bolt<00:02:22.510> meter<00:02:22.750> here<00:02:23.020> and

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
DD 1 and the RMS Bolt meter here and

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:34.559 
DD 1 and the RMS Bolt meter here and
let's<00:02:23.350> see<00:02:23.740> what<00:02:23.950> kind<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.250> power<00:02:24.520> we<00:02:24.760> get<00:02:33.569> it's

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
let's see what kind of power we get it's

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.260 
let's see what kind of power we get it's
like<00:02:34.630> thirty<00:02:35.380> five<00:02:35.739> point<00:02:36.670> one<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:40.030> here's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
like thirty five point one and here's

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.810 
like thirty five point one and here's

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
try four ohms mono alright I don't

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.430 
try four ohms mono alright I don't
recommend<00:03:03.040> doing<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.610> but<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:03.970> kept<00:03:04.900> blowing

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440

100<00:03:05.769> amp<00:03:05.890> fuses<00:03:06.310> when<00:03:06.459> I'm<00:03:06.550> trying<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.820> do<00:03:06.970> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
100 amp fuses when I'm trying to do the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.620 
100 amp fuses when I'm trying to do the
four<00:03:07.330> own<00:03:07.450> tests<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.760> each<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:10.150> four<00:03:10.180> gauge

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
four own tests so each of the four gauge

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.900 
four own tests so each of the four gauge
leads<00:03:11.049> that<00:03:11.230> come<00:03:11.380> off<00:03:11.530> my<00:03:11.709> power<00:03:11.920> supplies<00:03:12.430> is

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
leads that come off my power supplies is

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.780 
leads that come off my power supplies is
fused<00:03:13.810> by<00:03:13.959> 100<00:03:14.530> amp<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:14.890> that's<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.190> 200<00:03:15.610> amp

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
fused by 100 amp so that's the 200 amp

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.670 
fused by 100 amp so that's the 200 amp
total<00:03:16.570> fuse<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.340> need<00:03:18.700> like<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> 120<00:03:19.780> or<00:03:19.900> 150

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
total fuse but I need like a 120 or 150

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.310 
total fuse but I need like a 120 or 150
amp<00:03:21.040> fuse<00:03:21.370> which<00:03:21.579> I<00:03:21.700> don't<00:03:21.760> have<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:22.600> I'm<00:03:23.079> just

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
amp fuse which I don't have so I'm just

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.310 
amp fuse which I don't have so I'm just
going<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.500> chance<00:03:23.860> it<00:03:24.070> be<00:03:24.610> careful<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.360> I'm

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
going to chance it be careful and I'm

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.660 
going to chance it be careful and I'm
going<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.500> test<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:27.010> for<00:03:27.430> ohms<00:03:27.640> mono<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:29.670> let's

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
going to test it for ohms mono and let's

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.930 
going to test it for ohms mono and let's
see<00:03:31.180> what<00:03:32.140> we<00:03:32.260> can<00:03:32.410> do<00:03:32.560> here<00:03:32.829> forty<00:03:33.250> Hertz<00:03:33.400> test

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
see what we can do here forty Hertz test

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:42.660 
see what we can do here forty Hertz test
tone

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:51.080

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:03.960 

looks<00:03:52.090> like<00:03:53.940> 56<00:03:57.960> will<00:03:58.960> say<00:03:59.760> 56.0<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:03.100> we're

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
looks like 56 will say 56.0 and we're

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.760 
looks like 56 will say 56.0 and we're
pulling<00:04:05.640> 139<00:04:06.640> amps<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:08.410> let's<00:04:08.560> do<00:04:08.680> the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
pulling 139 amps so let's do the

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.350 
pulling 139 amps so let's do the
calculation<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.490> see<00:04:09.670> how<00:04:09.760> many<00:04:09.820> watts<00:04:10.150> that

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
calculation and see how many watts that

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.710 
calculation and see how many watts that
is<00:04:10.830> all<00:04:11.830> right<00:04:12.040> there<00:04:12.400> we<00:04:12.490> go<00:04:12.520> fifty<00:04:13.180> six<00:04:13.420> point

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
is all right there we go fifty six point

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.650 
is all right there we go fifty six point
one<00:04:13.900> volts<00:04:13.930> at<00:04:14.800> 4<00:04:15.640> ohms<00:04:15.880> gives<00:04:16.560> us<00:04:18.269> 787<00:04:19.269> watts

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
one volts at 4 ohms gives us 787 watts

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.540 
one volts at 4 ohms gives us 787 watts
well<00:04:22.660> not<00:04:23.290> quite<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.860> eleven<00:04:24.190> hundred<00:04:24.220> and

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
well not quite the eleven hundred and

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.840 
well not quite the eleven hundred and
fifty<00:04:24.880> watts<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.660> earthquake<00:04:26.380> said<00:04:26.850> but

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
fifty watts the earthquake said but

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.670 
fifty watts the earthquake said but
still<00:04:28.300> impressive<00:04:28.510> for<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:28.930> size<00:04:29.230> of<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.500> amp

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
still impressive for the size of the amp

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.090 
still impressive for the size of the amp
Class<00:04:30.160> A<00:04:30.400> B<00:04:30.640> so<00:04:31.350> there<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.500> have<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.770> the
