decided the most because it was course
that<00:02:38.120> but<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.810> course<00:02:38.840> platinum<00:02:39.410> was<00:02:39.530> probably

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
that but of course platinum was probably

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.040 
that but of course platinum was probably
the<00:02:39.980> best<00:02:40.190> I<00:02:40.400> don't<00:02:40.519> know<00:02:40.760> what<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.600> has<00:02:41.870> the
