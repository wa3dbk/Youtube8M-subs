00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.375
Hey guys!

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:03.675
today we're...

00:00:04.574 --> 00:00:06.574
... in the forest

00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:08.098
no wait, not yet

00:00:08.098 --> 00:00:08.856
we're not yet there

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:10.226
there is it..

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.960
we've planned something special today

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.735
we want to make a...

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:21.615
...a Tour

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:23.075
through the forest...

00:00:24.794 --> 00:00:26.794
Just we, without cars. Without that lazy stuff

00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:29.092
motivation is on top...

00:00:29.092 --> 00:00:30.722
...not

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:32.314
We're sitting here like... for an half our...

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:34.384
and just don't get up

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:35.873

00:00:35.873 --> 00:00:36.876
because we're so lazy

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:38.015
It's always the same

00:00:44.656 --> 00:00:46.656
I would say, we're ride until we don't have the power to hold on...

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.980
... I'll guess about 15 meters

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.660
It was about 100 meter's, right?

00:01:07.198 --> 00:01:09.198
200 meters?

00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:09.698
200? ok.

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:13.625
He're we were filming...

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.660
"BELOW ZERO"

00:01:17.315 --> 00:01:19.315
When we're filming everything was full of snow and now we have...

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:20.693
...Spring

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:25.374
We have a bit to go...

00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:27.374

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.780
Let's see what I've got with me

00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:53.071
Applejuice.Carbs.

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.484
Cookies

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.115
On tour I recommend...

00:01:58.194 --> 00:02:00.194
Carbs who are fast digestible...

00:02:00.194 --> 00:02:01.295
with sugar and so on

00:02:01.295 --> 00:02:03.174
chocolate bun

00:02:04.694 --> 00:02:06.694
on tour, those things always taste a lot better

00:02:06.694 --> 00:02:07.995
Yeah..

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:11.355
Until now, we're pretty motivated

00:02:11.674 --> 00:02:13.674
*German grammatics*

00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:15.379
*German grammatics*

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.020
*German grammatics*

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:25.935
We got a "thing" here

00:02:27.134 --> 00:02:29.134
From the company, "REMOVU"

00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:34.254
It's like a liveview...

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:35.954
...like the App for GoPro

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:38.634
It's a very useful tool...

00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:40.514

00:02:43.414 --> 00:02:45.414
I think we will make a review to this, wich will come soon on my channel

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.120
well...

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.320
you've missed the descent we just had...

00:02:50.598 --> 00:02:52.598
...because I've made a picture instead of a video

00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:56.595
that's the professionality of TrailTouch

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:30.188
so, you little crook!

00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:32.873
Got ya'

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.609

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.354

00:04:04.354 --> 00:04:05.315

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.760
Right now...

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.500
...we're again on another place

00:04:42.334 --> 00:04:44.334
the Day is getting to an end

00:04:44.334 --> 00:04:45.799
Soon, we'll reaching...

00:04:46.376 --> 00:04:48.376
...the last trail

00:04:50.234 --> 00:04:52.234
here we go, last run!
