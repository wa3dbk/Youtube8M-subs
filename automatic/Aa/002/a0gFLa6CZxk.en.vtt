a<00:00:23.039> while<00:00:23.359> this<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:24.930> we're<00:00:25.109> going<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
a while this is because we're going to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.679 
a while this is because we're going to
print<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.880> don't<00:00:27.000> want<00:00:27.359> any

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
print with it and you don't want any

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.380 
print with it and you don't want any
moisture<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.650> left<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> Apple<00:00:30.060> or<00:00:30.240> as

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
moisture to be left in the Apple or as

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.549 
moisture to be left in the Apple or as
little<00:00:30.570> moisture<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.140> possible<00:00:32.090> so<00:00:33.559> since

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
little moisture as possible so since

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
little moisture as possible so since
we've<00:00:34.710> got<00:00:34.890> two<00:00:35.130> halves<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.790> our<00:00:36.030> Apple<00:00:36.450> let's

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
we've got two halves of our Apple let's

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.190 
we've got two halves of our Apple let's
do<00:00:37.020> two<00:00:37.380> colors<00:00:38.149> we'll<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> nice<00:00:39.570> bright

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
do two colors we'll do a nice bright

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.250 
do two colors we'll do a nice bright
blue<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.920> nice<00:00:41.129> bright<00:00:41.520> red<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:45.899> I'll<00:00:46.710> just

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
blue and a nice bright red and I'll just

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.160 
blue and a nice bright red and I'll just
use<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:50.250> sort<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.059> spread<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.870> paint

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
use that to sort of spread the paint

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.569 
use that to sort of spread the paint
around<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:54.559> same<00:00:55.559> over<00:00:55.860> here<00:00:56.000> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.760 

for<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.270> print<00:01:00.660> we're<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
for this print we're going to do a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.680 
for this print we're going to do a
repeating<00:01:02.340> pattern<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.300> would<00:01:03.540> be<00:01:03.660> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
repeating pattern so this would be a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.200 
repeating pattern so this would be a
good<00:01:03.930> chance<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.350> talk<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.489> patterns<00:01:05.970> with

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
good chance to talk about patterns with

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.020 
good chance to talk about patterns with
your<00:01:06.390> kids<00:01:09.260> you<00:01:10.260> could<00:01:10.440> also<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:11.520> an<00:01:11.820> art

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
your kids you could also do an art

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.060 
your kids you could also do an art
history<00:01:12.420> unit<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:12.990> teach<00:01:13.260> them<00:01:13.440> about<00:01:13.530> Andy

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
history unit and teach them about Andy

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.830 
history unit and teach them about Andy
Warhol<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:14.850> would<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.150> very<00:01:15.690> cool<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:17.840> let's

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
Warhol that would be very cool and let's

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.249 
Warhol that would be very cool and let's
see<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:20.270> about<00:01:21.270> as<00:01:21.509> much<00:01:21.720> coverage<00:01:22.229> as

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
see so this is about as much coverage as

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.140 
see so this is about as much coverage as
you're<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.130> get<00:01:23.490> there's<00:01:23.759> going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.060> be

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you're going to get there's going to be

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.230 
you're going to get there's going to be
some<00:01:24.450> imperfections<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:26.009> know<00:01:26.240> it's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
some imperfections because you know it's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.340 
some imperfections because you know it's
something<00:01:28.200> from<00:01:28.649> nature<00:01:30.229> and<00:01:31.460> let's<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:33.350> two

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
something from nature and let's do two

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.710 
something from nature and let's do two
blue<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:37.429> one<00:01:38.429> red<00:01:40.759> looks<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:41.940> our<00:01:42.119> red<00:01:42.479> half

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
blue and one red looks like our red half

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.870 
blue and one red looks like our red half
is<00:01:43.080> going<00:01:43.679> to<00:01:43.770> pick<00:01:43.979> up<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.250> little<00:01:44.460> bit<00:01:44.610> more<00:01:44.789> of

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
is going to pick up a little bit more of

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.090 
is going to pick up a little bit more of
the<00:01:45.000> paint<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.520 

and<00:01:54.730> you<00:01:54.970> want<00:01:55.150> to<00:01:55.240> just<00:01:55.390> keep<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.140> right<00:01:56.380> in

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
and you want to just keep it right in

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:05.090 
and you want to just keep it right in

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.250 

this<00:02:05.670> could<00:02:05.850> be<00:02:05.970> a<00:02:06.000> fun<00:02:06.180> activity<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.720> make<00:02:07.020> a

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
this could be a fun activity to make a

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.800 
this could be a fun activity to make a
