Prada we got to show you is the new
atlas<00:00:47.430> freeride<00:00:47.969> crank<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.320> looks<00:00:49.379> very

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
atlas freeride crank so it looks very

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
atlas freeride crank so it looks very
similar<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> Atlas<00:00:50.640> crank<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.149> last<00:00:51.420> year

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
similar to the Atlas crank of last year

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.619 
similar to the Atlas crank of last year
but<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.320> shaved<00:00:52.530> 80<00:00:52.800> grams<00:00:53.160> out<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.390> crank

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
but we shaved 80 grams out of the crank

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.110 
but we shaved 80 grams out of the crank
for<00:00:54.960> 2012<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.579> took<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.789> little<00:00:56.910> bit<00:00:57.059> of

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
for 2012 so we took a little bit of

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.720 
for 2012 so we took a little bit of
material<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> spider<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> BB<00:00:59.609> is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
material out of the spider and the BB is

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.209 
material out of the spider and the BB is
also<00:01:00.030> lighter<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.649> other<00:01:01.770> big<00:01:01.949> thing<00:01:02.100> we

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
also lighter so the other big thing we

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.500 
also lighter so the other big thing we
want<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.399> talk<00:01:02.489> about<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> Atlas<00:01:03.239> crank

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
want to talk about for the Atlas crank

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.240 
want to talk about for the Atlas crank
is<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.110> now<00:01:04.260> much<00:01:04.589> easier<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:05.070> install

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
is that it's now much easier to install

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.969 
is that it's now much easier to install
we<00:01:06.210> got<00:01:06.330> our<00:01:06.420> new<00:01:06.510> exi<00:01:07.020> interface<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
we got our new exi interface so the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.950 
we got our new exi interface so the
x-type<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.490> completely<00:01:08.909> dead<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.750> you<00:01:09.810> no

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
x-type is completely dead so you no

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.750 
x-type is completely dead so you no
longer<00:01:09.990> need<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> big<00:01:10.830> breaker<00:01:11.189> bar<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
longer need a big breaker bar to get the

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.850 
longer need a big breaker bar to get the
cranks<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.900> see<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.170> aight<00:01:13.350> mel<00:01:13.560> allen

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860

key<00:01:14.189> from<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.460> multi-tool<00:01:14.909> easy<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.960> easy<00:01:16.380> off

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
key from a multi-tool easy on easy off

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.830 
key from a multi-tool easy on easy off
we<00:01:18.360> also<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.750> new<00:01:18.960> graphic<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:20.689> you<00:01:21.689> can

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
we also have a new graphic so you can

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.480 
we also have a new graphic so you can
see<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.140> there<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.830> Whistler<00:01:23.280> Bike<00:01:23.430> Park

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
see in there is the Whistler Bike Park

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.999 
see in there is the Whistler Bike Park
instead<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.299> North<00:01:24.479> Shore<00:01:24.890> there's<00:01:25.890> also

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
instead of the North Shore there's also

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.910 
instead of the North Shore there's also
new<00:01:26.220> thicker<00:01:26.430> chainring<00:01:26.880> tabs<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.390> atlas

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
new thicker chainring tabs on the atlas

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.370 
new thicker chainring tabs on the atlas
4.5<00:01:28.920> mil<00:01:29.130> thick<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.840> no<00:01:30.930> longer<00:01:31.140> run

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
4.5 mil thick so you can no longer run

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
4.5 mil thick so you can no longer run
triples<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:32.700> even<00:01:32.850> stronger

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
triples on this but it's even stronger

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.340 
triples on this but it's even stronger
so<00:01:33.780> lighter<00:01:34.229> stronger<00:01:34.759> good<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.350> it's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
so lighter stronger good to go and it's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.870 
so lighter stronger good to go and it's
not<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.740> Atlas<00:01:37.950> freeride<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.700> just

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
not like I Atlas freeride it's just

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.999 
not like I Atlas freeride it's just
simply<00:01:39.240> atlas<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.049> pretty<00:01:40.619> excited<00:01:40.950> about

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
simply atlas so pretty excited about

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.490 
simply atlas so pretty excited about
that<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:41.340> well<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.720> also<00:01:42.869> we're<00:01:43.110> talking<00:01:43.409> about

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that as well so also we're talking about

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.319 
that as well so also we're talking about
this<00:01:43.770> was<00:01:43.890> released<00:01:44.159> last<00:01:44.220> year<00:01:44.549> but<00:01:45.149> the

this was released last year but the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.469 
this was released last year but the
