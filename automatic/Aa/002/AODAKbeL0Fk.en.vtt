 at a Google Maps 5 points Windows 7 will of course be 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.839
 Hand what that cost 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.909
 for that, have to be stable behind 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.140
 Euro 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.140
 instead of the reformer Google Maps 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.499
 the idea was in the morning 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.550
 and 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.880
 as always 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.370
 fast construction is 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.950
 littered 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.950
 You can then see the March card 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.780
 I have to be double as well 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.500
 and Germania Hagen 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.550
 the new feature are so to speak, because the views you need to know that 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.790
 several persons fall in the case of the popular man with both fingers in the semifinals 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:55.960
 only the two 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.190
 Percent the two countries 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.560
 I need all billions of euros then we have to spot 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.960
 that in this new one 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.340
 3 the buildings 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.340
 Demel whose passenger vector graphics 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 then about a hundred times smaller, according to Google 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.330
 and that also very fluently I have to say 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.660
 it does not run so jerky the old versions of a quasi 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.220
 gradually built up gradually 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.780
 I find very pleasant very questionable 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.490
 and explore the market for the Mainz 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.870
 you can too 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.970
 the one compass 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.640
 Mode use the compass mode means only that in Arnstadt and 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.460
 one sees him prefer clearing the delicate according to speak it 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.930
 the view direction turns Rehmann seventh stage time, he is relatively smooth that 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.700
 whole parts of the south relatively smooth 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.960
 This is also a reason for the case to supply the tablet 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.420
 If possible, make a little mourning and then the "strange 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.390
 Karasek Zollverein Google Maps Version 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.830
 but everything has to stay the same 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.970
 but 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.650
 Klose shot out 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.920
 Recently, even the 9 percent stuck still visited that they 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.710
 now even if made available so at least some sources in the 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.579
 Internet so shared that 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.920
 the questions are also available if you do not have time 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.620
 co-managing director so for example the man in the subway is or so 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.880
 it would also be available if it was huge 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.760
 where you're probably less likely to use Google Maps so St 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.480
 as can be synonymous with Balles here had Google 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.399
 as you can see here 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:37.879
 that's all 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.549
 Wiegard 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.549
 so much for Google Maps around Samsung Galaxy Tab 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.619
 The defending champion will be used more in the coming days 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.429
 the world and have theirs 

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:49.629
 by tasting 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.620
 and speak it means if they do
