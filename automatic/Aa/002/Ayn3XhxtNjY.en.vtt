00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.780 

the<00:00:29.140> technique<00:00:29.560> is<00:00:29.740> very<00:00:29.800> similar<00:00:30.250> you<00:00:30.640> know

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
the technique is very similar you know

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.650 
the technique is very similar you know
the<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:32.410> all<00:00:32.590> done<00:00:32.830> checking<00:00:33.520> rooms<00:00:33.820> doesn't

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660

mean mainly using puppets
although<00:00:37.930> checking<00:00:38.559> one<00:00:38.680> had<00:00:38.890> difficulties

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
although checking one had difficulties

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.200

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
in clay because they naturally animals

with<00:00:46.210> feathers<00:00:46.629> you<00:00:47.440> know<00:00:47.470> so<00:00:47.860> we<00:00:47.949> had<00:00:48.070> we<00:00:48.280> used

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
with feathers you know so we had we used

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.610 
with feathers you know so we had we used
latex<00:00:49.210> rubber<00:00:49.390> sometimes<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.170> scope<00:00:50.440> the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
latex rubber sometimes to scope the

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
bodies with with this weave plastic you

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.490 
bodies with with this weave plastic you
use<00:00:54.610> plasticine<00:00:55.180> probably<00:00:55.629> more<00:00:55.809> gone<00:00:56.290> back

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
use plasticine probably more gone back

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.829 
use plasticine probably more gone back

I<00:02:37.780> think<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.050> fun<00:02:39.230> fundamental<00:02:39.800> kind<00:02:40.790> of

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
I think in the fun fundamental kind of

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.720 
I think in the fun fundamental kind of
dynamic<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.870> their<00:02:42.050> relationship<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:42.980> you

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
dynamic of their relationship is a you

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.570 
dynamic of their relationship is a you
know<00:02:43.880> every<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:45.200> mean<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.530> know<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.830> UK<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.550> a

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.960 
together so that we knew we know it
inside<00:04:11.980> out<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:13.290> sometimes<00:04:14.290> I<00:04:14.590> would

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
inside out and sometimes I would

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.370 
inside out and sometimes I would
storyboard<00:04:15.970> a<00:04:16.120> scene<00:04:16.359> or<00:04:16.630> write<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.870> scene<00:04:17.169> or

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
storyboard a scene or write a scene or

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.920 
storyboard a scene or write a scene or
he<00:04:17.530> would<00:04:17.680> write<00:04:17.889> a<00:04:17.919> scene<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.329> then<00:04:19.780> we'd

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
he would write a scene and and then we'd

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.050 
he would write a scene and and then we'd
sometimes<00:04:20.169> swap<00:04:20.530> over<00:04:20.949> and<00:04:21.160> but<00:04:21.609> in<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:21.820> in

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
sometimes swap over and but in the in
