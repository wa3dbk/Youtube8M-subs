00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
booth not only for vocals either what I

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.380 
booth not only for vocals either what I
have<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.520> three<00:01:11.939> pieces<00:01:12.210> of

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
have is these three pieces of

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.380 
have is these three pieces of
soundproofing<00:01:13.170> hung<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.189> microphone<00:01:15.000> stands

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
soundproofing hung on microphone stands

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.289 
soundproofing hung on microphone stands
that<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:15.960> adjustable<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.000> actually

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
that are adjustable so if you actually

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.910 
that are adjustable so if you actually
are<00:01:18.600> recording<00:01:19.049> an<00:01:19.140> acoustic<00:01:19.170> guitar<00:01:19.439> you're

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
are recording an acoustic guitar you're

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
are recording an acoustic guitar you're
sitting<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.340> chair<00:01:20.580> these<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.570> actually<00:01:21.750> be

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
sitting in a chair these can actually be

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.679 
sitting in a chair these can actually be
lowered<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.939> actually<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.450> more

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
lowered so that you actually have more

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.600 
lowered so that you actually have more
sound<00:01:25.020> reinforcement<00:01:25.320> behind<00:01:26.220> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
sound reinforcement behind you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.390 
sound reinforcement behind you
now<00:01:27.439> you<00:01:28.439> remember<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:28.920> from<00:01:29.130> one<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.280> my

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
now you remember this from one of my

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.469 
now you remember this from one of my
other<00:01:29.520> videos<00:01:29.700> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:32.479> microphone

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
other videos this is my microphone

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.499 
other videos this is my microphone
filter<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> actually<00:01:35.250> filter

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
filter this is to actually filter

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.370 
filter this is to actually filter
background<00:01:36.509> noise<00:01:36.720> from<00:01:36.900> behind<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
background noise from behind the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.350 
background noise from behind the
microphone<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.729> actually<00:01:39.240> works

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
microphone and this actually works

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.539 
microphone and this actually works
really<00:01:39.570> good<00:01:40.110> when<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.439> comes<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.189> setup

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
really good when it comes to this setup

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.760 
really good when it comes to this setup
and<00:01:42.180> I'll<00:01:42.299> show<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> how<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> actually<00:01:43.259> built

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and I'll show you how I actually built

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.450 
and I'll show you how I actually built
these<00:01:43.979> panels<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:45.000> in<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.149> moment<00:01:45.979> okay<00:01:46.979> so

right<00:02:13.739> here<00:02:14.159> I<00:02:14.340> poked<00:02:15.030> two<00:02:15.599> holes<00:02:16.310> into<00:02:17.310> this

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
right here I poked two holes into this

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.789 
right here I poked two holes into this
piece<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.849> soundproofing<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.659> I<00:02:19.170> did<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.680> on

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
piece of soundproofing and I did it on

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.559 
piece of soundproofing and I did it on
the<00:02:20.099> third<00:02:20.459> rung<00:02:21.000> down<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.849> once<00:02:24.299> this

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
the third rung down so that once this

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.770 
the third rung down so that once this
hangs<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.890> lends<00:02:26.280> support<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
hangs this lends support and the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.750 
hangs this lends support and the
soundproofing<00:02:28.379> doesn't<00:02:28.680> ripple<00:02:29.040> now<00:02:29.519> let<00:02:29.670> me

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
soundproofing doesn't ripple now let me

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.050 
soundproofing doesn't ripple now let me
show<00:02:29.940> you<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.209> back<00:02:34.489> this<00:02:35.489> is<00:02:35.549> what<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:35.910> looks

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
show you the back this is what it looks

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.330 
show you the back this is what it looks
like<00:02:36.120> from<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.510> back

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
like from the back

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.520 
like from the back
here<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.580> microphone<00:02:39.030> clip<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.349> can

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
here is the microphone clip and you can

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.220 
here is the microphone clip and you can
see<00:02:40.860> how<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.370> piece<00:02:42.209> of<00:02:42.390> velcro<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.900> actually

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
see how the piece of velcro is actually

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.180 
see how the piece of velcro is actually
hanging<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:45.390> clip<00:02:45.660> so<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.620> find<00:02:47.040> your

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
hanging in the clip so you find your

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.069 
hanging in the clip so you find your
third<00:02:47.430> rung<00:02:47.730> down<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.329> you<00:02:48.540> actually<00:02:48.690> poke

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
third rung down and you actually poke

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:52.880 
third rung down and you actually poke
your<00:02:49.230> two<00:02:49.470> holes<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.720> then<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.750> slide<00:02:52.709> it

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
your two holes and then you slide it

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.860 
your two holes and then you slide it
inside<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.430> microphone<00:02:53.849> clip<00:02:54.150> now<00:02:54.660> for

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
inside of the microphone clip now for

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.449 
inside of the microphone clip now for
further<00:02:55.049> stability<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:55.950> this<00:02:56.099> thing<00:02:56.280> doesn't

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
further stability so this thing doesn't

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.400 
further stability so this thing doesn't
waver<00:02:56.760> back<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.239> forth<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:58.049> go<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.319> the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
waver back and forth you go to the

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.410 
waver back and forth you go to the
bottom<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.250> do<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.549> same<00:02:59.790> thing<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.299> the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
bottom and you do the same thing on the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.360 
bottom and you do the same thing on the
bottom<00:03:00.569> only<00:03:01.530> difference<00:03:02.069> is<00:03:02.220> you're

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
bottom only difference is you're

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.190 
bottom only difference is you're
actually<00:03:02.609> going<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.819> wrap<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.420> piece<00:03:03.720> around

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
actually going to wrap this piece around

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.160 
actually going to wrap this piece around
the<00:03:04.440> bottom<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.299> this<00:03:06.299> keeps<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:06.959> when<00:03:07.079> you

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
the bottom and this keeps it so when you

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.449 
the bottom and this keeps it so when you
actually<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.769> sight<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.160> pull<00:03:08.370> it

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
actually have the sight and you pull it

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.520 
actually have the sight and you pull it
left<00:03:08.579> and<00:03:08.790> right<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.510> actually<00:03:09.690> doesn't<00:03:10.079> twist

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
left and right it actually doesn't twist

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.830 
left and right it actually doesn't twist
on<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:11.010> microphone<00:03:11.430> stand<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.540> stays

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
on the microphone stand so it stays

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.349 
on the microphone stand so it stays
pretty<00:03:13.140> solid<00:03:13.739> all<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.250> way<00:03:14.519> through<00:03:14.609> there's

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
pretty solid all the way through there's

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.620 
pretty solid all the way through there's
the<00:03:15.599> top<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:17.160> there's<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.549> bottom<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.540> of

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
the top and there's the bottom and of

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.000 
the top and there's the bottom and of
course<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:18.989> have<00:03:19.169> the<00:03:19.319> adjustment<00:03:19.769> on<00:03:19.950> the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
course you have the adjustment on the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.220 
course you have the adjustment on the
microphone<00:03:20.400> stand<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:21.419> bring<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:21.930> whole

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
microphone stand to bring this whole

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.530 
microphone stand to bring this whole
piece<00:03:22.620> down<00:03:23.069> to<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.430> floor<00:03:23.790> if<00:03:24.209> you're

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
piece down to the floor if you're

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.390 
piece down to the floor if you're
actually<00:03:24.870> recording<00:03:25.109> acoustic<00:03:25.739> guitar<00:03:26.130> and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
actually recording acoustic guitar and

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.009 
actually recording acoustic guitar and
you're<00:03:26.790> low<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.209> floor<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.750> want<00:03:27.959> a

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
you're low to the floor and you want a

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.500 
you're low to the floor and you want a
little<00:03:28.230> bit<00:03:28.349> more<00:03:28.500> sound<00:03:28.739> reinforcement

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
little bit more sound reinforcement

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.120 
little bit more sound reinforcement
lower<00:03:30.510> than<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.959> chair<00:03:31.260> okay

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
lower than the chair okay

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.349 
lower than the chair okay
so<00:03:33.109> again<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.500> velcro<00:03:34.739> poked<00:03:35.700> two<00:03:36.120> holes

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
so again the velcro poked two holes

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.080 
so again the velcro poked two holes
through<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.319> soundproofing<00:03:37.910> wrapped<00:03:38.910> around

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
through the soundproofing wrapped around

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.879 
through the soundproofing wrapped around
the<00:03:39.329> bottom<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.720> microphone<00:03:40.079> stand<00:03:40.410> and

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
the bottom of the microphone stand and

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.030 
the bottom of the microphone stand and
at<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.130> top<00:03:41.569> same<00:03:42.569> deal<00:03:42.840> only<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.560> top<00:03:43.799> is

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
at the top same deal only the top is

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.490 
at the top same deal only the top is
actually<00:03:44.400> hooked<00:03:44.930> inside<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.049> microphone

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
actually hooked inside the microphone

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.370 
actually hooked inside the microphone
clip<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:48.120> now<00:03:48.359> I<00:03:48.630> did<00:03:48.989> three<00:03:49.319> of<00:03:49.470> these<00:03:49.620> panels

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
clip so now I did three of these panels

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.229 
clip so now I did three of these panels
one<00:03:52.639> two<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:54.569> three<00:03:55.400> I'll<00:03:56.400> set<00:03:56.760> up<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.000> same

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
one two and three I'll set up the same

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:02.930 
one two and three I'll set up the same
and<00:03:58.200> in<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.709> back<00:03:58.919> shot

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.780 

that's<00:04:03.600> what<00:04:03.840> she<00:04:04.020> looks<00:04:04.260> like

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.330 

and<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.480> works<00:04:09.750> beautifully<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.890> it<00:04:11.099> perfect

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
and it works beautifully is it perfect

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.649 
and it works beautifully is it perfect
no<00:04:13.010> but<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.340> good<00:04:14.640> for<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:15.030> room<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.480> has

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
no but is it good for the room that has

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.319 
no but is it good for the room that has
just<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:15.989> lot<00:04:16.199> of<00:04:16.229> flutter<00:04:16.590> echo<00:04:16.769> in<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.370> room

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
just a lot of flutter echo in it a room

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.640 
just a lot of flutter echo in it a room
that<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.540> actually<00:04:18.840> don't<00:04:19.320> want<00:04:19.530> to

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
that you actually don't want to

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.909 
that you actually don't want to
customize<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.669> accommodate<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.269> studio<00:04:21.690> or<00:04:22.320> if

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
customize to accommodate a studio or if

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.350 
customize to accommodate a studio or if
you're<00:04:23.070> like<00:04:23.190> many<00:04:23.430> people<00:04:23.639> and<00:04:23.940> record<00:04:24.240> in

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
you're like many people and record in

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.730 
you're like many people and record in
your<00:04:24.479> living<00:04:24.810> room<00:04:24.840> something<00:04:25.229> that<00:04:25.470> you<00:04:25.590> can
