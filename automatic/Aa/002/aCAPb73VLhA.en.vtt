headlight<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.830> go<00:01:14.070> 8<00:01:14.310> millimeter<00:01:15.380> for

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
headlight so here we go 8 millimeter for

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
headlight so here we go 8 millimeter for
that<00:01:16.650> trim<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:18.229> have<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.590> more<00:01:20.040> Philips<00:01:20.790> screw

that trim I have one more Philips screw
right<00:01:21.630> here<00:01:21.689> which<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.380> difficult<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:23.040> get<00:01:23.220> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
right here which is difficult to get to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.320 
right here which is difficult to get to
but<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:24.479> ok<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:25.680> doable<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.580> should

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
but that's ok it's all doable I should

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
but that's ok it's all doable I should
be<00:01:27.509> able<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:28.650> move<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.189> headlight<00:01:29.610> out

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
disconnect it right here I'm not sure if

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310 
disconnect it right here I'm not sure if
it<00:01:35.430> was<00:01:35.579> necessary<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:36.509> I'd<00:01:36.689> rather<00:01:36.960> see

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it was necessary but I'd rather see

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.840 
it was necessary but I'd rather see
everything<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:40.040> can<00:01:41.040> see<00:01:41.250> what<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:41.520> doing

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850

actually<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.920> was<00:01:44.130> necessary<00:01:44.820> because

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
actually it was necessary because

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.090 
actually it was necessary because
there's<00:01:45.420> another<00:01:45.750> eight<00:01:46.079> millimeter<00:01:46.649> fella
