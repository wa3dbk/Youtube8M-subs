00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
these are nice little court waters to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.709 
these are nice little court waters to
start<00:00:13.740> out<00:00:13.950> baby<00:00:14.280> chicks<00:00:14.700> with<00:00:14.969> for<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> first

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
start out baby chicks with for the first

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.779 
start out baby chicks with for the first
two<00:00:16.020> weeks<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> couple<00:00:17.550> different

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
two weeks we have a couple different

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.890 
two weeks we have a couple different
kinds<00:00:18.060> here<00:00:19.010> this<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> base<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.660> can

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
kinds here this is a base that you can

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.760 
kinds here this is a base that you can
actually<00:00:22.140> take<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.039> screw<00:00:23.520> on<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.770> little

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
actually take and screw on a little

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.889 
actually take and screw on a little
screw<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.410> buy<00:00:31.590> these<00:00:31.650> anywhere

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
screw on so you can buy these anywhere

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.049 
screw on so you can buy these anywhere
we<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> plastic<00:00:34.950> jug<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.340> will<00:00:35.850> also

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
we have a plastic jug that will also

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.950 
we have a plastic jug that will also
screw<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:41.180> basically<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> fill<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.780> up<00:00:42.900> with

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
screw on basically you fill it up with

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.400 
screw on basically you fill it up with
water<00:00:43.760> turn<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.090> upside<00:00:45.660> down<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
water turn this upside down and you

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.060 
water turn this upside down and you
screw<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:48.739> and<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:50.040> you<00:00:50.070> flip<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.460> over

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
screw it on and then you flip it over

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.400 
screw it on and then you flip it over
the<00:00:53.070> advantage<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.180> base<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> it

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the advantage to this base is that it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.660 
the advantage to this base is that it
screws<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.220> so<00:00:56.989> if<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.320> tips<00:00:58.620> over<00:00:58.920> its<00:00:59.430> not

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
screws on so if it tips over its not

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.370 
screws on so if it tips over its not
gonna<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.450> know<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.930> not<00:01:01.110> gonna

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
gonna you know it's not gonna

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.690 
gonna you know it's not gonna
automatically<00:01:02.160> spill<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.880> real<00:01:03.270> quick

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
automatically spill out real quick

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.929 
automatically spill out real quick
this<00:01:05.700> one<00:01:06.060> works<00:01:06.420> well<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.780> ducks<00:01:07.740> geese<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
this one works well for ducks geese and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.230 
this one works well for ducks geese and
standard<00:01:09.509> size<00:01:09.810> chickens<00:01:10.619> or<00:01:11.520> larger<00:01:11.999> ban

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
standard size chickens or larger ban

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.020 
standard size chickens or larger ban
ease<00:01:17.780> this<00:01:18.780> one<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> same<00:01:19.679> style<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.939> a

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
ease this one is the same style it's a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.480 
ease this one is the same style it's a
little<00:01:21.329> bit<00:01:21.479> more<00:01:23.299> not<00:01:24.299> as<00:01:24.509> big<00:01:24.869> around<00:01:25.490> but

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
little bit more not as big around but

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.300 
little bit more not as big around but
it's<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.909> screw<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.929> a<00:01:28.139> slip<00:01:28.649> on<00:01:28.859> so

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
it's not a screw on it's a slip on so

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.940 
it's not a screw on it's a slip on so
you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.729> slip<00:01:29.969> it<00:01:30.179> on<00:01:31.520> or<00:01:32.520> slip<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.119> on

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
you can just slip it on or slip this on

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.099 
you can just slip it on or slip this on
so<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.009> fill<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.939> your<00:01:36.779> jug<00:01:37.469> with<00:01:37.679> water<00:01:39.109> or

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
so you fill the your jug with water or

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:45.199 
so you fill the your jug with water or
your<00:01:40.649> quart<00:01:41.009> jar<00:01:41.719> with<00:01:42.719> water<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:45.029> you

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
your quart jar with water and then you

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.179 
your quart jar with water and then you
just<00:01:45.450> basically<00:01:45.719> put<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:48.829> and<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.920> hold

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
just basically put this on and you hold

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.789 
just basically put this on and you hold
it<00:01:51.439> put<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.590> down<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.479> then<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.779> suction<00:01:55.229> will

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
it put it down and then the suction will

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.519 
it put it down and then the suction will
actually<00:01:56.369> let<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.639> feed<00:01:57.090> out<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.139> doesn't

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:01.529 
actually let it feed out so it doesn't

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:03.649 
actually let it feed out so it doesn't
run<00:02:01.709> over<00:02:02.069> so<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.700> suction<00:02:03.209> will<00:02:03.389> work

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
run over so the suction will work

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.529 
run over so the suction will work
properly<00:02:03.989> with<00:02:04.529> it<00:02:04.739> the<00:02:05.609> downside<00:02:06.179> to<00:02:06.389> this

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
properly with it the downside to this

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.169 
properly with it the downside to this
one<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.169> they<00:02:07.349> can<00:02:07.380> tip<00:02:08.039> over<00:02:08.280> even<00:02:08.940> though<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
one is they can tip over even though the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.330 
one is they can tip over even though the
suction<00:02:09.630> holds<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.080> pretty<00:02:10.380> secure<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.069> can

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
suction holds it pretty secure it can

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.950 
suction holds it pretty secure it can
tip<00:02:11.640> over<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.300> water<00:02:12.480> will<00:02:12.780> spill<00:02:13.080> out

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
tip over and the water will spill out

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.650 
tip over and the water will spill out
this<00:02:15.960> one<00:02:16.230> also<00:02:16.440> works<00:02:16.860> well

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
this one also works well

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.240 
this one also works well
for<00:02:19.140> turkeys<00:02:19.980> ducks<00:02:20.900> larger<00:02:21.900> chicks<00:02:22.320> rare

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
for turkeys ducks larger chicks rare

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.460 
for turkeys ducks larger chicks rare
breeds<00:02:23.640> some<00:02:24.150> larger<00:02:24.570> bantams<00:02:30.020> this<00:02:31.020> bass

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
breeds some larger bantams this bass

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.210 
breeds some larger bantams this bass
works<00:02:32.040> best<00:02:32.520> for<00:02:32.790> quail<00:02:33.420> pheasant<00:02:34.110> game<00:02:34.830> birds

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
works best for quail pheasant game birds

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.040 
works best for quail pheasant game birds
and<00:02:35.820> smaller<00:02:36.390> tight<00:02:36.840> bantams<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.660> reason

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
and smaller tight bantams and the reason

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.560 
and smaller tight bantams and the reason
it<00:02:40.230> works<00:02:40.410> best<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.310> got<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> lower<00:02:41.820> profile

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
it works best it's got a lower profile

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.170 
it works best it's got a lower profile
because<00:02:43.170> they're<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.380> smaller<00:02:43.860> bird<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:45.030> they

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
because they're a smaller bird so they

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.580 
because they're a smaller bird so they
can<00:02:45.360> see<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.720> water<00:02:46.580> also<00:02:47.930> there's<00:02:48.930> not<00:02:49.230> much

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
can see the water also there's not much

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.340 
can see the water also there's not much
room<00:02:49.920> here<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.460> they<00:02:50.910> can't<00:02:51.240> get<00:02:51.510> into<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:52.110> and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
room here so they can't get into it and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.520 
room here so they can't get into it and
get<00:02:52.530> damp<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.220> chilled<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:53.850> die<00:02:54.170> that's<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
get damp and chilled and die that's the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.040 
get damp and chilled and die that's the
downside<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.730> using<00:02:56.760> one<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.510> these<00:02:59.780> they<00:03:00.780> get

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
downside to using one of these they get

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.700 
downside to using one of these they get
they<00:03:01.500> fall<00:03:01.860> in<00:03:02.330> get<00:03:03.330> damp<00:03:03.690> even<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.290> they<00:03:04.470> get

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
they fall in get damp even if they get

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.260 
they fall in get damp even if they get
out<00:03:04.740> they're<00:03:05.220> damp<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.820> now<00:03:05.940> they<00:03:06.090> get

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
out they're damp and now they get

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.240 
out they're damp and now they get
chilled<00:03:06.630> real<00:03:06.900> quick<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:10.470> this<00:03:10.830> works<00:03:11.130> well

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
chilled real quick so this works well

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.900 
chilled real quick so this works well
for<00:03:11.460> game<00:03:11.970> birds<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.690> small<00:03:12.840> bantams<00:03:13.910> same

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
for game birds and small bantams same

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:22.390 
for game birds and small bantams same
concept<00:03:16.820> it's<00:03:17.820> designed<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.660> screw<00:03:18.960> on<00:03:21.380> and

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
concept it's designed to screw on and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.680 
concept it's designed to screw on and
it'll<00:03:23.400> set<00:03:23.760> down<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.420> same<00:03:24.690> way<00:03:26.420> there's<00:03:27.420> just

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
it'll set down the same way there's just

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.360 
it'll set down the same way there's just
enough<00:03:28.020> room<00:03:28.290> for<00:03:28.320> them<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.710> get<00:03:28.950> their<00:03:29.160> beak

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
enough room for them to get their beak

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.430 
enough room for them to get their beak
in<00:03:29.610> there<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.060> not<00:03:30.210> get<00:03:30.510> rest<00:03:31.020> their<00:03:31.200> body

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
in there and not get rest their body

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.430 
in there and not get rest their body
damp<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.000> is<00:03:33.180> really<00:03:33.360> recommended<00:03:34.200> for

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
damp so this is really recommended for

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.540 
damp so this is really recommended for
that<00:03:38.300> all<00:03:39.300> of<00:03:39.630> this<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.230> generally<00:03:41.040> good<00:03:41.520> for

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
that all of this is generally good for

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.270 
that all of this is generally good for
the<00:03:42.360> first<00:03:42.630> two<00:03:42.930> weeks<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.620> then<00:03:43.830> you<00:03:43.860> want<00:03:44.220> to

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
the first two weeks and then you want to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.280 
the first two weeks and then you want to
migrate<00:03:44.460> to<00:03:44.730> other<00:03:45.090> larger<00:03:45.930> type<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.770> waters
