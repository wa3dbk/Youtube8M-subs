00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
what's called a smart mode now if you're

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.490 
what's called a smart mode now if you're
a<00:00:50.039> real<00:00:50.250> shutterbug<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.030> you'd<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.500> to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
a real shutterbug and you'd like to to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.350 
a real shutterbug and you'd like to to
change<00:00:52.710> your<00:00:52.920> f-stop<00:00:53.070> or<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.760> shutter<00:00:54.030> speed

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
change your f-stop or your shutter speed

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.330 
change your f-stop or your shutter speed
or<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.809> film<00:00:55.050> speed<00:00:55.110> manually<00:00:55.890> it's

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
or your film speed manually it's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.400 
or your film speed manually it's
probably<00:00:56.699> not<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> camera<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:58.320> if

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
probably not the camera for you but if

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
probably not the camera for you but if
you<00:00:58.500> turn<00:00:58.680> on<00:00:58.739> smart<00:00:59.190> mode<00:00:59.370> then<00:01:00.059> basically

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
you turn on smart mode then basically

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.799 
you turn on smart mode then basically
you<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.489> point<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.670> shoot<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> camera

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
you just point and shoot and the camera

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.880 
you just point and shoot and the camera
will<00:01:03.930> take<00:01:03.960> care<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> rest<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
will take care of the rest and it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.880 
will take care of the rest and it
actually<00:01:05.100> does<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> good<00:01:05.580> job<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.860> just

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
actually does a good job of it so just

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.130 
actually does a good job of it so just
flip<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.310> around<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.909> can<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.420> 2.7

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
flip this around so we can see the 2.7

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.149 
flip this around so we can see the 2.7
inch<00:01:10.290> LCD<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> back<00:01:12.170> now<00:01:13.170> if<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.470> hit<00:01:14.100> play

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
inch LCD on the back now if we hit play

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.980 
inch LCD on the back now if we hit play
we<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.240> picture<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.840> took
