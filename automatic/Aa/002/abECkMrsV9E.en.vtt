00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.579
 the country image foundation 

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:05.340
 launched the campaign that seeks to encourage tourism but that gave the public 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.650
 who follow their riches abroad for the bicentennial 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.389
 of beds information about this initiative 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.210
 of the image country foundation to the new campaign area called chile 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.550
 does the context well to make known the quality periods 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.120
 which to the properties country of the kindnesses and strengths faith that has 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.970
 our country is to talk about it we are with him with harangues to do is 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.019
 executive director of the foundation image country as these have and many 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.129
 thank you night towards you joan gabriel good first is hard work what 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.710
 we have seen in detail m 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.590
 who wants to work and aims mainly at the perception that there is 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.340
 of chili that apparently 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.340
 It is much better known than we would like in other parts of the world 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.420
 Of course, everything we have studied during these Kirchner years is a 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.140
 very unknown country abroad 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.140
 and that however among those who know them has a good reputation 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.770
 and therefore the basis to split the work and to develop it and know 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.370
 Exactly what do those who are outside think about us? 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.600
 particularly that I say that the cones 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.560
 and we have seen that Chile is considered a country that knows how to do things well 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.630
 but I'm looking forward to meeting the conference yesterday because for example the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.880
 campaign the palapas 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.549
 efe is now shown the original power of zapata a strategy shirt 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.220
 realistic 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.110
 but we thought it was 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.840
 for different reasons it would be long explains 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.560
 what the first notice 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.130
 they are as they have standing as they are there 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.079
 ok to say to us obviously I was thinking as I said in a job that 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.140
 he has twenty or thirty years ahead 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.780
 and in that job of imposing the prestige of Chile from the outside world 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.140
 obviously that the original people have to be 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.610
 and it has a list of the culture and it has to be the art of the Mapuche and crazy and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.759
 tide and the world has to be present 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.710
 per hundred but those and I took them something that foreigners touch them today 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.770
 the day more closely and that will be what they bring to Chile are the wine 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.909
 are the coen of the sea products are of the fruit that reside in a 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.169
 season that is not one's own therefore 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:12.589
 in a yahweh and that opens a door and who after recent on a path that 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.879
 as I say long to us it seemed to us that is why we should 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.819
 start to bring chili to people 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.359
 therefore, there is no need to know what more mandate after this other bolt has 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.980
 expropriated property of our country we do not think of bringing water to be 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.909
 an important campaign in brazil during the course this other year 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:30.870
 the theme of the original people 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.210
 The subject of tourism, the theme of the Easter beach are themes that are going to say that 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.579
 is very in the center bonus I do not see it as something very future 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.359
 she has been present in all our decisions 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.109
 roast a lot of fat to Juan Gabriel ValdÃ©s paiz so many things part of this 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.310
 Once I was going to start devouring totally when I police the holidays 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.190
 despite these boats through international calls to give 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.320
 know about the properties that our country has katherine years have done
