00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
one thing I've noticed that helps me a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.150 
one thing I've noticed that helps me a
lot<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.510> when<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.140> learned<00:00:22.440> I<00:00:22.800> learned<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
lot is that when I learned I learned to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.710 
lot is that when I learned I learned to
push<00:00:23.340> regular<00:00:23.760> obviously<00:00:24.360> so<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.660> can

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
push regular obviously so that I can

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.540 
push regular obviously so that I can
film<00:00:25.050> people<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:25.800> when<00:00:26.010> they're<00:00:26.100> on<00:00:26.130> my<00:00:26.310> left

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
film people like when they're on my left

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.820 
film people like when they're on my left
side<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.020> really<00:00:28.230> want<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.560> get<00:00:28.650> into

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
side but if you really want to get into

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.260 
side but if you really want to get into
it<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.130> someone's<00:00:29.430> on<00:00:29.520> your<00:00:29.550> right<00:00:29.820> side<00:00:29.850> is

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
it if someone's on your right side is

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.359 
it if someone's on your right side is
better<00:00:30.600> to<00:00:30.750> put<00:00:30.930> switch<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.859> push<00:00:32.070> switch

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
better to put switch so you push switch

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.799 
better to put switch so you push switch
and<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.699> easier<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.059> stay<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.330> front<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.660> them

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and it's easier to stay in front of them

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.150 
and it's easier to stay in front of them
and<00:00:33.870> film<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> right<00:00:34.379> way<00:00:34.530> because<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:34.860> on

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and film the right way because it's on

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.069 
and film the right way because it's on
the<00:00:35.250> other<00:00:35.370> side<00:00:35.489> otherwise<00:00:36.449> they're<00:00:36.720> pushing

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the other side otherwise they're pushing
