having that rigidity that makes you it
that<00:00:53.340> makes<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.360> really

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
that makes you think that you really

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.810 
that makes you think that you really
have<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> solid<00:00:55.170> solidly<00:00:56.039> built<00:00:56.219> phone<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.670> your

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
have a solid solidly built phone in your

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.400 
have a solid solidly built phone in your
hands<00:00:57.180> there<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:58.020> don't<00:00:58.260> feel<00:00:58.350> like

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
hands there you really don't feel like

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.569 
hands there you really don't feel like
you're<00:00:58.590> gonna<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:58.859> dropping<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.309> because

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
you're gonna be dropping this because

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.569 
you're gonna be dropping this because
the<00:00:59.699> grip<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.149> easy<00:01:00.570> given<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
the grip is really easy given the

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.830 
the grip is really easy given the
somewhat<00:01:02.579> rounded<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.120> still<00:01:03.329> very<00:01:03.359> rigid

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
somewhat rounded but still very rigid

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.149 
somewhat rounded but still very rigid
corners<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.260> keep<00:01:04.409> using<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> term<00:01:04.739> rigid

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
corners I keep using the term rigid

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.280 
corners I keep using the term rigid
because<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.090> kind<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.540> build

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
because that is the kind of build

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.719 
because that is the kind of build
quality<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:07.890> here

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
they have very decisive lines all around

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.890 
they have very decisive lines all around
you<00:01:11.490> still<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> dual<00:01:12.299> glass<00:01:12.630> finish

you still have the dual glass finish

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.170 
you still have the dual glass finish
here<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.439> really<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.640> hand<00:01:14.939> it's<00:01:15.119> just

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
