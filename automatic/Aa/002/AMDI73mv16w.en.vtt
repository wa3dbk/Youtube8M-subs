00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
there that's what I reminds me of in a

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.540 
there that's what I reminds me of in a
weird<00:00:39.930> way<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.620> looks<00:00:40.829> awesome<00:00:41.399> though<00:00:41.430> I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
weird way so it looks awesome though I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.430 
weird way so it looks awesome though I
really<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.420> then<00:00:42.989> after<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.200> we

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
really like it and then after that we

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.319 
really like it and then after that we
have<00:00:43.620> mega<00:00:43.829> pidgeot<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> normal

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
have mega pidgeot which is a normal

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.750 
have mega pidgeot which is a normal
flying<00:00:45.660> ability<00:00:46.289> no<00:00:46.500> guard<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.399> special

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
flying ability no guard and it's special

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.220 
flying ability no guard and it's special
attack<00:00:48.059> increases<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.840> that's<00:00:49.020> kinda

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
attack increases so that's kinda

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.299 
attack increases so that's kinda
interesting<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> special<00:00:50.129> attack

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
interesting to see a special attack

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.560 
interesting to see a special attack
increase<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.820> thought<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> always<00:00:51.329> train

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
increase I thought you always train

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.029 
increase I thought you always train
those<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> tech<00:00:52.110> maybe<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:52.649> wrong<00:00:52.770> than

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
those in the tech maybe I'm wrong than

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.950 
those in the tech maybe I'm wrong than
that<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.340> don't<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.640> kind<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.539> interesting

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
that I don't know kind of interesting

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.200 
that I don't know kind of interesting
though<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.980> looks<00:00:56.190> really<00:00:56.430> cool<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.760> comes

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
though it looks really cool it comes

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.119 
though it looks really cool it comes
like<00:00:57.390> our<00:00:57.539> final<00:00:57.840> fantasy<00:00:58.170> hair<00:00:58.379> cut<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.739> game

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
like our final fantasy hair cut the game

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.490 
like our final fantasy hair cut the game
to<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.600> guess<00:01:00.809> its<00:01:00.989> feathers

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
to it you know it's I guess its feathers

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.740 
to it you know it's I guess its feathers
but<00:01:01.680> kowelska<00:01:01.980> has<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> scarf<00:01:02.579> or<00:01:02.760> something<00:01:02.820> it

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
but kowelska has a scarf or something it

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.690 
but kowelska has a scarf or something it
looks<00:01:04.110> very<00:01:04.170> interesting<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:05.519> seems

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
looks very interesting and it seems

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.130 
looks very interesting and it seems
weird<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:05.909> these<00:01:06.090> two<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.240> get<00:01:06.390> megas<00:01:06.780> i<00:01:06.960> mean

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
weird for these two to get megas i mean

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.390 
weird for these two to get megas i mean
i'm<00:01:07.260> glad<00:01:07.350> they<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:07.770> both<00:01:07.920> look<00:01:08.159> cool

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
i'm glad they are they both look cool

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.100 
i'm glad they are they both look cool
but<00:01:08.610> i<00:01:09.240> guess<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.540> really<00:01:09.720> does<00:01:09.930> show<00:01:10.080> that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
but i guess this really does show that

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.050 
but i guess this really does show that
any<00:01:10.470> Pokemon<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.159> become<00:01:11.369> mega<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.820> doesn't
