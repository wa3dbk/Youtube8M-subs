00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
people sometimes like if they're sitting

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.210 
people sometimes like if they're sitting
still<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.970> dunno<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.990> common<00:01:19.320> spots<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.189> check

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
still I dunno the common spots to check

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.679 
still I dunno the common spots to check
and<00:01:20.700> stuff<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.270> sometimes<00:01:21.630> you

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and stuff like that but sometimes you

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.370 
and stuff like that but sometimes you
just<00:01:21.750> can't<00:01:22.380> seem<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.189> anybody

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
just can't seem to see anybody

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.219 
just can't seem to see anybody
so<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.970> thought<00:01:26.970> I'd<00:01:27.090> let<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.270> guys<00:01:27.450> know<00:01:27.659> what

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
so I thought I'd let you guys know what

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.609 
so I thought I'd let you guys know what
the<00:01:28.380> settings<00:01:28.590> are<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.990> updated

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
the settings are for the for the updated

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.890 
the settings are for the for the updated
settings<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.060> definitely<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> lot

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
settings they are definitely a lot

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
settings they are definitely a lot
better<00:01:34.140> than<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.470> ones<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.799> current<00:01:35.159> that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
better than the ones that I current that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.480 
better than the ones that I current that
I<00:01:35.549> had<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.360> that<00:01:36.570> video<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.170> did<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.979> similar

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
I had in that video I did have similar

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.789 
I had in that video I did have similar
settings<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.030> these<00:01:39.180> prior<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.229> him<00:01:40.380> telling

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
settings to these prior to him telling

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.590 
settings to these prior to him telling
me<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.490> there<00:01:41.610> are<00:01:41.729> some<00:01:42.030> things<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.360> he

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
me but there are some things that he

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.230 
me but there are some things that he
switched<00:01:42.930> around<00:01:43.520> because<00:01:44.520> he<00:01:44.610> did<00:01:44.759> talk<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
switched around because he did talk to a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.420 
switched around because he did talk to a
BenQ<00:01:45.960> tech<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.229> guess<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:49.560> will<00:01:50.130> put<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
BenQ tech I guess so I will put the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.340 
BenQ tech I guess so I will put the
settings<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.850> screen<00:01:51.180> picture<00:01:51.840> mode<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.200> want

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
settings on screen picture mode you want

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.889 
settings on screen picture mode you want
to<00:01:52.409> have<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> dumb<00:01:52.740> movie<00:01:53.210> some<00:01:54.210> people<00:01:54.479> prefer

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
to have a dumb movie some people prefer

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.230 
to have a dumb movie some people prefer
to<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> real<00:01:56.399> time<00:01:56.430> strategy<00:01:57.090> or

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
to have it on the real time strategy or

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.469 
to have it on the real time strategy or
the<00:01:57.360> RTS<00:01:57.780> settings<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:59.189> don't<00:01:59.610> really<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the RTS settings I don't really know the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.080 
the RTS settings I don't really know the
difference<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:01.320> be<00:02:01.409> honest<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.009> had<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.969> in

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
difference to be honest I had it in

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.010 
difference to be honest I had it in
photo<00:02:03.450> which<00:02:03.719> was<00:02:04.320> awful<00:02:04.829> because<00:02:04.979> it

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
photo which was awful because it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.600 
photo which was awful because it
it<00:02:07.020> doesn't<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.560> guess<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.039> refresh<00:02:08.369> rate<00:02:08.580> is

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
it doesn't I guess the refresh rate is

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.999 
it doesn't I guess the refresh rate is
dulled<00:02:08.970> down<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.629> photo<00:02:10.259> mode<00:02:10.379> so<00:02:10.800> I'm<00:02:10.860> not

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
dulled down in photo mode so I'm not

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.630 
dulled down in photo mode so I'm not
really<00:02:11.190> too<00:02:11.400> sure

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
really too sure

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.850 
really too sure
just<00:02:12.360> put<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.780> movie

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
just put it in movie

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.430 
just put it in movie
at<00:02:14.220> 75<00:02:14.820> so<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.270> can<00:02:15.510> adjust<00:02:15.900> your<00:02:16.020> in-game

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
at 75 so you can adjust your in-game

contrast<00:02:30.510> at<00:02:30.630> fifty<00:02:30.990> sharpness<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.770> had<00:02:31.950> really

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
contrast at fifty sharpness I had really

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.970 
contrast at fifty sharpness I had really
low<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:33.060> made<00:02:33.810> things<00:02:34.020> blend<00:02:34.470> together<00:02:34.620> too

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
low I made things blend together too

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.770 
low I made things blend together too
much<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.430> having<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.910> at<00:02:36.030> seven<00:02:36.420> was<00:02:36.540> pretty

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
much so having it at seven was pretty

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.000 
much so having it at seven was pretty
good<00:02:36.930> that's<00:02:37.860> what<00:02:38.100> he<00:02:38.250> suggested<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:40.010> black

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
good that's what he suggested and black

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.500 
good that's what he suggested and black
equalizer<00:02:41.490> at<00:02:41.670> ten<00:02:41.910> it<00:02:42.030> goes<00:02:42.180> all<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.330> way<00:02:42.390> up

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
of them at fifty I'm not too sure if

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.860 
of them at fifty I'm not too sure if
that<00:03:01.739> he<00:03:02.130> didn't<00:03:02.520> give<00:03:02.850> me<00:03:03.060> numbers<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.750> that

that he didn't give me numbers for that

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.540 
that he didn't give me numbers for that

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
so I'm not too sure if that's correct or

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.900 
so I'm not too sure if that's correct or
not

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
not

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.520 
not
though<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.720> might<00:03:06.930> be<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.230> setting<00:03:07.500> that

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530
