that's<00:00:51.559> been<00:00:51.770> stopped<00:00:52.280> down<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:52.969> chewed<00:00:53.539> up

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
that's been stopped down and chewed up

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.740 
that's been stopped down and chewed up
pretty<00:00:54.020> good<00:00:54.309> compared<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:55.699> other<00:00:56.329> stuff

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
pretty good compared to the other stuff

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.090 
pretty good compared to the other stuff
on<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.050> far<00:00:57.260> right<00:00:57.500> there<00:00:57.530> where<00:00:57.860> I<00:00:57.890> haven't

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
on the far right there where I haven't

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.869 
on the far right there where I haven't
put<00:00:58.370> them<00:00:58.489> yet

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
put them yet

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.790 
put them yet
I<00:00:58.910> basically<00:00:59.629> just<00:01:00.079> keep<00:01:00.230> moving<00:01:00.590> them<00:01:00.710> around

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
I basically just keep moving them around

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.700 
I basically just keep moving them around
I'll<00:01:01.670> leave<00:01:01.850> them<00:01:01.969> in<00:01:02.090> there<00:01:02.239> for<00:01:02.449> about<00:01:02.780> an

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
I'll leave them in there for about an

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.010 
I'll leave them in there for about an
hour<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.339> then<00:01:04.430> I'll<00:01:04.549> move<00:01:04.670> them<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.299> spot

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
hour and then I'll move them to a spot

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.830 
hour and then I'll move them to a spot
to<00:01:06.350> Jason<00:01:06.830> that<00:01:07.040> way<00:01:08.000> they<00:01:08.210> just<00:01:08.479> keep<00:01:08.659> eating

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
to Jason that way they just keep eating

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.100 
to Jason that way they just keep eating
and<00:01:09.260> keep<00:01:09.560> pooping<00:01:09.979> on<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.189> ground<00:01:10.430> which<00:01:11.110> you

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
and keep pooping on the ground which you

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.740 
and keep pooping on the ground which you
get<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.380> graphs<00:01:12.680> maybe<00:01:13.640> about<00:01:13.939> two<00:01:14.180> weeks<00:01:14.420> of

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
get the graphs maybe about two weeks of

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.410 
get the graphs maybe about two weeks of
recovery<00:01:15.049> time<00:01:15.530> tops<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.729> then<00:01:17.060> you<00:01:17.150> can<00:01:17.299> put

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
recovery time tops and then you can put

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.429 
recovery time tops and then you can put
them<00:01:17.509> right<00:01:17.630> back<00:01:17.780> where<00:01:17.990> they<00:01:18.110> were<00:01:18.140> and

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
them right back where they were and

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.080 
them right back where they were and
eventually<00:01:18.860> what<00:01:19.040> should<00:01:19.400> happen<00:01:19.580> here<00:01:19.939> is

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
eventually what should happen here is

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.899 
eventually what should happen here is
that<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.380> soil<00:01:21.380> quality<00:01:22.040> will<00:01:22.250> improve<00:01:22.280> to

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
that the soil quality will improve to

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.370 
that the soil quality will improve to
the<00:01:22.939> point<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.450> where<00:01:23.600> I<00:01:23.630> can<00:01:23.930> grow<00:01:24.080> stuff

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
the point to where I can grow stuff

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.890 
the point to where I can grow stuff
other<00:01:24.650> than<00:01:24.890> grass<00:01:25.130> on<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.240> patch<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.659> Grant

play<00:01:50.180> around<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:50.899> do<00:01:51.530> whatever<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:52.040> is<00:01:52.130> that

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
play around and do whatever it is that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.429 
play around and do whatever it is that
they're<00:01:52.460> going<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.729> do<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.780> do<00:01:53.960> need<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.290> watch

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
they're going to do you do need to watch

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.380 
they're going to do you do need to watch
out<00:01:54.740> for<00:01:54.770> digging<00:01:55.430> because<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.060> rabbits

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
out for digging because the rabbits

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.480 
out for digging because the rabbits
natural<00:01:56.930> instinct<00:01:57.409> is<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.740> dig<00:01:57.950> once<00:01:58.280> they're

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
natural instinct is to dig once they're

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.120 
natural instinct is to dig once they're
touching<00:01:58.850> soil<00:01:59.229> so<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.259> pretty<00:02:00.530> much<00:02:00.619> just<00:02:00.770> hang

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
touching soil so I pretty much just hang

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.030 
touching soil so I pretty much just hang
out<00:02:01.280> outside<00:02:01.509> keep<00:02:02.509> an<00:02:02.659> eye<00:02:02.750> on<00:02:02.810> them<00:02:03.140> do<00:02:03.829> some

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
out outside keep an eye on them do some

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.649 
out outside keep an eye on them do some
stuff<00:02:04.250> around<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.640> yard<00:02:04.850> and<00:02:05.090> check<00:02:05.329> up<00:02:05.509> on

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
stuff around the yard and check up on

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.880 
stuff around the yard and check up on
them<00:02:05.810> every<00:02:06.020> couple<00:02:06.140> minutes<00:02:06.560> make<00:02:06.740> sure

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
them every couple minutes make sure

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.110 
them every couple minutes make sure
nobody's<00:02:07.250> escaped<00:02:07.700> with<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.840> cage<00:02:09.080> here<00:02:09.500> the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
nobody's escaped with this cage here the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.510 
nobody's escaped with this cage here the
holes<00:02:11.349> and<00:02:12.349> between<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.770> green<00:02:12.950> wire<00:02:13.129> we're

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
holes and between the green wire we're

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.960 
holes and between the green wire we're
just

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
just

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.970 
just
a little<00:02:14.270> bit<00:02:14.420> too<00:02:14.660> big<00:02:14.990> the<00:02:15.290> way<00:02:15.410> I<00:02:15.440> purchased

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
a little bit too big the way I purchased

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.220 
a little bit too big the way I purchased
it<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.430> bought<00:02:16.580> this<00:02:16.820> thing<00:02:17.090> for<00:02:17.300> about<00:02:17.480> $20

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
it and I bought this thing for about $20

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.470 
it and I bought this thing for about $20
at<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.590> feed<00:02:18.890> store<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.550> pretty<00:02:20.150> good<00:02:20.360> investment

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
at a feed store a pretty good investment

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.090 
at a feed store a pretty good investment
in<00:02:20.990> my<00:02:21.110> opinion<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.590> could<00:02:21.680> probably<00:02:21.860> build

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
in my opinion you could probably build

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.210 
in my opinion you could probably build
one<00:02:22.400> yourself<00:02:23.360> for<00:02:23.570> cheaper<00:02:23.960> but<00:02:24.230> it's<00:02:24.980> one<00:02:25.100> of

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
one yourself for cheaper but it's one of

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.100 
one yourself for cheaper but it's one of
those<00:02:25.340> times<00:02:25.730> where<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:26.870> pay<00:02:27.080> for

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
those times where you just pay for

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.920 
those times where you just pay for
something<00:02:27.500> because<00:02:28.220> your<00:02:28.430> time<00:02:28.670> is<00:02:28.730> your<00:02:29.660> time

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
something because your time is your time

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.540 
something because your time is your time
and<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:30.530> other<00:02:30.740> stuff<00:02:30.860> to<00:02:31.070> do<00:02:31.250> with<00:02:31.400> it

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
and you have other stuff to do with it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.140 
and you have other stuff to do with it
so<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:32.540> went<00:02:32.870> ahead<00:02:32.960> and<00:02:33.140> ran<00:02:33.290> some

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
so I just went ahead and ran some

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.780 
so I just went ahead and ran some
chicken<00:02:35.150> wire<00:02:35.300> around<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.640> fastened<00:02:37.640> that

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
chicken wire around it and fastened that

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.490 
chicken wire around it and fastened that
to<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.330> that's<00:02:38.480> prevents<00:02:39.110> these<00:02:39.200> little

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
to it and that's prevents these little

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.050 
to it and that's prevents these little
guys<00:02:39.590> from<00:02:39.860> being<00:02:40.070> able<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.280> get<00:02:40.400> get<00:02:40.910> out

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
guys from being able to get get out

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.350 
guys from being able to get get out
because<00:02:41.300> much<00:02:41.630> like<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:42.310> mouse<00:02:43.310> or<00:02:43.670> rat<00:02:43.730> or

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
because much like a mouse or rat or

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.730 
because much like a mouse or rat or
something<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.960> if<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.200> rabbit<00:02:45.470> can<00:02:45.590> get

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
something like that if a rabbit can get

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.860 
something like that if a rabbit can get
its<00:02:45.860> head<00:02:46.040> through<00:02:46.310> and<00:02:46.700> opening<00:02:47.630> there's<00:02:47.810> a

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
its head through and opening there's a

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.120 
its head through and opening there's a
pretty<00:02:48.110> good<00:02:48.290> chance<00:02:48.350> it's<00:02:48.770> going<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.980> be<00:02:49.070> able

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
pretty good chance it's going to be able

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.590 
pretty good chance it's going to be able
to<00:02:49.220> squeeze<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.610> rest<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.880> its<00:02:50.000> body<00:02:50.180> through

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
to squeeze the rest of its body through

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.240 
to squeeze the rest of its body through
at<00:02:51.050> least<00:02:51.110> when<00:02:51.590> they're<00:02:51.709> young

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
at least when they're young

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.520 
at least when they're young
all<00:02:52.760> these<00:02:53.030> girls<00:02:53.240> in<00:02:53.510> here<00:02:54.020> they're<00:02:54.290> right

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
all these girls in here they're right

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.199 
all these girls in here they're right
about<00:02:54.770> two<00:02:55.010> months<00:02:55.370> old<00:02:55.490> so<00:02:55.760> they<00:02:55.880> got<00:02:56.030> about

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
about two months old so they got about

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.590 
about two months old so they got about
two<00:02:56.450> more<00:02:56.660> months<00:02:56.870> until<00:02:58.360> they're<00:02:59.360> heading

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
two more months until they're heading

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.350 
two more months until they're heading
for<00:02:59.630> the<00:03:00.200> freezer<00:03:00.470> camp<00:03:00.830> so<00:03:01.670> they're<00:03:02.150> going<00:03:02.300> to

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
for the freezer camp so they're going to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.240 
for the freezer camp so they're going to
increase<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.990> size<00:03:03.020> quite<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.530> bit<00:03:03.740> between<00:03:04.100> now

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
increase in size quite a bit between now

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.070 
increase in size quite a bit between now
and<00:03:04.280> then<00:03:04.520> and<00:03:04.790> then<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.510> chicken<00:03:05.690> wire<00:03:05.900> won't

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
and then and then the chicken wire won't

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.150 
and then and then the chicken wire won't
be<00:03:06.260> really<00:03:06.590> necessary<00:03:07.130> however<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:09.130> plan<00:03:10.130> on

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
be really necessary however I plan on

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.180 
be really necessary however I plan on
continually<00:03:11.030> cycling<00:03:11.570> new<00:03:12.320> younger<00:03:12.680> rabbits

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
continually cycling new younger rabbits

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.070 
continually cycling new younger rabbits
through<00:03:13.430> here<00:03:13.640> so<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.660> was<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.930> necessary

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
through here so it was the necessary

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.410 
through here so it was the necessary
thing<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.740> needed<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.040> be<00:03:16.130> done<00:03:16.370> anyway<00:03:17.180> I

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
thing that needed to be done anyway I

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.000 
thing that needed to be done anyway I
hope<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:17.840> guys<00:03:17.989> enjoyed<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.470> video<00:03:18.560> and
