00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.130
 the dairy industry in Brazil has grown significantly 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.040
 making it a good business opportunity 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.570
 however, they require structures and equipment of high investment by 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.030
 part of the entrepreneur making this option impossible for many small producers 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.420
 thus being one of the outputs for these entrepreneurs and even for the middle and 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.710
 large size is the manufacture of yogurt milk sweet drink of milk 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.260
 Cream cheese 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.130
 these products can be produced with simpler equipment structures and 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.100
 high yield since all milk used in the system is 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.840
 transformed into final product 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.200
 allied to this fact these products have presented in the last decades the 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.420
 increase in consumption 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.290
 by practically all social classes in all regions of Brazil 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.420
 for this importance cpt signed an agreement with the department of 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.460
 food technology of the Federal University of ViÃ§osa for the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.980
 of this course 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.100
 let's know along this course making the yogurt 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.880
 dairy drink 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.909
 of creamy curd and milk candy plus a homemade video dairy 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.590
 presenting the main techniques of cheese production and other products 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.870
 milk derivatives 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.990
 it is worth noting that the first course in the series entitled 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.010
 and quality control is essential for you to know 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.190
 the standards for installation and equipment etienne fundamental elements for 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.529
 making any complaint 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:24.139
 In addition, this introductory video introduces 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.139
 production of any type of diet 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.599
 this work was coordinated by the doctor celia lucia terreira 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.459
 Professor at Federal University of ViÃ§osa 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.459
 and consultant of several assassinations in all Brazil 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.179
 before we started manufacturing the products 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.699
 we will see some of the hygiene care that is fundamental 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:58.699
 to achieve good manufacturing practices 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.209
 when arriving at the dairy the operators must always carry out the personal hygiene 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.209
 beginning by washing the boots 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.950
 they should be explained 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.790
 using people until the complete withdrawal of all societies 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:30.909
 now the hands should also be explained with special attention 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.909
 blue lines 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.939
 then sanitizing solution must be passed 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.129
 before starting the tank and must be rinsed under running water for 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.459
 inside and out 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:54.430
 then 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.980
 pass the acidic solution prepared throughout its surface giving 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.500
 especially with the corners and registers
