 the stage session the spectators 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.419
 it goes as if it was appreciated to see elsewhere 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.729
 and 14 to the youngest m hayes party 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:17.439

 his presence in Japan last week 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.500
 it's like you want to be on stage and that's because this trial 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
 can say and Hebrew make believe a rotting 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.680
 in fact in the lace 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.719
 pello nature of the art of the culture of consenting people 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.729
 but caution is grounding is the only slow structure that that 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.069
 every night it's exactly the same thing you never know afterwards 

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:46.530
 in different areas I came to sit different life 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.380
 a different atmosphere different people from elsewhere 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.190
 the elderly and I was younger yellow and green finally for 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.150
 defend 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.390
 and if you had 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.360
 I know this source 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 They are magnificent 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.660
 m 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.910
 unfortunately not hand in the restaurant we did a good show in question the 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.760
 methods we will come all the names of the banks several days judge you are 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.090
 adopted - that's if you ever have room 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.740
 in a room a cupboard a kitchen I'm ready for anything for the money or 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.770
 even if it is necessary 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.770
 I love to live in Nantes 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.620
 with on stage 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.090
 karzai charest 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.430
 at the break 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.340
 it's this way 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.570
 it's still very surprising 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.090
 and thanks to his death in 1970 that lack the frame in the heart of this world 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.370
 all the failures 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.290
 we manage to equalize if it happens for me it's the most logical 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.910
 called to pick one-of-a-kind map in two places people are 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.540
 dead number of friends in France 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.560

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.740
 Tuesday already another probe I'm ringing 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.610
 the psychological threshold of 20 euros 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.930

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.770

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.549
 I say that these are problems with the police with elected officials on his 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.050
 position a month ago 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.440
 you have to be more focused to troubleshoot for that you have to be 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.239
 together 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.769
 Thursday for now it's France from below but especially France to 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.459
 side 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.939
 the France we love 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.169
 it is too long 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:23.629
 he opens his doors open 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.079
