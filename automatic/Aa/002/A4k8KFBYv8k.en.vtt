00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.440
 valuing the beauty would be very welcome 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.090
 to the video channel of speedometers that 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.920
 started in today's machine shop 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:21.000
 Monday , September 9 , quite a lot 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.470
 heat here at home once it here 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.400
 here in front of us we have a fiat 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.570
 canopy 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.630
 equipped with 1.0 16v valves engine 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.730
 motorzinho and cool ball show 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.680
 having a maintenance they would have used a 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.420
 good care 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.309
 the timing belt and 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.739
 cooling 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.329
 I do not have to give problem 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.399
 But, beauty, what 's the problem with school? 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.499
 here is the neighboring country that has a 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.420
 problem in fuel marking 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:53.499
 and for those who already accompany our channel 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.829
 The longer you've seen there in another neighborhood 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:59.199
 white river what was done in this 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.789
 have been made and such 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:06.900
 to the pump module is following the 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:10.119
 This car's pump mode is here. 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.920
 they will replace who did the maintenance 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.549
 replaced it 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.890
 Level sensor with mark well xing 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.759
 ling of life but okay with the sensor 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.469
 new level and one unit of 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.979
 cushion that is that 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:30.039
 white pecan there for those who have straw and 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.829
 I already work with the line anyway 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.079
 unit is located on top of the 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.920
 and has an automatic with 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.900
 four children for her 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.820
 she is responsible for not letting the 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.890
 content will flicker in the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.380
 what the car is in motion 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.939
 fuel in the tank 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.180
 The lip is obviously always 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.490
 following is the level of fuel 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.479
 if it did not have that part in the case of this 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.530
 father here 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.780
 the pointer ezinho there in the marker would be 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.920
 monitoring the level of fuel 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.110
 quiet 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:11.300
 That piece there, it's ok, that's right. 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:14.390
 now this sensor is not only the 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.120
 watermark hell 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.690
 It's still not the order he's from another 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.220
 pallium not let what we 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.420
 we will pass the budget of the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.610
 client in the value of the new piece then 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.120
 have to be replaced once again 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:38.360
 corresponding to this module to this 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:44.900
 panel here which is the complete panel 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.900
 show you can get a focus 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:58.130
 then this is the complete roll of the line and 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.170
 it needs another level sensor 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.090
 beauty so the piece is in the hand of the 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.360
 authorized pulling client 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.840
 I'll show you the difference of 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.200
 a first-line piece to one of 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.460
 30th the line starts here and shows 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.940
 you there all the other details and 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:23.520
 now symbolized level sensor 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.150
 brand of de braz 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.020
 here is his mark mark that 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:35.550
 lately I've been pleasing the sensors 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:39.390
 good quality is quite straightforward more 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.900
 quiet now not only this information 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.850
 that the reason for an empty tank appears 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.660
 the favela is decreasing 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.660
 we will filling 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.200
 and here we have a full tank we have 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.730
 one piece working perfectly 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.620
 now hold the camera a little bit 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:04.410
 I on the bench sensor change is 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.060
 looking at this frozen vision now 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.060
 we turned my voice back 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.930
 Alvaro Beauty 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:26.620
 now with the old sensor connected good 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.620
 here they go put out with 5 a hand only 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.700
 I think so 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.700
 It was a half hour I can put 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.750
 freezing the 90's camera 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.760
 beauty 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:05:02.039
 now I see resistance evaluation that 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:02.039
 your sensor ovens short 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.060
 those 280 that appear the child 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:17.559
 it would be an empty tank in this sensor 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.599
 then it comes in smell and sandwiches 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:23.029
 to s40 that would be the full tank 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:25.610
 if it marks 280 for an empty tank 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:31.610
 while this sensor here is the 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:35.089
 verify the mark 420 when the 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.830
 cigarettes team based on the 280 of the 

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:40.460
 sensor you were before it will mark 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.379
 as if he had a tank room and 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.719
 our people will be committed that is the 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.830
 what's going to happen? what's going to be done? 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:50.870
 Now let's get the brazed sensors. 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.399
 install it here in the module put the 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.479
 electronic damping unit in 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.979
 up again 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.139
 install in the car and everything will be 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:59.380
 working was a look here in the 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.430
 his tank 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.560
 I do not know if I can show much 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.010
 good for you 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:10.630
 for gasoline level is not going to have 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:14.360
 way to catch look at suggest in the background it 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:18.080
 and it has a little less than a quarter 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.590
 I think so, so we'll see if 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.160
 will match what our 11 will get 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:29.080
 the athlete is already regularized 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.850
 our father who is already mounted straight 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.010
 show you part of the bank that 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:40.370
 cross in the place again, right? 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:42.340
 all right he would not have much to 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.850
 show different right 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:49.840
 but that's it detail our marker 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.840
 fuel here on the left 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.200
 before I wanted to show before I 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.900
 I just forgot, but I know how to 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:01.790
 linked key # 6 was rolled 3 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:04.889
 and look at the difference now now it marks 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:08.879
 more or less like a room 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:10.379
 a little over a quarter of a 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:12.660
 Brazil is befitting who in 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:14.970
 tank right 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.590
 and okay fixed our problem before 

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.030
 when he came around the pointer a 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.700
 little further down 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:24.150
 the customer ran out of fuel was 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:27.530
 that was bothering him now and 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:31.020
 no longer bothers skinned beauty 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:35.970
 one more is solved with an exchange of 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:39.000
 sensors and the installation of the 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:41.700
 your Jorge was adequate but everything was already 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.730
 Correct everything, but a little country. 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:47.220
 save kir last day the speedometer 

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.310
 come on you know who likes like there 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.690
 share subscribe to our channel 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.260
 fox and mickey of today is getting by 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:56.000
 on here 

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.000
 big hug used until the next
