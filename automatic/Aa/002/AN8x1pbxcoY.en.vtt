gradually increase it's just kind of a
solid<00:01:28.130> line<00:01:28.760> right<00:01:29.150> there<00:01:31.180> for<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.240> lot<00:01:32.570> of

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
solid line right there for a lot of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.670 
solid line right there for a lot of
reasons<00:01:33.140> she<00:01:33.440> would<00:01:33.740> be<00:01:33.950> my<00:01:34.130> favorite<00:01:34.479> but<00:01:35.680> for

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
reasons she would be my favorite but for

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.490 
reasons she would be my favorite but for
some<00:01:37.460> important<00:01:37.940> reasons<00:01:38.330> she<00:01:38.510> is<00:01:38.600> not<00:01:38.840> I've

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
some important reasons she is not I've

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.530 
some important reasons she is not I've
never<00:01:39.770> had<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> model<00:01:40.490> model<00:01:40.760> wait<00:01:40.909> before<00:01:41.090> um

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
never had a model model wait before um

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.990 
never had a model model wait before um
but<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.500> can<00:01:42.650> honestly<00:01:42.710> say<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:43.700> hair

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
but I can honestly say that this hair

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.420 
but I can honestly say that this hair
texture<00:01:44.630> is<00:01:44.780> really<00:01:44.960> different<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.680> I

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
texture is really different and I

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.520 
texture is really different and I
haven't<00:01:46.700> decided<00:01:46.970> if<00:01:47.330> it's<00:01:47.570> different<00:01:48.049> good

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
haven't decided if it's different good

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.020 
haven't decided if it's different good
or<00:01:48.860> different<00:01:48.920> bad<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:50.750> just<00:01:51.500> seems<00:01:52.030> softer

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
or different bad it just seems softer

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.390 
or different bad it just seems softer
think<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.720> lot<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.110> other<00:01:54.229> ones<00:01:54.530> but<00:01:54.740> at<00:01:55.190> the

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
think a lot of the other ones but at the

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.240 
think a lot of the other ones but at the
same<00:01:55.610> token<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:56.150> haven't<00:01:56.510> had<00:01:56.690> in<00:01:56.869> light<00:01:57.080> of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
same token I haven't had in light of

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.530 
same token I haven't had in light of
tangling<00:01:58.250> just<00:01:58.640> yet<00:01:58.850> but<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.119> haven't<00:01:59.330> actually

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.810 
that I have is okay so you saw the
picture<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:06.680> it's<00:02:07.040> supposed<00:02:07.280> to<00:02:07.340> be<00:02:07.460> layered

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
picture and it's supposed to be layered

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.280 
picture and it's supposed to be layered
and<00:02:08.439> it<00:02:09.439> would<00:02:09.560> kind<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.129> appear<00:02:10.489> to<00:02:10.670> be<00:02:10.819> but<00:02:11.629> if

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
and it would kind of appear to be but if

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.839 
and it would kind of appear to be but if
I<00:02:12.530> show<00:02:12.799> you<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.750> just<00:02:15.260> pulled<00:02:15.500> this<00:02:15.849> which

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
I show you so I just pulled this which

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.360 
I show you so I just pulled this which
is<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> really<00:02:17.300> long<00:02:17.420> piece<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.770> right<00:02:18.950> under

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
is a really long piece and right under

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.760 
is a really long piece and right under
it

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
it

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.190 
it
it's<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.920> lot<00:02:21.100> shorter<00:02:21.510> so<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.690> means<00:02:22.930> this

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
it's a lot shorter so that means this

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.030 
it's a lot shorter so that means this
long<00:02:23.530> piece<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:25.270> sitting<00:02:25.630> on<00:02:25.750> top<00:02:25.810> of<00:02:26.350> this

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
long piece is sitting on top of this

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.160 
long piece is sitting on top of this
short<00:02:27.370> piece<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:30.420> mean<00:02:31.420> basically<00:02:31.630> we<00:02:32.050> all

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
short piece so I mean basically we all

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.690 
short piece so I mean basically we all
know<00:02:32.350> layers<00:02:32.620> don't<00:02:32.890> work<00:02:33.070> like<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.310> they

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
know layers don't work like that they

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.020 
know layers don't work like that they
don't<00:02:33.730> love<00:02:34.060> him<00:02:34.270> shorter<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.870> longer<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:36.820> when

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
don't love him shorter to longer so when

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.630 
don't love him shorter to longer so when
you<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:38.020> when<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.290> falls<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:39.010> looks<00:02:39.220> like<00:02:39.430> there

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
you so when it falls it looks like there

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.210 
you so when it falls it looks like there
to<00:02:39.790> hold<00:02:39.970> see<00:02:40.900> how<00:02:41.080> that's<00:02:41.620> kind<00:02:41.770> of<00:02:42.010> nicely

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
to hold see how that's kind of nicely

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.700 
to hold see how that's kind of nicely
layers<00:02:42.640> right<00:02:43.210> there<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.660> then<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.960> falls

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
layers right there and then that falls

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.980 
layers right there and then that falls
on<00:02:44.920> top<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:46.320> um<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.730> cut<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:49.270> bad<00:02:49.660> I

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
on top of it um so the cut is bad I

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.760 
on top of it um so the cut is bad I
don't<00:02:50.380> know<00:02:50.470> if<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.680> got<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.890> bad<00:02:51.100> league<00:02:51.630> but

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
don't know if I got a bad league but

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.260 
don't know if I got a bad league but
that's<00:02:53.770> a<00:02:53.920> problem<00:02:54.190> because<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.670> hate<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.060> get<00:02:55.240> a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
that's a problem because I hate to get a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.960 
that's a problem because I hate to get a
wig<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.960> then<00:02:56.710> have<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.130> like<00:02:57.310> cut<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:57.760> or

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
wig and then have to like cut it or

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.670 
wig and then have to like cut it or
style<00:02:58.360> it<00:02:58.540> or<00:02:58.690> do<00:02:58.870> anything<00:02:59.080> because<00:02:59.410> if<00:02:59.590> I

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
style it or do anything because if I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.710 
style it or do anything because if I
wanted<00:02:59.920> a<00:03:00.010> curly<00:03:00.370> wig<00:03:00.520> I<00:03:00.730> would<00:03:01.150> bike<00:03:01.420> really

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
wanted a curly wig I would bike really

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.390 
wanted a curly wig I would bike really
wait<00:03:02.050> not<00:03:02.350> by<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> straight<00:03:02.860> way<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.220> have

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
wait not by a straight way that I have

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.000 
wait not by a straight way that I have
to<00:03:03.520> curl<00:03:03.700> so<00:03:04.630> that's<00:03:04.870> really<00:03:05.590> kind<00:03:05.920> of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
to curl so that's really kind of

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.790 
to curl so that's really kind of
annoying<00:03:06.250> I<00:03:06.780> probably<00:03:07.780> shouldn't<00:03:08.230> have<00:03:08.320> cut

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
annoying I probably shouldn't have cut

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.110 
annoying I probably shouldn't have cut
the<00:03:08.950> lace<00:03:09.070> I<00:03:09.250> probably<00:03:09.490> should<00:03:09.730> have<00:03:09.760> sent<00:03:10.000> it

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
the lace I probably should have sent it

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.490 
the lace I probably should have sent it
back<00:03:10.270> and<00:03:10.570> try<00:03:10.750> for<00:03:11.020> another<00:03:11.080> one<00:03:11.440> because

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
back and try for another one because

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.130 
back and try for another one because
maybe<00:03:11.830> i<00:03:12.070> just<00:03:12.160> got<00:03:12.520> a<00:03:12.550> bad<00:03:12.880> one<00:03:13.120> but<00:03:13.150> oh<00:03:14.730> well

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
maybe i just got a bad one but oh well

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.740 
maybe i just got a bad one but oh well
so<00:03:17.140> it's<00:03:17.410> just<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.860> long<00:03:18.640> piece<00:03:18.970> in<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.330> front

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
so it's just a long piece in the front

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.390 
so it's just a long piece in the front
it<00:03:20.020> just<00:03:20.350> shouldn't<00:03:20.530> be<00:03:20.800> longer<00:03:21.070> than<00:03:21.250> the

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
it just shouldn't be longer than the

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.080 
it just shouldn't be longer than the
rest<00:03:21.670> of<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:21.940> hair<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.120> mean<00:03:22.420> look<00:03:22.540> at<00:03:22.660> that<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
rest of the hair I mean look at that the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.170 
rest of the hair I mean look at that the
texture<00:03:25.570> is<00:03:25.600> really<00:03:25.900> nice<00:03:26.170> it's<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.490> very<00:03:27.910> nice

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
texture is really nice it's a very nice

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.900 
texture is really nice it's a very nice
believable<00:03:28.900> texture<00:03:29.490> because<00:03:30.490> there's<00:03:30.700> no

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
believable texture because there's no

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.060 
believable texture because there's no
framing<00:03:31.240> around<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.959> kind<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.500> pull<00:03:32.680> out<00:03:32.830> a

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
framing around it I kind of pull out a

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.610 
framing around it I kind of pull out a
lot<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.370> my<00:03:33.520> own<00:03:33.670> hair<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.660> leaves<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.050> bank<00:03:35.290> or

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
lot of my own hair it leaves the bank or

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.699 
lot of my own hair it leaves the bank or
shin<00:03:35.800> of<00:03:35.890> my<00:03:35.980> hair<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.400> leave<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.270> out<00:03:37.709> but

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
shin of my hair and leave that out but

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.440 
shin of my hair and leave that out but
this<00:03:39.959> if<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.800> way<00:03:42.040> cat<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.730> mean<00:03:43.000> it's<00:03:43.150> on<00:03:43.270> both

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
this if this way cat I mean it's on both

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.720 
this if this way cat I mean it's on both
sides<00:03:43.750> like<00:03:44.050> that<00:03:44.290> like<00:03:44.860> this<00:03:45.190> part<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:45.700> really

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
sides like that like this part is really

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.650 
sides like that like this part is really
long<00:03:46.240> and<00:03:46.980> part<00:03:47.980> behind<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.610> it's<00:03:49.150> just<00:03:49.390> less

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
long and part behind it it's just less

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.949 
long and part behind it it's just less
rare<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.540> um<00:03:53.910> what<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:54.940> have<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.180> cut<00:03:55.390> her<00:03:55.510> and

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
I'm going to have to put layers in her

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.220 
I'm going to have to put layers in her
in<00:03:59.170> order<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.650> kind<00:03:59.890> of<00:04:00.010> fix<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.489> problem<00:04:00.640> and

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
in order to kind of fix that problem and

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.140 
in order to kind of fix that problem and
then<00:04:02.230> maybe<00:04:02.440> after<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:02.860> she'll<00:04:03.520> be<00:04:03.550> okay<00:04:03.970> um

then maybe after that she'll be okay um
her<00:04:07.410> parting<00:04:09.000> is

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.330 

so<00:04:15.689> all<00:04:16.079> of<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.380> right<00:04:16.500> here<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.739> my<00:04:16.829> own<00:04:17.130> hair

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
so all of this right here is my own hair

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.750 
so all of this right here is my own hair
so<00:04:17.370> she<00:04:17.729> has<00:04:17.940> about<00:04:18.090> Angeles<00:04:19.549> right<00:04:20.549> there

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
so she has about Angeles right there

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.930 
so she has about Angeles right there
right<00:04:20.790> there<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:21.870> it's<00:04:22.350> this<00:04:23.040> way<00:04:23.340> just<00:04:23.699> X

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
right there and it's this way just X

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.070 
right there and it's this way just X
funny<00:04:24.360> like<00:04:24.990> it's<00:04:25.229> a<00:04:25.350> lace<00:04:25.560> front<00:04:25.860> but<00:04:27.080> it

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
funny like it's a lace front but it

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.990 
funny like it's a lace front but it
doesn't<00:04:28.560> really<00:04:28.710> like<00:04:29.070> for<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.520> move<00:04:29.760> it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
doesn't really like for you to move it

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.670 
doesn't really like for you to move it
and<00:04:30.030> even<00:04:30.300> when<00:04:30.539> you<00:04:30.600> do<00:04:30.930> you<00:04:31.169> still<00:04:31.440> can't

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
and even when you do you still can't

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.439 
and even when you do you still can't
really<00:04:31.979> see<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.550> there's<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.850> part<00:04:33.180> they're

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
really see that there's a part they're
