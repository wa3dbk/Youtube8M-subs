as<00:03:07.280> much<00:03:07.489> as<00:03:07.669> far<00:03:07.879> as<00:03:08.000> like<00:03:08.180> it's<00:03:08.900> an<00:03:09.109> everyday

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
as much as far as like it's an everyday

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.080 
as much as far as like it's an everyday
product<00:03:10.040> but<00:03:10.159> it's<00:03:10.280> not<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.430> foundation<00:03:10.819> where

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
product but it's not a foundation where

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.849 
product but it's not a foundation where
you're<00:03:11.209> putting<00:03:11.419> it<00:03:11.540> all<00:03:11.689> over<00:03:12.049> so<00:03:12.230> it's<00:03:12.650> going

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
you're putting it all over so it's going

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.039 
you're putting it all over so it's going
to<00:03:12.980> last<00:03:13.189> you<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.489> long<00:03:13.609> time<00:03:13.669> so<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.780> really

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
to last you a long time so I so I really

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.330 
to last you a long time so I so I really
like<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.260> I<00:03:15.439> know<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.739> price<00:03:15.950> point<00:03:16.159> is<00:03:16.310> a

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
like it I know the price point is a

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.670 
like it I know the price point is a
little<00:03:16.430> bit<00:03:16.699> higher<00:03:17.000> however<00:03:17.629> I<00:03:18.139> notice<00:03:18.560> with

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
little bit higher however I notice with

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.500 
little bit higher however I notice with
highlights<00:03:19.159> and<00:03:19.370> blushes<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.120> don't<00:03:20.269> use<00:03:20.389> it

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
highlights and blushes you don't use it

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.240 
highlights and blushes you don't use it
as<00:03:20.629> much<00:03:20.659> as<00:03:20.959> like<00:03:21.049> a<00:03:21.079> foundation<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.220> you

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
as much as like a foundation so you

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.530 
as much as like a foundation so you
should<00:03:22.579> probably<00:03:22.639> switch<00:03:22.909> over<00:03:23.389> with

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
should probably switch over with

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.780 
should probably switch over with
different<00:03:23.840> colors<00:03:24.199> and<00:03:24.409> so<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.069> think<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.400> $30

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
different colors and so I think the $30

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.640 
different colors and so I think the $30
price<00:03:25.940> point<00:03:26.269> is<00:03:26.389> quite<00:03:26.629> it's<00:03:27.019> a<00:03:27.079> great<00:03:27.349> gift

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
price point is quite it's a great gift

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.710 
price point is quite it's a great gift
so<00:03:28.430> if<00:03:28.760> you<00:03:29.060> guys<00:03:29.239> are<00:03:29.389> trying<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.599> buy
