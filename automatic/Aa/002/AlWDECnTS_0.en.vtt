00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
gonna have to prepare done is we're just

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.979 
gonna have to prepare done is we're just
clean<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.459> little<00:04:05.030> bit<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.239> debris<00:04:05.480> up<00:04:05.780> in<00:04:05.900> the

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
clean a little bit of debris up in the

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.000 
clean a little bit of debris up in the
hole<00:04:06.140> just<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:06.410> it<00:04:06.470> makes<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.680> little<00:04:06.860> bit

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
hole just so it makes a little bit

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.759 
hole just so it makes a little bit
easier<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.459> Nick<00:04:08.769> placing

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
easier to Nick placing

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.229 
easier to Nick placing
specially-designed<00:04:10.250> nipped<00:04:10.880> over<00:04:11.150> the

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
specially-designed nipped over the

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.300 
specially-designed nipped over the
rabbit<00:04:11.510> holes<00:04:11.750> ensures<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.590> rabbits<00:04:13.070> get

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
rabbit holes ensures that rabbits get

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.430 
rabbit holes ensures that rabbits get
tangled<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.000> trapped<00:04:14.390> in<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.690> net<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.410> it

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
tangled and trapped in the net so it

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.009 
tangled and trapped in the net so it
cannot<00:04:15.800> escape<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:17.060> rabbit<00:04:17.359> is<00:04:17.450> not<00:04:17.630> harmed

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
cannot escape the rabbit is not harmed

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.840 
cannot escape the rabbit is not harmed
in<00:04:18.169> this<00:04:18.290> process<00:04:18.769> and<00:04:18.950> makes<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.430> capture

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
in this process and makes the capture

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.510 
in this process and makes the capture
quite<00:04:20.269> easy<00:04:23.710> all<00:04:24.710> these<00:04:24.979> holes<00:04:25.220> so<00:04:25.400> I've

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
quite easy all these holes so I've

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.650 
quite easy all these holes so I've
knitted<00:04:25.729> about<00:04:26.030> maybe<00:04:26.260> 10<00:04:27.260> or<00:04:27.290> 11<00:04:27.560> holes<00:04:28.660> this

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
knitted about maybe 10 or 11 holes this

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.969 
knitted about maybe 10 or 11 holes this
is<00:04:29.720> quite<00:04:29.960> a<00:04:29.990> big<00:04:30.169> network<00:04:30.470> actually<00:04:30.800> so<00:04:30.889> I'm

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
is quite a big network actually so I'm

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.020 
is quite a big network actually so I'm
actually<00:04:31.100> hoping<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.580> get<00:04:31.700> two<00:04:31.910> or<00:04:32.000> three

actually hoping to get two or three
rabbits<00:04:32.479> out<00:04:32.600> of<00:04:32.750> this<00:04:32.840> Network<00:04:33.200> also<00:04:34.160> making

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
rabbits out of this Network also making

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.460 
rabbits out of this Network also making
sure<00:04:34.790> that<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.210> holes<00:04:35.540> which<00:04:35.690> Ruby<00:04:36.020> theme

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470
