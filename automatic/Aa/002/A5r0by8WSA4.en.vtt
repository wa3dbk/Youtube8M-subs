mark them along the top with a ruler and
there's<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.540> gadget<00:02:20.810> out<00:02:21.170> there<00:02:21.470> close<00:02:21.709> it

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
there's a gadget out there close it

there's a gadget out there close it
the<00:02:22.220> Markson<00:02:22.879> so<00:02:23.660> that's<00:02:24.140> one<00:02:24.410> thing<00:02:24.650> you

might want to take into account is
really<00:02:30.829> how<00:02:31.310> accurate<00:02:32.239> do<00:02:32.959> your<00:02:33.170> cane<00:02:33.590> slices

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
if you are making a cane cupboard pin

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.740 
if you are making a cane cupboard pin
and<00:02:42.319> you're<00:02:43.190> going<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.400> blend<00:02:43.640> all<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.329> Canes

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
and you're going to blend all the Canes

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.900 
and you're going to blend all the Canes
together<00:02:45.260> they<00:02:45.769> don't<00:02:45.980> necessarily<00:02:46.700> have<00:02:46.879> to

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
together they don't necessarily have to

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.190 
together they don't necessarily have to
be<00:02:47.180> that<00:02:47.450> accurate

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
be that accurate

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.160 
be that accurate
but<00:02:48.980> some<00:02:49.819> people<00:02:50.060> just<00:02:50.090> have<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.629> in<00:02:50.780> them<00:02:50.989> to

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
but some people just have it in them to

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.740

few<00:03:14.239> other<00:03:14.419> things<00:03:14.540> that<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:15.049> have<00:03:15.319> seen<00:03:15.620> are

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
few other things that I have seen are

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.659 
few other things that I have seen are
gadgets<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.810> hold<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.620> cane<00:03:18.859> people<00:03:19.489> use

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
gadgets that hold the cane people use

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.900 
gadgets that hold the cane people use
different<00:03:20.150> type<00:03:20.569> sizes<00:03:21.440> they<00:03:22.069> have<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.639> pipes

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
different type sizes they have the pipes

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.210 
different type sizes they have the pipes
cut<00:03:23.269> in<00:03:23.359> half<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.810> they<00:03:24.019> lay<00:03:24.230> their<00:03:24.530> canes<00:03:24.829> in

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.580 
cut in half and they lay their canes in
there<00:03:25.489> so<00:03:26.419> you<00:03:26.480> can<00:03:26.959> lay<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:27.349> cane<00:03:27.620> in<00:03:28.250> and

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
there so you can lay the cane in and

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.520 
there so you can lay the cane in and
slice<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.889> slices<00:03:31.430> off<00:03:31.790> like<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.419> we<00:03:33.349> have<00:03:33.500> a

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
slice the slices off like that we have a

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.470 
slice the slices off like that we have a
brand<00:03:33.980> new<00:03:34.190> bead<00:03:35.030> roller<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:36.340> I've<00:03:37.340> cheated<00:03:37.849> I

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
brand new bead roller and I've cheated I

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.150 
brand new bead roller and I've cheated I
always<00:03:38.930> say<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.109> think<00:03:39.230> this<00:03:39.410> one<00:03:39.560> fits<00:03:39.769> but<00:03:39.950> it

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
always say I think this one fits but it

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.210 
always say I think this one fits but it
comes<00:03:40.849> in<00:03:41.000> three<00:03:41.239> different<00:03:41.419> sizes<00:03:41.690> and<00:03:42.530> what

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
comes in three different sizes and what

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.000 
comes in three different sizes and what
you<00:03:43.370> can<00:03:43.579> do<00:03:43.819> is<00:03:44.180> put<00:03:44.780> your<00:03:44.900> cane<00:03:45.139> in<00:03:45.380> here<00:03:45.769> and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
you can do is put your cane in here and

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.009 
you can do is put your cane in here and

if you have different marks along the
side<00:03:48.410> of<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.650> cane<00:03:49.010> you<00:03:50.000> can<00:03:50.180> hold<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:50.540> cane

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
side of the cane you can hold the cane

00:03:50.960 --> 00:04:01.930 
side of the cane you can hold the cane
and<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.320> size<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.980> fits<00:03:53.710> too<00:03:54.710> far<00:04:00.880> and<00:04:01.880> just

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
and a size that fits too far and just

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.790 
and a size that fits too far and just

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
hold it and make the slices like this so

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.480 
hold it and make the slices like this so
that's<00:04:06.950> another<00:04:07.310> method<00:04:07.640> and<00:04:09.190> one<00:04:10.190> other

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
that's another method and one other

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.750 
that's another method and one other
thing<00:04:10.970> that<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.630> have<00:04:11.870> seen<00:04:12.170> done<00:04:12.560> is<00:04:14.350> Manan

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
thing that I have seen done is Manan

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.020 
thing that I have seen done is Manan
Schwarzenberg<00:04:16.760> will<00:04:17.720> hold<00:04:18.050> the<00:04:18.290> cane<00:04:18.590> and

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
Schwarzenberg will hold the cane and

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.630 
Schwarzenberg will hold the cane and
just<00:04:20.030> slice<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:21.020> slices<00:04:21.590> just<00:04:21.830> like<00:04:22.070> this

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
just slice the slices just like this

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.760 
just slice the slices just like this
I<00:04:22.670> don't<00:04:23.330> often<00:04:23.750> have<00:04:24.020> good<00:04:24.230> luck<00:04:24.440> that<00:04:24.620> one

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770

because you're controlling how hard
you're<00:04:40.040> pressing<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.880> blade<00:04:41.180> so<00:04:42.170> that's

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
you're pressing the blade so that's

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.700 
you're pressing the blade so that's
another<00:04:43.040> method<00:04:43.870> another<00:04:44.870> thing<00:04:45.320> that<00:04:45.680> people

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
another method another thing that people

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.800 
another method another thing that people
have<00:04:46.310> done<00:04:46.610> is<00:04:47.000> they<00:04:47.960> have<00:04:47.990> baked<00:04:48.500> their<00:04:48.950> canes

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
have done is they have baked their canes

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.850 
have done is they have baked their canes
before<00:04:50.810> they<00:04:50.960> slice<00:04:51.200> if<00:04:51.410> they<00:04:51.530> don't<00:04:51.710> take

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
before they slice if they don't take

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.260 
before they slice if they don't take
them<00:04:52.100> all<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.400> way<00:04:52.550> they<00:04:52.790> bake<00:04:53.030> them

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
them all the way they bake them

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.930 
them all the way they bake them
partially<00:04:53.590> I've<00:04:54.590> never<00:04:54.920> quite<00:04:55.280> figured<00:04:55.790> out

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
partially I've never quite figured out

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.660 
partially I've never quite figured out
how<00:04:56.000> they<00:04:56.540> take<00:04:56.840> a<00:04:57.080> partially<00:04:57.740> baked<00:04:57.950> cane<00:04:58.280> and

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
how they take a partially baked cane and

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.900 
how they take a partially baked cane and
put<00:04:58.880> it<00:04:59.000> around<00:04:59.150> around<00:04:59.660> bead<00:05:00.320> maybe<00:05:01.250> someone

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
put it around around bead maybe someone

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.170 
put it around around bead maybe someone

can comment once they see our little
video<00:05:05.720> up<00:05:06.140> and<00:05:06.410> the<00:05:07.250> other<00:05:07.460> thing<00:05:07.850> is<00:05:08.390> that
