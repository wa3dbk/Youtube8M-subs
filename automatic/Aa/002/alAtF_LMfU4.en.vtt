this<00:01:12.439> mode<00:01:12.799> may<00:01:13.520> opt<00:01:13.789> to<00:01:13.969> choose<00:01:14.389> a<00:01:14.689> higher<00:01:15.259> ISO

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
this mode may opt to choose a higher ISO

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.580 
this mode may opt to choose a higher ISO
which<00:01:16.460> means<00:01:16.789> the<00:01:17.509> colors<00:01:17.990> will<00:01:18.229> come<00:01:18.380> out<00:01:18.560> a

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
which means the colors will come out a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.039 
which means the colors will come out a
little<00:01:18.770> bit<00:01:18.979> more<00:01:19.130> grainy<00:01:19.459> than<00:01:19.700> you<00:01:19.789> want<00:01:20.049> so

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
little bit more grainy than you want so

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.219 
little bit more grainy than you want so
instead<00:01:21.560> of<00:01:21.619> doing<00:01:21.950> this<00:01:22.569> what<00:01:23.569> I<00:01:23.600> would<00:01:23.719> do<00:01:23.990> is

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
instead of doing this what I would do is

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.980 
instead of doing this what I would do is
just<00:01:24.439> keep<00:01:25.069> the<00:01:25.700> mode<00:01:25.939> dial<00:01:25.969> set<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.450> program

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
just keep the mode dial set to program

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.289 
just keep the mode dial set to program
we<00:01:27.679> normally<00:01:28.130> have<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:28.399> set<00:01:28.549> to<00:01:28.579> program<00:01:29.030> so

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
we normally have it set to program so

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.129 
we normally have it set to program so
this<00:01:29.509> is<00:01:29.689> easy

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:30.139 
this is easy

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:33.099 
this is easy
