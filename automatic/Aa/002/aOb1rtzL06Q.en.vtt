now<00:00:02.220> Bernard<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.669> going<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.850> do<00:00:02.970> something

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
now Bernard is going to do something

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.519 
now Bernard is going to do something
here<00:00:03.419> a<00:00:03.449> little<00:00:03.600> bit<00:00:03.750> different<00:00:04.170> we're<00:00:04.440> going

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
here a little bit different we're going

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.900 
here a little bit different we're going
to<00:00:04.620> take<00:00:04.770> advantage<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.460> fact<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.819> he

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
to take advantage of the fact that he

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.110 
to take advantage of the fact that he
can<00:00:06.180> use<00:00:06.359> more<00:00:06.629> weight<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.140> lower<00:00:07.919> we<00:00:08.700> put<00:00:08.940> we

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
can use more weight to lower we put we

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.730 
can use more weight to lower we put we
got<00:00:09.269> 50<00:00:09.630> pounds<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.050> weight<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.469> backpack

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
got 50 pounds of weight in this backpack

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.919 
got 50 pounds of weight in this backpack
here<00:00:11.250> so<00:00:11.400> there's<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.639> couple<00:00:11.820> 25<00:00:12.360> pound<00:00:12.630> plates

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
here so there's a couple 25 pound plates

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.060 
here so there's a couple 25 pound plates
and<00:00:14.660> he's<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.139> only<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.800> lowering

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
and he's going to do only the lowering

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.300 
and he's going to do only the lowering
only<00:00:17.520> phase<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.600> chin<00:00:18.840> up<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:19.619> possible

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
only phase of the chin up it's possible

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.179 
only phase of the chin up it's possible
to<00:00:20.550> run<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> strength<00:00:21.119> training<00:00:21.390> routine<00:00:21.869> in

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
to run a strength training routine in

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.429 
to run a strength training routine in
which<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.369> don't<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:23.730> any<00:00:24.029> weight<00:00:25.019> lifting

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
which you don't do any weight lifting

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.950 
which you don't do any weight lifting
you<00:00:25.710> do<00:00:25.830> only<00:00:26.099> lowering<00:00:26.699> only<00:00:26.939> exercise<00:00:27.390> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
you do only lowering only exercise and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.960 
you do only lowering only exercise and
that's<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.949> exercise<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that's what this exercise here this is

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720 
that's what this exercise here this is
lowering<00:00:30.300> only<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:30.869> negative<00:00:31.380> only<00:00:31.730> called

phase negative negative only chins and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.959 
phase negative negative only chins and
here<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.680> see<00:00:37.860> Bernard<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> a

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
here you see Bernard and this is a

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.090 
here you see Bernard and this is a
brutal<00:00:39.750> way<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.050> training<00:00:40.320> it's<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.710> very<00:00:41.040> very

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
brutal way of training it's a very very

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.979 
brutal way of training it's a very very
intense<00:00:41.670> way<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.059> training<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.480> intense<00:00:42.780> as

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
intense way of training is intense as

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.319 
intense way of training is intense as
you<00:00:43.079> saw<00:00:43.230> those<00:00:43.379> guys<00:00:43.559> leg<00:00:43.890> pressing<00:00:44.370> that's<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you saw those guys leg pressing that's a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
you saw those guys leg pressing that's a
more<00:00:45.600> intense<00:00:45.899> way<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.230> training<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.649> tension

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
more intense way of training the tension

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.750 
more intense way of training the tension
level<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> muscle<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.210> much<00:00:49.020> higher<00:00:49.760> we're

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
level on the muscle is much higher we're

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.740 
level on the muscle is much higher we're
not<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> talk<00:00:51.149> about<00:00:51.270> negative<00:00:51.539> only

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
not going to talk about negative only

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.090 
not going to talk about negative only
training<00:00:52.110> anymore<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.680> this<00:00:52.770> today<00:00:52.949> because

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
training anymore with this today because

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.319 
training anymore with this today because
there's<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> lot<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> subtleties<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.090> are

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
there's a lot of subtleties that are

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.729 
there's a lot of subtleties that are
involved<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.710> very

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
involved with it but it's a very

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.680 
involved with it but it's a very
effective<00:00:56.219> way<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> will<00:00:57.300> put<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
effective way and if you will put the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.090 
effective way and if you will put the
emphasis<00:00:58.079> on<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> lowering<00:00:58.590> phase<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:59.070> your

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
emphasis on the lowering phase in your

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.680 
emphasis on the lowering phase in your
strength<00:00:59.460> training<00:00:59.760> you'll<00:01:00.390> get<00:01:00.570> better

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
strength training you'll get better

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.780 
strength training you'll get better
results<00:01:00.899> from<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.320> strength<00:01:01.590> program<00:01:04.790> now

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790

the fourth rule when it comes to doing a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.660 
the fourth rule when it comes to doing a
repetition<00:01:07.860> properly<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
repetition properly is we want to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.330 
repetition properly is we want to
minimize<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.240> use<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> leverage<00:01:10.189> we've<00:01:11.189> all

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
minimize the use of leverage we've all

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.590 
minimize the use of leverage we've all
been<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.549> weight<00:01:11.790> rooms<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.270> you've<00:01:12.390> seen

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
been in weight rooms and you've seen

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600 
been in weight rooms and you've seen
guys<00:01:12.840> as<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.650> bench<00:01:13.860> press<00:01:14.189> throwing<00:01:14.520> their

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.080 
lean way back on it with these people
are<00:01:20.009> thinking<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.490> they're<00:01:20.610> supposed<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> do

are thinking that they're supposed to do
is<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.360> think<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> weights<00:01:21.990> are<00:01:22.229> just

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
is they think that the weights are just

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.640 
is they think that the weights are just
supposed<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.920> go<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.270> down<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:25.259> long<00:01:25.560> as

supposed to go up and down as long as

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.420 
supposed to go up and down as long as
the<00:01:25.710> weights<00:01:25.830> are<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.369> down

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the weights are going up and down

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.800 
the weights are going up and down
something's<00:01:26.939> happening<00:01:27.330> no<00:01:27.420> matter<00:01:27.450> what

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
something's happening no matter what

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
something's happening no matter what
happens<00:01:27.990> there<00:01:28.439> let's<00:01:29.400> take<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.579> look<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
happens there let's take a look a bit of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.910 
happens there let's take a look a bit of
an<00:01:30.240> extreme<00:01:30.720> example<00:01:30.869> leverage<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.829> with

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
an extreme example leverage it here with

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.910 
an extreme example leverage it here with
Bernard<00:01:35.329> taking<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> curl<00:01:36.710> he's<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:37.860> to

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
Bernard taking the curl he's going to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.249 
Bernard taking the curl he's going to
lean<00:01:38.100> way<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:40.549> now<00:01:41.630> Bernards<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.810> lifting

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
lean way back now Bernards not lifting

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.010 
lean way back now Bernards not lifting
that<00:01:43.380> weight<00:01:43.439> into<00:01:43.860> position<00:01:44.280> he<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:45.020> shifting

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
with Archimedes principle right if I

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.330 
with Archimedes principle right if I
have<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> long<00:01:52.590> enough<00:01:52.799> lever<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.130> place<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
have a long enough lever and a place to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.700 
have a long enough lever and a place to
stand<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.970> lift<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> world<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.530> same

thing<00:01:55.740> happens<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.369> weight<00:01:56.520> room<00:01:56.729> it

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
thing happens in a weight room it

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.539 
thing happens in a weight room it
doesn't<00:01:57.960> matter<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.979> weight<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.430> this

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
doesn't matter what this weight on this

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
doesn't matter what this weight on this
bar<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.880> what<00:02:00.600> matters<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.170> what<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
bar is what matters is what the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.480 
bar is what matters is what the
effective<00:02:02.040> tension<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.670> muscle<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:04.490> guys

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
effective tension in this muscle is guys

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.789 
effective tension in this muscle is guys
think<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.329> moving<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> weight<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.649> down

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
think that moving the weight up and down

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.680 
think that moving the weight up and down
is<00:02:08.069> all<00:02:08.610> that's<00:02:08.819> supposed<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.179> happen<00:02:09.330> that's

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
is all that's supposed to happen that's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.720 
is all that's supposed to happen that's
kind<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:10.020> John<00:02:10.319> Wooden's<00:02:10.739> saying<00:02:11.099> don't

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
kind of like John Wooden's saying don't

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.500 
kind of like John Wooden's saying don't
mistake<00:02:11.849> activity<00:02:12.629> for<00:02:12.840> achievement

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
mistake activity for achievement

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.000 
mistake activity for achievement
and<00:02:15.510> those<00:02:15.870> look<00:02:16.020> at<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.290> that's<00:02:16.680> kind<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and those look at that that's kind of a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.170 
and those look at that that's kind of a
powerful<00:02:17.370> statement<00:02:17.520> cuz<00:02:17.819> it's<00:02:17.940> got<00:02:18.060> an

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
powerful statement cuz it's got an

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.610 
powerful statement cuz it's got an
application<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> lot<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.110> things<00:02:19.319> in<00:02:19.530> your

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
application to a lot of things in your

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.980 
application to a lot of things in your
life<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.100> there's<00:02:20.640> probably<00:02:20.940> no<00:02:21.150> place<00:02:21.720> in

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
life but there's probably no place in

life but there's probably no place in
the<00:02:22.080> world<00:02:22.260> where<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:24.000> activities<00:02:24.690> mistaken

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
the world where that activities mistaken

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.199 
the world where that activities mistaken
for<00:02:25.290> achievement<00:02:25.709> greater<00:02:25.920> or<00:02:26.220> more<00:02:26.280> so<00:02:26.880> than

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
for achievement greater or more so than

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.530 
for achievement greater or more so than

on<00:02:44.280> there<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.700> push<00:02:45.540> it<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.900> it<00:02:46.800> will<00:02:46.950> roll

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
on there and push it and it will roll

on there and push it and it will roll
now<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.330> just<00:02:48.780> move<00:02:49.080> 500<00:02:49.410> pounds<00:02:50.270> but<00:02:51.270> did<00:02:51.420> you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
now you just move 500 pounds but did you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.900 
now you just move 500 pounds but did you
do<00:02:51.600> anything<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.110> change<00:02:52.320> your<00:02:52.560> body<00:02:52.709> no<00:02:53.580> yet

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
do anything to change your body no yet

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.160 
do anything to change your body no yet
you<00:02:54.030> didn't<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> tension<00:02:54.810> level<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:55.080> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
you didn't the tension level on the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.259 
you didn't the tension level on the
muscle<00:02:55.440> wasn't<00:02:55.680> high<00:02:55.830> wasn't<00:02:56.250> sustained<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
muscle wasn't high wasn't sustained the

muscle wasn't high wasn't sustained the
weight<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.660> moved<00:02:58.370> there's<00:02:59.370> two<00:02:59.610> big

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
weight just moved there's two big

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.949 
weight just moved there's two big
problems<00:03:00.120> with<00:03:00.690> using<00:03:01.190> leverage<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:03.450> lift<00:03:03.780> the

problems with using leverage to lift the

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.330 
problems with using leverage to lift the
weight<00:03:04.140> or<00:03:04.350> as<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.470> say<00:03:04.680> shift<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.160> weight<00:03:05.280> into

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
weight or as I say shift the weight into

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.910 
weight or as I say shift the weight into
position
