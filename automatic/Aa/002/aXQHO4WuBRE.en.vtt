00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 the shaolin monks teach us not only 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.710
 what is energy but also what it is 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.469
 energy sources 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.759
 there are many sources of energy 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.630
 in the universe but those that there 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.550
 they are called human energy 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 this energy present in everything 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.710
 the universe is called in Chinese qi which 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.670
 literally it means energy in the sense 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.369
 on the other hand there is a c of the sky which 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.309
 corresponds to all the influences i 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.559
 cosmic influences that can suffer 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.790
 human beings both positive and in 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.350
 negative 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.140
 for example atmospheric conditions 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.730
 or the planetary influences i 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.579
 lunar influences 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.850
 all these influences coming from 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.910
 meteorology or the energies of others 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.760
 planets can disturb or facilitate 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.100
 man's life 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.530
 there is another energy that has to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.450
 dealing with the earth 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 these are the influences that come from 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.890
 c of the earth the c of the earth is 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.590
 called di we can identify 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.220
 this especially with energy that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.689
 it comes from food as we have said before 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.850
 if we eat a kind of food rather 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.439
 that another we get a different one 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.860
 quality of energy 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.659
 therefore it is very important to choose a 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.840
 earth energy that comes to us 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.340
 through nutrition that is useful 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 suitable for maintaining our body 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.220
 also the geo- pati influences c 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.110
 the various types of magnetic energy 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.049
 present in the earth can disturb 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.530
 or facilitate human life the strength of 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.259
 severity 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.840
 all these energies that come from 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.850
 earth must be harmonized with 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.790
 what is the ultimate source of energy 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.780
 which is the human energy that is called 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.200
 genchi man's energy is 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.879
 an energy that is a mixture of energies 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.860
 that man gets from his parents to 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.100
 moment of conception and energies 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.310
 which will take from 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.410
 feeding and breathing 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.180
 together these three types of energy 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.030
 c of heaven c of the earth c 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.330
 of man are the sources of ours 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.330
 power
