so far but yeah again I just run out
around<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> outside<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> map<00:01:17.790> now<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
around the outside the map now the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.880 
around the outside the map now the
spawns<00:01:18.360> flip<00:01:18.810> constantly<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.830> black<00:01:20.400> ops<00:01:20.640> so

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890

steady aim pro if you use steady aim pro
while<00:03:31.389> knifing<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:32.260> actually<00:03:32.560> retracts<00:03:32.709> the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
while knifing it actually retracts the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.610 
while knifing it actually retracts the
knife<00:03:33.430> from<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.329> enemy<00:03:34.630> faster<00:03:35.170> so<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.410> can

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
knife from the enemy faster so you can

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.129 
knife from the enemy faster so you can
actually<00:03:35.739> knife<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.760> know<00:03:36.880> quickly<00:03:37.329> which<00:03:38.109> is

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
actually knife you know quickly which is

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.349 
actually knife you know quickly which is
which<00:03:38.799> is<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.980> point<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.609> so<00:03:39.819> I<00:03:39.850> highly

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
which is the point and so I highly

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.509 
which is the point and so I highly
recommend<00:03:40.510> that<00:03:40.840> that<00:03:41.019> set<00:03:41.230> up<00:03:41.370> if<00:03:42.370> you're

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
recommend that that set up if you're

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:43.890 
recommend that that set up if you're
going<00:03:42.609> to<00:03:42.670> go<00:03:42.819> for<00:03:43.060> knifing<00:03:43.569> homely<00:03:43.810> and

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
going to go for knifing homely and

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.349 
going to go for knifing homely and
obviously<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.380> ballistic<00:03:44.709> knife<00:03:44.819> is<00:03:45.819> well<00:03:46.090> it

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
obviously the ballistic knife is well it

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.900 
obviously the ballistic knife is well it
helps<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.889> mean<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.549> pretty<00:03:48.790> cool

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
helps and I mean it's pretty cool

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.490 
helps and I mean it's pretty cool
because<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.150> can<00:03:49.180> shoot<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.630> which<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:50.019> kind

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
because you can shoot it which is kind

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.819 
because you can shoot it which is kind
