00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.030 
size drill bit with me the time take
this<00:02:27.510> we're<00:02:28.510> gonna<00:02:28.600> put<00:02:28.690> some<00:02:28.870> glue<00:02:29.019> on<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.320> and

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
this we're gonna put some glue on it and

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.960 
this we're gonna put some glue on it and
you<00:02:30.220> put<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.519> in<00:02:30.580> like<00:02:30.610> this

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.520 

and<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.120> put<00:02:34.330> your<00:02:34.450> me<00:02:35.110> back<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.380> yellow

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
and you put your me back to yellow

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.020 
and you put your me back to yellow
eventually<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.310> but<00:02:37.350> anyway<00:02:39.030> from

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
eventually like that but anyway from

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.520 
eventually like that but anyway from
here<00:02:40.209> it's<00:02:40.360> obviously<00:02:40.780> really<00:02:40.959> simple<00:02:41.410> you

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
here it's obviously really simple you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.400 
here it's obviously really simple you
take<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.860> weatherstripping<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.230> get<00:02:44.380> a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
take the weatherstripping and you get a

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.699 
take the weatherstripping and you get a
piece<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:45.100> know<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.310> right<00:02:45.459> size<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.709> you

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
piece you know the right size and you

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.220 
piece you know the right size and you
wrap<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:47.980> around<00:02:48.190> here<00:02:48.700> close<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.989> bottom

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
wrap it around here close to the bottom

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.630 
wrap it around here close to the bottom
and<00:02:51.660> try<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.780> out<00:02:53.400> experiment<00:02:54.400> on<00:02:54.489> your<00:02:54.580> own

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
and try it out experiment on your own

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.360 
and try it out experiment on your own
until<00:02:55.569> it<00:02:55.780> fits<00:02:56.019> your<00:02:56.200> trumpet<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.830> had<00:02:57.069> to<00:02:57.160> cut

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
until it fits your trumpet I had to cut

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.100 
until it fits your trumpet I had to cut
the<00:02:57.519> weatherstripping<00:02:58.030> thin<00:02:58.420> as<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:58.900> can<00:02:58.989> see

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
the weatherstripping thin as you can see

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.509 
the weatherstripping thin as you can see
already<00:02:59.200> did<00:02:59.440> here<00:02:59.680> that's<00:03:00.190> why<00:03:00.310> it's<00:03:00.430> all

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
already did here that's why it's all

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.120 
already did here that's why it's all
jagged<00:03:00.790> because<00:03:01.090> I<00:03:01.180> cut<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:02.530> fit<00:03:02.769> and<00:03:03.010> you

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
jagged because I cut it to fit and you

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.240 
jagged because I cut it to fit and you
don't<00:03:03.670> really<00:03:03.760> need<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.060> be<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.329> thick<00:03:05.250> so

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
don't really need to be this thick so

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.039 
don't really need to be this thick so
you<00:03:06.280> just<00:03:06.489> end<00:03:06.670> up<00:03:06.850> basically<00:03:07.660> with<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.840> thin

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
you just end up basically with a thin

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.180 
you just end up basically with a thin
piece<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.230> web<00:03:08.410> with<00:03:08.530> weather<00:03:08.709> stripping<00:03:09.040> you

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
piece of web with weather stripping you

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.560 
piece of web with weather stripping you
wrap<00:03:09.400> all<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.640> way<00:03:09.700> around<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.150> it<00:03:10.269> should<00:03:10.480> be

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
wrap all the way around and it should be

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:33.630 
wrap all the way around and it should be
self-adhesive<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:12.160> that's<00:03:12.340> that

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:43.030 

no<00:03:34.640> comparison<00:03:41.290> that's<00:03:42.290> playing<00:03:42.560> softly

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
no comparison that's playing softly

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.280 
no comparison that's playing softly
without<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.370> mute<00:03:43.640> this<00:03:44.540> is<00:03:44.720> with<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> straight

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
without a mute this is with a straight

00:03:45.290 --> 00:04:08.200 
without a mute this is with a straight
mute<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:51.050> with<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.320> Renuzit<00:03:51.740> mute<00:04:07.210> it's

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:08.210 
mute and with a Renuzit mute it's

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.390 
mute and with a Renuzit mute it's
actually<00:04:08.660> almost<00:04:08.990> completely<00:04:09.470> silent<00:04:09.680> it's

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
actually almost completely silent it's

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.830 
actually almost completely silent it's
just<00:04:10.670> loud<00:04:10.820> enough<00:04:10.880> for<00:04:11.120> you<00:04:11.420> to<00:04:11.510> be<00:04:11.600> able<00:04:11.750> to

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
just loud enough for you to be able to

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.050 
just loud enough for you to be able to
hear<00:04:11.990> it
