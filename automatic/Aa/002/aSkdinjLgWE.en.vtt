00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
padding for a second this is very soft

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.930 
padding for a second this is very soft
padding<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.350> don't<00:02:38.500> know<00:02:38.560> what<00:02:38.770> it's<00:02:39.430> made<00:02:39.760> of

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.820 
padding I don't know what it's made of
but<00:02:40.120> it's<00:02:40.270> really<00:02:40.510> soft<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.410> whenever<00:02:41.710> I'm

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
but it's really soft so whenever I'm

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.050 
but it's really soft so whenever I'm
using<00:02:41.940> my<00:02:42.940> 7200<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:45.280> basically<00:02:45.760> it

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
using my 7200 this basically it

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.200 
using my 7200 this basically it
stretches<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.020> top<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.590> is<00:02:47.800> nylon<00:02:48.580> so

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
stretches the top of it is nylon so

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.050 
stretches the top of it is nylon so
instead<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:50.050> know<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:51.190> weight<00:02:51.400> going<00:02:51.850> all

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
instead of you know the weight going all

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.000 
instead of you know the weight going all
you<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.540> right<00:02:53.050> where<00:02:53.350> your<00:02:53.530> shoulder<00:02:53.890> is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010

right in the middle

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.150 
right in the middle
this<00:02:55.120> basically<00:02:55.570> stretches<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.770> makes<00:02:56.980> it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
this basically stretches and it makes it

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.640 
this basically stretches and it makes it
very<00:02:57.190> very<00:02:57.910> durable<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.540> comfortable<00:02:58.870> now

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650
