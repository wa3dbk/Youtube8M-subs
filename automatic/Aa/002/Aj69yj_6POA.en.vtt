00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.479
 who does not know what a scratch on the 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.090
 knee never learns to ride a bicycle 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.730
 today we will know some pelados that change 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.960
 the blocks by mountains and they know what is 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.960
 up to break the ribs 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.520
 christ king and indiana with a let's go to 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.500
 the house of sebastián serón that is going to 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.980
 count an extreme way of doing 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.980
 sport 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.200
 I have sebastián I have 20 years studied 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.040
 communication and practical journalism ni 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.040
 four years ago 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.260
 why did you think to practice because 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.220
 obliges blind coupling once there 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.960
 I fell I scratched that tantrum I am jose 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.150
 domingo jiménez the father of sebastián 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.520
 he replied wandering four years ago because 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.290
 I did not find very exciting for 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.050
 enrique walking you have to have state 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.940
 physical you have to pedal and every moment 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.590
 to the brink of a fall then 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.390
 have it in the budget is 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.090
 impressive the satisfaction with not 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.090
 it always comes when it makes progress 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.180
 and this decision is pure cross-country 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.190
 to go one generally pedaling 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.720
 start like this in the down a bicycle 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.400
 normal how much can it cost in those 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.370
 visits but it did not work out like 4 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.120
 million there are bicycles of 22 of 30 of 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.860
 15 are carbon in aluminum m 5 m 4 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.280
 I'm depending on the brand model 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.490
 one more 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.490
 wrong 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.400
 asked if certain 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.490
 I'm not really very competitive in 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.490
 I do this because I like it very much 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.210
 looks strange 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.330
 i 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.459
 what do you like most about practicing 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:04.280
 one each day learning better by teaching 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.280
 the mounted bicycle patch 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.970
 that does not help much the routine I'm 12 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.530
 holes or something in my case at six and 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.420
 mean in the morning equal to 8 7 at 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.430
 night every day like I do this 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.350
 a weekend is like relaxing 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.380
 it does not make up for the whole week with me 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.690
 runner I like to manufacture the flights me 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.350
 like to do several of the things that 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.610
 come here the best of practice dawn 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.590
 chopped that is totally every 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.230
 descent is modified in downhill is a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.880
 progressive sports are enlarging the 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.690
 flights is good was a little shorter 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.240
 already enlarged 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.650
 for a lime glass and now you think 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.190
 do for other careers then 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.190
 I was progressing 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.420
 and evaluation as the worst fall 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:45.290
 between very fast I landed in this spot 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.970
 that brake that has twisted and not a stone 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.370
 he received me and went ahead over 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.140
 any sport this is very difficult 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.540
 you have to have a lot of concentration in that 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.139
 it's priceless and it sure can not and 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.509
 as for the blows bones 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.219
 normal, well, this is a sport 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.490
 extreme for many is reason for 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:04.330
 adrenaline risk and get away a little bit 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.919
 Of the routine 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.919
 this was real time really
