00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello everyone new video today and this one 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.259
 time it is a nail art video 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.809
 then a video in which I will show you believe 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.030
 the art I've made lately is a 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.070
 bit that I don't do it or anyway of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.139
 supplier I insert in the I prepare with 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.779
 you maybe but these things seemed 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.210
 very nice and so I wanted to bring them together 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.080
 in a single video and show it to you all 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.720
 together 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 also because I really am 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 very simple if I can do that 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.840
 I'm a chronic sling can 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.880
 but anyone can succeed at the same time 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.250
 very much in effect in the sense that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.710
 when I had them I received a lot of 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.590
 compliments so surely they are 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.180
 cute fast so they combine things 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.899
 which I prefer so let's go to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.899
 see what I've done 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.520
 to make the first proposal for a nail 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.920
 art I'm going to take this polish 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.720
 verdino which is very beautiful is a green 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.390
 blue who does it came out with the new one 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.610
 essence collection and putting two 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.510
 spend plenty of time on your nails because 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.800
 with just one pass, enough remains 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.570
 transparent is not the color you see 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.760
 in the little bottle and after giving two 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.400
 look like the nail polish is fine 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.710
 dry and go get this set of 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.990
 essence va nail art decorations 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.940
 to use the small white bow e 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.000
 I apply it by first putting the glue in 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.960
 endowment and then simply 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 placing it and making a light one 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.520
 pressure only on the lunar 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.079
 and the final result to this here 

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:36.079
 second but it's super cute 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.050
 for the second nail art I go to 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.570
 use this polish and done 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.150
 dark foundation and a colored glaze 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.660
 kiko strawberry red this one quid 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.150
 rai 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.830
 I tend the nail polish alone 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.830
 on the ring finger and thumb 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.130
 while on the other nails I go to 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.650
 spread the quick-drying enamel 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.880
 of kiko so while being this 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.950
 the other dries I leave time 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.990
 both glazes to dry and then 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.690
 I'm always going to get this set of 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.150
 essence of the new collection and with the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.220
 I am going to apply on the ring finger i 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.260
 glasses then these glasses a lot 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.420
 funny orange then I put some 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.460
 also glue on the thumb and glue 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.459
 obviously supplied and in this case 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.560
 I'm going to attack vat make you black so 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.360
 such that they adhere as much as I like 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.790
 a lot of this nail art and a lot 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.500
 witty and if you put your fingers together 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.500
 they look like glasses with a mustache 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.450
 this is really a nail art 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.680
 very easy to use a fuchsia enamel 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.870
 and this top for ds as first thing I go 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.580
 to spread the fuchsia glaze on all the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.530
 nails this here is really a discovery 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.750
 it is very comfortable to spend and once 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.910
 cross stretched the nail polish on all fingers 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.580
 except the ring finger on the ring finger I go to 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.290
 Use this glaze the essence that 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.600
 is what I showed you in the video 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.640
 a new collection is needed 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.590
 couple of passes for the effect to be 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.660
 load like the color you see in the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.240
 little bottle though really is 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.440
 three-dimensional and these glitter yes 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.440
 they see a lot 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.409
 these were the 3 nail art I decided on 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.569

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.430
 and easy to make but suitable for 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.799
