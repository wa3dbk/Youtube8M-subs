pick up the edge of the blue that was
there<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.890> just<00:01:25.130> carry<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.760> down<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.090> little

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
there and just carry it down a little

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.920 
there and just carry it down a little
bit<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:26.900> you<00:01:26.960> get<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.260> feeling<00:01:27.500> of<00:01:27.860> distance

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
bit and you get the feeling of distance

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.399 
bit and you get the feeling of distance
also<00:01:29.930> if<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.049> tilt<00:01:30.439> your<00:01:30.590> paper<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:32.600> get<00:01:32.869> runs

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
also if you tilt your paper you get runs

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.890 
also if you tilt your paper you get runs
and<00:01:34.100> then<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.400> can<00:01:34.549> just<00:01:34.670> dry<00:01:35.030> your<00:01:35.270> brush<00:01:35.570> and

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
and then you can just dry your brush and

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.109 
and then you can just dry your brush and
pick<00:01:36.470> up<00:01:36.619> any<00:01:36.830> little<00:01:36.979> drips<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.790> happen

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
pick up any little drips that happen

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.390 
pick up any little drips that happen
like<00:01:38.299> that<00:01:38.350> but<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.470> idea<00:01:39.799> is<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:40.130> get<00:01:40.220> the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
like that but the idea is to get the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.280 
like that but the idea is to get the
pinch<00:01:40.640> from<00:01:40.820> going<00:01:41.060> very<00:01:41.240> dark<00:01:41.600> into<00:01:42.020> very

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
pinch from going very dark into very

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.760 
pinch from going very dark into very
very<00:01:42.590> light<00:01:42.799> which<00:01:43.430> it<00:01:43.580> is<00:01:43.729> on<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.270> horizon

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
very light which it is on the horizon

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.350 
very light which it is on the horizon
the<00:01:45.770> other<00:01:45.920> kind<00:01:46.220> of<00:01:46.310> wash<00:01:46.549> that<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:46.970> can<00:01:47.150> do

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
the other kind of wash that you can do

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.670 
the other kind of wash that you can do
is<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:48.640> three-color<00:01:49.640> wash<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:51.020> secret<00:01:51.500> to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
is a three-color wash and the secret to

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.580 
is a three-color wash and the secret to
doing<00:01:51.860> that<00:01:52.189> is<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:53.659> use<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.869> little<00:01:54.350> bit<00:01:54.470> of

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
doing that is to use a little bit of

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.639 
doing that is to use a little bit of
water<00:01:54.770> in<00:01:55.340> between<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:56.210> colors<00:01:56.600> so<00:01:57.409> for

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
water in between the colors so for

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.690 
water in between the colors so for
example<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:58.520> could<00:01:59.270> do<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.479> sunset<00:02:00.350> or<00:02:00.380> sunrise

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
example I could do a sunset or sunrise

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.480 
example I could do a sunset or sunrise
by<00:02:01.700> first<00:02:02.030> putting<00:02:02.270> my<00:02:02.509> blue<00:02:02.780> dawn<00:02:03.490> rinsing

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
by first putting my blue dawn rinsing

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.789 
by first putting my blue dawn rinsing
the<00:02:04.610> brush<00:02:04.850> putting<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.930> little<00:02:06.110> row<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.530> water

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
the brush putting a little row of water

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.940 
the brush putting a little row of water

to the red and then take the red down to
the<00:02:29.400> bottom<00:02:29.550> like<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.239> and<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:31.590> where<00:02:31.890> you

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
the bottom like that and that where you

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.030 
the bottom like that and that where you

keep your colors completely clean and as

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.479 
keep your colors completely clean and as
it<00:02:35.220> dries<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.930> colors<00:02:37.260> will<00:02:37.440> blend<00:02:37.680> slightly

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
it dries the colors will blend slightly

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.220 
it dries the colors will blend slightly
into<00:02:38.730> each<00:02:38.850> other<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:39.480> it's<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.020> very

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
into each other but it's a very

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.650 
into each other but it's a very
beautiful<00:02:40.440> way<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:40.920> doing<00:02:41.370> something<00:02:41.730> that's

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
beautiful way of doing something that's

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.130 
beautiful way of doing something that's
ready<00:02:42.989> for<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:44.459> painting<00:02:45.239> to<00:02:45.270> go<00:02:45.510> on<00:02:45.630> top<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:45.930> it

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
ready for a painting to go on top of it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.199 
ready for a painting to go on top of it
so<00:02:46.290> here's<00:02:46.620> what<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.830> did<00:02:47.070> earlier<00:02:47.459> which<00:02:48.180> is

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
so here's what I did earlier which is

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.810 
so here's what I did earlier which is
dry<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.350> can<00:02:49.530> see<00:02:49.709> I've<00:02:49.830> done<00:02:50.040> pink<00:02:50.459> and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
dry and you can see I've done pink and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.300 
dry and you can see I've done pink and
then<00:02:51.690> added<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.230> little<00:02:52.380> water<00:02:52.680> around<00:02:53.070> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
then added a little water around the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.280 
then added a little water around the
edge<00:02:53.489> dropped<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.180> yellow<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.630> added<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.200> bit

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
edge dropped the yellow in added a bit

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.199 
edge dropped the yellow in added a bit
of<00:02:55.380> water<00:02:55.620> on<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.010> edge<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.580> taken<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.030> into

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
of water on the edge and taken it into

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.449 
of water on the edge and taken it into
blue<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:58.170> you're<00:02:58.319> not<00:02:58.440> getting<00:02:58.830> greens<00:02:59.160> or

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
blue but you're not getting greens or

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.000 
blue but you're not getting greens or
purples<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.390> what<00:03:00.930> I'll<00:03:01.110> do<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.440> top<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.860> that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
purples and what I'll do on top of that

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.460 
purples and what I'll do on top of that
is<00:03:02.250> probably<00:03:03.180> put<00:03:03.540> something<00:03:03.989> like<00:03:04.019> some

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
is probably put something like some

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.770 
is probably put something like some
boats<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.790> will<00:03:05.910> be<00:03:06.030> boats<00:03:06.300> in<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
boats and it will be boats in the

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.250 
boats and it will be boats in the
sunrise<00:03:07.319> or<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.890> sunset<00:03:08.160> on<00:03:08.819> top<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.900> a

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
sunrise or in the sunset on top of a

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.070 
sunrise or in the sunset on top of a
three-color<00:03:11.250> wash<00:03:11.519> so<00:03:12.510> it's<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.690> great<00:03:12.780> way<00:03:13.050> of

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
three-color wash so it's a great way of

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.220 
three-color wash so it's a great way of
painting<00:03:13.380> with<00:03:13.709> watercolor
