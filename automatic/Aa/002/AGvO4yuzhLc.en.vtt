which are now unified I think because

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:39.000 
which are now unified I think because
the<00:04:37.090> thing<00:04:37.360> is<00:04:37.390> that<00:04:38.050> we<00:04:38.289> have<00:04:38.530> still<00:04:38.800> good

restless<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.849> don't<00:04:40.599> know<00:04:40.750> why<00:04:40.960> they<00:04:41.169> want<00:04:41.349> to

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680

fired the bells quickly quickly so my

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.740 
fired the bells quickly quickly so my
opinion<00:04:44.169> is<00:04:44.440> I'm<00:04:44.620> against<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:45.729> unifying<00:04:46.419> but

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
opinion is I'm against this unifying but

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.610 
opinion is I'm against this unifying but
