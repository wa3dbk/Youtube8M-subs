starts off at 32 K and it goes all the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.410 
starts off at 32 K and it goes all the
way<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.630> 75<00:01:11.260> K<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.940> next<00:01:12.940> we<00:01:13.030> have<00:01:13.120> the<00:01:13.210> shutter

way to 75 K and next we have the shutter

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.840 
way to 75 K and next we have the shutter
angle<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:13.960> it's<00:01:14.170> measured<00:01:14.470> in<00:01:14.590> degrees<00:01:14.680> so<00:01:15.430> 45

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
angle and it's measured in degrees so 45

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.999 
angle and it's measured in degrees so 45
degrees<00:01:16.240> means<00:01:16.509> it's<00:01:16.750> very<00:01:17.079> closed<00:01:17.530> down<00:01:17.770> and

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
degrees means it's very closed down and

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.730 
degrees means it's very closed down and
360<00:01:18.729> degrees<00:01:19.090> means<00:01:19.600> it's<00:01:19.840> wide<00:01:20.170> open<00:01:20.619> and

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740

personally<00:01:51.490> I<00:01:51.789> prefer<00:01:51.939> film<00:01:52.750> because<00:01:53.140> it

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
personally I prefer film because it

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.770 
personally I prefer film because it
gives<00:01:53.409> me<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.590> best<00:01:53.829> quality<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.670> I<00:01:55.149> can<00:01:55.479> just

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
gives me the best quality and I can just

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.200 
gives me the best quality and I can just
do<00:01:56.109> a<00:01:56.140> lot<00:01:56.409> with<00:01:56.679> it<00:01:56.859> then<00:01:57.460> below<00:01:57.850> you've<00:01:58.030> got

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
do a lot with it then below you've got

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.969 
do a lot with it then below you've got
the<00:01:58.359> frame<00:01:58.630> rates<00:01:58.899> you<00:01:59.079> can<00:01:59.109> go<00:01:59.350> anywhere

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
the frame rates you can go anywhere

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.709 
the frame rates you can go anywhere
between<00:02:00.189> 24<00:02:01.179> 25<00:02:02.049> or<00:02:02.530> 29<00:02:03.520> or<00:02:03.850> 30<00:02:03.880> frames<00:02:04.659> per

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
between 24 25 or 29 or 30 frames per

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.810 
between 24 25 or 29 or 30 frames per
second<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.320> then<00:02:05.770> below<00:02:06.009> that<00:02:06.039> you<00:02:06.249> have<00:02:06.609> the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
second and then below that you have the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.639 
second and then below that you have the
time<00:02:07.149> lapse<00:02:07.390> interval<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:08.050> that's<00:02:08.380> really

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
time lapse interval and that's really

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.990 
time lapse interval and that's really
cool<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.250> can<00:02:09.369> tape<00:02:09.520> time-lapse

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
cool so you can tape time-lapse

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.730 
cool so you can tape time-lapse
photography<00:02:10.179> which<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.200> great<00:02:11.410> because<00:02:11.680> you

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
photography which is great because you

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.070 
photography which is great because you
can<00:02:11.950> go<00:02:12.100> all<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.340> way<00:02:12.490> from<00:02:12.640> taking<00:02:13.330> one<00:02:13.720> frame

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
can go all the way from taking one frame

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.290 
can go all the way from taking one frame
every<00:02:14.110> two<00:02:14.560> frames<00:02:14.950> all<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.790> way<00:02:15.910> up<00:02:16.090> to

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
every two frames all the way up to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.270 
every two frames all the way up to
taking<00:02:16.690> one<00:02:16.900> frame<00:02:17.200> every<00:02:17.230> 10<00:02:17.710> minutes<00:02:17.980> and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
taking one frame every 10 minutes and

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.580 
taking one frame every 10 minutes and
then<00:02:18.610> there's<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.910> lot<00:02:19.180> in<00:02:19.480> between<00:02:19.510> next<00:02:20.470> we

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
then there's a lot in between next we

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.110 
then there's a lot in between next we
have<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.830> display<00:02:21.190> settings<00:02:21.460> so<00:02:21.790> here<00:02:22.000> you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
have the display settings so here you

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.490 
have the display settings so here you
can<00:02:22.270> choose<00:02:22.510> how<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.900> view<00:02:23.110> your<00:02:23.380> dynamic

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
can choose how to view your dynamic

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.870 
can choose how to view your dynamic
so<00:02:24.860> for<00:02:25.010> example<00:02:25.069> even<00:02:25.460> though<00:02:25.700> you're

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
so for example even though you're

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.150 
so for example even though you're
shooting<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.510> film<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.290> can<00:02:27.470> still<00:02:27.680> choose<00:02:27.980> to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
shooting in film you can still choose to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.400 
shooting in film you can still choose to
view<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.550> in<00:02:28.670> video<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.569> prefer<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.170> still

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
view it in video now I prefer to still

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.650 
view it in video now I prefer to still
view<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:30.980> film<00:02:31.340> because<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:32.150> want<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.390> see

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
view it in film because I want to see

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.059 
view it in film because I want to see
what<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:32.990> final<00:02:33.170> product<00:02:33.709> will<00:02:33.770> look<00:02:34.010> like

what the final product will look like

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.040 
what the final product will look like
but<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.120> do<00:02:35.209> whatever<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.600> want<00:02:35.810> then

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
buttons so you've got the focus button

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.930 
buttons so you've got the focus button
and<00:02:51.050> if<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.260> press<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.530> once<00:02:51.920> it's<00:02:52.700> going<00:02:52.880> to

pressing the button twice you're going

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.690 
pressing the button twice you're going
to<00:02:56.750> activate<00:02:57.050> focus<00:02:57.440> peaking<00:02:57.709> now<00:02:58.489> if<00:02:58.610> you

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
to activate focus peaking now if you

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.970 
to activate focus peaking now if you
press<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.120> iris<00:02:59.510> button<00:02:59.870> once<00:03:00.110> it's<00:03:00.770> going<00:03:00.920> to

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.350 
press the iris button once it's going to
adjust<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.310> aperture<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:02.090> can<00:03:02.239> also

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
adjust the aperture and you can also

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.240 
adjust the aperture and you can also
adjust<00:03:02.600> it<00:03:02.930> manually<00:03:03.290> by<00:03:03.590> using<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:03.980> up<00:03:04.100> and

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
adjust it manually by using the up and

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.650 
adjust it manually by using the up and
down<00:03:04.340> errors

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.570 

so<00:03:08.320> let's<00:03:08.470> talk<00:03:08.590> about<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.920> shutter<00:03:09.160> speeds

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
so let's talk about the shutter speeds

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.250 
so let's talk about the shutter speeds
now<00:03:09.760> like<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.060> said<00:03:10.120> before<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.810> shutter<00:03:11.020> speed

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
now like I said before the shutter speed

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.890 
now like I said before the shutter speed
is<00:03:11.410> measured<00:03:11.710> between<00:03:12.190> 45<00:03:13.030> all<00:03:13.300> the<00:03:13.420> way<00:03:13.540> up<00:03:13.660> to

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
is measured between 45 all the way up to

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.400 
is measured between 45 all the way up to
360<00:03:14.860> degrees<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.490> obviously<00:03:15.820> 360<00:03:16.630> will<00:03:17.080> open

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
360 degrees so obviously 360 will open

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.440 
360 degrees so obviously 360 will open
up<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.740> lens<00:03:17.890> completely<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.700> then<00:03:18.790> 45<00:03:19.240> will

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
up the lens completely and then 45 will

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.720 
up the lens completely and then 45 will
close<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.930> down<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.380> here<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:20.980> can<00:03:21.130> see<00:03:21.400> what

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
close it down and here you can see what

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.580 
close it down and here you can see what
that<00:03:21.850> looks<00:03:22.120> like<00:03:22.210> and<00:03:22.600> how<00:03:23.050> smooth<00:03:23.380> the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
that looks like and how smooth the

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.890 
that looks like and how smooth the
motion<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.070> at<00:03:24.190> 360<00:03:24.880> versus<00:03:25.510> what<00:03:25.660> it's<00:03:25.780> like

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
motion is at 360 versus what it's like

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.080 
motion is at 360 versus what it's like
at<00:03:26.050> 45<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:27.370> here's<00:03:27.550> some<00:03:27.700> low-light

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
at 45 so here's some low-light

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.830 
at 45 so here's some low-light
performance

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
performance

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.990 
performance
the<00:03:29.740> shot<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:29.950> done<00:03:30.160> with<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.430> camera<00:03:30.790> so<00:03:30.970> I

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
the shot is done with the camera so I

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.250 
the shot is done with the camera so I
just<00:03:31.270> turned<00:03:31.450> off<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.570> lights<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.960> can<00:03:32.110> see

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
just turned off the lights you can see

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.680 
just turned off the lights you can see
all<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.530> settings<00:03:32.710> down<00:03:33.040> there<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.510> as<00:03:34.510> you

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
all the settings down there and as you

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.640 
all the settings down there and as you
see<00:03:34.930> zooming<00:03:35.500> in<00:03:35.650> it's<00:03:36.430> not<00:03:36.550> bad<00:03:37.320> now<00:03:38.320> this<00:03:38.500> is

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
see zooming in it's not bad now this is

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.340 
see zooming in it's not bad now this is
my<00:03:38.800> Canon<00:03:39.160> t3i<00:03:39.340> same<00:03:40.120> settings<00:03:40.600> I<00:03:40.840> shot<00:03:41.230> this

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
my Canon t3i same settings I shot this

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.800 
my Canon t3i same settings I shot this
at<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.620> same<00:03:41.800> time<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.460> when<00:03:43.270> you<00:03:43.360> zoom<00:03:43.600> in

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
at the same time and when you zoom in

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.080 
at the same time and when you zoom in
you<00:03:43.930> can<00:03:44.170> start<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.620> see<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.100> it's<00:03:45.310> slightly

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
you can start to see that it's slightly

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.449 
you can start to see that it's slightly
falling<00:03:46.600> apart

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
falling apart

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.920 
falling apart
here's<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.239> side-by-side<00:03:49.840> comparison<00:03:50.349> and

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
here's a side-by-side comparison and

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.990 
here's a side-by-side comparison and
here<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.049> can<00:03:53.200> see<00:03:53.409> that<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.859> Canon<00:03:54.519> t3i

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
here you can see that the Canon t3i

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.750 
here you can see that the Canon t3i
it<00:03:55.239> is<00:03:55.659> slightly<00:03:55.989> falling<00:03:56.379> apart<00:03:56.739> versus<00:03:57.340> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
it is slightly falling apart versus the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.300 
it is slightly falling apart versus the
Blackmagic<00:03:58.510> which<00:03:58.689> is<00:03:58.840> still<00:03:59.140> not<00:03:59.500> bad<00:04:00.040> and

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
Blackmagic which is still not bad and

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.309 
Blackmagic which is still not bad and
this<00:04:00.700> was<00:04:00.879> shot<00:04:01.060> at<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.269> same<00:04:01.540> time<00:04:01.840> same

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
this was shot at the same time same

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.410 
this was shot at the same time same
lighting<00:04:02.530> conditions<00:04:03.099> same<00:04:03.700> everything<00:04:04.000> now

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
lighting conditions same everything now

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.839 
lighting conditions same everything now
the<00:04:04.480> focus<00:04:04.930> peaking<00:04:05.170> is<00:04:05.469> great<00:04:06.189> this<00:04:06.579> is

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
the focus peaking is great this is

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.339 
the focus peaking is great this is
something<00:04:07.299> that's<00:04:07.480> just<00:04:07.569> beautiful

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
something that's just beautiful

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.520 
something that's just beautiful
whatever<00:04:09.099> is<00:04:09.340> green<00:04:09.670> is<00:04:09.909> in<00:04:10.420> focus<00:04:10.599> it's<00:04:11.230> that

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
whatever is green is in focus it's that

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.860 
whatever is green is in focus it's that
simple<00:04:11.829> and<00:04:12.040> this<00:04:12.400> works<00:04:12.790> very<00:04:13.150> well<00:04:13.299> even

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
simple and this works very well even

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.039 
simple and this works very well even
outside<00:04:14.260> when<00:04:14.469> it's<00:04:14.620> very<00:04:14.769> bright<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.840> let's

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
outside when it's very bright so let's

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.749 
outside when it's very bright so let's
take<00:04:17.199> a<00:04:17.229> look<00:04:17.440> at<00:04:17.530> some<00:04:17.680> images<00:04:17.859> now<00:04:18.519> here's

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:18.759 
take a look at some images now here's

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.939 
take a look at some images now here's
some<00:04:19.209> RAW<00:04:19.449> images<00:04:19.660> which<00:04:20.169> look<00:04:20.530> just

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
some RAW images which look just

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.520 
some RAW images which look just
beautiful<00:04:21.340> this<00:04:22.180> is<00:04:22.240> obviously<00:04:22.690> color<00:04:23.020> graded

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
beautiful this is obviously color graded

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.430 
beautiful this is obviously color graded
and<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:24.520> just<00:04:24.940> looks<00:04:25.120> beautiful<00:04:25.539> I<00:04:25.690> had<00:04:26.320> to

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
and it just looks beautiful I had to

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.379 
and it just looks beautiful I had to
stabilize<00:04:26.830> it<00:04:26.949> in<00:04:27.070> post<00:04:27.310> because<00:04:27.729> the<00:04:27.849> lens<00:04:28.090> is

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
stabilize it in post because the lens is

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.520 
stabilize it in post because the lens is
really<00:04:28.630> not<00:04:28.750> that<00:04:28.960> great<00:04:29.229> when<00:04:29.440> you're

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
really not that great when you're

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.170 
really not that great when you're
holding<00:04:29.889> it<00:04:30.009> and<00:04:30.430> I'll<00:04:30.550> talk<00:04:30.759> more<00:04:30.940> about<00:04:31.000> that

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
holding it and I'll talk more about that

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.540 
holding it and I'll talk more about that

also will give you some really really
big<00:04:39.099> files<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.820> one<00:04:40.120> minute<00:04:40.449> equals<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.990> about

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
big files so one minute equals to about

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.980 
big files so one minute equals to about
three<00:04:42.370> gigs<00:04:42.639> so<00:04:43.210> you<00:04:43.300> got<00:04:43.449> to<00:04:43.570> keep<00:04:43.660> that<00:04:43.840> in

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
three gigs so you got to keep that in

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.310 
three gigs so you got to keep that in
mind

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320

unlike<00:04:44.620> Pro<00:04:44.800> res<00:04:45.009> which<00:04:45.220> is<00:04:45.370> about<00:04:45.580> one<00:04:45.940> gig

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
but compared to h.264 it gives you a lot

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.170 
but compared to h.264 it gives you a lot
more<00:04:53.169> to<00:04:53.560> work<00:04:53.710> with<00:04:53.740> in<00:04:54.099> post<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:54.669> it<00:04:54.970> allows

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
more to work with in post and it allows

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.719 
more to work with in post and it allows
you<00:04:55.360> to<00:04:55.389> create<00:04:55.780> some<00:04:56.169> beautiful<00:04:57.070> footage<00:04:57.370> and

you to create some beautiful footage and

pulling<00:05:07.930> on<00:05:08.050> this<00:05:08.169> camera<00:05:08.440> it's<00:05:08.740> just<00:05:08.860> like

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
pulling on this camera it's just like

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.469 
pulling on this camera it's just like
other<00:05:09.099> cameras<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.610> mean<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:09.849> just<00:05:09.940> depends<00:05:10.389> on

the<00:05:10.599> lens<00:05:10.840> I<00:05:11.169> use<00:05:11.680> a<00:05:11.710> follow<00:05:12.099> focus<00:05:12.400> because<00:05:12.849> I

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
the lens I use a follow focus because I

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.089 
the lens I use a follow focus because I
hate<00:05:13.300> that<00:05:13.539> focus<00:05:13.990> ring<00:05:14.199> so<00:05:14.530> a<00:05:14.560> follow<00:05:14.860> focus

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
hate that focus ring so a follow focus

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.070 
hate that focus ring so a follow focus
is<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.430> must<00:05:15.729> for<00:05:15.849> me<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:16.720> might<00:05:16.930> feel

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080

different<00:05:17.530> about<00:05:17.949> that<00:05:18.009> so<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.729> just<00:05:18.940> depends

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
different about that so it just depends

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.589 
different about that so it just depends
