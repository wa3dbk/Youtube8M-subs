00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.610
 to analyze more this issue is with 

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.549
 we the international analyst the 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:09.160
 goddess yes from san juan in by theoretical 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.620
 greetings immersed you usa every day has 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.389
 less international support in their 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.969
 decision to attack Syria while 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.670
 they increase in tone those who are against 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.440
 Do you think that would further aggravate the 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.110
 consequences of a possible attack 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.850
 considered illegal by the community 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.930
 international and organizations 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.940
 international as the un 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.680
 I consider an American attack 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.050
 hide little support within the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.989
 international community for certainly 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.360
 would cause political isolation and 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:48.690
 diplomat of usa but in the sense 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.350
 of aggravating the conflict what could 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.460
 really aggravate the conflict is 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.860
 precisely that the United States and its 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.460
 allies intervene because in this case 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.920
 is Syria has for example a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.550
 powerful ally in russia who like you 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 has mentioned in the newsletter as the 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.649
 President Putin has already expressed that 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.910
 will continue to help Syria if it is 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:17.490
 attacked by external enemies and that 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.490
 has continued to continue to give armament 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.030
 and economic support is really the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.740
 greater danger and more I would say that the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.920
 fact that there are fewer countries than 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.310
 support usa the fact of confrontation 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.500
 that usa 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.450
 and confront continues to attack Syria 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.880
 there could be a greater 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.299
 confrontation I mean with russia and 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.299
 this is not only the USA that is 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.810
 Israeli example that has therefore ambitions 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.509
 territorial and wants to destroy Syria 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.179
 and he's doing it with collaboration 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.429
 of the us and the rebels supported by 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.860
 united states and Saudi Arabia by 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.549
 Turkey for Jordan and others 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.100
 so this let's say it would be the biggest 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:08.390
 danger to record the conflict the the 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.120
 clear armed action let's hope that by 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.330
 example within the usa when it 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.950
 vote in the us congress that at least 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.920
 in the representative chamber where 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.650
 it seems that there is a great opposition 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.540
 to obama's plan the proposal to a 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.060
 draft resolution that gives permission 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.760
 to obama to attack by the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.370
 Congress that fails there for a 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.580
 side is that the opposition with france 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.030
 continues to increase there is 65% of the people 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.160
 French I think 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.890
 to the policy of aggression of his government 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.530
 so let's hope that apart from that 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.240
 there is a greater number of voices at a 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.880
 international I mean countries to 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.400
 governments and also nations 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.830
 together that denounce the idea of a 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.410
 attack that within the countries where 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.080
 supposedly because there is support for a 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.150
 attack as was thought the United Kingdom 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.130
 that there was and already it was seen how it failed to 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.680
 be defeated the intervention proposal 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.720
 military in the British parliament as 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.900
 what happens like that in the american congress 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.180
 but that would not completely eliminate the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.370
 threat because president obama his 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.430
 regime are determined to intervene 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.620
 to favor the interests of israel and 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.200
 of Saudi Arabia and there are others clear that 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.480
 they are involved with vested interests ' 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.280
 which are the Turks that apparently have 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.620
 territorial aspirations on 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.130
 north of Syria so we'll see what 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.560
 it happens but it really is the threat is 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.630
 in the mere fact that she wants us 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.730
 attack and the consequences that that can 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.920
 haul to for example to see countries 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.480
 as russia they would intervene 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.550
 decisively to help 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.350
 Syrian ally 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.510
 if you do not ask a question very 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.150
 briefly 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.750
 you talked about a possible one 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.790
 confrontation between USA and Russia as 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.549
 one of the main allies said 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.460
 believes that this confrontation can go more 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:06.880
 there and end up in a war 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.940
 good is potentially the danger 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.520
 I would say that Russia would give its support of 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.320
 have a North American attack 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.460
 initially one way would be 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.280
 continuing to continue supplying 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.350
 non-sophisticated weapons anti-aircraft missiles 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.140
 anti-ship missile batteries also by 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.690
 example combat houses also crosses 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.910
 could provide troops operators 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.040
 for anti-aircraft batteries the 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.740
 aerial detection systems use the 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.720
 Russian aerial detection system by 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.300
 example the radar alerts plans 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.520
 armavir in the north north of the Caucasus 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.710
 between the black sea the change but for 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.500
 example usa has been experiencing 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.290
 with a modern weapon in your air force 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.280
 which is a kind of plane invisible to 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.530
 ultrasophisticated backhand unmanned something 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.320
 as well as the plane that they will go then achieved 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.770
 get off recognition but this one would be 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.480
 electronic attack and larger 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.840
 possibly the size of the b2 bomber 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.690
 strategic invisible to the radar 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.470
 this would be used the usa have designed it 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.180
 to blind the anti-aircraft defenses like 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.490
 the early warning radars of a 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.590
 enemy and there is the danger that is 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.720
 so determined the obama regime for 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.389
 intervene at the expense of any 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.729
 result to cost of any price 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.979
 I want to say what happens if they dare 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.530
 if they have that weapon it seems they already have 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.990
 a prototype at least one use it against 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.060
 closed for the potential to try 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.850
 mowing the air crossing defenses that 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.889
 would help Syria in terms of detecting 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.350
 attacks waves of cruise missiles and 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.000
 American planes of his allies this 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.560
 It would be an act of aggression because 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.990
 would also violate Russian airspace 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.060
 the idea would be to enter the space of the 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.950
 inclement but it was already seen with the plane 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.500
 invisible to the radar that was lowered 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.360
 about what will be detected 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.630
 that there is a potential danger of 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 confrontation and clear that the US decides 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.360
 then use allies like turkey 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.550
 Israel to invade Syria and as already 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.380
 has said obama does not want to send troops 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.680
 and of course Russia is forced to send 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.630
 troops 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.610
 symbolically as in a crisis 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.199
 of Kosovo when he sent a unit of 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.380
 paratroopers to airport 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:23.660
 capital of Kosovo from pristine and that 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.509
 sees in the end forced to intervene with more 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:29.750
 troops and there clear little by little go to 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:32.000
 see go see a combat escalation or 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.680
 that the Russian warships that are 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.570
 being sent to the eastern Mediterranean 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.850
 that there is a clash with the forces 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.530
 American naval and there is another 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.169
 climbing too and let's not forget to 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:44.210
 conclude that Israel allegedly used a 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:48.349
 tactical nuclear weapon a bomb 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:50.750
 possibly American the b61 11 of 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:53.229
 deep penetration on the ground against 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.130
 mountain almost a kevin to damask 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:57.139
 presumably to destroy the center 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.289
 of research by Jack Ryan 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.449
 Syrian government and that is already an escalation 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:04.699
 dramatic if it's true that it was used 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:07.039
 a tactical nuclear weapon that should 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:09.530
 investigate yourself and you can already 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:12.289
 say that crossed the atomic red line 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.330
 and this could also put in 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:17.510
 danger that there is a potentially 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:19.340
 a nuclear war between Russia and the USA or 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.560
 even between israel 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.070
 and that gets us to support Israel 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.720
 and we have the third world war 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:29.560
 well thank you so much Mr. tailor for 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.560
 your analysis
